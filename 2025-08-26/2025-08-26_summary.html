‘Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,' Trump tells education secretary in cabinet meeting

Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in federal funding to the Ivy League university.

“Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in a cabinet meeting.

Trump's comments came amid reports that his administration and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end to their months-long battle over the government's allegations that Harvard has not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

In April, Harvard became the first – and so far only – university to sue the Trump administration over the funding cuts. It sued again the following month over the government's efforts to block the school from enrolling international students.

The university has argued that the administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the university in retaliation for the school's refusal to comply with a series of demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force. Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions practices.

A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the Department of Justice last month.

The Department of Justice has argued that the federal government has the authority to cancel grants when institutions violate presidential directives, and have cited Trump's executive order purporting to combat antisemitism.

The New York Times and the Associated Press have both reported that Harvard and the White House had made substantial progress toward a deal. Under the proposed agreement, according to the Times, Harvard would pay $500m in exchange for the restoration of billions in frozen federal research funds. However, key terms reportedly remain unresolved, with negotiations still continuing.

The Harvard president, Alan Garber, has disputed the Times report, reportedly telling faculty that the article was inaccurate and alleged that the information had been leaked to the press by White House officials.

According to Harvard Crimson, the university's student newspaper, Garber said the university remains committed to resolving the matter through the courts and that academic freedom was nonnegotiable in any deal.

In July, it was also reported that Harvard agreed to comply with federal demands to turn over employment records for thousands of staff members.

Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have made unprecedented efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite universities over their handling of the pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, DEI programs and more.

Several other universities that have faced federal funding cuts – including Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have reached settlement agreements with the administration to restore research funding.

Columbia University agreed to pay more than $220m and implement a series of reforms to settle allegations that it was not doing enough to combat antisemitism. However, some education advocates decried that deal as a blow to academic freedom.

            The letter dated Monday from Smith's lawyers is the first time the former special counsel has responded to accusations leveled against his investigations into the president by conservative lawmakers and media outlets, including the current attorney general.
    


            Smith spearheaded the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump - one for allegedly mishandling classified documents and another for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were abandoned by Smith after Trump won reelection.
    


            “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper,” his attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski wrote.
    


The New York Times first reported the letter.
    


Trump's tortured history of legally targeting his foes



            The letter was addressed to Jamieson Greer, the head of the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent watchdog office that has no affiliation with the office Smith used to run. Trump appointed Greer to the role in an acting capacity after he fired the previous head of the office, who was appointed by President Joe Biden for a five-year term.
    


            Greer's office has launched an investigation into whether Smith improperly engaged in political activities through his prosecutions against Trump. The investigation was made public after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed that “Smith used his DOJ role to influence the election” in favor of Biden's and Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaigns.
    


            Smith's attorneys this week said that the investigation is “premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest.”
    


            “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,” it says.
    


            The Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.

            President Donald Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, DC, a move that could run into significant obstacles with city juries.
    


            “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital, capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty,” the president said during a meeting with Cabinet members Tuesday.
    


            The president did not immediately outline any specifics, but called capital punishment a “very strong preventative” measure. States, he said, “are going to have to make their own decision,” though in the nation's capital, prosecutors would seek the death penalty.
    


            “We have no choice,” he said.
    


            Traditionally, the DC Superior Court handles the bulk of murder cases in the city, and it would be bound by the city code that does not authorize capital punishment.
    


Pirro's office fails three times to win felony indictment of alleged attacker of FBI agent



            However, the US attorney's office in DC, which prosecutes crimes in both the local and federal court in the city – unlike any other jurisdiction in the country – could bring federal charges in many capital-eligible cases and seek the death penalty.
    


            “We will use all legal sanctions and sentences called for by law,” US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a press conference on Tuesday, when asked about her office seeking capital punishment in DC cases.
    


            Actually getting a death sentence, though, might not be so easy, as prosecutors would have to convince jurors to sign off. Historically, prosecutors have faced challenges in convincing special juries to impose capital punishment in DC, even if they vote unanimously to convict the defendants, multiple people in Washington's legal community have told CNN in recent weeks.
    


            “It's going to be difficult to find 12 people in DC who are going to do that,” said Jon Jeffress, a former federal public defender-turned-private defense lawyer in the city.
    


            The federal court in the District of Columbia hasn't held a death penalty trial since 2003, when Rodney L. Moore was convicted of 10 killings and Kevin L. Gray was convicted of 19 killings, according to multiple people familiar with the court and that case. In that case, the jurors said they couldn't agree unanimously on death sentences for the two men rather than life imprisonment, court records show.
    


            Asked about the unwillingness of juries in the past to approve the death penalty in DC cases, Pirro said: “We're going to follow the law, the deliberative process, present the evidence … whether DC is inclined to do it or not, it's not a political issue.”
    


            “This is an issue that's sanctioned by the law, and gives us the power to do that. If not us, then who?” she added.
    


            In recent months, the Justice Department has indicated in at least three cases in DC's federal court that it may seek the death penalty, according to court records.
    


            One of those cases is against Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of shooting two Israeli embassy staff members leaving a Jewish community event in May.
    


            The Department of Justice is also actively considering seeking the death penalty in DC District Court for two Mexican nationals who were charged in 2008 in a gang case and recently brought to the US, and for two young men who were indicted for a 2023 carjacking, according to court records.
    


            This comes at a time where the federal death row is down to three, after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of about three dozen federal inmates who had been sentenced to death. Trump has vowed since the first day of this administration to restore the use of capital punishment in the US, directing the attorney general to pursue the death penalty for crimes wherever possible.

Reporters demand apology from Tom Barrack, US special envoy to Syria, after his remarks at Beirut press conference 

Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”.

As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation's meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We're going to have a different set of rules ... please be quiet for a moment.

“The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we're gone,” he said.

“Act civilised, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what's happening in the region,” added Barrack, who has recently been leading talks with Lebanese officials.

The Lebanese presidency in a statement on X expressed regret at “remarks made inadvertently from its podium by one of its guests”, affirming its appreciation for the journalists and media representatives.

The information minister, Paul Morcos, in a statement also expressed regret at the remarks “by a member of the foreign delegation towards media representatives at the presidential palace”.

The photojournalists' syndicate called Barrack's comments “a direct insult” that set “a serious and totally unacceptable precedent”.

In a statement, it demanded “an immediate and public apology”, rejecting attempts to “downplay the seriousness of what happened or let it pass without accountability”.

The press editors' syndicate also called for “a public statement of apology” and floated a boycott of the envoy's future visits and meetings.

The union of journalists in Lebanon said Barrack's remarks were “a reflection of an unacceptable arrogance in dealing with the media” and also called for an official apology.

Ibrahim Musawi, a lawmaker from the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah and head of parliament's media committee, called the remarks “a blatant insult” and urged the government to “summon the US ambassador and reprimand her”.

Haboob swept through capital, rattling homes, terrifying drivers and leaving tens of thousands without power

A powerful storm kicked up a towering wall of dust that rolled through the city of Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday, darkening the sky, blinding drivers, knocking out power and damaging one of the nation's busiest airports.

The dust storm, known as a haboob, is pushed by the wind and produced by a weather front or thunderstorm. It typically occurs in flat, arid areas. The storm came from the south-east, and was followed by heavy rain, wind and lightning.

Bernae Boykin Hitesman was driving her son and daughter, ages nine and 11, home from school when the storm arrived late in the afternoon in Arizona City, about 60 miles (95km) south-east of Phoenix.

She had to quickly pull over as the storm engulfed her car. “I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,” she said.

Boykin Hitesman said she could taste the dust and feel the strong wind rattling her car until it finally passed about 15 minutes later.

“I was nervous,” she said. “My kids were really, really scared, so I was trying to be brave for them.”

Richard Filley, a retired university professor who lives in Gilbert, said the dust storm caused the trees to sway and knocked bird feeders to the ground. Fine dust found its way through “every little crack and space” into his house, he said.

“The windstorm part of it, I'm glad it's gone,” he said. “You look at the photos of haboobs and they are a spectacular natural phenomenon. They are kind of beautiful in their own way.”

Heavy rain and wind followed Monday's haboob, delaying flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor international airport and causing some damage to the airport.

“Crews have been identifying leaks and attempting to clean up water where it has collected in passenger areas,” Heather Shelbrack, the airport's deputy aviation director for public relations, said in an email.

Tens of thousands of customers in Maricopa county lost power.

Phoenix has been drier than usual during the monsoon season, while parts of south-east and north-central Arizona have had a fair amount of rain, said Mark O'Malley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.

“But that's typical for a monsoon, very hit and miss,” he said.

The forecast for metro Phoenix calls for a 40% chance of rain on Tuesday before drying out, O'Malley said.

The storm comes just days after the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert was hit by dust storms and high winds.

The annual gathering in the Black Rock desert officially started on Sunday, but attenders who had already set up camp on Saturday were confronted with a powerful dust storm that sent tents flying and plunged visibility to near zero.

Footage shared on social media by attenders showed intense winds, dust storms and collapsed tents.

The National Weather Service Reno warned on Tuesday that more storms could hit the region, and could persist late into the evening.

Israel said it would respond to the deal last week, but has yet to contact mediators, days past its own deadline.

Israel missed its own deadline to respond to a temporary ceasefire and captive release deal that Hamas accepted over a week ago, with Israeli authorities appearing “unwilling” to accept the framework despite Hamas saying that the agreement contains significant concessions in Israel's favor.

Qatari officials said on Tuesday that they have not heard from Israel about the framework, presented by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, even though Israel said that it was going to respond by Friday, August 22. 

Israel appears “unwilling to reach an agreement,” said Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari, per Al Jazeera.

“We are in contact with all parties in pursuit of a ceasefire agreement, but there is no official Israeli response — neither acceptance, rejection, nor the presentation of an alternative proposal,” al-Ansari said. “We do not take seriously the media statements in Israel and are awaiting an official response to the proposal.”

Hamas announced over a week ago that it has agreed to the latest proposal. The details of the framework haven't been released to the public, but reports have said that it involves a 60-day pause in attacks and an increase in humanitarian aid. Hamas would release roughly half of the remaining 50 Israeli captives in this time, while Israel would release some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners it's holding in captivity.

Qatari officials say the proposal is “almost identical” to one put forth by U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, in June. That proposal, in fact, reportedly involved the release of fewer Israeli captives than the current deal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, however, imposed a new condition on the framework last week, insisting that it involve the release of all Israeli captives — likely a nonstarter without a plan for a permanent ceasefire agreement, especially as Israel escalates its campaign to raze Gaza City and annex the Strip.

The introduction of a last-minute demand echoes a tactic taken by Israel numerous times amid the genocide, of insisting on a condition that Israeli officials know will be rejected out of hand right as negotiations are nearing completion. Former U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently effectively admitted that this is a known tactic of Netanyahu's to allow Israel to continue its genocide.

Israel's refusal to accept the agreement comes even though Hamas agreed to significant concessions in the latest proposal. 

Drop Site reported last week that Hamas agreed to provisions like allowing Israel to continue its occupation of Gaza's border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, which was previously a red line for Hamas. Another significant concession reportedly involved the removal of Hamas's demand that the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme be removed from the Strip amid the ceasefire.

The top negotiator for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed resistance group in Gaza that has participated in ceasefire negotiations, said that Palestinian negotiators are effectively daring Israel to finally accept a ceasefire deal.

“If the Israeli government now refuses to accept the mediators' proposal — which is fundamentally their own — it exposes the true nature of the Israeli position, shielded by the United States, regarding the entirety of the negotiation process: using it for stalling and gaining time to commit further crimes. There is no longer any room for concessions or futile negotiations,” the official, Mohammed Al-Hindi, told Drop Site.

Israelis have launched protests against Netanyahu's refusal to secure the release of the captives. By demanding that all of the captives be released and delaying an agreement, after all, he is ensuring that numerous Israelis remain in captivity in Gaza indefinitely — potentially facing injury, famine, or death at the hands of Israeli forces.

US President Donald Trump has attempted to portray his deployment of National Guard troops and other federal agents in Washington, DC as a boon for public safety.

Inside DC courtrooms, however, judges and defense attorneys have expressed alarm at the tactics being used by law enforcement officers to unfairly charge local residents with serious crimes that carry lengthy prison sentences.

NPR reports that US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui expressed incredulity on Monday while dismissing weapons charges against a Maryland resident named Torez Riley, who was subjected to what the judge described as “without a doubt the most illegal search I've ever seen in my life.”

While reviewing the case, the judge said that law enforcement officials seem to have targeted Riley for a search simply because he was a Black man carrying what appeared to be a heavy backpack.

“I'm absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened,” Faruqui said. “A high school student would know this was an illegal search.”

The Department of Justice had agreed to drop the charges after body camera footage of Riley's arrest showed officers searching him without probable cause, but Faruqui said that was cold comfort for a defendant who had already spent the last week behind bars.

“We don't just charge people criminally and then say, ‘Oops, my bad,'” the judge said. “I'm at a loss how the US Attorney's office thought this was an appropriate charge in any court, let alone the federal court.”

Faruqui also noted that judges in his court “on multiple occasions” in recent weeks had taken the highly unusual step of moving to suppress search warrants used against suspects, which makes them inadmissible to use in court.

NPR's report echoes an article in The New York Times earlier this week that detailed some of the difficulties the government is having in making some of its charges stick in the wake of Trump's DC crackdown.

In its report, the Times focused the arrest of 28-year-old Amazon delivery driver named Mark Bigelow, who was hit with federal felony charges for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officials who were attempting to detain him over a misdemeanor offense of possessing an open container of alcohol.

“As he was placed in a vehicle, the handcuffed Mr. Bigelow became belligerent, twisting his body and yelling, ‘Get off me! Y'all too little, bro!' at an ICE agent, according to a court filing, which described how Mr. Bigelow made ‘physical contact' by kicking an agent in the hand and another in the leg,” reported the Times. “As a result, Mr. Bigelow was charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer, an offense that carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.”

Federal public defender Elizabeth Mullin said in court last week that Bigelow would never have been charged with a federal felony were it not for the president's decision to send federal agents swarming the streets of the nation's capital.

“He was caught up in this federal occupation of DC,” she said. “This was a case created by federal law enforcement.”

The Times also reported on Monday that federal prosecutors had reduced charges against a woman named Sidney Lori Reid, who was accused of assaulting an FBI agent during a protest against Trump's immigration policies last month. The decision to refile Reid's case as a misdemeanor came after prosecutors failed on three separate occasions to convince a grand jury to charge her with felony offenses.

Attorneys Tezira Abe and Eugene Ohm, who have been representing Reid, said that the grand juries' refusal to indict their client on three separate occasions indicated fatal weaknesses in the government's case.

“The US attorney can try to concoct crimes to quiet the people, but in our criminal justice system, the citizens have the last word,” they said. “We are anxious to present the misdemeanor case to a jury and to quickly clear Ms. Reid's name.”

But the findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle.

Air pollution from oil and gas activities is responsible for an estimated 91,000 deaths and over 10,000 preterm births in the US each year, according to a new study that examined the impacts of the industry through its lifecycle from extraction to refining to burning fuel in power plants.

The study, published August 22 in the journal Science Advances, also attributes an estimated 216,000 annual incidences of US childhood asthma to air pollutants from fossil fuels, as well as over 1,600 lifetime cancers.

California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have the highest total health burden from all stages of oil and gas production and use, according to the study, with racial minorities facing disproportionate exposure to harmful air pollutants that include fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle, the authors said, given annual production increased by 40% from 2017 to 2023 and consumption increased by about 8%.

“Every day, new peer-reviewed evidence emerges demonstrating the level of harm the petrochemical industry causes,” Heather McTeer Toney, executive director of the nonprofit Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement. “Faced with this data, I can't imagine how a government official at any level could support building more petrochemical plants.”

Previous studies have focused on air pollution from a single stage of the oil and gas lifecycle, a single air pollutant, or a specific region, according to the study authors.

To measure the industry's national health impact, the researchers combined data from several sources, from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s National Emission Inventory. The new study is “a solid leap forward” in its effort to determine the industry's broader health impacts, said Johnathan Buonocore, an air pollution researcher at Boston University. “This paper shows there's impacts across that whole supply chain that we all should be paying attention to,” he said.

The findings come after the Trump administration launched what the US EPA in March called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history,” with a particular focus on easing regulations “throttling the oil and gas industry.”

Last month, the administration announced plans to rescind the government's “endangerment finding,” which forms the basis for enforcing limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The administration  issued a rule that extends by 18 months deadlines for fossil fuel operations to reduce their emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds.

The Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Biological Diversity and other nonprofits this week filed a motion asking a federal court to stop the move to delay these limits on pollution from oil and gas operations.

“Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for its pollution, the Trump administration is forcing people to breathe dangerous chemicals and suffer the harms of an overheating climate,” Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute, said in a statement.

Even as the federal government moves to roll back and delay air pollution protections, states still have the option to implement their own stricter regulations, including more stringent permitting requirements and pollution control rules, said Buonocore.

“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said. “States have the ability to set their own regulations that go above and beyond the federal floor.”

Buonocore and colleagues concluded in a 2023 study that oil and gas production is responsible for $77 billion in annual health costs – about three times the cost of climate impacts from the industry's methane emissions. The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.

Over half of US counties lack a single federally-monitored air quality station, with more than 50 million Americans living in “air quality monitoring deserts,” according to a study published in April.

            A federal judge on Tuesday threw out an aggressive, unusual lawsuit the Trump administration brought earlier this year against all 15 federal judges in Maryland, rejecting a bid by the Justice Department to limit court power in fast-moving immigration cases.
    


            The opinion on Tuesday framed the lawsuit as a major constitutional standoff, with Judge Thomas Cullen writing the Justice Department couldn't pursue a “constitutional free-for-all.”
    


            Cullen, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, also wrote a scathing rebuke of the Trump administration, saying it is intentionally trying to smear the justice system.
    


            “Over the past several months, principal officers of the Executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,' ‘liberal,' ‘activists,' ‘radical,' ‘politically minded,' ‘rogue,' ‘unhinged,' ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,' ‘[c]rooked,' and worse,” Cullen wrote.
    


            “Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he added.
    


            The ruling from Cullen, who was brought in from another district to handle the case in Maryland, said the government lacked the legal right — known as standing — to bring the challenge and that the judges are immune from such suits brought by the executive branch.
    


            “Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss. To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote in the 39-page decision.
    


Judge to require that Kilmar Abrego Garcia remain in the US while he challenges deportation to Uganda



            The Justice Department sued all federal judges on the lower-level District Court of Maryland in late June, after the court's chief judge put in place a rule that would automatically and temporarily block the Trump administration from removing an immigration detainee from the US if the detainee had gone to court to challenge their removal.
    


            That rule was on full display Monday in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador in mid-March and eventually returned to the US. The Trump administration has indicated it was to deport him immediately, but Abrego Garcia filed a new case in Maryland that triggered the protection from the court against immediate deportation.
    


            Tuesday, Cullen found he wouldn't have the authority the Trump administration wanted from him to immediately block the Maryland judges it sued, and that the executive branch doesn't have a reason within the law where it can sue the judges as it did.
    


            “Dismissal of the Executive's suit is appropriate because it has not pointed to a cause of action that permits this court to entertain a lawsuit between two coordinate branches of government, and this court will not be the first to create one,” he wrote.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.
    


            The Justice Department had argued that the automatic orders from the Maryland court in certain immigration cases were unlawful because they didn't involve the usual analysis by a judge to determine whether such a temporary block against a removal was warranted.
    


            In finishing his opinion, Cullen underscored the unusual nature of the lawsuit, which came as the Trump administration faced a slew of immigration-related cases amid its effort to deport an unprecedented number of undocumented immigrants from Maryland and elsewhere.
    


            “Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,” he wrote. “Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.”

            United States Special Envoy Tom Barrack sparked outrage after telling Lebanese journalists to act “civilized,” not “animalistic,” during a news conference in the Lebanese capital Beirut on Tuesday.
    


            Barrack, joined by deputy envoy Morgan Ortagus, was in the Lebanese capital as part of US efforts to disarm the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. During the briefing, he scolded the journalists for calling out questions simultaneously – a common practice in news conferences – linking their behavior to what he described as a broader “problem” in the Middle East.
    


            “Please, be quiet for a moment. And I wanna tell you something. The moment this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we're gone. So, you want to know what's happening? Act civilized, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what's happening in the region,” he told the reporters.
    


            Lebanon faces a delicate dilemma. It relies on crucial US support while accommodating Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the country, even as it comes under frequent Israeli military attacks.
    


            “Do you think this is fun for us? Do you think this is economically beneficial for Morgan (Ortagus) and I to be here putting up with this insanity?” he told the journalists.
    


            Barrack, who is of Lebanese descent, is the special envoy to Syria and also serves as the US Ambassador to Turkey.
    


            The envoy's comments angered Lebanese journalists on social media, who described the statements as “racist.”
    


            “Tom Barrack struts into Beirut like a 19th-century colonial commissioner, calls Lebanese journalists ‘animalistic,' lectures us on ‘civilization,' & blames it all on our ‘region.' That's not just arrogance, it's racism. You don't run this country, & you don't get to insult its people,” Lebanese-British journalist Hala Jaber said on X.
    


            Another journalist, Ali Hashem, called the comments “humiliating.”
    


            “The level of arrogance US officials demonstrate in Lebanon is humiliating for the country.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the US State Department and Barrack's team for comment.
    


            Without naming Barrack, the Lebanese presidency said it “regrets the statements made from its platform” by “one of its guests today.”
    


            Barrack is leading a US delegation to Lebanon, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congressman Joe Wilson, and Ortagus.
    


            The US has offered Lebanon support if its government disarms Hezbollah. The militant group was weakened significantly after months of an Israeli campaign that was launched after Hezbollah attacked Israeli-held territory in support of Hamas in October 2023.

            The wrestler beaten while motionless by the son of former UFC champion Rampage Jackson is conscious but has a “difficult recovery ahead,” according to a Facebook post by his brother.
    


            Footage from an event on Saturday night in Sun Valley, California, posted on social media showed Jackson's son, Raja Jackson – a professional MMA fighter – sliding into the ring during another bout and throwing Syko Stu, whose real name is Stuart Smith, to the mat.
    


            The video, which bears a watermark suggesting it was livestreamed on the video platform Kick, showed Jackson straddling Smith before repeatedly punching him in the face and the side of his head, even when Smith was lying motionless. Other wrestlers then restrained Jackson.
    


            CNN has not been able to independently verify the video, but Kick confirmed to CNN that Raja Jackson's account has been banned from the platform.
    


            Smith's brother, Andrew, said early on Monday that his brother was “conscious and does have some recollection of events from the day of the attack.”
    


            Andrew Smith later provided an update, writing that his brother was resting having sustained “severe injuries to his head.”
    


            “He is currently conscious and able to talk but will have a difficult recovery ahead,” Andrew wrote.
    


            “With all the media and social media attention it's been hard to get back to everyone.Stuart Smith appreciates all the love and support. He loves wrestling, his wrestling family, and all his fans and supporters. Wrestling has been a huge part of his life and he lives to put on a performance. He's also just a regular guy with a life and family outside the ring.”
    


            Smith's wife, Contessa Patterson, organized a fundraising page to help cover his medical costs and loss of income after the “unscripted assault.”
    


            “Stuart Smith is a U.S. Army veteran who used wrestling as an outlet to deal with his PTSD, this incident has not only caused major physical harm, but will also disrupt his career inside the ring and outside of it,” she wrote.
    


            At the time of writing, the page has raised almost $70,000.
    


            After the event on Saturday, Rampage Jackson took to Twitter to condemn his son's actions.
    


            “I don't condone my son's actions AT ALL!” he wrote in a post to X on Sunday morning. “He (Raja Jackson) suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact.
    


            “As a father, I'm deeply concerned with his health AND the well-being of Mr. Smith. That being said I'm very upset that any of this happened, but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery. I apologize on his (Raja Jackson's) behalf and to KICK for the situation.”
    


            A statement by organizer KnokX suggested that the incident started off as a scripted part of the show, known as a “work” in wrestling, but was not intended to go as far as it did.
    


            “What was supposed to be a planned and agreed upon wrestling spot, turned into a selfish, irresponsible act of violence against Mr. Smith,” the organizer wrote.
    


            “This egregious act is reprehensible and never should have occurred. In the 17 years of operation of KnokX Pro Wrestling Academy, there has never been anything as heinous take place such as this and we apologize to our patrons and fans.”

More than 100 organizations advocate for freedom of 16-year-old dual citizen detained for more than six months

More than 100 US human rights, faith-based and civil rights groups have demanded that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, immediately secure the release of a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen who has been in an Israeli prison for six months over allegations of rock throwing.

The coalition, which includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), the Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA, warned that Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim's deteriorating health puts “his life on the line” and demanded urgent US intervention in the most significant organized pressure campaign on the imprisoned teenager's case yet.

“Mohammed is an American child with a community in Florida who cares about him deeply,” the organizations wrote in the letter. “It is the responsibility of the US government to protect all American children, including Palestinian-Americans.”

The ADC, one of the signers, also erected a billboard in New York's Times Square earlier in August featuring Ibrahim's photograph and the message “Free Mohammed Ibrahim”, describing him as a Palestinian-American teenager “unjustly imprisoned by Israel”.

The Guardian was first to report Ibrahim's detention. The teen, who splits his time between Palm Bay, Florida, and the West Bank, was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested him from his home in the West Bank in February. He has since developed scabies, according to state department emails to the family, and lost at least 25lbs, his lawyer says.

The Guardian learned of his detention while investigating the death of Ibrahim's cousin, Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.

The teenager is now being held at Israel's Ofer prison, which the coalition described as notorious for abusing Palestinian children. He was previously detained at Megiddo prison, where a 17-year-old Palestinian teenager died in April from what advocates described as abusive conditions.

“Mohammed traveled to his family's home in the West Bank for a family vacation to see loved ones,” the letter reads. “The Israeli military took Mohammed when he was only 15 years old, forcing him to spend his 16th birthday in an Israeli military prison, terrified and separated from his parents.”

Military court documents seen by the Guardian show Israeli authorities accuse Mohammed of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in at least two separate incidents. At an August court hearing, his lawyer said Ibrahim needed medical care, with his next hearing scheduled for 29 October.

The groups argue Ibrahim's imprisonment violates the fourth Geneva convention's prohibition on transferring detainees from occupied territory to the occupying power's territory. He is among 323 Palestinian children aged 12-17 currently held in Israeli military detention, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine.

His father, Zaher Ibrahim, contacted Mike Haridopolos, a Republican congressman from Florida, in March after more than 45 days without contact with his son, casework filed with the lawmaker and seen by the Guardian shows. Haridopolos's office confirmed it had shared the family's information with the state department, which said the US embassy in Israel was “following standard procedures”.

US embassy officials have conducted welfare checks on Ibrahim since his detention but faced restrictions in July after informing the family that Ibrahim was suffering from scabies and was receiving medical treatment, according to state department emails reviewed by the Guardian. It is unclear whether officials have resumed the welfare checks.

In response to the letter, a spokesperson for the state department said: “Whenever a US citizen is detained abroad, the Department works to provide consular assistance in accordance with US and international law.” The spokesperson also said: “If we become aware of an arrest of any US citizen, including a minor, we will provide consular services, including prison visits.”

The organized campaign represents an escalation in efforts to secure Ibrahim's release after months of what advocates describe as inadequate government response to his detention.

“Dozens of Palestinian-American families own land in the West Bank – Palestinian cities and villages that are increasingly being targeted by Israeli settlers and the Israeli military,” the groups wrote. “Yet, Palestinian-American families are not receiving any protection from the US government against rising Israeli settler and Israeli military violence against them.”

BERLIN, August 26. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has made four attempts to speak with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the phone in the past weeks but the latter did not take the calls, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported, citing sources.

The paper points out that earlier, Trump shocked India by imposing the country with 25% tariffs and calling it a "dead economy." "There are signs indicating that Modi felt insulted," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes, adding that Modi's unwillingness to hold a phone conversation with Trump demonstrates the extent to which the Indian premier was irritated by what the US president had done.

The newspaper also notes that the way Trump is perceived in India has considerably changed, particularly due to his statements about plans to boost relations with Pakistan.

India and the United States launched talks on a large-scale trade agreement in February, following Modi's visit to Washington. The two countries seek to increase annual trade to $500 billion by 2030. The document was expected to be signed in the fall. India's delegation made several trips to Washington to hold talks on the document; a US delegation's visit to India for the sixth round of talks, set for August 25, was canceled.

On August 6, the US raised tariffs on Indian goods by 25% to 50%, citing New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil and petroleum products. Trump criticized the South Asian nation for having always purchased the bulk of defense equipment from Russia and being the largest buyer of Russian energy, alongside China. The Indian Foreign Ministry condemned criticism from the US and the EU over Russian oil imports as unjustified. The increased tariffs are set to take effect on August 27.

U.S. funding was an attempt to provide alternatives to extremism, largely devoted to supporting better local governance and training leaders

Asmadee Bueheng knows T-shirts. It had always been a hobby, finding items emblazoned with music bands or other designs that make them rare.

In deep southern Thailand, on the border with Malaysia, he would sift through bulk shipments of used clothes – sold by weight in bundles of up to 100 kilograms − and pick out shirts he knew had value. Then he would sell them, sometimes for hundreds of dollars, to customers as far away as Japan.

It made for a fun gig, a modestly profitable side venture to his main work as a journalist at BenarNews, writing on intensely local and sometimes deeply sensitive subjects.

Then, Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a new administration that cut deeply into U.S. spending overseas, including the funds that supported BenarNews, a media outlet operating in Islamic regions of southeast Asia that published stories about Muslim society in Thailand. It was funded by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

In Thailand, “no other news agency reported peoples' stories in the deep south,” Mr. Bueheng says. “It was the essential platform for local stories like this to be told.”

The cuts shut down Benar in April and left Mr. Bueheng unemployed.

Trump administration ends some USAID contracts providing life-saving aid, officials say

Selling T-shirts is now his main work, searching through bags brought in from Pakistan and Malaysia and posting good finds for sale on Facebook Marketplace, rather than reporting on issues like a project to develop local hydro dams. That project has come at a cost to the environment and local residents that, he says, demands scrutiny.

“I want to write about this,” he says. “But nobody wants to run the story.”

The Malay Muslims of southern Thailand occupy a region that has been wracked by violence and political instability, home to a separatist movement that has attacked civilians and institutions of the central government. The conflict has killed more than 7,000 people in the past two decades. 

Today, military checkpoints with armoured vehicles and defensive installations are installed across roads through the area. Soldiers with assault rifles are visible walking through local forests on patrol.

Few foreign tourists travel here, and the Thai government has been suspicious of Western influence in the region, in particular human-rights advocacy.

“Many international organizations could not do anything here,” said Yasmin Sattar, a political scientist at Prince of Songkla University who has conducted an assessment of United States Agency for International Development spending in the Thai south over the past decades.

But the U.S., through its funding of BenarNews and money that came from USAID, found ways to deliver funds that supported local organizations and government administrators.

Among Western donors, “we could say that USAID is the biggest,” she said.

Around the world, cuts to U.S. foreign funding have been rapid and severe, with the shuttering of USAID cutting off money for critical medical supplies and life-saving food. 

Mr. Trump has accused the agency of misspending billions of dollars. The cuts could result in 14 million additional deaths over the next half-decade, according to a study published last month in The Lancet. 

What has happened in southern Thailand, a region little-known outside the country, underscores the immense reach of the funding changes. It also points to the ways Mr. Trump's foreign policies risk longer-term damage to his own country, undoing years of effort to bolster the U.S. position in the Muslim world.

“It's just a pity,” said Prof. Sattar.

In recent years, U.S. funding in the area was largely devoted to supporting better local governance, training leaders and young people. It was an attempt to provide alternatives to extremism. 

“When young people get the sense that they can engage with their own local government, at the end of the day they may not feel like they want to engage with violence,” said Prof. Sattar.

A decade ago, in the long aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. image was so poor in southern Thailand − as in other Muslim areas around the world − that local organizations “couldn't even tell the community that they got funds from the U.S.,” Prof. Sattar said. But years of investment began to bring change in perceptions. 

“Foreign aid can be a soft power,” she said. “But when Donald Trump returned, everything just turned back.”

Across southern Thailand, roughly 15 small organizations have had to shutter projects because of the cuts, said Soraya Jamjuree, co-ordinator of the Network of Civic Women for Peace. Months later, “there is still no replacement for the USAID funding,” she said. 

Her organization, which published a guide for women's participation in public life, was in the past visited by the U.S. ambassador to Thailand. The front cover of the guide features the USAID logo and slogan: “From the American people.”

“A lot of religious leaders in the deep south hold very conservative ideas on women: Women should stay at home. They should not have a role in society. With this project, we are trying to conduct a dialogue with local religious leaders,” Ms. Jamjuree said. “It is not against Islamic law for women to have a greater role in society.”

Opinion: Scrapping USAID doesn't just hurt the world's poor – it harms the West

Her organization receives funds from Canada, too, as well as a raft of other international sources. But the U.S. was important because of the size of its support. Foreign cash is particularly key in an area riven by sectarian strife, she said. Community groups that receive government funding can be seen as allies with a government that some here perceive as oppressive.

The disappearance of U.S. funding has also come at a sensitive time in southern Thailand, where a long-standing peace process has been suspended since late last year. Incidents of violence rose 30 per cent last year, and are up again this year. The number of casualties was up by two-thirds.

Civil-society groups, including those that have been funded by USAID, have played a role as independent monitors of what is taking place in the Thai south, where martial law has “allowed government security forces to do whatever they want − enforcement of the law without any discretion,” said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, which monitors conflict in the region.

“The issue is impunity, because government officials claim they have impunity when they violate international laws.”

For that reason, the central government has long chafed at foreign support for local organizations in the Thai south. In the wake of U.S. funding cuts, “it has seemed to me the government is a little bit more relaxed. They know that USAID has stopped giving money to the local civil society,” Mr. Jitpiromsri said.

The U.S. had always been careful not to fund projects overtly critical of the Thai military, in order to avoid pushing the country closer toward China. Nonetheless, Mr. Jitpiromsri said, “Trump's new policy has effects on the human-rights movement.”

Among those who feel newly vulnerable is Mr. Bueheng, the journalist. He has faced criminal charges, accused of obstructing justice, underscoring the risk of his work.

“When I worked at BenarNews, at least I had some organization to support me. But after its closure, I am back to being freelance − and vulnerable to oppression by authorities.”

Mr. Bueheng says he faced criminal charges and was accused of obstructing justice after the news outlet that employed him was defunded due to USAID cuts.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail

Open letter has been signed by 209 former EU ambassadors, senior diplomatic staff and ambassadors from EU nation states

A public letter signed by 209 former EU ambassadors, senior diplomatic staff and ambassadors from EU nation states has been published today, calling for urgent action over Israel's war in Gaza and unlawful actions in the West Bank.

If the EU will not act collectively, member states must take steps individually or in smaller groups to support human rights and uphold international law, the letter says, laying out nine possible approaches.

They include suspending arms export licenses, barring trade in goods and services with illegal settlements and barring European datacentres from receiving, storing or processing data from Israeli government or commercial sources if it relates to Israel's “presence and activities in Gaza and elsewhere in the occupied territories”.

Signatories include 110 former ambassadors, 25 former director general and two of the most senior diplomats in the EU – Alain Le Roy, former secretary general of the European External Affairs service and Carlo Trojan, former secretary general of the European Commission.

“This struck a chord,” said Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, former EU representative to the Palestinian territory and part of a steering group of 6 former diplomats coordinating the initiative which began in mid-July.

This letter was the third public call for action, and the first calling for nations to act individually if the EU does not take collective action. A proposal to partly suspend Israel from the Horizon research fund over Gaza failed in late July.

“There is such dismay now within the institutions, people are saying enough is enough,” Kühn von Burgsdorff said.

“We can't stay paralysed if the 27 (member states) can't take action, that betrays our values. So we have proposed nine actions that can be taken at the state level or by groups of states.”

“European governments are losing credibility not just in the global south but with our own citizens, in every member state.” He cited polling from his native Germany, traditionally a staunch supporter of Israel, that showed 80 percent of the population disagree with Israel's actions in Gaza and two-thirds want the government to take action.

The Israeli military said on Tuesday an initial inquiry into its strike on a Gaza hospital that killed five journalists determined that troops had identified a camera “positioned by Hamas” in the area to observe its forces. Israeli forces struck Nasser hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people including journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others outlets.

The UN has demanded that Israel's investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20 people, among them five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability. “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN's human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.

Mariam Abu Dagga, one of the Gaza-based journalists killed in the Israeli airstrike on Nasser hospital, has been described as “deeply passionate” by her peers. The 33-year-old photojournalist was killed when Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday (25 August) and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded.

The Israeli security cabinet has begun its meeting, a spokesperson told The Times of Israel. The meeting has started at prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. It was moved up to 4pm and is expected to finish by 7pm.

The death toll in Gaza has risen, with least 75 Palestinians, including 17 aid seekers, being killed in the last 24 hours according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. It said that the total death toll since 7 October 2023 has now risen to 62,819, with 158,629 people wounded.

Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar has accused “left-wing” governments of trying to “force” Palestinian state on to Israel. During his first official visit to the US since taking office last year, he said at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in New York that the move would amount to “suicide”.

A human rights group says US military personnel could face legal liability for assisting Israeli forces who commit war crimes in Gaza. According to Human Rights Watch, direct participation by US forces since October 2023, including providing intelligence and involvement in coordination and planning makes the United States party to the conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups.

Protesters in Israel on Tuesday torched tyres, blocked highways and clamoured for a ceasefire that would free hostages still in Gaza, even as Israeli leaders moved forward with plans for an offensive which they argue is needed to defeat Hamas. The disruption came as Palestinians in Gaza braced for the expanded offensive against a backdrop of displacement, destruction and parts of the territory plunging into famine, AP reported.

Dutch airline KLM will resume flight services to and from Israel on 28 September, after suspending flights in June over security concerns. It will bring back the Tel Aviv to Amsterdam route once daily with a Boeing 737-900, which seats 188 passengers. The carrier took a one-year absence from flying to Israel, and only just reopened the route before shutting it down again on 13 June due to the closure of Israel's airspace following Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear and military infrastructure.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar are prepared to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon, near the Israeli border, in hopes that it would create opportunities and jobs for members of the militant Hezbollah group and its supporters once they surrender – Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Tom Barrack, said. As reported by The Independent, Barrack took trips to Israel and Syria to discuss the situation in Lebanon after the Lebanese government said it would disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah rejected this plan.

Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that the country would not be joining other western nations in recognising Palestinian statehood at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. Reuters reports that he was speaking at a joint news conference with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who said last month that Canada planned to recognise the state of Palestine at the General Assembly, after similar announcements by France and Britain.

Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students to leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month, but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel's approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK's leading universities.

Israel-based group Physicians for Human Rights has written to Israel's government warning that orders to evacuate hospitals in Gaza City ahead of a planned Israeli offensive will be a “death sentence” for many patients. “The analysis shows that southern Gaza cannot accommodate additional patients,” PHR said in a letter sent on Monday to COGAT, the Israeli authority responsible for civilian affairs in Gaza.

Iran has vowed to take “reciprocal action” after Australia expelled its ambassador over accusations that Tehran was behind antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.

Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday that the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) had “credible intelligence” to believe that the Iranian government was behind the attacks against the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis's Continental Kitchen in Bondi in Sydney last year.

He also announced that Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps would now be listed as a terrorist group.

But Iran hit back on Tuesday and pledged to take “reciprocal action”. It also said that Albanese was weak and was only taking the action to compensate for a tougher recent line on Israel.

Israel hit Gaza's Nasser hospital twice, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.

The first strike hit the top floor of a building at the Nasser hospital, killing the Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri and others.

Iran's involvement in clandestine violence and espionage overseas takes many forms, but all have a single aim – to win advantage for Tehran by striking unexpectedly at the “soft underbelly” of enemies.

It's a strategy that dates back to the 1979 revolution, and is rooted in a pragmatic if regretful assessment of Iran's continuing weakness on the conventional battlefield.

Australian authorities have not revealed exactly what convinced them that Iran was behind a series of antisemitic attacks in the country in recent months, but the charge is plausible, experts say.

“We don't know the full details, but the Australians wouldn't [publicly blame Iran] unless they were pretty confident,” said Matthew Redhead, an expert in state threats and intelligence at London's Royal United Services Institute.

“Iran sees this as a cheap way of fighting an undeclared war against its opponents and of rallying audiences its wants to impress in the Middle East … They don't have the resources to fight any other way. There is a long history here.”

The Israeli military said on Tuesday an initial inquiry into its strike on a Gaza hospital that killed five journalists determined that troops had identified a camera “positioned by Hamas” in the area to observe its forces.

Israeli forces struck Nasser hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people including journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others outlets.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said later on Monday that Israel deeply regretted what he called a “tragic mishap”.

Protesters in Israel on Tuesday torched tyres, blocked highways and clamoured for a ceasefire that would free hostages still in Gaza, even as Israeli leaders moved forward with plans for an offensive which they argue is needed to defeat Hamas.

The disruption came as Palestinians in Gaza braced for the expanded offensive against a backdrop of displacement, destruction and parts of the territory plunging into famine, AP reported.

It also followed deadly strikes a day earlier on Gaza's main hospital which killed 20 people including medics and journalists. Among them was Mariam Dagga, a journalist who worked for the Associated Press.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to convene a security cabinet meeting later Tuesday. However, the government said the meeting will not include discussion of ceasefire talks, according to an official with knowledge of the situation.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter, said there was a delegation from Egypt in Israel on Monday and they discussed the negotiations.

Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students to leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month, but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel's approval.

It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK's leading universities.

Chevening scholarships are largely government funded and are offered to “exceptional individuals” to study for a one-year master's degree at a UK university. All 40 students identified by the government have fully funded scholarships.

A Home Office source said it was “a complex and challenging task”. Names would have to be submitted to the Israeli authorities for approval, after which the students would travel to a third country, likely to be Jordan, for visa biometric checks, which are not currently available in Gaza.

Campaigners for the students welcomed the news, but expressed concern that the latest group had received no direct contact from the government or been given details of what might happen next, while others with full funding appeared not to have been included.

The Israeli army has raided the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, triggering clashes with Palestinian youths.

Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that the army detained at least three people after raiding a currency exchange shop.

Israel-based group Physicians for Human Rights has written to Israel's government warning that orders to evacuate hospitals in Gaza City ahead of a planned Israeli offensive will be a “death sentence” for many patients.

“The analysis shows that southern Gaza cannot accommodate additional patients,” PHR said in a letter sent on Monday to COGAT, the Israeli authority responsible for civilian affairs in Gaza.

“Hospital capacity across the Gaza Strip is already at maximum. This makes the safe transfer of patients from Gaza City hospitals to southern medical centers impossible.”

There are no permanent hospitals in Rafah, just a field hospital. Al Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis -- which was attacked yesterday -- is already operating at 180 percent capacity and faces ongoing shortages, the letter said.

Field hospitals run by international organisations in Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis and Al-Mawasi have limited equipment and face risks of closure.

The letter called for an immediate halt to evacuations, and for the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical equipment.

Physicians for Human Rights last month said Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, citing the “deliberate, cumulative, and ongoing dismantling of Gaza's healthcare system”.

The UN has demanded that Israel's investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20 people, among them five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability.

“There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN's human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.

On Monday, Israel struck Nasser hospital, the last functioning public hospital in southern Gaza, twice. Witnesses said the second strike came just as rescue crews and journalists arrived to evacuate the wounded 15 minutes after the first bombing, killing first responders and media workers.

The “double tap” strike killed journalists working for Reuters, Associated Press and Al Jazeera, as well as independent journalists. It drew global condemnation. All three publications issued statements mourning the journalists, and urged Israel to look into the killings.

The office of the Israeli prime minister said it “deeply regrets the tragic mishap” that happened at the hospital and that the Israeli military was conducting an investigation.

The UN spokesperson urged Israel to ensure its investigation led to results, referring to recent Israeli military investigations that were closed without resolution.

The Israeli security cabinet has begun its meeting, a spokesperson told The Times of Israel.

The meeting has started at prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. It was moved up to 4pm and is expected to finish by 7pm.

The security cabinet will discuss the next phases of the IDF's operation in Gaza City, and the forum is expected to approve of plans.

According to local sources, the cabinet will not discuss the hostage release and ceasefire plan that Hamas accepted last week.

Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel's plans to take over Gaza City showed it wasn't serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire would be the “only way” hostages would be released.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar are prepared to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon, near the Israeli border, in hopes that it would create opportunities and jobs for members of the militant Hezbollah group and its supporters once they surrender – Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Tom Barrack, said.

As reported by The Independent, Barrack took trips to Israel and Syria to discuss the situation in Lebanon after the Lebanese government said it would disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah rejected this plan.

Now, Barrack said something needs to replace conflict in the area, according to The National. 

“We have to have a substitute for what happened, because there is another outside party,” he said, referring to Iran.

“Iran has been the financier of the growth of Hezbollah, both its municipality and its militia. So how do we substitute that?” he asked.

“We bring in the Gulf countries simultaneously and a new economic zone, which will have some depth to it in the next few weeks.”

Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that the country would not be joining other western nations in recognising Palestinian statehood at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.

Reuters reports that he was speaking at a joint news conference with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who said last month that Canada planned to recognise the state of Palestine at the General Assembly, after similar announcements by France and Britain.

However, Merz said that Germany would not be following. “The position of the federal government is clear, as far as the possible recognition of the state of Palestine is concerned,” Merz said.

“Canada knows this. We will not join this initiative. We don't see the requirements met.”

More than 140 nations have joined the call for international recognition of a Palestinian state, which is around three-quarters of all United Nations members.

Mariam Abu Dagga, one of the Gaza-based journalists killed in the Israeli airstrike on Nasser hospital, has been described as “deeply passionate” by her peers.

The 33-year-old photojournalist was killed when Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday (25 August) and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded.

Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri; the Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam; the photojournalist Moaz Abu Taha, and Ahmad Abu Aziz from Quds Feed were also killed.

“Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old freelance journalist and close friend of Dagga.

To her colleagues, she was known also for her kindness and dedication.

“Mariam was kind, gentle and deeply passionate about her work. She had lost her mother and her closest colleague, Abu Anas, yet she never stopped covering the war for even a single day,” Farhan said.

Independent Arabia said that she was the “example of dedication and professional commitment”, and praised her for carrying “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”.

This comes as The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned Israel's “broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza”.

The flight time is expected to bee extended by an hour to allow for a stop in Larnaca, Cyprus. This is to switch out crew members who are concerned about being in Israel during an ongoing war – The Times of Israel reports.

A Norwegian wealth fund has sold Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, over Israel's use of its bulldozers to destroy Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank.

The fund said it excluded Caterpillar and five Israeli banking groups on ethics grounds. “There is no doubt that Caterpillar's products are being used to commit extensive and systemic violations of international humanitarian law,” said the fund's independent council on ethics.

It also said the machinery was “being used by Israeli authorities in the widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property”.

“As deliveries of the relevant machinery to Israel are now set to resume, the council considers there to be an unacceptable risk that Caterpillar is con­tributing to serious violations of individuals' rights in war or conflict situations,” it said.

The wealth fund has now removed more than 20 Israeli companies this year, but Caterpillar is the first big US company to be removed through the wealth fund's ongoing review to ensure its investments do not contribute to violations of international law.

LATEST: Polish president's veto won't threaten Ukraine's Starlink access, Nawrocki's office claims.

Editor's note: This story was updated to include another law signed by President Karol Nawrocki the same day and a comment from a diplomatic source.Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Aug. 25 vetoed a bill that would have extended financial support for Ukrainians fleeing the war, a decision that officials warn will also cut funding for Ukraine's Starlink internet service starting Oct. 1.

Poland has been supporting Ukraine's internet connection since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion by financing Starlink systems, which are a lifeline for soldiers fighting on the front line.

"Presidential vetoes are cutting blindly! Karol Nawrocki turns off the Internet in Ukraine with his decision, because de facto it means his decision on the law on assistance to Ukrainian citizens," Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski wrote on X. "This is the end of the Starlink Internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine, which is waging war. This is also the end of support for storing Ukrainian administration data in a safe place."

"I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet," he added, accusing Nawrocki of "helping Russia" by blocking support for Kyiv's communications infrastructure.

The Polish president's decision to veto the bill "means that as of Oct. 1, Warsaw will not be able to continue paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription," a spokesperson for Poland's Digital Affairs Ministry told TVP public television on Aug. 25.

"The bill, which President Nawrocki vetoed, extended the period of assistance, meaning this funding from the Ukraine Aid Fund, until the end of March next year," ministry spokesperson Marek Gieorgica said. "Therefore, there is currently no legal basis for funding this from Oct. 1."

According to Polish outlet Onet, Nawrocki said on Aug. 25 that Poland's strategic interests have not changed, and Russia remains "the greatest threat to security." 

"However, after 3.5 years, the situation in terms of financials and social and political emotions has fundamentally changed. The law that was proposed should be corrected today," Nawrocki added during a briefing at the Presidential Palace.

Ukraine relies heavily on Starlink, the satellite internet system developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, to maintain connectivity in front-line areas and support government communications. 

Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on April 3 that Poland had supplied 5,000 additional Starlink terminals for critical infrastructure.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has received over 50,000 Starlink terminals, with Poland providing nearly 30,000 — the largest contribution by any single country, according to Fedorov.

Among other measures, Nawrocki announced the submission of his own bill that, among other measures, would extend the period required to obtain Polish citizenship from three to 10 years and introduce harsher penalties for illegal border crossing. 

Nawrocki also proposed equating the "Bandera symbol" with Nazi and Communist symbols in Poland's criminal code and revising the law on the Institute of National Remembrance to reflect "crimes committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army."

The controversy over historical symbols has long complicated Polish-Ukrainian relations. While many in Poland associate Stepan Bandera's legacy with wartime atrocities, in Ukraine, the figure has come to symbolize resistance and national identity, especially in the fight against Russia's ongoing invasion.

"In order to eliminate Russian propaganda and set relations with Ukraine on a mutual respect, I believe we should also include in this bill an unambiguous slogan 'stop Banderism,'" the Polish president declared.

A Ukrainian diplomatic source told the Kyiv Independent that while Ukraine appreciates Poland's past support, equating Ukrainian symbols with Nazi and Communist ones risks fueling negative sentiment in Ukrainian society.

"Any politicized decisions on allegedly equating Ukrainian symbols with Nazi and Communist ones may provoke stronger negative sentiment in Ukrainian society and will require a response from the Ukrainian side," the source said.

Nawrocki, a right-wing nationalist backed by the opposition Law and Justice party, narrowly won Poland's presidential election on June 1 with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal rival Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski.

While Poland has a parliamentary system in which the president's authority is largely ceremonial, the Polish president is still able to veto legislation proposed by the parliament.

News Editor

Anna Fratsyvir is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent, with a background in broadcast journalism and international affairs. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

According to the data provided by the prosecutors, 202,997 criminal cases have been opened into unauthorized abandonment of military units, also known as absence without leave, from 2022 to July 2025. A total of 15, 564 people have been officially charged with the crime. 

Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 have been prohibited from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with some exceptions. Men aged 25 to 60 can be conscripted into the armed forces. 



Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, told the Kyiv Independent that claims about the capture of Zaporizke appeared already on Aug. 25 and were not confirmed by Ukraine at the time.

The NGOs argue in a joint statement that the restrictions will be a major obstacle to exposing corruption and journalistic investigations. 

Initial findings suggest the drone may have been intended to strike targets within Russian territory. The Estonian police say Russian electronic warfare, including GPS jamming, could have diverted the aircraft off course, causing it to stray into Estonian airspace.

"The attack damaged the enterprise's buildings and equipment, causing a power outage," the DTEK energy company said. "At that time, 146 miners were underground; their ascent to the surface is ongoing."

Thirty-three-year-old National Guard soldier Vladyslav survived after Russian forces slit his throat and threw him into a pit, believing he was dead, Suspilne reported on Aug. 25. He managed to climb out and spent five days crawling back to Ukrainian-controlled territory.

The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to organize peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian presidents in its effort to end Moscow's full-scale war, while Kyiv awaits a proposed framework for security guarantees from its partners.

State-owned and private processors, including energy giant Reliance Industries, plan to trim daily purchases to 1.4-1.6 million barrels from the current 1.8 million barrels, Bloomberg reported.

The 19th sanctions package should instead include further measures against Moscow's "shadow fleet" and companies helping Russia circumvent existing sanctions, Politico reported.

The deals were reportedly offered as incentives to push the Kremlin toward a peace agreement and to provide Washington with justification for easing certain sanctions on Russia.

The operation "disabled logistical facilities that support the operations and combat supply of Russian army units," the Special Operations Forces said in a statement.

The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. 

During his tenure, Igor Krasnov oversaw the arrest of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when he returned from Germany.

MOSCOW, August 26. /TASS/. First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Denis Manturov did not rule out the resumption of aviation cooperation between Russia and the United States, but he stressed that it is too early to discuss the possible format of such collaboration, he said in an interview with TASS CEO Andrey Kondrashov ahead of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).

"Perhaps the resumption of aviation cooperation cannot be ruled out. But in which areas and in what formats - this is too early to discuss for now," he said.

Earlier, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and special presidential representative for investment and economic cooperation, stated that direct air service between Russia and the United States could resume by the end of 2025. Saint Petersburg may serve as one of the hubs for flights to the US. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, discussions on resuming flights between the two countries can take place only after Aeroflot is lifted from sanctions.

California Republicans on Aug. 25 filed a second legal challenge against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's congressional redistricting plan, which will go before voters as Proposition 50 in November.

The lawsuit argued that the plan violates the state Constitution, which requires that maps be drawn by the politically neutral California Citizens Redistricting Commission.

In the lead-up to the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this month, things did not look good for Ukraine. Characterizations of the summit oscillated between a “new Yalta,” in which the U.S. president might agree to the Kremlin's demands for a Russian sphere of influence over Ukraine, and a “new Munich,” in which Trump would throw Ukraine under the bus and withdraw U.S. support for the country's defense. In other words, expectations in Ukraine and among Kyiv's allies were low.

Yet the summit didn't end in a major disaster for Ukraine. Trump didn't negotiate with Putin on Kyiv's behalf; he didn't agree to start normalizing relations with Russia before the war in Ukraine was resolved; and on August 18, he received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a phalanx of European leaders at the White House, where they collectively managed to throw the diplomatic ball back into Putin's court. “This was very much a day of team Europe and team U.S. together supporting Ukraine,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said afterward.

But although Putin now knows that his aspirational Plan A, in which Trump would simply impose a deal on Kyiv written in Moscow, is unlikely to materialize, he has shifted to his more workable Plan B, in which Trump will lose patience and significantly reduce U.S. assistance to Ukraine. In the Kremlin's calculus, this still counts as winning, and Putin's diplomatic strategy is still following the three-pronged approach that my co-authors and I outlined in Foreign Affairs a few months ago. Moscow is holding the U.S. president's attention, forestalling a new round of painful U.S. sanctions, and keeping the fighting going.

This is because, in the Kremlin's assessment, time is on Russia's side. Moscow has the upper hand on the battlefield: it has maintained a significant numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, and despite mounting casualties, it has continued to gradually gnaw through the fortified lines in the Donbas. Moreover, Russia is catching up in drone warfare, denying Ukraine its competitive edge. Moscow doesn't want a cease-fire to stop the war right now—unless, of course, all of its political demands are simply met.

Russia is playing Trump for time. But despite the country's confidence, it's not clear that Putin has a realistic contingency plan should Kyiv prove able to hold on, as it has for the past three years. If, for example, the EU speeds up delivery of ammunition and drones from existing stock and extends a financial lifeline to Kyiv by confiscating the $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets sitting in its banks, the Kremlin may not achieve its strategic goal of Ukraine's subjugation. Despite putting Russia's economy and society on a war footing, Putin may need more than just time to win.

Early engagements with the second Trump administration seemed encouraging for Moscow's Plan A. Trump appointed his friend Steve Witkoff as a special envoy for negotiations with Russia, and Witkoff visited Moscow several times and spent hours talking to Putin. Between Trump's inauguration in January and the summer, the U.S. and Russian presidents had three lengthy phone calls, and Putin's talking points clearly made an impact on his U.S. counterpart, as painfully evidenced in Trump's dressing down of Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28.

Moreover, Moscow has been trying to compartmentalize the relationship with the United States, as was clear during the first high-level meeting between the Russians and Trump's national security team on February 18. The Kremlin suggested seeking peace in Ukraine in tandem with a broader normalization of U.S.-Russian ties, which would include reopening the consulates in both countries (which have been closed since 2017), restarting arms control talks, and boosting mutual trade and investment.

By summer, however, it had become apparent that the Kremlin's charm offensive was faltering. Zelensky, with a lot of counseling from European leaders, had managed to patch up the relationship with Trump by signing a mineral deal that provided the United States with preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources, particularly rare-earth minerals. In return, the White House has continued Kyiv's access to U.S. military assistance, including American intelligence and the ability to purchase U.S. weapons with European money. And on July 14, speaking alongside Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO, Trump threatened “very severe tariffs” if Russia didn't agree to an unconditional cease-fire.



The threat of further economic coercion had teeth. In 2024, Russia exported a meager $3 billion in goods to the United States, so even triple-digit tariffs would not seriously affect the Kremlin's budget. But Trump has imposed a 25 percent punitive tariff on Indian goods for purchasing Russian oil—a tariff that will likely further increase the discounts that Russian oil sellers need to provide to Indian buyers, reducing the profitability of the oil trade for the Kremlin.

The decrease in oil and gas revenues is already affecting the war economy: some of the Russian regions that previously offered lavish payouts for military recruits are reducing sign-up bonuses because funds are drying up. The most visible sign of this is the country's ballooning budget deficit. At the beginning of this year, the Kremlin's plan was to have a budget deficit of just 0.5 percent of the country's GDP. Yet in June, the Kremlin had to increase that to 1.8 percent of GDP. It will overshoot even this target; in the first seven months of this year, the budget deficit already amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP.

More U.S. sanctions could also prove damaging. The United States, for instance, has not yet blacklisted Russian energy giants, such as Rosneft and Lukoil, but such a move would put significant pressure on the Kremlin's cash flow. As Alexandra Prokopenko wrote in Foreign Affairs in January, the Russian economy has enough steam to support Putin's war machine for another 18 to 24 months, but the situation is worsening.

This reality presented the Kremlin with a dilemma of whether to continue the hard-nosed course, ignoring Trump's threats—or try to assuage him. In the end, the Kremlin decided it was better to initiate a meeting between the presidents and get Trump and Putin's personal relationship back on track. The Kremlin invited Witkoff to come to Moscow, where he was presented with a semblance of an acceptable deal on August 7. The Russians also suggested a meeting with Trump, which was hastily organized in Alaska. The usual Russian mantra that leaders' summits must be carefully prepared—a justification that the Kremlin uses to explain Putin's reluctance to meet with Zelensky—was tellingly abandoned.

After a three-hour conversation between Putin and Trump, the Alaskan summit's scheduled working lunch was canceled and the press conference downgraded to official remarks by each president. This was a clear signal that Russia's attempts to compartmentalize the Ukrainian war and to normalize ties in other areas had failed. But that was the only notable underperformance by Putin's team.

On the core issue, Putin achieved his key goal for the meeting: he convinced Trump that the White House's peacemaking efforts should be focused on reaching a comprehensive resolution to end the war, not an unconditional cease-fire, and that the fighting could continue in the meantime. Despite Trump's previous claims, as well as urging by European leaders and Zelensky before the summit, the White House has imposed no punitive measures on Russia over the Kremlin's refusal to agree to a cease-fire.

How did Putin succeed? He matched Trump's performative diplomacy with performative negotiations, essentially tricking the Trump administration into believing that he was making serious concessions. According to Trump and various U.S. officials, such as Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Vice President JD Vance, Putin signaled in Alaska that he was ready to climb down from some of his maximalist demands—demands that were absurd to begin with.



Instead of demanding the full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the four regions to which Moscow lays claim, the Kremlin is now asking Kyiv to surrender only the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Moscow will accept the current line of contact. Putin apparently suggested that he is also willing to trade other parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies, including pockets of the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions.

These land swaps would see Kyiv surrender a land mass nearly ten times as large as what Russia is prepared to give back. Moreover, the quarter of the Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls, including the strategic cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, is the most fortified part of the country and has been turned into a massive network of defense installations since its recapture in 2014 from Russian-backed separatists. For Zelensky, surrendering this territory is all but impossible for both political and military reasons. All available polling shows that Ukrainian society will not accept the country's territory's being traded; and from the military perspective, surrendering western Donbas would amount to giving the invader the key to all of northern and central Ukraine. (There are no major fortification lines beyond the “fortress belt” that Putin wants Kyiv to abandon.)

Nevertheless, after the summit, Trump accepted the logic of “land swaps” offered by Putin, although he said that the decision would be Zelensky's to make.

Another key issue discussed in Alaska was postwar security guarantees for Ukraine. Witkoff told Fox News that “epic progress” had been made during the summit. According to him, Putin agreed for the first time to the concept of security guarantees for Ukraine, and the result could be even stronger than NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause—without actual NATO membership for Kyiv.

Moreover, according to Witkoff, Russia agreed to enact a law that it would not take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal or “go after any other European countries.” These promises were greeted as “groundbreaking” by Trump's team, and the U.S. president presented them as a major achievement during his August 18 meeting at the White House with Zelensky and a group of European leaders.

For a moment, there was optimism that a security guarantee could be hammered out. Capitalizing on the vague language of the Russian proposal, Europeans jumped on the opportunity to present a plan of their own: the deployment of a European “reassurance force” in Ukraine after the war, to which ten EU countries would potentially contribute troops, while Trump promised vague “air support” from the United States without elaborating on what that could mean in practice.



But on August 20, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov poured cold water on the plan. According to him, Moscow's idea for a security guarantee is not a set of bilateral commitments between Ukraine and the U.S. and European governments with formulations similar to Article 5, but rather a consensus-based agreement guaranteed by the UN Security Council's five permanent members—with the Kremlin holding veto power. Essentially, he wants the fox to help guard the henhouse. Moreover, Moscow insists on seriously limiting the Ukrainian armed forces—both in numbers and equipment—as well as their ability to cooperate with foreign partners in arms procurement, intelligence sharing, weapons design, and training.

The “epic progress” turned out to be strikingly similar to the positions Russia held in the talks that took place in Istanbul in the first two months after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and ultimately collapsed. As first described in Foreign Affairs by Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko, those negotiations ended with no agreement in part because of Moscow's and Kyiv's inability to bridge the very same gap over security guarantees. For Putin, ending Ukraine's security partnership with the West remains a core goal. But from Kyiv's vantage point, the size of its army and ability to maintain ties to NATO's militaries are a prerequisite for retaining sovereignty and thus nonnegotiable.

Moreover, Ukraine has reasons to believe that its negotiating position is stronger than it was in 2022. Unlike three years ago, European countries are finally ready to provide the security guarantees Kyiv seeks—or at least they now say so. Even more important, the depth of cooperation between Ukraine and NATO now far outstrips the level Putin worried about before the war, precisely because of Russia's invasion. The alliance is intimately involved in building and testing weapons with Ukraine, training its army, and supplying it with intelligence and arms, including ones that can strike deep inside Russian territory. It is unimaginable that Kyiv would abandon this partnership voluntarily. Despite Trump's wish to organize a meeting between Putin and Zelensky as well as a trilateral summit to seal the deal, a genuine peace agreement remains as elusive as ever.

It's impossible to predict how Trump will deal with the chasm between Russia's positions and what is acceptable to Ukraine. But while Putin stalls, it is clear that Europe is busy developing plans of its own. Europe's Plan A consists of carefully pushing Trump to accept the fact that it's the Kremlin that is obstructing his peace efforts and that only pressure can incentivize Putin to engage in compromise. If this plan succeeds, Putin's procrastinating could backfire, with Trump at last hitting Russia with more sanctions. The Europeans are also planning to continue to pay for American weapons for Ukraine. In the week after the Alaskan summit, the Pentagon approved the sale to Ukraine of $850 million worth of equipment, including 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles with a range of 150 to 280 miles.

But if the Europeans' Plan A fails—if Trump doesn't blame Putin, or if he merely loses interest—they are developing their own Plan B. At the very least, they plan to maintain current levels of military support to Ukraine and increase the sanctions pressure on Russia (although the EU's sanctions toolkit is far less powerful than Washington's). If key European countries agree to step up the pressure, they could also share more of their existing military equipment stock with Ukraine, temporarily reducing the combat readiness of their own forces but keeping Ukraine in the fight at this crucial juncture. They could also provide a long-term financial lifeline to Kyiv by seizing the nearly $250 billion in state Russian assets frozen in the EU, allowing the purchase of U.S. weapons without reaching deeper into European taxpayers' pockets. In theory, if the United States keeps providing intelligence, doesn't drop the sanctions, and allows the EU to buy weapons for Ukraine, Europeans can self-organize and play a critical role in sustaining Ukraine's defense effort to the very moment when Putin's war machine may run out of offensive steam some 18 to 24 months down the road.

Europe's Plan B probably will not deter the Kremlin: given Putin's demonstrated ability to stomach pain and keep plugging away at an elusive victory, the Russian leader may instruct his generals and economic team to simply carry on. His government can navigate the deterioration in public finances by cutting expenditures on education, health care, and infrastructure, as it has throughout the war. Putin is also prepared to tap into the deep well of Russian manpower by force if the financial incentives dry up further. In July, the Kremlin launched digital draft notices to push more Russian men into the army; the moment a future recruit receives an electronic notification that he has been called up, Russia's borders are closed to him and there are various penalties for not serving. The Kremlin is obviously preparing money and troops for a protracted war in which its only strategy is to outlast Ukraine militarily and economically.

Yet the eventuality for which the Kremlin does not appear to have a plan is that Russia will be unable to translate its massive advantage in manpower and materiel into a decisive breakthrough—as has been the case since the war began. A plan, in other words, for the possibility that Ukraine's defense lines don't crumble after all.

Gender-related medical interventions for minors are continuing in some American clinics, reports show, even in the face of strong opposition from the Trump administration and bans on the procedures in about half of U.S. states.

Some of these treatments are occurring covertly, people on both sides of the controversy suggest. A few clinics, which initially said they would halt procedures, have resumed after outcry from transgender advocates.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Aug. 25 signed a resolution calling for Moscow to withdraw from the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture.

Despite Russia remaining a signatory to the convention, Russian war crimes and the torture of Ukrainian civilians and troops have been repeatedly documented.

The resolution calls for Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw Russia from the decades-old agreement.

"On the submission to the President of the Russian Federation... a proposal on the denunciation by the Russian Federation of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment," the resolution read.

Russia's actions in occupied Ukrainian territories further underscore its disregard for international protections. 

Former Kherson Mayor Volodymyr Mykolaienko was detained by Russian forces on April 18, 2022. Russian troops were unsuccessful in pressuring Mykolaienko to cooperate with occupation authorities, and he was targeted for his pro-Ukrainian views, his niece Hanna Korshun-Samchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

A Russian serviceman claimed to have participated in the May 2024 killing of five captured Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast, Polish-Belarusian media outlet Vot Tak reported.

Ukrainian Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 and died in the fall of 2024 after being tortured in Russian captivity. Roschyna's body was returned to Ukraine in February with missing organs.

According to the data provided by the prosecutors, 202,997 criminal cases have been opened into unauthorized abandonment of military units, also known as absence without leave, from 2022 to July 2025. A total of 15, 564 people have been officially charged with the crime. 

Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 have been prohibited from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with some exceptions. Men aged 25 to 60 can be conscripted into the armed forces. 



Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, told the Kyiv Independent that claims about the capture of Zaporizke appeared already on Aug. 25 and were not confirmed by Ukraine at the time.

The NGOs argue in a joint statement that the restrictions will be a major obstacle to exposing corruption and journalistic investigations. 

Initial findings suggest the drone may have been intended to strike targets within Russian territory. The Estonian police say Russian electronic warfare, including GPS jamming, could have diverted the aircraft off course, causing it to stray into Estonian airspace.

"The attack damaged the enterprise's buildings and equipment, causing a power outage," the DTEK energy company said. "At that time, 146 miners were underground; their ascent to the surface is ongoing."

Thirty-three-year-old National Guard soldier Vladyslav survived after Russian forces slit his throat and threw him into a pit, believing he was dead, Suspilne reported on Aug. 25. He managed to climb out and spent five days crawling back to Ukrainian-controlled territory.

The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to organize peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian presidents in its effort to end Moscow's full-scale war, while Kyiv awaits a proposed framework for security guarantees from its partners.

State-owned and private processors, including energy giant Reliance Industries, plan to trim daily purchases to 1.4-1.6 million barrels from the current 1.8 million barrels, Bloomberg reported.

The 19th sanctions package should instead include further measures against Moscow's "shadow fleet" and companies helping Russia circumvent existing sanctions, Politico reported.

The deals were reportedly offered as incentives to push the Kremlin toward a peace agreement and to provide Washington with justification for easing certain sanctions on Russia.

The operation "disabled logistical facilities that support the operations and combat supply of Russian army units," the Special Operations Forces said in a statement.

The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. 

During his tenure, Igor Krasnov oversaw the arrest of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when he returned from Germany.

President Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday, saying he is "always" ready for a legal fight after Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook signaled she would pursue legal action over her ouster.

In the wake of the unprecedented removal of a Federal Reserve governor, President Donald Trump doubled down on his decision Tuesday, saying he is "always" ready for a legal fight after the ousted governor, Lisa Cook, signaled she would pursue legal action.

"She seems to have had an infraction and she can't have an infraction. And especially that infraction because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages. We need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn't seem like she was," Trump said, referencing Cook's alleged misconduct in securing mortgage loans.

The Federal Reserve acknowledged Cook's potential legal action and said in a statement that the U.S. central bank will "abide by any court decision."

"Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System," a Federal Reserve spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, commonly known as the Fed Board, is composed of seven members, or governors, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. 

A LOOK AT THE UNFOLDING BATTLE BETWEEN TRUMP AND POWELL OVER FED POLICY

Cook's potential removal from the Fed Board leaves a seat open on the panel that guides the nation's monetary policy. This gives Trump another opportunity to name someone closely aligned with his financial policy to the Fed.

When asked about replacing Cook on the Fed Board, Trump told reporters at the White House that he has some "very good people for that position."

Trump accused Cook — who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors — of mortgage fraud on Monday evening. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.

The allegations stem from Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to an agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte accused Cook of claiming two primary residences, one in Ann Arbor and another in Atlanta in 2021, with the goal of getting better mortgage terms.

'SOME AUTHORITARIAN S***:' DEMS RIP TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED FIRING OF FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK

On Aug. 15, Pulte sent the Justice Department a criminal referral regarding Cook in which he accused her of falsifying bank documents and property records.

As it stands, Trump says Cook is fired, effective immediately. But Cook and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argue that he has no legal authority to remove her. Her term on the Fed Board runs until January 2038.

"President Trump has taken to social media to once again ‘fire by tweet' and once again his reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority," Lowell said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.

"We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action," Lowell added.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump seemingly caught his loyal conservative base off-guard and sparked backlash by saying he would allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities.

That would be a departure for the Trump administration after it added new vetting for student visas, moved to block foreign enrollment at Harvard and expanded the grounds for terminating international students' ability to study in the United States. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has singled out China, the second highest source of international students in the U.S., saying in May that the State Department would revoke visas for students tied to the Chinese Communist Party and boost vetting of new applicants.

Trump's announcement Monday adds to the confusion about the administration's restrictive visa policies and its approach to China as the superpowers tussle over trade and intensifying tech competition. It also marks another divide with figures in Trump's “Make America Great Again” base, who tout an “America First” agenda and had contested the U.S. inserting itself in the recent Israel-Iran war. 

Some of Trump's most ardent supporters — from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to former adviser Steve Bannon and far-right activist Laura Loomer — rejected the idea of welcoming more Chinese students.

It's not immediately clear why the figure Trump cited was so high — more than twice the number of Chinese students enrolled in the 2023-2024 school year. The total also has been falling in the past few years. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Here's what to know about Trump's announcement and the reaction:




During a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump was asked by reporters if he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“President Xi would like me to come to China. It's a very important relationship. As you know, we are taking a lot of money in from China because of the tariffs and different things,” he said. “I hear so many stories about ‘We are not going to allow their students,' but we are going to allow their students to come in. We are going to allow it. It's very important — 600,000 students.”

Trump doubled down at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, sitting next to Rubio, where he said he was “honored” to have Chinese students in the U.S. and said they help colleges stay afloat.

“I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here,” Trump said. “Now, with that, we check and we're careful, we see who is there.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry also said that Trump told Xi in a June phone call that “the U.S. loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.”

It was a shift after the State Department announced in late May that it would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections with the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”

After decades of growth, the number of Chinese students in the U.S. peaked at 372,532 in the 2019-2020 academic year, just as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. The number slipped to 289,526 in 2022 and further dipped to 277,398 in 2023. 

In the past year, several U.S. universities, including the University of Michigan, have ended their joint partnerships with Chinese universities after Republicans raised concerns that U.S. dollars have contributed to China's tech advancement and military modernization.

Experts say the number of students is likely to fall further because of tense U.S.-China relations and China's declining population.

There's growing bipartisan consensus that U.S. schools should not help train Beijing's top talent in critical fields such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and aerospace technology.

Kurt Campbell, deputy secretary of state in the Biden administration, has said he would like to see Chinese students coming to the U.S. to study humanities and social sciences, “not particle physics.”

During his first term, Trump banned Chinese graduate students who had attended schools with Chinese military ties.

Bannon, one of Trump's former advisers, criticized the announcement Tuesday, saying “there should be no foreign students here for the moment.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was asked Monday on Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle” how such a shift would be consistent with Trump's “America First” push. Lutnick argued that Trump was taking a “rational economic view” and asserted that 15% of American universities and colleges would go out of business without those foreign students.

“I just don't understand it for the life of me. Those are 600,000 spots that American kids won't get,” host Laura Ingraham said. 

At Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Trump said international students are helping keep some U.S. schools afloat.

“And you know what would happen if they didn't (come)? Our college system would go to hell very quickly and it wouldn't be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle on the bottom,” Trump said.

An analysis by NAFSA, an association of international educators, found that international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 jobs during the 2023-2024 academic year.

Greene, the Republican congresswoman from Georgia, raised questions. 

“If refusing to allow these Chinese students to attend our schools causes 15% of them to fail then these schools should fail anyways because they are being propped up by the CCP,” Greene said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. 

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The foreign ministry has called out the U.S. for what it says is “discriminatory, politically driven and selective law enforcement” against Chinese students arriving in the U.S.

Mao Ning, a ministry spokesperson, said Friday that students have been treated unfairly and subjected to extended interrogations. Mao said some students had their visas revoked and were banned from entering the country after they were told they “might endanger national security.”

“The U.S.'s moves severely violate the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese nationals, impede the flow of people between the two countries and dampen China-U.S. people-to-people exchanges,” she said.

The embassy issued an advisory Monday urging Chinese students not to enter the U.S. through Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, alleging several students were harassed and interrogated by customs officials. The embassy said at least one student was detained for more than 80 hours before being sent back to China.

Live Updates


• Trump's crime crackdown: President Donald Trump said his administration will seek the death penalty in murder cases in Washington, DC. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has warned the president to stay out of Chicago — which is likely the next city in the president's sights — as Trump issued an executive order establishing “specialized units” in the National Guard that will be “equipped to deal with public order issues.”
    


• Fed in the crosshairs: Meanwhile, Trump said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing on Monday, was not “100% above board.” Cook has refused to resign, setting up a potential showdown. Her attorney announced he is filing a lawsuit challenging the president's action.
    


            President Donald Trump said he is considering a longer term for White House economist Stephen Miran on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors and that he soon expected to have “a majority” at the Fed.
    


            Trump earlier this month nominated Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacancy left by former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler after she resigned.
    


            Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, would finish a term slated to end January 31, 2026.
    


                    “We just put a very good man in one position. We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said today during a presidential Cabinet meeting, but he did not specify what he meant by “the other.“We'll have a majority very shortly. So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great,” he said.
                





            However, Trump currently is attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whose term expires in 2038. Cook's attorney said today she plans to fight the dismissal in court.
    


            The Fed Board of Governors includes seven positions. Two current governors have said they would like to cut interest rates, and Miran has signaled he also thinks rates are too high.Trump has complained for months that the Fed has kept interest rates too high
    


            President Donald Trump floated the idea today of sending Americans tariff rebate checks, an idea that his own treasury secretary has suggested the White House is unlikely to do.
    


                    There was a concept of “making a dividend to the people in this country who have had to suffer through stupid leadership, and they paid a lot of taxes and they got nothing for it,” the president said.“Primarily we want to pay down debt, but there's a possibility that we take a piece of it and pay some, make a dividend,” he  said.
                





            Some lawmakers have proposed using tariff revenue to send rebate checks of at least $600 per adult and dependent child. A family of four could end up with around $2,400 from the federal government.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has thrown cold water on the idea, including earlier this month during an interview on CNBC, saying in part that the revenue generated from new tariffs will go toward paying the national debt.
    


            “I think, at a point, we're going to be able to do it,” he said, noting how S&P Global on Monday affirmed its AA+ credit rating on the United States. “But President [Donald] Trump and I are laser-focused on paying down the debt.”
    


            CNN's Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.
    


            President Donald Trump today said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing yesterday, was not “100% above board.”
    


                    “She seems to have had an infraction, and she can't have an infraction, especially that infraction, because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting. “And we need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn't seem like she was.”
                





            Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud over two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence in the same year. Cook has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing.
    


            In a letter posted on social media late yesterday, Trump said he has determined there is enough cause to fire Cook, citing the mortgage fraud allegations.
    


            But the legality of Trump's attempt to remove Cook remains unsettled.
    


            Earlier today, Cook's personal attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced he is filing a lawsuit challenging Trump's firing of Cook.
    


            President Donald Trump renewed his threat to impose heavy economic penalties on Russia if it refuses to halt its war against Ukraine — but did not set any fresh timetable for following through.
    


            “It will not be a world war but it will be an economic war,” Trump said on Tuesday of the actions that he may eventually take. “It's going to be bad for Russia.”
    


            But he quickly added that he didn't want to impose new sanctions or tariffs aimed at hurting the Russian economy, expressing hope that there was still a path toward brokering a deal to end the war.
    


            Trump also again suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bore some blame for the conflict, calling him “not exactly innocent either,” and brushed off Russia's recent signals that it wouldn't sign a peace deal with Zelensky.
    


            “Doesn't matter what they say,” he said. “Everybody's posturing. It's all bullshit.”
    


            Trump has repeatedly threatened to ramp up economic pressure on Russia over the prolonged war, but has yet to take significant action, repeatedly extending his two-week deadlines for Putin.
    


            “The one that I thought would be the easiest is turning out to be the hardest,” Trump said Tuesday of the war in Ukraine. “But I think I'll get it done.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he would like to send National Guard troops to New York if Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants it.
    


            “I get along with Kathy. If she'd like to do that, I would do it,” he said during a White House Cabinet meeting when a reporter asked him about the prospect.
    


            “New York has difficulty,” he said. “I want to make this like, friendly. But the places we're talking about happen to be virtually all Democrat-run.”
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to back off his administration's plans to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” a move that, he says, comes as US relations with China have improved.
    


            In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of visas for Chinese students, an escalation of tensions with Beijing and a blow to American higher education institutions. The plan was met with strong opposition from China at the time.
    


            But today, the president appeared to reverse course: “We're getting along very well with China, and I'm getting along very well with President Xi. I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here.”
    


                    He continued: “I like that their students come here. I like that other countries' students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.”
                





            Trump said he told China's President Xi Jinping that he is “honored” to have Chinese students in the US.
    


            China is the country of origin for almost of a quarter of international students in US higher education, and Chinese and other international students account for a significant source of revenue for colleges and universities.
    


            “We check and we're careful and we see who's there, and Marco wants that — we spoke, we're in the same position,” he said, referring to Rubio.
    


            Trump appeared to explain that the apparent reversal was the result of improving US-China relations: “We're just getting along very well with China. It's a different relationship than we had. … They respect us again. I respect them. The relationship is very good.”
    


            President Donald Trump backed off his assertion that there would be a “conclusive” end to the war in Gaza in the next few weeks, clarifying remarks he had made just a day earlier.
    


            “There's no conclusive. It's been going on for a long time,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with his cabinet today.
    


            Yesterday, Trump said he thought that “within the next two to three weeks, you're going to have pretty good, conclusive — a conclusive ending.”
    


            Walking back that specific wording, Trump today added that conflict in the region goes back “thousands of years.”
    


            “There's nothing conclusive, but hopefully we're going to have things solved very quickly with regard to Gaza and also with regard to Ukraine and Russia,” the president added.
    


The landscape of the war: The American president's claims that the war will end soon comes as Israel is facing global condemnation after an attack on a Gaza hospital killed 20 people, including five journalists and medical workers.
    


            Meanwhile, Hamas said it has agreed to a new Gaza ceasefire proposal as mediators push to renew talks ahead of a major Israeli assault on Gaza City.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday upon hearing the news of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce's engagement that “I wish them a lot of luck.”
    


            “I think he's a great player. I think he's a great guy, and I think that she's a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck,” the president said during a lengthy Cabinet meeting.
    


            The president, as recently as August 4, has criticized Swift on social media, including claiming she was “NO LONGER HOT” and was “Woke” while praising actress Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle jeans ad.
    


            Swift endorsed Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, following the only debate between Trump and Harris last year. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by JD Vance, Trump's running mate, to criticize Democrats.
    


            Asked about the endorsement on Fox News in the days following, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”
    


            Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in an Instagram post Tuesday afternoon, with a caption reading, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”
    


            Indiana Republican Sen. Todd Young told reporters today that he doesn't know if President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is legal.
    


            “It's breaking new ground, but I don't know whether the law allows it or not. I haven't studied that law,” he said.
    


            Cook's lawyer announced today that he is filing a lawsuit to challenge her removal, and said Trump “has no authority” to fire her.
    


            Meanwhile, North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs the House Republican campaign arm, said, “I'm not a lawyer. But the president is the chief of the executive branch.”
    


            Top Democrats have condemned Trump's attempt to fire Cook, with some saying the move is illegal.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent deemed the independence of the Federal Reserve a “political arrangement” a day after President Donald Trump moved to fire a member of the Fed's board, suggesting Trump was working to restore trust in the central bank.
    


            “You have the overwhelming mandate from the American people. You're restoring confidence in government,” Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House.
    


            Noting the Fed was “on the front of everyone's mind,” Bessent argued the institution relied on trust from the US populace.
    


                    “The Federal Reserve's independence comes from a political arrangement between itself and the American public,” he said. “Having the public's trust is the only thing that gives it credibility, and you sir, are restoring trust to government.”
                





            He didn't mention Lisa Cook, the Fed board member who Trump said he was dismissing yesterday evening, citing allegations of mortgage fraud.
    


            Many legal experts and economists have questioned the move, saying it could undermine faith in the bank's independence from political interference.
    


            President Donald Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in murder cases in Washington, DC.
    


            “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital, capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty,” the president said during a meeting with Cabinet members today.
    


            He said it's a “very strong preventative” measure. “I don't know if we're ready for it in this country … we have no choice,” Trump said.
    


            He said the measure will be implemented in Washington, DC, while “states are going to have to make their own decision.”
    


            It was not immediately clear how Trump's edict would work. Washington, DC, does not have the death penalty, but the federal government does. Unlike in other places, prosecutors — even those who handle local murder cases in DC Superior Court — work for the federally appointed US Attorney.
    


            President Donald Trump called for Harvard University to pay a sweeping $500 million settlement to restore its federal funding, saying the elite university has been “very bad.”
    


            “We want nothing less than $500 million from Harvard. Don't negotiate, Linda,” Trump said to Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
    


            He continued, “They've been very bad. Don't negotiate.”
    


            Harvard is one of the Trump administration's biggest targets, and an agreement between the two parties has so far proven elusive.
    


            The administration has argued it's cracking down on antisemitism on campus amid the Israel-Hamas war. But Harvard, the only school to take on the White House directly in court, has become the epicenter of a broader clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight — and a belief inside the White House that targeting the country's most elite academic institutions is a winning political issue for the president.
    


            Trump's comments come as a federal judge is expected to soon rule in the school's funding case against the Trump administration. Harvard had asked for an expedited final decision from US District Judge Allison Burroughs before September 3, which the school said was the first date it would be required to submit paperwork to close out grant funding.
    


            The administration has previously reached agreements with fellow Ivy League institutions Columbia University and Brown University.
    


            President Donald Trump ratcheted up his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore Tuesday as he publicly declined the Democratic governor's offer to walk the streets of Baltimore and called the Charm City a “hellhole.”
    


            In remarks last week, Moore, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, encouraged Trump to walk around Baltimore with him and see the city's efforts to curb crime, saying he would see “one of the greatest cities in the United States of America.”
    


            Trump has named Baltimore among the cities where federal forces could be used to crack down on crime, similar to his efforts to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC.
    


            Trump told reporters in the Cabinet Room on Tuesday that Moore “refuses to admit his problems.”
    


                    “Wes Moore was telling me he wants — ‘I want to walk with the president.' Well, I said, ‘I want to walk with you too someday, but first you got to clean up your crime, because I'm not walking. I'm not walking in Baltimore right now — Baltimore is a hellhole,'” Trump said.
                





            Moore has tweaked Trump on social media since initially extending the offer, saying in a post Sunday that “President Bone Spurs will do anything to get out of walking” and offering to “get you a golf cart if that makes things easier.” In turn, Trump has threatened to “rethink” federal funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge that collapsed last year.
    


            According to the Baltimore Police Department, the homicide rate has decreased 22% compared to this time last year.
    


            President Donald Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio during today's Cabinet meeting — but not without making a playful jab at the Florida Republican's political future.
    


                    “Marco has been really, I think you're born for this job,” Trump said. “I don't think you should ever run for another office,” he added.
                





            “You're so good at this. He is so good. And everybody likes him. Everybody likes him but everybody — much more importantly than like, I think you would say, is respect — they respect Marco,” the president continued.
    


            His comments come weeks after he suggested Vice President JD Vance is the “most likely” heir apparent to the Make America Great Again movement, while proposing that Vance and Rubio join for a future GOP ticket.
    


            “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” Trump said at the time, while appearing with some other members of his Cabinet. “I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Tuesday he's no longer going to refer to his domestic policy law as the “big, beautiful” bill, acknowledging the need to better message it to voters who remain deeply skeptical of the signature legislation.
    


            “I'm not going to use the term great, big beautiful,” Trump said. “That was good for getting it approved, but it's not good for explaining to people what it's all about.”
    


            The president added that he instead wants to focus on the tax cuts in the law, in line with broader administration efforts to rebrand the wide-ranging legislation as primarily delivering a middle-class tax cut.
    


            White House officials, seeking to bolster support for the law, have recently sought to emphasize the slice of tax provisions that poll the best with voters, including an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime and deeper tax cuts for some individuals.
    


            But until now, Trump had resisted shifting away from his focus on the law's size and scope, boasting about passing a multitrillion-dollar package so large that there's “something for everything” in it.
    


            President Donald Trump is currently hosting a meeting with his Cabinet.
    


            It comes after the president fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and as he has been looking to take his crackdown on crime to a national level.
    


            We'll bring you the latest updates as it happens.
    


            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced he is filing a lawsuit to challenge President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her yesterday evening.
    


                    “President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,” he said in a statement sent to CNN.
                





            The announcement comes hours after Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire her.

            Trump administration officials are planning to meet with a senior Chinese trade negotiator this week — but there's little expectation it will yield a breakthrough in ending the nations' trade standoff.
    


            The negotiator, Li Chenggang, is expected to meet with deputy-level administration officials during his visit to Washington, a US government spokesperson told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the meeting.
    


            But the sit-down is not a formal negotiating session, and administration officials are skeptical that it will accomplish much. Chenggang was not invited by US officials and instead sought out the meeting on his own, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


Criticism of Trump's trade policies: His arrival comes just days after China's ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, criticized Trump's trade policies in a speech at a soybean industry event for “casting a shadow over China-U.S. agricultural cooperation,” according to a transcript published by the Chinese Embassy.
    


            The remarks have ratcheted up tensions over agricultural issues at the center of the trade dispute, further complicating efforts by the two sides to find a permanent resolution.
    


            Trump earlier this year launched a trade war against China, threatening to slap tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese imports before agreeing to hold off on most of the levies while the two sides negotiated.
    


            The US and China have since held three formal negotiating sessions, with Trump agreeing earlier this month to extend the trade truce until November to give them more time to strike a deal. Still, major points of contention remain: Trump has demanded that China purchase significantly more US soybeans, and yesterday threatened to sharply escalate tariffs if the nation decides to once again curb exports of rare-earth magnets.
    


            The Department of Transportation is threatening to pull federal funding to California, New Mexico and Washington if the states don't comply with a requirement of English language proficiency of all commercial motor vehicle drivers.
    


            The three states must comply within 30 days, or the DOT will hold “up to 100%” of the state's funding from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. According to a fiscal 2024 funding estimate, California receives approximately over $30 million in federal funding, New Mexico receives over $6 million and Washington receives over $9 million.
    


            “This is a safety issue — making sure drivers of very heavy 80,000-pound rigs can speak the language is truly a critical safety issue,” Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news conference today.
    


            CNN has reached out to each state's respective DOT for comment.
    


Florida incident: The DOT's double down on an order Duffy signed with the requirements in May comes after a truck driver in Florida was accused of making an illegal U-turn that killed three people.
    


            The fatal incident sparked a clash between US Department of Homeland Security and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over Harjinder Singh, a native of India, obtaining a work permit and driver's license in the state. The Trump administration says Singh was in the US illegally.
    


            Singh had an association with all three states that Duffy threatened. He had a CDL from Washington and California, and had been previously pulled over in New Mexico, according to the secretary.
    


            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that embattled Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook — who has vowed not to leave her post after President Donald Trump sought to fire her yesterday — doesn't deserve to be at the central bank and should just “go away.”
    


            Trump announced yesterday that he removed Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. The action, which marked a significant escalation of its attacks on the Fed, was highly unprecedented.
    


            Cook, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said yesterday that Trump “has no authority” to fire her and that she will not resign.
    


            A CNN review of mortgage documents shows that Cook took out mortgages for two properties, both of which were listed as her principal residence. However, it's not known why she did so or if she did so intentionally.
    


            Lutnick, during an interview on CNBC's “Squawk Box,” said that Cook should leave her role.
    


                    “A governor of the Federal Reserve literally signs her name and commits mortgage fraud, and she says I'm not going anywhere,” Lutnick said, alleging fraud. “Well, the crook always says I'm not going anywhere. Why would anyone defend that?”
                





            Cook has not been charged with any crimes or wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in her post.
    


            Lutnick said if Cook did commit mortgage fraud, she should no longer serve as a Fed governor.
    


            He added: “This woman should go away if she's committed mortgage fraud, and those signatures sure as hell look like hers.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — JB Pritzker took a water taxi along the Chicago Riverwalk, past one of Donald Trump's famous downtown towers. The gleaming and heavily trafficked tourist district was a deliberate backdrop on the day the Illinois governor directed a defiant message toward the White House: “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here.”

The governor's protests, however, may not matter. After Trump's National Guard deployments to Los Angeles in June and Washington, D.C. this month, the Republican says his next targets for federal intervention may be two of the nation's most Democratic cities: Chicago and Baltimore.

Trump's possible move — targeting states whose governors are among potential White House contenders in 2028 — would be another escalation of presidential power, directly challenging the rights of states and cities to govern themselves. It also would intensify a partisan scramble for voters' trust on matters of public safety.

For Trump, militarizing U.S. streets is the latest tactic to support his “law and order” branding and mass deportation agenda. It's a way to cast Democratic leaders in affected locales as weak and ineffective, even as Trump exaggerates the violence he's ostensibly trying to stop. Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying ‘Can you send over the troops please?'” Trump said Tuesday at the White House. “It's out of control.”

Democrats see a dangerous overreach by an aspiring authoritarian and have said they will challenge Trump in court if necessary. They also see in the political fight a way to persuade voters, especially moderates and independents, that Republicans bluster on crime while Democrats are better able to protect citizens and keep the peace. 




“This is not about fighting crime,” said Pritzker, flanked on Monday by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other leaders, adding that it's more about “an arrogant little man” trying to “intimidate his political rivals.”

Yet there are risks for Democrats. Though violent crime is down across the country, including Chicago, arguing over how to combat what's still happening means tussling on some of Trump's most comfortable political turf. Additionally, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to block federal money for locales where elected officials have opposed him.

Pritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026, has been among Democrats ' most vocal Trump critics. Weeks into Trump's second administration, Pritzker compared it to the Nazi Third Reich. More recently, he welcomed Texas Democrats who fled the statehouse in Austin to delay Republicans' partisan redrawing of the state's congressional districts at Trump's request.

In Chicago on Monday, Pritzker and Johnson emphasized that Trump's administration had not reached out about its plans, first detailed in a weekend Washington Post story. The president acknowledged he hadn't talked to Illinois or Maryland officials and at one point Monday said he might not send troops unless Pritzker asked.

Pritzker's aides said his priority is to keep a federal deployment from happening. That's why Pritzker and his staff hustled to gather a cross-section of political, civic and faith leadership in a made-for-TV show of unity that Trump would surely see. Of course, it also trained cameras on Pritzker.

“I know he doesn't read ... but I know he watches television,” he said of Trump. “And so perhaps if somebody from Fox News or from Newsmax is here, they'll cover the fact that Chicago is in much better shape” because of what local officials are doing. 

In a bit of Trumpian bravado, he added, “If you hurt my people, nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.”

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, another potential Democratic contender in 2028, said Trump's characterizations of Baltimore and other cities reflect a president “living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes.”

Nonetheless, voters have been siding with Republicans on the issue.

A CNN/SSRS poll from May found that about four in ten Americans said the GOP's views on crime and policing aligned more with their own, compared to just three in ten who felt the same about Democrats. The rest said neither party reflected their views.

Trump also had an advantage on the issue over Democrat Kamala Harris in their 2024 general election matchup. According to AP VoteCast, a national survey of presidential voters, about half of respondents said Trump was better able to handle crime, while about 4 in 10 said this about Harris.

Democrats acknowledged the gap this week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times the amount of money on crime-related ads than Democrats did in recent presidential election years. 

But they said there is an opening. They urged Democrats not to mimic Republican “tough-on-crime” rhetoric but instead position themselves as being “serious about safety, not empty scare tactics.”

Pritzker aides agreed Democrats have a chance to emphasize public safety policy choices.

A litany of speakers in Chicago cited drops – some of them considerable -- in violent crime and property crimes in the city. They also highlighted the hundreds of millions of dollars in Trump administration cuts in federal support for law enforcement, housing and other programs that Johnson called “proven solutions to crime and violence reduction.”

“We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence,” the mayor said.

The debate also raises questions about where Trump has not called for federal intervention.

Trump, as a candidate, regularly assailed U.S. cities – not just Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington. Detroit was “decimated” and “filthy.” Atlanta was a “killing field.” Pritzker noted that Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, have notably higher murder rates than Chicago.

But Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia all have Republican governors. Michigan, meanwhile, is home to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, but one who has deviated from her colleagues like Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom by engaging more directly with Trump, including in-person visits to the White House. 

And even one leading Republican executive, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, added tacit support to Democrats' critiques. 

“Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,” he said in a statement, without mentioning Trump by name. “America's mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results. Local control is always best.”

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explains the rationale for President Donald Trump's deal with Intel and a 'very important' part of his deal with China on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump's plan to allow 600,000 Chinese student visas to be issued sparked backlash from the right on Monday and Tuesday.

"I hear so many stories that we're not going to allow their students," Trump told reporters as trade talks with China are ongoing.

"We're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. It's very important. But we're going to get along with China," he continued.

Trump expanded on his comments during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday.

"I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here because they'll go out and start building schools and they'll be able to survive it. But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries' students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system," Trump said.

"I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check in with careful and we see who's there," he added.

Some immigration groups and conservative voices on social media voiced their opposition to the proposal.

"We should not let in 600,000 CHINESE students to attend American colleges and universities that may be loyal to the CCP," Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., posted on X late Monday night. "If refusing to allow these Chinese students to attend our schools causes 15% of them to fail then these schools should fail anyways because they are being propped up by the CCP."

"Granting 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals threatens to put foreign students ahead of U.S. graduates," Joe Chatham, director of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

"The focus now must be on reforms to limit access to sectors crucial to our economy and national security that have repeatedly been the target of corporate espionage and intellectual property theft—not expanding access to hostile countries. Educating foreign nationals should never be put before the interests of U.S. citizens and ensuring that our nation thrives," he continued.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick delved further into the Trump administration's view on the matter when pressed on "The Ingraham Angle."

"The president's point of view is that what would happen if you didn't have those 600K students is that you'd empty them from the top, all the students would go up to better schools, and the bottom 15% of universities and colleges would go out of business in America."

"He's taking a rational economic view, which is classic Donald Trump," Lutnick added.

Many suggested that the free market should come into play with these colleges that could be at a potential financial risk.

"Let them go under, then! What is this madness? NO. WE DON'T WANT MORE CHINESE STUDENTS. We actually don't want any," conservative commentator Kira Davis wrote.

"15% going under isn't a bad thing," writer Ryan Girdusky posted to X.

"Trump's team is not capable of defending his Chinese student visa program," conservative lawyer Marina Medvin posted on X. "That's because they don't actually want it either. It's hard to sell something you don't like."

"So this is essentially a subsidy for academia. Got it. American universities shouldn't need an influx of foreign students in order to stay afloat. If they can't survive on American enrollment, then let them go under. Plus, Chinese students steal our research and send it home," Josh Peterson, a full stack developer and investigative journalist, posted.

Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler unleashed on the Trump White House, saying these Chinese students should be banned.

"Chinese 'students' are all spies for the Chinese Communist Party. They're forced to be. They steal our intellectual property. They steal our tech. They steal our intel. They cozy up to our military," Wheeler posted on X. "Trump should ban all Chinese students from U.S. universities. Deport them all."

"This is the dumbest explanation I've heard. By all means, put colleges & universities out of business!" Wheeler said in response to Lutnick's defense of Trump's policy. "Their business is indoctrinating students into hardened revolutionary Marxists. If you want to save America, you'll have to raze the university system. Perfect chance to start."

Others agreed with Lutnick's perspective on the issue, saying that it could actually help the United States bring in more talent domestically. 

"This is not as horrible as people are making it out to be. Chinese students on U.S. visas aren't average kids. They represent the top tier of China's youth," podcast host Joshua Reid posted to X.

"On the other side, we are hosting China's future leaders, scientists, and innovators. Which also means that American culture returns home with them. When you start to think about emergent tech, this is actually a great idea. Bring the top level students over the US. This is talent that is pulled away from China and now becomes a national asset," Reid added.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered a fiery rebuke of President Trump's reported plan to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago

The White House fired back at the barrage of criticism from Illinois Democrats over President Donald Trump's threat to send U.S. troops to Chicago. 

"If these Democrats spent half as much time addressing crime in their cities as they did going on cable news to complain about President Trump, their residents would be a lot safer," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. 

During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump himself confirmed that he's "willing to go to Chicago, which is in big trouble," adding that Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., considered a likely 2028 presidential hopeful, "refuses to admit that he has problems – huge problems."

Pritzker and his fellow Illinois Democrats – Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Attorney General Kwame Raoul – railed against Trump as a "wannabe dictator" on Monday as the White House weighs deploying the U.S. National Guard to Chicago.

"Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish its dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is – a dangerous power grab," Pritzker said.

Pritzker called the potential move "exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against."

"What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American," he added. 

When reached for comment regarding Pritzker's criticism, the White House shared a fact sheet on Chicago crime, which includes local reporting that indicates, for the past 13 years, Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city.

It also includes FOX 32's report that more illegal guns are recovered in Chicago than in Los Angeles or New York City combined. 

The City of Chicago is pushing back with its own fact sheet, arguing Johnson's primary focus has been "driving down violent crime in Chicago" during his first two years as mayor. 

"In the first six months of this year, Chicago has seen a 33% reduction in homicides and a 38% reduction in shootings," the mayor's office said, citing year-to-date crime statistics. 

Johnson also highlighted a "citywide homicide clearance rate of 77.4%," which his office said is "the highest in more than a decade," as the mayor emphasizes mental health and a "holistic approach to community safety."

"It's very safe right now," Trump said of Washington, D.C., during his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 

For nearly two weeks, Trump has carried out a crackdown on crime in Washington, mobilizing more than 2,200 National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the nation's capital.

"It's going to get so good that this will be the safest capital there is. It'll be one of the safest places in our nation anywhere," Trump told his Cabinet, adding that "12 days ago, it was the most unsafe place in our nation."

Trump has floated deploying troops to other U.S. cities as well, including Baltimore, Md., where he was met with criticism by another potential 2028 presidential contender, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.

A Ukrainian woman who came to the U.S. to escape war in her native country was stabbed to death in Charlotte on Friday, police said.

The victim was identified by authorities as 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska.

As news of her tragic death spread, a GoFundMe campaign was also launched to help Zarutska's relatives cope and has so far raised over $12,000.

"Dear friends, our Valeria has suffered a terrible tragedy," the fundraiser reads.

"Yesterday, her niece Ira, who was 22 years old, was killed. Ira had recently arrived in the United States, seeking safety from the war and hoping for a new beginning. Tragically, her life was cut short far too soon. This is an irreparable loss for her family."

The fundraiser, reportedly created on behalf of Zarutska's Ukrainian aunt Valeria, has also drawn support from the local community. 

Organizers said any donations or shares of the campaign "will mean so much."

The killing happened at the busy East/West Boulevard light rail station near Camden Road in South End. 

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police said Zarutska was stabbed around 10:30 p.m. When officers arrived and found her, she died at the scene. 

An image showed police tape around the platform and a train at the East/West Boulevard rail station.

Decarlos Brown, 34, was arrested shortly after the incident and hospitalized before being charged with first-degree murder. Police have not released details about what led to the stabbing.

Court records, obtained by The New York Post, show Brown has a history of arrests dating back to 2011, including charges of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats. Most charges were later dropped.

Zarutska's death has renewed calls for action on public safety in Charlotte. Members of the Charlotte City Council expressed concern Monday about violence on the city's transit system.

President Donald Trump speaks from the White House about the potential for his crime crackdown to extend to Chicago, while taking aim at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

A weekend fire that destroyed a Baltimore school playground has reignited a broader fight over how Maryland should respond to youth crime.

Two suspects, ages 12 and 13, were arrested in connection to the fire, which reportedly caused more than $100,000 in damage, WBFF reported. Images posted on Facebook by the Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57 show flames towering over a charred play structure.

While the arson case alarmed parents and neighbors, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore defended the state's strategy and pointed to falling violence statewide.

President Donald Trump, by contrast, said Sunday that he would send the National Guard to Baltimore to "quickly clean up the crime" if Moore asked for help. Moore has rejected calls to consider deploying the National Guard to assist local police, though.

Moore had earlier invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in the crime-ridden city in September, saying in an Aug. 21 letter that the event would provide an opportunity to "discuss strategies for effective public safety policy."

Appearing on CBS News' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Moore claimed that under his leadership, Maryland has seen one of the fastest drops in violent crime in the nation.

"The results have been incredibly encouraging," Moore said. "Maryland has had among the fastest drops of violent crime than anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate is down over 20% since I have been the governor. The last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet."

On city streets, some have said the numbers don't capture daily reality.

"Juvenile crime is out of whack," he told WBFF, arguing that repeat offenders are too often returned to the streets. "They need to put them kids, especially repeat offenders, they need to lock them up," he said, adding that parents should face charges in some cases.

A young mother pushing a stroller shared similar fears. Crime in Baltimore "is very hectic," she told the outlet. "It's very scary, especially for the new generation and a new mom… It's very alarming to raise your kids here."

Even as official numbers show a dip in crime, Republican lawmakers have said the stats don't tell the full story. Maryland Senate Minority Leader Justin Ready, a Republican, told the outlet that complaints about youth crime are still pouring into his office.

"Just over the weekend, in Baltimore, there was a terrible incident with a playground where (juveniles) set fire to it," Ready said. "Local law enforcement is continuing to tell us, ‘We're still not getting young people who are picked up repeatedly getting the help and treatment of DJS.'"

Moore's newly appointed Department of Juvenile Services secretary, Betsy Fox Tolentino, acknowledged the public's frustration but insisted progress is being made.

"I think everyone's concerns are valid concerns," Tolentino told the outlet. "We have made a lot of progress, especially in Baltimore, in driving down violent crime, and that includes juvenile crime. But until every person feels safe, and the community has trust and confidence in the department, we certainly have work to do."

Moore's communications director, David Turner, doubled down late Monday, saying that "public safety remains the governor's top priority," and that the administration continues to work with state and local partners to increase accountability.

"As Maryland's chief executive, there is no higher priority than public safety. Though juvenile crime numbers across Maryland continue to drop, we will continue to work in partnership with the general assembly, state's attorneys, local leaders, and advocates to promote accountability for criminal acts and take swift action to keep our communities safe," Moore's office shared in a statement with Fox News Digital.

Moore's office told Fox News Digital that the state's programs are working and there have been "encouraging results." 

"But the work is not done," his office said. "One person who doesn't feel safe in their community is too many and Governor Moore will continue his all-of-the-above approach to public safety to make our communities safer and hold violent offenders accountable.

Community leaders have begun organizing to rebuild the school playground.

"Today was a tough day. My heart is heavy, and I'm feeling so many emotions right now," Kendra Summers commented on a Facebook post of the damage shared by Baltimore City Fire Department's Engine 57. "Our school playground, a space that has meant so much to our students, families, and staff, was destroyed by arson. It's hard to process, especially with the first day of school just around the corner on Monday."

Summers said despite the fire, she was "choosing to focus on the good" and reminisce on the journey of the playground's construction, which took place in May 2019. 

"This community is resilient, and while today's events are heartbreaking, I know we will rise above them. We will rebuild, and we will continue to grow," she added. 

The fire department also encouraged the community to come together to help rebuild the playground.

BANDON, Oregon (AP) — The owner of an Oregon zoo has been indicted on more than 300 counts of animal neglect and other charges after police said they found drugs and guns at the facility.

Brian Tenney, the owner of West Coast Game Park Safari in Bandon, was arraigned on Monday. Tenney's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a phone number associated with the zoo did not have voicemail set up. Tenney has not yet had the opportunity to enter a plea.

Oregon State Police announced earlier this year that authorities served several search warrants at the zoo near the southern Oregon coast in May, following an investigation that included inquiries into the animals' welfare. Police said they found methamphetamine, dozens of firearms, cocaine and large amounts of cash. 

More than 300 animals were relocated to animal sanctuaries or rescue facilities, and a camel, chicken and kinkajou were euthanized after being evaluated by veterinarians. 

A grand jury indicted Tenney on 371 charges — including 327 felonies — on Aug. 19, according to state court records.

A federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump has tossed a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against every judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland over a blanket order slowing deportations.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday dismissed a June lawsuit filed against the judges over a standing order from the judicial district's chief judge, George Russell, which automatically granted a two-day pause on deporting illegal immigrants if they file a habeas corpus petition challenging their detention.

Cullen sided with the judges in tossing the case, arguing in the ruling that allowing the lawsuit to proceed “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution's framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign. That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another's authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary's constitutional role,” Cullen wrote, calling the lawsuit “not ordinary.”

The Justice Department, in the lawsuit it filed in June against all of the judges in the judicial district, which only includes one Trump appointee, claimed the standing order was unlawfully interfering in the executive branch's business.

“Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect. In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch,” the DOJ said in its lawsuit.

Lawyers for the federal judges in Maryland argued the lawsuit was “unprecedented” and “fundamentally incompatible with the separation of powers.”

Cullen said in his ruling that the DOJ “must find a proper way to raise” its concerns, and suggested appealing the standing order in a habeas proceeding to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, among other options to challenge the standing order.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, where the challenged order remains in place, has been the venue for multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration, as the left-leaning bench has become a popular place for opponents of the administration to bring their legal challenges.

WHAT IS NEXT FOR ABREGO GARCIA AFTER BEING DETAINED BY ICE

One of the most high-profile cases the Trump administration has fought in the Maryland judicial district was filed by illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia over his deportation.

The latest volley fired in that legal battle, filed Monday, challenges the Salvadoran national's deportation to Uganda via a habeas corpus petition. Because of the standing order in the judicial district, his deportation was automatically paused until at least Wednesday, but a judge indefinitely halted his deportation pending the scheduling of an evidentiary hearing in the case.

Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness.

The six Republican justices have largely behaved as lickspittles to the leader of their political party. These are, after all, the same GOP political appointees who said that President Donald Trump is allowed to commit crimes.

Last May, however, the Court did appear to draw a line in the sand and warn Trump not to cross it. In Trump v. Wilcox, a decision that otherwise endorsed the proposition that Trump can fire leaders of independent federal agencies that are supposed to enjoy a degree of job security, the Court signaled that Trump may not fire leaders of the Federal Reserve.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Admittedly, the Republican justices' explanation of why Fed leaders are protected is gibberish. The Court said that “the Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States” — whatever the hell that means.

One of the first major constitutional disputes in the United States involved a disagreement between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over whether Congress could charter a national bank. But that dispute did not raise the question of whether the president could fire bank officials.

In any event, we're about to find out if the Republican justices were serious about this rare and arbitrary limit they placed on Trump's authority. Because Trump, being Trump, has decided to test it. Late on Monday, Trump announced that he will remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors. So Trump is doing the one thing that this Court has said he may not do.

While Cabinet secretaries and most other federal agencies' leaders serve at the pleasure of the president, the Federal Reserve is one of several agencies led by multi-member boards whose members may only be removed “for cause” by the president. This is because the Fed is supposed to make technocratic decisions about US monetary policy without being influenced by partisan politics.

If Trump controlled the Fed, or if he had the power to fire its leaders, he could order it to juice the economy at a politically beneficial time for him — even though doing so would do much greater long-term harm to the US economy.

The Republican justices, however, are all devotees of a legal theory known as the “unitary executive,” which claims that it is unconstitutional to give any federal agency leader protection from being fired by the president. In Wilcox, for example, the Court's Republicans permitted Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, two other agencies whose leaders are supposed to be protected from political firings.

Trump, for what it is worth, claims that his decision to fire Cook is legal because he is, in fact, firing her for cause. He alleges that she committed mortgage fraud by describing two separate properties as her primary residence, but this is an obvious pretext. Trump has raised similar allegations against several of his political enemies, including New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA).

It is now all but inevitable that Cook v. Trump will reach the Supreme Court after Cook sues to retain her job.

The unitary executive theory derives from a provision of the Constitution that states that “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”

In a 1988 dissenting opinion that many of the Republican justices now treat as a holy text, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that this provision “does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power” belongs to the president. And thus any federal official who wields power that is “executive” in nature must be fully accountable to the president and must serve at the president's pleasure.

Even if you accept this basic principle, the Republican justices have often applied the unitary executive theory in haphazard and ahistorical ways. In their benighted Trump immunity opinion, for example, the Republican justices claimed that “investigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive function” — and thus the president must have full control over all federal prosecutors. But the United States didn't centralize federal prosecutions in the executive branch until fairly late in its history.

As law professor Jed Shugerman explained in a 2019 essay, prosecutions initiated by private attorneys were the norm “through the mid-nineteenth century” — although the Fifth Amendment still required these private lawyers to obtain an indictment from a grand jury before a federal prosecution could proceed. Additionally, “federal judges themselves led what appeared to be prosecutions during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.” Vestiges of this old system still remain. Current law, for example, gives federal district judges the power to appoint US attorneys under some circumstances.

The Federal Reserve exception to the unitary executive that the Court announced in Wilcox is another example of the GOP justices' haphazard approach to presidential power. If “all of the executive power” must be vested in the president, then it shouldn't matter that one particular agency is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States” (again, whatever the hell that means).

All of which underscores a recurring theme from these justices: The current Court's unitary executive decisions do not appear to be a good-faith effort to interpret the Constitution; rather, it appears that they're just about power. The Republican justices want Trump to be able to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, and they don't want him to be able to fire members of the Federal Reserve. The question presented by Trump's decision to fire Cook is whether these justices will hold to that line, now that the leader of their political party seeks to erase it.

While lawyers can only palm their faces in despair at this Court's unitary executive cases, economists and investors will watch the Cook case with great interest, because the consequences of a decision permitting Trump to fire Fed leaders would be quite dire.

The Federal Reserve is supposed to maintain a very delicate balance when it raises or lowers interest rates. High interest rates strangle economic growth and depress employment, but they also reduce inflation. Low interest rates do the opposite. So, if the Fed sets those rates in the wrong place, it risks either mass unemployment or runaway inflation.

Nor do we need to imagine what could go wrong if the Fed succumbs to political pressure. In 1971, President Richard Nixon pushed Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates in advance of Nixon's reelection race — the idea was to inject cocaine into the economy at the moment when voters were weighing Nixon's economic record, and to let the pain come later. Burns complied with Nixon. The economy boomed in 1972. And Nixon won reelection in an historic landslide.

But the pain did come. Burns's action is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s.

The Fed, in other words, has the power to temporarily boost the economy at the cost of much greater economic turmoil down the road. It's not hard to imagine how presidents could abuse this power if the Supreme Court gives them control over the Fed.

So it's not hard to see why even this Supreme Court is cautious about giving Trump the power to fire Federal Reserve leaders. The Republican justices may be zealous adherents to the unitary executive theory, but they also have stock portfolios.

Still, these same justices have shown all the backbone of a jellyfish when they are asked to impose literally any limit whatsoever on Donald Trump. So it remains to be seen whether they will hold to the completely arbitrary line they drew in Wilcox.

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a Pennsylvania requirement for mail-in ballots with missing or incorrect dates to be tossed out is unconstitutional, upholding a lower district court ruling.

A panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld a March ruling from a federal district court in Pennsylvania that found the requirement did “not pass constitutional muster” in a lawsuit filed around the 2022 election. The Republican National Committee had appealed the lower court ruling, but a panel of three judges appointed by former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush rejected the appeal.

“We must determine if the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's requirement that mail-in ballots that arrive in undated or misdated return envelopes be discarded complies with our Constitution,” the opinion written by Judge D. Brooks Smith said. 

“Weighing the burden that practice imposes on Pennsylvanians' constitutional right to vote against the State's interest in the practice, the balance of the scales leads us to hold that it does not comply with our Constitution,” added the opinion by the Bush-appointed judge.

The lawsuit, which was brought in Nov. 2022 by a group of Pennsylvania voters, now-Sen. John Fetterman's (D-PA) campaign, along with the Democratic Party's House and Senate campaign wings, argued the state's date requirement for mail-in ballots violated the Civil Rights Act along with the First and 14th Amendments.

“The date on a mail ballot envelope thus has no bearing on a voter's qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote,” the Democrat-led lawsuit alleged.

The Supreme Court is slated to hear a trio of cases that could have significant implications for the 2026 elections, including one regarding Louisiana's congressional map and one that could open the door to challenging late-arriving mail-in ballots.

If the decision allowing undated ballots to be counted remains in place for the 2026 elections, it could have an impact on various key races in the Keystone State, including for the governor and in battleground House races.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down President Donald Trump's latest executive orders and his crackdown on crime as he eyes additional cities on 'Special Report.'

After yet another bloody weekend, some Chicago residents said they would welcome reinforcements if President Donald Trump decides to federalize the police force in Chicago.

Trump first floated the idea on Friday during a press conference in the Oval Office after seeing success with the same effort in Washington, D.C., which went 12 days without a homicide. 

"Chicago's a mess," Trump said on Friday, adding that it would "be our next one after this," following the federal intervention in Washington, D.C.

"Chicago's a killing field right now, and they don't acknowledge it," he said on Monday. "And they say, we don't need him."

LIZ PEEK: TRUMP PRANKS DEMOCRATS INTO OPPOSING SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS CLAIMED TO SUPPORT

Danielle Carter-Walters, a Black woman, is a personal trainer in the city. She is also the co-founder of Chicago Flips Red, a group of Windy City Trump supporters.

"Our communities are out of control. The destruction. The devastation of what's happening. We are being displaced out of our homes by illegal aliens," she told the Chicago Sun-Times. "There's a lot of us, thousands, silently supporting us. People think that Black women can't be MAGA. People are starting to see there's a lot of us."

Carter-Walters is a resident of the city's Marquette Park neighborhood.

"I stay on the South Side of Chicago," she said. "I'm living the experience. You can't sit in your car without worrying about being robbed, mugged, shot, carjacked. We definitely need something to be done."

CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PLAN 'MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION'

She's not the only person in favor of federal intervention.

"This is a unique generational opportunity for Illinois and for the city of Chicago, and I think that the politics are getting in the way," Aaron Del Mar, the Cook County Republican Party chairman, told NBC Chicago. "[Chicago Mayor] Brandon Johnson and [Illinois Gov.] J.B. Pritzker should be saying one thing, and that's ‘thank you.'"

Former First Assistant State's Attorney of Cook County Robert Milan is counted among those who support Trump's plan. He recalled efforts under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel to flood high-crime areas with more police and the National Guard. That plan, according to NBC Chicago, worked to reduce shootings in the short term, but federal funding to continue was never granted.

"You would see that in those areas there would be no shootings at all," he told the outlet. "In really, really dangerous areas, right? And we would listen to the gangbangers on wiretaps, and they were saying, ‘We gotta get out of here, police are everywhere, we can't do anything.'"

Meanwhile, Chicago marked another weekend of bloodshed.

Six people were killed, including a 5-year-old boy, and 27 were injured in shootings across the city, according to CBS News.

On Friday night, two men were standing outside when a person approached them on foot, pulled a gun, and shot and killed them, the outlet reported.

On Saturday afternoon, a boy in an apartment was shot in the head, according to CBS. He died shortly thereafter at Comer Children's Hospital.

California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.

An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.

Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.

But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue — not a political one — because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Trump Administration threatens funding for some states over enforcing English rules for truckers.

“This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs — semis — can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,” Duffy said.

The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.

He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.

Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on the X platform that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.

“This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people — and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,” Newsom's office said.

Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.

Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.

Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.

“Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,” Litty said.

But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.

“Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle — reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,” the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.

California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.

But in addition, Newsom's press office has said Singh obtained a work permit during Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.

Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.

“You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,” DeSantis said, calling the crash an “avoidable tragedy.”

Former deputy assistant attorney general Tom Dupree discusses the FBI raid on John Bolton's home and reaction to it on 'America Reports.'

The FBI's raid on John Bolton's home and office is tied to an investigation that reaches beyond his controversial book, a source told Fox News Digital, fueling speculation that the former Trump adviser could face criminal charges.

The scope of any potential charges against Bolton, who served under President Donald Trump before falling out of favor with him in 2019, is uncertain, but experts tend to agree that Bolton has some legal exposure.

Prominent D.C.-based attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in national security, said that while there are many unknowns about the Department of Justice's investigation into Bolton, his memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," could be an area of vulnerability for him.

"With respect to Bolton's book, he is potentially vulnerable if he maintains any copies of early drafts which were determined to contain ‘voluminous' amounts of classified information when it was first submitted to the White House for review," Zaid told Fox New Digital. "Those drafts were likely disseminated, per normal course of business, to his literary agent, publisher and lawyer."

Zaid added that those transmissions could be unlawful under the Espionage Act, a serious set of charges used throughout history to punish spies and leakers of government secrets.

During the first Trump administration, Attorney General Bill Barr opened an investigation into Bolton and brought a civil lawsuit against him over the book days before it was set for release.

The DOJ alleged in the lawsuit that Bolton skipped over normal prepublication review processes and allowed his publisher to move forward with printing a book that contained several passages of classified national security information.

In court papers, Bolton said he did not initially believe his memoir contained classified information, but then he edited some information out of the book after consulting with the National Security Council. Bolton never received a final signoff from the National Security Council before moving forward with publishing. He argued in court papers that the Trump administration's refusal to approve the memoir's contents violated his First Amendment rights and that the National Security Council's review process "had been abused in an effort to suppress" the book, which contained harsh criticisms of Trump.

DEMOCRATS OPPOSED JOHN BOLTON FOR YEARS — UNTIL THEY SOUGHT HIM AS AN ALLY AGAINST TRUMP

Judge Royce Lamberth, a D.C.-based Regan appointee, denied the Trump DOJ's request to block publication of Bolton's book because, among several reasons, it had already been exposed to publishers. Still, Lamberth faulted Bolton.

"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States," Lamberth wrote in an order at the time. "He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability."

Lamberth found it was likely Bolton "jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information" in violation of various nondisclosure agreements he signed as part of his national security role.

The DOJ never brought charges against Bolton, and the investigation was closed under the Biden administration. The Biden DOJ dismissed the civil lawsuit against Bolton over his book in June 2021.

JD VANCE INSISTS FBI SEARCHING BOLTON HOME ‘NOT AT ALL' ABOUT POLITICAL RETRIBUTION

While Bolton's book controversy has been at the forefront since the raids at his home and office, one well-placed source familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital on Monday the investigation is far more expansive than the book. 

The search warrants, which were authorized by a judge, were based on evidence collected overseas by the CIA, the New York Times reported.

Critics note Bolton is the latest target of the Trump DOJ, which despite pledging to end "weaponization" has pursued several of the president's political rivals. The department has launched grand jury probes into New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and is examining Obama-era national security officials who Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says tried to undermine Trump's 2016 victory. Trump has also urged an investigation of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, citing "criminal acts" tied to the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal.

Former U.S. Attorney John Fishwick of Virginia suggested the line between honest scrutiny of potential wrongdoing and political revenge has become blurred.

"Trump DOJ targeting enemies of Trump — Letitia James, Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor [Lisa] Cook and now John Bolton. Trump appears to want them harmed for personal/political reasons but if they broke the law are the investigations justified?" Fishwick told Fox News Digital in a statement. "That question is putting an incredible stress test on our legal system."

Zaid noted that Bolton could bring claims of a selective or vindictive prosecution if he were indicted but that those are difficult to prove.

Attorney Jason Kander, an Army veteran and former secretary of state of Missouri, said on the podcast "Talking Feds" that even if the DOJ does not secure a conviction against Bolton, the legal process itself is punishment.

"It's not just harassment. It's potential financial ruin," Kander said. "When they come after you like this it doesn't matter if there isn't a scintilla of evidence. It's a minimum half a million bucks in legal fees in a situation like this."

Ugandans on Tuesday questioned an agreement with the United States to receive deported migrants, highlighting the lack of parliamentary approval and that the deal eases political pressure on the country's authoritarian president.

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The highest-profile detainee that the United States seeks to deport, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, appears to be headed to Uganda, where critics claim that a deal with the Trump administration eases political pressure on a president who's ruled for nearly four decades.

Ugandan officials have released few details about the agreement but have said they prefer to receive deportees of African origin — and don't want people with criminal records. Abrego Garcia is an El Salvador native who has been charged with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty.

Abrego Garcia, the subject of a protracted immigration saga, was detained again Monday by immigration officials in the U.S., and the Department of Homeland Security said he “is being processed for removal to Uganda.”

Other African nations already have accepted deportees. In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight others to South Sudan, where civil war threatens to erupt again. Rwanda has said it will receive up to 250 migrants deported from the U.S.

Opposition figures and others in Uganda on Tuesday questioned the lack of parliamentary approval for the agreement.

Without such oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda's national assembly.

He said the agreement left him “a little perplexed” because Uganda already struggles to look after refugees fleeing violence in neighboring countries like Congo and South Sudan. He suggested the agreement makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for Uganda's government.




It is unclear what Uganda's government is receiving for accepting deportees, how many it might take or what its plans for Abrego Garcia might be. The country's attorney-general, as well as government ministers in charge of refugees and internal affairs, were not immediately available for comment.

The day before Uganda confirmed the deal, the deputy minister in charge of international relations, Okello Oryem, asserted to The Associated Press that such an agreement was “complete rubbish.”

Some Ugandans on Tuesday were busy speculating what benefit longtime President Yoweri Museveni might receive. The authoritarian leader has been in power since 1986.

For Museveni, the deal is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons” and might come with trade opportunities, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anti-corruption group in Uganda.

“The Trump administration is about deals, about deal-making, and any strongman would welcome that,” he said.

After U.S. sanctions targeted many government officials over human rights and other issues, “Museveni will be happy” to transact with Washington over deportees, said Ibrahim Ssemujju, a lawmaker and prominent opposition figure. “He will be asking, ‘When are you bringing them?'”

Ssemujju asserted that the agreement is flawed without parliamentary authorization.

Negotiators for the Ugandan side in the deal with the Trump administration are believed to have been reporting directly to Museveni.

For much of his time in power, Museveni was seen as a strong U.S. ally, especially for his support of counter-terrorism operations in Somalia, where he deployed troops to fight the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.

But his cachet in Washington has declined. The Biden administration piled pressure over corruption, LGBTQ+ rights concerns and alleged rights abuses.

Ugandan officials sanctioned by the U.S. include the parliament speaker, the prisons chief, a former police chief, a former deputy army commander and some former government ministers.

In 2023, reacting to U.S. sanctions imposed against Ugandan officials following the enactment of a law against homosexuality, Museveni told a gathering of government officials that he had no wish to visit the U.S.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered a fiery rebuke of President Trump's reported plan to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump as a "wannabe dictator" Monday, accusing him of trying to "occupy" Chicago with National Guard troops after reports the White House is preparing a possible deployment as soon as September.

The Democrat railed against a Washington Post report detailing the potential move, warning that Trump was escalating rhetoric against Chicago and its leaders over crime. 

"This is exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against," Pritzker said at a press conference in front of Trump Tower in downtown Chicago.

‘SLAP IN THE FACE': MAJOR BLUE STATE GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL OPENING FINANCIAL AID TO ILLEGALS

"What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American."

Pritzker vowed to fight the move in court, accusing Trump of trying to occupy a U.S. city for political gain.

"Go talk to the people of Chicago who are enjoying a gorgeous afternoon in this city… ask if they want their neighborhoods turned into a war zone by a wannabe dictator," Pritzker said, flanked by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other local officials. 

"Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish his dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is – a dangerous power grab."

The Democrat said Trump was trying to militarize a blue state while simultaneously slashing $800 million in federal crime prevention grants. Most of the grants were headed to nonprofits and local community groups, not to police departments or federal law enforcement. 

Pritzker said that crime rates are down in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and that Trump's narrative of the city being engulfed in crime is manufactured. 

For instance, he said that murders are down 32% compared to last year and nearly cut in half since 2021.

"You are neither wanted here nor needed here," Pritzker added. "We will see the Trump administration in court. We will use every lever at our disposal to protect the people of Illinois and their rights."

Hours earlier Trump suggested he would prefer to be "asked" before sending troops. He has been floating the idea of deploying the National Guard in Chicago, replicating operations in Washington, D.C., which has also seen the federal government take control of the local police. More than 1,000 arrests have been made and the capital has gone 11 days straight without a homicide, according to the latest figures.

ILLINOIS GOV CALLS FOR MASS PROTESTS AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN: GOP 'CANNOT KNOW A MOMENT OF PEACE'

National Guard units sent without state approval are generally restricted to defending federal property and personnel. When Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles in June over anti-ICE protests, they were confined to federal buildings and escort duties for immigration agents. In Washington, D.C., which is under federal jurisdiction, Guard units have conducted armed patrols alongside local police.

"In a certain way, you really want to be asked to go," Trump told reporters, before taking a jab at Pritzker: "He has to spend more time in the gym."

Trump continued his attacks on Pritzker and ripped the Windy City's crime record.

"I'm thinking about you know, when I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there. I made the statement that next year be Chicago because, as you all know, Chicago's a killing field right now and they don't acknowledge it. And they say, we don't need him."

Chicago recorded 573 homicides in 2024, marking the 13th straight year Chicago has led the nation in total murders, according to Chicago Police Department data compiled by Wirepoints.

According to the Council on Criminal Justice's year-end 2024 update, aggravated assaults declined by 4% compared to 2023 but remained 4% higher than in 2019, gun assaults fell 15% though they were still 5% above 2019 levels, and carjackings dropped 32% year-over-year yet were 25% higher than in 2019.

Meanwhile, Johnson echoed Pritzker's defiance, insisting Chicagoans don't want a "military occupation." 

"We believe that you don't solve crime by sending in the military," Johnson said. "The last thing that Chicagoans want is someone from the outside of our city who doesn't know our city, trying to dictate and tell us what our city needs."

Johnson called the plan "a stunt," saying Trump's targeting of Chicago is rooted in racism.

"We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence. We've already tried that, and we've ended up with the largest prison population in the world without solving the problems of crime and violence," Johnson said.

"The addiction on jails and incarceration in this country. We have moved past that. It is racist. It is immoral. It is unholy. And it is not the way to drive violence down."

Why it matters that the University of Chicago is pausing admissions to doctoral programs in literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages

The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was lit, COVID-19 was still a mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan, and I was a Ph.D. candidate in a dying field: comparative literature. I was getting ready to Zoom interview for a tenure-track job near Boston that I almost certainly wouldn't get (and didn't). Sardined with me in a Greenwich Village coffee shop in December 2019, one of my faculty mentors talked me through, for the thousandth time, the questions I should expect the hiring committee to ask me and dispensed advice about how I should answer them. Then we walked back to his office, lined in handsome foreign-language editions of various novels and works of philosophy, where I would sit for the interview. There, he offered a final piece of wisdom: “Don't be nervous. It's just Harvard,” he said, grinning. “It's not like it's Chicago.”

A joke, but not entirely. For as long as I can remember, and certainly much longer than that, the University of Chicago has been widely viewed as the destination for humanities students and scholars. Some other elite schools might have the coveted Ivy League branding, or a few more famous faculty members, or a couple more dollars to tack onto the salaries of its professors and graduate students. But perhaps nowhere is the study of literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages more valued, their spirit more authentically preserved, their frontiers more doggedly pursued, than at Chicago. The university has had several household names on its humanities faculty, including the firebrand critic Allan Bloom, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the ethicist Martha Nussbaum, as well as scholars who may be less well known to the general public but whose work has been deeply influential in their fields, including the brilliant literary critic Sianne Ngai and Fred Donner, the pathbreaking and Guggenheim-winning historian of early Islam. In short, Chicago is a place for scholars' scholars. At least, that's the reputation. And Chicago's reputation is no doubt why, when the university announced recently that it was reducing Ph.D. admissions for seven departments—among them art history and English language and literature—and outright freezing admissions to others, including classics, the decision was met, in some quarters, with fury and disbelief. “Chicago!” as one stunned academic friend put it in a text to me.

In an August 12 email to faculty, Deborah Nelson, Chicago's arts and humanities dean, said that the changes were necessitated by “this moment of uncertainty” and “evolving fiscal realities.” These bits of bureaucratese appear to be allusions to both the Trump administration's war on higher education and Chicago's homegrown financial troubles, which include an eye-popping $6.3 billion in debt and a bad bet on crypto. “To be anything but cautious at this moment,” the dean's email continued, “would be irresponsible.”

Chicago's social-sciences division has also announced doctoral-admissions pauses, primarily in humanistic-leaning programs such as anthropology and social thought, where towering figures including the philosopher Hannah Arendt once taught. What's happening at Chicago is a particular gut-punch to the humanities, not just at the university itself, but nationally and even globally. The school is, as the classics professor Catherine Kearns put it in a message to me, “a singular center for the pursuit of humanistic knowledge and intellectual growth.” Of the nearly 30 Chicago humanities professors I spoke with for this article, many emphasized that the stakes are much higher than the fate of prospective graduate students or the professors who might teach them. Chicago has long helped to keep alive tiny fields and esoteric areas of humanistic study, particularly in the languages. Without the university's support, and the continued training of graduate students who can keep these bodies of knowledge going, entire spheres of human learning might eventually blink out.

Of course, some might view these comments as self-serving complaints. But the primary fears of the people I spoke with were not about their own careers or futures, but instead about their fields—about knowledge that, once lost, cannot be easily regained. “If you allow a field to die, there's a loss to something like humanity,” Clifford Ando, a Chicago classicist who has been outspoken about the administration's maneuvers, told me. “There's also a real practical risk that a field simply cannot be re-created just because you have books.” I heard this sentiment echoed over and over. “If we stop producing people who are trained or educated to help undergraduates understand the most important things thought or written or painted in human history,” the renowned philosopher Robert Pippin said, “we might not be able to recover that.” Elaine Hadley, an emerita professor of English, told me, “Part of what we do is we're conservators, keeping a body of knowledge going. We want to innovate and we want to think new things about it, and, you know, we want to make it relevant to the present day, but we're also trying to keep this knowledge alive.”

These responses emphasize the cultural costs of shrinking the number of people trained in humanities fields, rather than focusing on the question of whether universities should be calibrating the production of Ph.D.s to the academic job market. No one I spoke to was insensitive to the pressures their grad students face when confronting the vanishing opportunities for tenure-track employment. But the professors also seemed reluctant to define the success of a program by how many professors it creates—after all, most humanities PhD students at Chicago do not pay tuition and receive stipends to cover their living costs, and getting paid to learn and read is not the worst fate.

These faculty perspectives also stood in stark contrast with the reigning image of elite higher educators in right-wing media outlets: that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Implicit in their impassioned defenses was the belief that the role of a humanist is to preserve knowledge, safeguard learning from the market and the tides of popular interest, and ward off coarse appeals to economic utility.

Depending on whom I asked, the move to scale back humanities doctoral programs is either a prudent acknowledgment of the cratered job market for tenure-track professorships and a wise attempt to protect the university's humanities division from looming financial and political risks, or it is a cynical effort, under cover of the Trump administration's assaults, to transfer resources away from “impractical,” unprofitable, and largely jobless fields (such as, say, comparative literature) and toward areas that the university's senior leadership seems to care about (such as, say, STEM and “innovation”). One faculty member I spoke with mentioned a consulting firm that was brought on to help Chicago as it considers changes to its humanities division, including possibly consolidating the departments from 15 down to eight. Many professors worried that the move to impose uneven changes—reducing admissions in some while halting them in others—may be an attempt to create circumstances that will ultimately make it easier to dissolve the paused programs. “Let no good crisis go unleveraged,” Holly Shissler, an associate professor in the Middle Eastern Studies department, said with a dark laugh. “You engineer a situation in which there are no students, and then you turn around and say, ‘Why are we supporting all these departments and faculty when they have no students?'”

When I emailed Nelson and asked whether the changes were part of a plan to kill off the paused departments, she said, “A one-year pause is exactly that—a discrete decision that applies merely to a single admissions cycle.” She seemed to acknowledge, however, that a divisional reorganization could happen. “My goal is to sustain the full scope of our faculty's research and teaching,” she said. “To do so, we must be open to new ideas and structures.” She added, “There's no magic number of departments in the arts and humanities.” In the meantime, Chicago's humanities professors appear largely determined to resist being evaluated in terms of expediency. In a meeting with Nelson a few days after the announcement, 14 out of 15 chairs in the humanities division told the dean that she should pause enrollment in all of their departments or none of them. Targeting some and not others was unacceptable, they argued, because it sent the message that some fields matter and others do not.

The department chairs' wager seems to be that acting as a unified bloc will make reorganizing the division and cutting programs more difficult, even if the division-wide pause causes short-term pain for the next academic year. As anyone who has served on a faculty anywhere can tell you, this degree of cross-department solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for less-favored colleagues is remarkable, and even moving. Last Wednesday afternoon, the dean announced that the chairs had gotten their wish: With the exception of philosophy and music composition (owing to previous pauses in those programs), doctoral admissions will be frozen across the humanities for the 2026–27 academic year.

It's a bittersweet victory, of course, one that will result in fewer doctoral students in the short term and is not guaranteed to strengthen the division in the long term. And it does not settle the most pressing question raised by all this turmoil. If even Chicago is not willing to support and protect American arts and letters, who will? One Chicago administrator, in an attempt to defend the university's admissions pauses, pointed out that other prestigious peer institutions were expected to make similar announcements about their Ph.D. admissions in the coming weeks, and noted that Harvard is cutting nearly $2 million from its own humanities division. I would like to think that my (and others') alarm about the future of the humanities is overblown. But the evidence doesn't give me much hope.

We all have a limited reserve of attention, and modern life is excellent at depleting it. 

The human brain wasn't built for all this — all of the information, screens, meetings, scheduling, thinking.

The problem is the brain hasn't changed much since the days of hunter-gatherers, but the demands we put on it have, says Kayla Stajkovic, a lecturer in organizational behavior at the University of California Davis. In the past, humans did a fair amount of strategizing and planning to survive, but now, we're bombarded with emails and messages all day, we juggle calendars, attempt to multitask, and pull out our phones when we can't think of anything better to do.

Into the breach has stepped an enormous number of productivity hacks, as well as influencers and productivity evangelists peddling easy-fix solutions. A to-do list no longer suffices when you can intricately track habits, time, goals, and progress. Setting up and customizing new systems can consume more time and energy than the tasks they're meant to streamline. We also live in an era of ubiquitous short-form videos and AI overviews, bite-sized bits of information that are supposed to save us time, but in fact may just be fueling the desire to devour more content as quickly as possible.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Even with all these new hacks, tools, and organizational methods, it can still feel like a challenge to concentrate for a few hours a day. It isn't that we're undisciplined or have undiagnosed ADHD (although that certainly may be the case for some) — we're simply pushing our minds beyond the brink of what they can reasonably do, Stajkovic says. We all have a limited reserve of attention, and many aspects of our tech-laden, productivity-focused lives deplete that mental energy.

“You could see how it would be easy for people to say we have attention problems when really the problem is the environment and how much we're trying to fit in,” Stajkovic says. “It would be like trying to tow a boat with a Honda Civic. The boat is heavier than the car's capacity to tow it; it's just not going to do it. It's not a problem with the car. It just wasn't made to tow a boat.”

If you're already at your cognitive limit, no workaround will transform your brain from a Honda Civic to a tractor-trailer. Instead of adding, you need to do something entirely counterintuitive: find a way to lighten the load.

This constant barrage of information we're subjected to in modern life, most of which is delivered via a screen, leads to information and cognitive overload — a mental maxing out of attention and productivity. Because the hunter-gatherer brain has a limit on attentional capacity, modern demands chip away at those resources, Stajkovic explains. Simple, routine tasks — brushing your teeth, feeding yourself — are less mentally taxing, while blocks of meetings, hours of work without a break, and perpetual scrolling are depleting. In this exhausted state, it's difficult to put forth your best effort.

In one study, German workers who used text-based digital tools like Slack, Trello, and email during the pandemic had higher rates of perceived cognitive overload. Video tools, on the other hand, didn't contribute to cognitive overload.

Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank. The consequences of cognitive overload are far-reaching, if not entirely surprising: Psychological distress, lower job productivity and satisfaction, depressive symptoms. “It impairs our working memory, it impairs our ability to make decisions and the quality of decisions we make,” says Miriam Arnold, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “It can also have behavioral outcomes, so we might try to avoid the information, for example, ignoring emails or procrastinating, which makes it worse in the long term.”

Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank.

The drive to perpetually produce is motivated in part by the fact that productivity feels good, according to Leidy Klotz, a professor in engineering and behavioral science at the University of Virginia. Fail to meet a self-imposed (or boss-imposed) output, and you might think something must be wrong with you, not the taxing context in which you work or your employer's demanding expectations.

The pace of work in our hyper-connected digital workplace isn't helping matters much either. Employees are not only responsible for the central elements of their job; they're also expected to be constantly reachable and responsive. The modern workday can feel like it's filled more with communicating about work — answering emails and attending meetings — than actually doing the work.

Even with more busywork and tighter timelines to contend with, we're still driven to be high-performers because of the fundamental human need to display competence, says Klotz, also the author of Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less. Although sending another email or checking off a to-do list item gives the illusion of accomplishment, it's only a proxy for actual productivity. It's just energy-depleting busy work. “One of the reasons that it doesn't feel good to be going as hard as we can and not actually accomplish anything,” Klotz says, “is because we realize that we're not meeting that need for competence.”

In order to get more done, some may turn to productivity tools and systems — project managing software, strategies meant for people with diagnosed attention disorders, breaking down assignments into smaller tasks. While these hacks appear to streamline workflows, in actuality, they add to the cognitive load. “Say you have three things to do, and a strategy is breaking it into micro-tasks,” Stajkovic says. “Now you've created 26 things to do that your mind is trying to keep track of. So actually, you're undermining yourself in that regard.”

The best way to get more done when you've hit your cognitive max is the most straightforward: Take a break and rejuvenate, experts say.

Recognizing the signs of cognitive overload is the first step. Feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and unable to focus are signals to pull back, not force more output, Stajkovic says. In which case, try to take at least a 15-minute pause during the workday and don't skip your lunch break. Some jobs don't offer the flexibility to pause outside of designated break times, so Stajkovic suggests switching to a less taxing assignment if you can, something you can do almost automatically without much thinking.

Outside of work, it's important not to sabotage leisure time. Leave work at work and save emails for the next day. Not all company cultures are amenable to this, of course, but team leaders can encourage employees to take breaks, to let their mind wander, and to disengage outside of work hours, Stajkovic and Klotz say.

To stave off cognitive overload, question some of the behaviors that contribute to it, says Gloria Mark, the author of Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity and the Substack The Future of Attention. Why are you responding to emails at 10 pm or opening TikTok as soon as you have a moment of downtime? Most of the time, these seemingly urgent messages can wait, or that social media habit is purely out of boredom. “Once you become aware of that, you can be more intentional in your behavior,” Mark says.

And instead of adding more to your plate in the form of elaborate productivity hacks, try eliminating what doesn't serve you. While everyone's scenario will look different, Klotz suggests clarifying your goal in work or life and skipping meetings or tasks that don't serve that goal if you have the flexibility. If your main purpose at work is to teach students, maybe there are a few nonessential department meetings you could opt out of to make more time for additional instruction.

Perhaps the most impactful antidote to our fast-paced, production-obsessed culture is recognizing you probably did enough today — and nothing short of a brain upgrade can change that. “Instead of thinking about ‘What more could I do?'” Stajkovic says, “focus on what I did get done and being content with that.”

            The Trump administration's cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
    


            The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
    


            Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
    


            But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
    


            In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don't match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.
    


            The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
    


            In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
    


            The money in question wasn't spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
    


            “It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    


            The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
    


            After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
    


            Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn't sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
    


            In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
    


            “I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven't had to do that before. We don't have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
    


            At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
    


            Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She'd been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn't read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
    


            “We would find them rehab places. We'd get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she'd also remind people “that they're cared for, that they're worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they're not treated that way.”
    


            Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
    


            Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
    


            Ashton said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
    


            HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
    


Trump administration pulls back billions in Covid-era funding for state, local health departments



            Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
    


            The Trump administration's nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News' analysis.
    


            The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
    


            She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients' hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
    


            “We've never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
    


            Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
    


            Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
    


            As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won't rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
    


            Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump's first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
    


            “We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don't understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
    


CDC facing major funding cuts, with direct impact on state and local health departments



            Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
    


            Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn't slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
    


            Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect' funding” for public health.
    


            The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
    


            “The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.
    


            KFF Health News' analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
    


            Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 to one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
    


            To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage on National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
    


            This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients' location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration's order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

US vaccine consensus has officially shattered.

For decades, the American public, the federal government, and the medical community have been nearly unanimous: Vaccines are important because they save lives. Today, after years of escalating attacks, that consensus has irrevocably shattered.

The rupture has centered around, what else, the Covid vaccines. Yesterday, a British cardiologist allied with US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told the Daily Beast that the Trump administration would soon pull Covid-19 vaccines off the market. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics said that the group would continue to recommend Covid vaccines for kids under the age of 2 — openly defying Kennedy's move this May to end the recommendation for both healthy children and pregnant people.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, saying on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country's leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of the evidence that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children.

Kennedy, in response, ominously warned the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don't follow the government's vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy's scrutiny.

And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is meeting this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of Trump's “Operation Warp Speed” during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed.

As a result of all this, more people could get sick.

Drug manufacturers may produce fewer doses of their existing vaccines. Insurers may not be willing to cover people's shots if they are not being recommended by the government. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can't find one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won't be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won't cover it anymore. That will leave them to decide between taking the risk to go see their loved one, who could get seriously ill, or not seeing them at all.

We are running headlong into a forced experiment, in which the federal government actively obstructs the usage of vaccines and the development of new ones, and a growing share of the public has lost their faith in one of modern medicine's greatest tools.

That the federal government and professional medical societies would be openly at war over vaccine guidance in this way really was once unimaginable. Around the turn of the century, more than 90 percent of Americans agreed that childhood immunizations were important. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully eradicated measles as of 2000.

But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still believe that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw its worst measles outbreak since the early 1990s, and Kennedy's health department was, based on reporting by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements waffling on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective.

How did we get here?

Well, for starters, even though anti-vaccine activism has existed for decades, the movement received a boost with the COVID-19 pandemic and the way it polarized people's opinions about public health experts. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy's presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found an uneasy home within the Trump administration. After Trump's election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government's support for vaccines.

In the first few months on the job, he put a vaccine skeptic in charge of searching for a link between vaccines and autism. He unilaterally rolled back those COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant people. He replaced the federal government's expert vaccine panel with his own handpicked members. He has ordered a review of the childhood immunization schedule, as well as the safety of Covid shots. He canceled a $500 million mRNA vaccine contract.

This is a fight Kennedy wanted. But now the medical community is punching back. Americans, meanwhile, are stuck in the middle, just as we head into another cold-and-flu season.

            Before joining his teammates in celebration, the 31-year-old took a detour to the Padres fan sitting directly next to the visitor dugout.
    


            The fan's voice could be heard on field mics throughout the broadcast reminding the three-time MVP of his struggles in the batter's box throughout the series. Ohtani was sitting at 0-10 – unusual for him – before the homer.
    


            So, after hitting his 45th home run of the season, Ohtani, with a huge smile on his face, ran up to the fan and gave him a high five and a pat on the back.
    


            The camera cut to the fan who appeared to shake his head while smiling after the interaction. He was then seen laughing while talking to those around him. All in good fun, it seems.
    


            “Very annoying, as he's in my right ear the entire game. But it was very out of character for Shohei and he was wearing him out the whole game,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. “It was good to see Shohei, you know, initiate a high five from him.”
    


            The skipper added with a smile, “That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.”
    


            Ohtani certainly wasn't the only Dodgers player struggling earlier in the series as their offense only scraped together two runs total in the opening two games – both LA losses – before exploding on Sunday.
    


            His projected 409-foot home run to right-center came with Los Angeles already up by five in the ninth. It was the cherry on top of a dominant outing for the defending World Series champions.
    


            The win moved the Dodgers level with their division rivals in the NL West, but with San Diego losing 6-9 to the Seattle Mariners and the Dodgers blowing out the Cincinnati Reds 7-0 on Monday, LA now has a game lead in the back-and-forth division race.

Antisemitism has become a raging problem in the West. You can see it online, where there is an abundance of conspiracy theories about Jewish people. It's at protest rallies and in our elite institutions.

In July, Claire Shipman, Columbia University's acting president, announced that the university would take steps to combat antisemitism on campus. In a message to the community, Shipman promised that Columbia would make reforms.

“In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.

One book that Shipman can put on the syllabus is Sarah Hurwitz's new release, As a Jew: Reclaiming Our Story from Those Who Blame, Shame, and Try to Erase Us, a timely and important book.

Hurwitz is known publicly as a speechwriter for both of the Obamas. Hurwitz grew up in a “culturally Jewish” home in Massachusetts, but her parents weren't religious, even if they sent Sarah to Hebrew school. Hurwitz maintained this loose relationship with her faith until, at 36 and the height of her career, she attended an Introduction to Judaism class. That course changed her life. She found in Judaism a wisdom and a tradition that she had never appreciated. Hurwitz's first book, Here All Along: Finding Meaning, Spirituality, and a Deeper Connection to Life – in Judaism (After Finally Choosing to Look There), about her rediscovery of Judaism, was published in 2013.

As a Jew is the follow-up. It is a much more intense book than its predecessor. Hurwitz is angry about the antisemitism that has risen in recent years. In 2021, during “yet another iteration of the Israel–Gaza conflict” and with “Hamas launching rockets at Israel and Israel responding with air strikes,” Hurwitz was appalled by what she read online: “As I scrolled through social media posts declaring that Israelis are Nazis and ‘Zionism = Racism,' I was struck by how many of these posts were coming from progressive voices, people I thought of as being on my ‘side.' None of this was new. It had been bubbling beneath the surface for years.”

As one would expect from a book written by a speechwriter, Hurwitz has a way with words. Here she is describing how modern liberalism can't compare to religious tradition: “Severed from my roots, the closest I came to meaning and spirituality was a collection of social justice slogans and self-help clichés, a convenient mash-up of Democratic politics and ‘being a good person' filtered through the ‘you do you' creed of modern life. Knowing much about how to be accomplished, but little about how to be good, I skimmed the surface of my life while building my résumé.”

Hurwitz traces modern antisemitism back not only to Adolf Hitler but to the Soviet Union. Communists didn't like the fact that Jews had a tradition going back thousands of years, a threat to communism's “Year Zero” plans to start history anew. Hurwitz quotes historian Izabella Tabarovsky, who observed that Soviet propaganda denouncing “Zionism” reached people across the Muslim world and in Africa. The result, Tabarovsky concludes, was a rebrand of Zionism from a movement for national self-determination to “a racist, fascist, Nazi-like, genocidal, imperialist, colonialist, militarist and apartheid-promoting conspiratorial ideology.”

Today, antisemitism can be found on the Right and the Left, and particularly on college campuses. For a Democrat such as Hurwitz, seeing students at America's elite institutions rage against Jewish people is heartbreaking. “I now understood how the story of Zionism has been stolen and rewritten by others such that it is no longer about a people who rejected their role as history's scapegoats and rose up to claim safety, autonomy, and power in a state of their own,” she writes. “Instead, it has been turned into a story about a people who epitomize the worst evils of humankind, all of which are embodied in their state, the very founding of which was a sin.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKES HEADWAY IN CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM LEGAL FIGHTS

If I have any criticism of As a Jew, it's that Hurwitz doesn't address the ways that Jews in America have profoundly enriched our culture. From Bob Dylan to Superman, Annie Leibovitz to Mel Brooks, Mad magazine to Philip Glass, Jews have helped create modern America.

In the end, Hurwitz laments that many Jewish people let others write their history. Hurwitz now reflects that her early detachment from her faith “was the product of two thousand years of antisemitism and two hundred years of efforts by Jews to erase parts of ourselves and our tradition in the hope of being accepted and safe. My Jewish identity back then was not empowering. It was humiliating. As I came to understand the various forces that had turned me against my own tradition, I came to see the ways in which I have been complicit in this process. And in addition to grief, shame, and anger, I feel something else: compassion. Compassion for my ancestors.”

The Department of Justice is homing in on critics of President Donald Trump and Democratic officials who once made him the subject of their own investigations.

The latest targets include John Bolton, his first-term national security adviser whose house was recently raided, and Chris Christie, the former friend-turned-foe whom the president suggested should be reinvestigated for actions taken when he was New Jersey governor.

The unofficial retribution list for whom Trump's DOJ has placed in its crosshairs extends well beyond the pair, including those like Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Barack Obama, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump and those supporting him say the actions are warranted to retaliate against the onslaught of “lawfare” he faced during the 2024 campaign. Indeed, the president is making good on a campaign pledge to seek revenge against political enemies that could eventually result in legal punishments.

“Revenge does take time, I will say that,” Trump said during a 2024 campaign interview with Phil McGraw, better known on TV as “Dr. Phil.”

But Trump is also testing whether embracing what critics have assailed as “politically motivated” investigations will quell what his supporters see as unfair political prosecutions in the future, or if it will further erode public confidence in the justice system.

“Joe Biden weaponized his administration to target political opponents — most famously, President Trump,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. “And if that wasn't bad enough, Biden — or whoever was really calling the shots — also used his administration to target everyday Americans who dared express political opinions he disagreed with.”

Jackson, referencing allegations that former President Joe Biden's mental acuity deteriorated as commander in chief to the point he could no longer run the country, cited as evidence Biden DOJ investigations into parents who criticized local school boards and anti-abortion activists jailed for protests at abortion clinics.

“The American people are lucky Biden's shameful chapter of history is closed,” Jackson continued. “President Trump is restoring law and order.”

Trump declined to say on Monday whether more raids of vocal critics like Bolton could be expected and said that the responsibility falls to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Agents last week searched Bolton's Washington, D.C.-area home and office related to classified documents, but it was unclear if the ongoing inquiry into his tell-all book from his time in Trump's first term was connected.

“It already has the absolute aura of being politically motivated,” former DOJ national security prosecutor Joseph Moreno said in an appearance on NBC News. “I hope that's not the case.”

Instead, Trump blamed Democrats for having first weaponized the justice process, in part by raiding his south Florida Mar-a-Lago estate under Biden, which later led to criminal charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents.

“They raided Mar-a-Lago. They started that,” Trump said. “These were bad people that we had in our government.”

Like Bolton, Christie, one of Trump's fiercest opponents, also found himself in the president's crosshairs. On Monday, Trump floated reopening the so-called 2013 “Bridgegate” investigation from Christie's time as governor. The investigation led to the conviction of two Christie allies related to lane closures on the George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey to Manhattan as part of a retaliation scheme against a Democratic mayor. The convictions were overturned in 2020 by the Supreme Court.

“He blamed other people, but he knew all about it. I don't know if they want to look at him; it's not for me. If they want to look at it, they can,” Trump told reporters of the DOJ investigating Christie. “I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.”

Trump cited the lane closures affecting ambulances that were delayed due to traffic.

Other subjects of DOJ investigations include James, the Democratic New York attorney general who's targeted Trump's company; Schiff, a former impeachment manager, for mortgage fraud allegations; and Obama, Brennan, and Comey for the 2016 Russian election interference investigation.

In similar attempts to flex his executive authority, Trump has moved to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations as he criticizes the board for not lowering interest rates. He's also revoked the security clearances for dozens of current and former high-level government officials, including Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.

On Monday, Trump suggested he may extend his power by making Chicago the next city to which he deploys National Guard troops to combat crime, as he did in the nation's capital.

TRUMP SAYS HE KNOWS ‘NOTHING' ABOUT FBI RAID ON JOHN BOLTON'S HOME

Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), a possible 2028 presidential contender who's increasingly clashed with Trump, said he was “ringing an alarm” about the president's “manufactured” crisis. He condemned the notion of sending military troops into Chicago as an attempt to “intimidate his political rivals.”

“This is exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against, and it's the reason that they established a federal system with a separation of powers built on checks and balances,” Pritzker said. “What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American.”

            President Donald Trump is making sure to share – repeatedly – a recent government analysis that shows his sweeping array of tariffs is expected to reduce the federal debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, more than forecast only a few months ago.
    


            The president has referenced the Congressional Budget Office report in multiple remarks and on Truth Social since it was released on Friday, saying it shows the success of one of his key, but controversial, policy platforms.
    


            “The tariffs came in at $4 trillion,” Trump said at an Oval Office event on Monday afternoon, the second time he mentioned the report that day. “The CBO, they just announced it. I told them that was going to happen, but they refused to give us credit for it. Now they're giving us credit because the money is flowing in.”
    


            However, how much revenue the US actually realizes depends on several important factors, including whether the current levies remain in place into 2035 and how the nation reacts to the higher tariffs. The tariffs are expected to increase inflation and potentially weaken the economy, which could in turn reduce federal revenue. (The CBO's analysis did not take the economic impact into account.)
    


            Already, the president has announced some recent changes not incorporated into the analysis, including the coming suspension of tariff-free entry for products under $800. On the flip side, a federal appeals court is considering whether Trump overstepped his legal authority to impose many of the tariffs, which may lead to at least some of them being undone.
    


            Also, the president hasn't mentioned that the One Big Beautiful Bill, his domestic policy agenda that he signed into law last month, is expected to increase the federal debt by an estimated $4.1 trillion or so between 2025 and 2034, more than his tariffs are forecast to bring in.
    


            Since taking office in January, Trump has slapped tariffs on a wide range of goods and countries, including increasing tariffs on most Chinese goods by 30%, on automobiles and car parts by up to 25%, and on most imports of steel and aluminum by 50%, among other examples. The levies are expected to increase the price consumers pay for computers and other electronics, clothing, toys, furniture and more, even as the president insists that foreign governments will pick up the tab.
    


            The beefed-up tariffs are projected to lower the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the 2025 to 2035 period, plus reduce interest costs by an additional roughly $700 billion, for a total impact of $4 trillion, according to the CBO's latest estimate. It looked at tariffs imposed as of August 19.
    


            The CBO had estimated in early June that the tariffs implemented through May 13 would reduce the federal debt by a total of roughly $3 trillion.
    


            However, Trump has also modified the rates on countries and sectors numerous times.
    


            For instance, Trump slapped a minimum 20% tariff on most Chinese goods in April. But within days, he increased rates to 145% in response to China imposing higher tariffs on American goods. In May, following bilateral trade negotiations, both countries agreed to lower rates on one another's goods, with the US charging a minimum of 30%. Rates are set to stay at the previously agreed upon levels through November. However, Trump said Monday that he's prepared to hike tariffs on Chinese goods as high as 200% if it doesn't ship more rare-earth minerals to the US.
    


            The president also recently said he would consider distributing at least some of the tariff revenue to Americans in the form of rebate checks, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC last week that the money would go to paying down the national debt.
    


            Tariffs and other customs duties have generated nearly $156 billion in revenue so far this year, through August 22, according to Treasury Department data.
    


            The revenue is more than most people expected, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a watchdog group. And it could be difficult to pull back, though it would depend on the economic consequences.
    


            “If we see a significant increase in inflation and a recession or something, it's more likely that these get reversed, either wholesale or piece-wise through trade deals,” he said, noting that a prior CBO estimate that took economic impact into account showed tariffs would likely decrease revenue somewhat. “Whereas, if you just see a one-time, small price shift and some mild economic weakness, we may learn to live with these.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.

Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. 

Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said in an emailed statement. “I will not resign.”

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.

Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans. 




Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's “reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,” adding, “We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.” 

Cook was appointed to the Fed's board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and she has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor “for cause,” which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. The president cannot fire a governor simply because of differences over interest rate policy.

Establishing a for-cause removal typically requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, legal experts say, which hasn't happened in this case.

“This is a procedurally invalid removal under the statute,” said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia law school and author of “The Fed Unbound,” a book about the Fed's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Menand also said for-cause firings are typically related to misconduct while in office, rather than based on private misconduct from before an official's appointment.

“This is not someone convicted of a crime,” Menand said. “This is not someone who is not carrying out their duties.”

Fed governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and on issues of financial regulation. While they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they are not like cabinet secretaries, who serve at the pleasure of the president. They serve 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence. 

While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has sought to fire a Fed governor. In recent decades, presidents of both parties have largely respected Fed independence, though Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson put heavy pressure on the Fed during their presidencies — mostly behind closed doors. Still, that behind-the-scenes pressure to keep interest rates low, the same goal sought by Trump, has widely been blamed for touching off rampant inflation in the late 1960s and ‘70s.

President Harry Truman pushed Thomas McCabe to step down from his position as Fed chair in 1951, though that occurred behind the scenes.

The Supreme Court signaled in a recent decision that Fed officials have greater legal protections from firing than other independent agencies, but it's not clear if that extends to this case. 

Menand noted that the Court's conservative majority has taken a very expansive view of presidential power, saying, “We're in uncharted waters in a sense that it's very difficult to predict that if Lisa Cook goes to court what will happen.” 

Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the president's use of the “for cause” provision is likely an effort to mask his true intent. “It seems like a fig leaf to get what we wants, which is muscling someone on the board to lower rates,” she said.

Trump has said he would only appoint Fed officials who would support lower borrowing costs. He recently named Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to replace another governor, Adriana Kugler, who stepped down about five months before her term officially ended Aug. 1.

Trump appointed two governors in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, so replacing Cook would give Trump appointees a 4-3 majority on the Fed's board.

“The American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,” Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. “In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”

Trump argued that firing Cook was constitutional. “I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office,” the president wrote.

Cook will have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.

Trump's announcement drew swift rebuke from advocates and former Fed officials.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Trump's attempt to fire Cook illegal, “the latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It's an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.”

Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.

Forcing Cook off the Fed's governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.

Powell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell's term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.

A towering wall of dust has rolled through metro Phoenix on Monday. Storms left thousands of people without power and temporarily grounded flights at the city airport. One woman videotaped the sight of the dust surrounding her car. A camera recorded the view of the storm covering highways and buildings.

PHOENIX (AP) — A powerful storm kicked up a towering wall of dust that rolled through metro Phoenix on Monday, darkening the sky, blinding drivers, knocking out power and grounding flights at one of the nation's busiest airports. 

Bernae Boykin Hitesman was driving her son and daughter, ages 9 and 11, home from school when the storm, known as a haboob, arrived late in the afternoon in Arizona City, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southeast of Phoenix.

She had to quickly pull over as the storm engulfed her car. “I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,” she said.

Boykin Hitesman said she could taste the dust and feel the strong wind rattling her car until it finally passed about 15 minutes later.

“I was nervous,” she said. “My kids were really, really scared, so I was trying to be brave for them.”

A haboob is a dust storm pushed by the wind produced by a weather front or thunderstorm and typically occurs in flat, arid areas. Heavy rain and wind followed Monday's haboob, delaying flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and causing some damage to a terminal roof. 

“Crews have been identifying leaks and attempting to clean up water where it has collected in passenger areas,” Heather Shelbrack, the airport's deputy aviation director for public relations, said in an email. 




More than 15,000 people lost power, most in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, according to PowerOutage.us.

Richard Filley, a retired university professor who lives in Gilbert, said the dust storm caused the trees to sway and knocked bird feeders to the ground. Fine dust found its way through “every little crack and space” into his house, he said.

“The windstorm part of it, I'm glad it's gone,” he said. “You look at the photos of haboobs and they are a spectacular natural phenomenon. They are kind of beautiful in their own way.”

Phoenix has been drier than usual during the monsoon season, while parts of southeast and north-central Arizona have had a fair amount of rain, said Mark O'Malley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.

“But that's typical for a monsoon, very hit and miss,” he said.

The forecast for metro Phoenix calls for a 40% chance of rain Tuesday before drying out, O'Malley said.

President Donald Trump says he's firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, amid mortgage fraud allegations, opening a new front in the fight over America's central bank.

The president's announcement came Monday night, days after Cook said she wouldn't leave her post despite Trump calling for her to resign over an accusation from one his officials that she committed mortgage fraud.

Trump appointee Bill Pulte, the head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged on social media last week that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.

Trump said in announcing the move that he had the constitutional authority to remove Cook, but doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity, as Trump would likely appoint a loyalist to the Fed's governing board with Cook gone.

Trump's plan to fire Cook threatens the Fed's venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here's why the central bank's independence matters:

The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy, which strengthens or weakens based on cuts or increases to the short-term interest rate the central bank controls.

Cutting the rate — which typically happens when the economy falters — can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. Raising the rate — which the Fed does to cool the economy and combat inflation — can weaken the economy and cause job losses.

Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliances more expensive.

Most investors also prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the peninsula has grown more unstable in the past few years as Pyongyang continues to develop its nuclear programs and is “at the final stage of developing” intercontinental ballistic missiles. 

“The hard facts are that the number of nuclear weapons that North Korea possesses has increased 2.5 times during the past three to four years,” Lee said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies after meeting with Trump in the White House. “And their ability to produce fissile material has increased tremendously.” 

Lee said Seoul has increased its defense capabilities but is at a disadvantage without nuclear capability. He called for efforts to stop the situation from getting worse.

The recently defunded nonprofit that distributed federal money to public media stations across the U.S. is warning of another casualty when it shuts down next month: the resilience of the nation's emergency alert systems.

In 2022, Congress authorized $136 million for the Next Generation Warning System grant program, meant to help stations in rural, tribal and otherwise underserved communities repair and improve the warning systems that tell people about evacuation orders, Amber Alerts, tornado warnings, and more.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which manages the grant money, is shutting down Sept. 30 after Congress and Trump defunded it in July.

That could leave unspent millions in grant dollars that were awarded but not yet paid to stations, imperiling dozens of projects meant to save lives in emergencies. 

The need for robust and redundant warning systems was made tragically clear in July when Texas floods killed at least 136 people, many in areas with spotty cellphone reception and no siren systems.

Adm. Daryl Caudle took over as chief of naval operations, the Navy's highest-ranking officer, on Monday, ending a six-month vacancy created by the Trump administration's firing of his predecessor.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ousted a growing list of top military leaders with little or no explanation. Hegseth fired Caudle's predecessor, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, without explanation in February.

Neither Caudle nor Navy Secretary John Phelan addressed the ouster at a swearing-in ceremony Monday, though Franchetti was among several former chiefs of naval operations in attendance.

Caudle showed his agreement with an often-repeated Trump administration phrase, saying, “Peace through strength works.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Monday with counterparts from eight seven NATO allies, Ukraine and the European Union about the Trump administration's efforts to forge a Ukrainian-Russian peace agreement.

In a brief statement that did not divulge any details of the conversation, the State Department said Rubio had spoken with the foreign ministers of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Ukraine and the top diplomat for the EU.

Rubio and the others “agreed to continue cooperation in diplomatic efforts to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end through a lasting negotiated settlement,” the State Department said.

Earlier Monday, Trump suggested multiple times that he might dispatch the National Guard to Chicago regardless of Gov. JB Pritzker's opinion, calling the city a “killing field,” an apparent reference to the Cambodian genocide.

Pritzker and other Illinois officials said the Trump administration has not reached out to Chicago leaders about any federal initiative to deploy military personnel to the city to combat crime the way the president has in the nation's capital. They cited statistics showing drops in violent crime in Chicago and cast Trump's move as performative, partisan and racist.

“Mr. President, do not come to Chicago,” Pritzker said, standing in a park about a mile from the Chicago skyscraper that features Trump's name in large lettering.

The governor said he would fight the “petty whims of an arrogant little man” who “wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish his dissidents and score political points.”

Trump signed an executive order on Monday threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding to local and state governments that offer cashless bail, arguing that it is a threat to public safety.

Cashless bail refers to policies that allow people to be released from jail without paying any money while they await trial. It is an alternative to the traditional cash bail system in which which people pay money to be released and get their money back if they return to court when they are supposed to.

Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of cashless bail on crime. Many focus on the recidivism of individual defendants rather than overall crime rates.

Loyola University of Chicago's Center for Criminal Justice published a 2024 report on Illinois' new cashless bail policy, one year after it went into effect. It acknowledges that there is not yet enough data to know what impact the law has had on crime, but that crime in Illinois did not increase after its implementation. Violent and property crime declined in some counties.

The president has signed a proclamation honoring 13 American servicemembers killed in a suicide bombing during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal of forces at the end of the Afghanistan war in 2021.

Surrounded by family members of those killed in the attack, Trump called the attack “the worst day, and in many ways the most embarrassing day in the history of our country.”

In May, Trump directed the Defense Department to conduct a review of what occurred during the U.S. withdrawal, and Trump said during the event that he expected that to be complete by the middle of next year.

Tuesday marks the fourth anniversary of the suicide bombing.

A bipartisan pair of congressional lawmakers are pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria after they were heartened by a visit with the country's new interim leader.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, told reporters on a call that they had talked with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa about permanently lifting sanctions and would make a push to have Congress do that in the coming months. 

President Donald Trump issued an executive order lifting the sanctions on the country in June, but Congress would need to act to make that move permanent.

Shaheen said the sanctions “are preventing investment in the country and the prosperity and opportunity that people want to see in the future.”

The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says that Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza needs to end after an airstrike on a hospital killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press.

“I personally am appalled by the bombing in Gaza and by the killing of journalists. And I think it needs to end now,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told reporters on a call from Beirut.

Shaheen was traveling in the Middle East as part of a U.S. delegation to meet with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Congressional Democrats, who once were stalwart supporters of Israel, have recently become more outspoken critics of how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has conducted the war on Hamas.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis noted that the government is temporarily prohibited from deporting Abrego Garcia under overlapping court orders currently in effect. 

She asked Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign if the government knows it is “absolutely forbidden at this juncture” to remove him from the U.S. under the current legal landscape. 

“Your honor, yes, we certainly understand that,” Ensign said.

Abrego Garcia was taken to a Virginia detention center after he surrendered on Monday, said the plaintiff's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, adding that they are concerned he would be moved to another facility later. 

Xinis said she will order that Abrego Garcia is not moved from the Virginia facility for now. She said she believed she must extend a temporary restraining order barring Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S.

U.S. Ambassador to France Charles Kushner did not respond to a summons to the French foreign ministry to answer complaints about an open letter he sent accusing French authorities of not doing enough to combat antisemitism, a French diplomatic official said.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with the ministry's practice, said Kushner, the father of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, did not appear for the meeting and was represented instead by his number two.

The official said the U.S. diplomat was told that Kushner's open letter to French President Emmanuel Macron “was unacceptable in both form and substance,” constituted interference in France's internal affairs and ignored the French government's efforts and policies on combating antisemitism.

Neither the embassy nor the State Department had any immediate response to the French official's description of the meeting. The State Department had said on Sunday that it stood by Kushner's criticisms and that the ambassador “is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.”

A network of clinics in Maine will not resume getting Medicaid funds to treat thousands of low-income patients during its lawsuit over Trump administration cuts to abortion providers, a judge ruled Monday.

President Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the “big beautiful bill,” blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. The parameters in the bill also stopped funding from reaching Maine Family Planning, a much smaller provider that offers health care services in one of the poorest and most rural states in the Northeast.

Maine Family Planning says Medicaid dollars are not used for its abortion services, which are a relatively small percentage of the overall services provided. It's unfair to cut off funding for the clinics “solely because Congress wanted to defund Planned Parenthood,” an attorney for Maine Family Planning told the judge earlier this month. But in his ruling Monday, Judge Lance Walker said the payments will not resume during the ongoing lawsuit by the provider seeking to restore the funds.

One of the duties for National Guard members in Washington will be cleaning up trash around the city, the military task force overseeing all the troops deployed to D.C. said Monday.

The D.C. National Guard posted a video on social media Saturday that showed troops cleaning up an area around a trail. They were shown hauling several garbage bags and cleaning up large amounts of rubber gloves from a park bench.

Officials said the effort is part of a broader “beautification” operation aimed at community restoration and improvement.

Task force officials wouldn't offer details about how often troops have been asked to clean up areas in Washington.

Those rules, broadly, say that while troops can use force, they should do so only “in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm” and “only as a last resort,” the military task force overseeing all the troops deployed to D.C. said Monday.

Troops first began patrolling the streets of D.C. with guns on Sunday -- just days after Defense Secretary Hegseth authorized the move.

The task force has directed questions on why the change was necessary to Hegseth's office. Those officials have declined to answer those questions.

Speaking in the Oval Office Monday, Hegseth said that it was common sense to arm them because it meant they were “capable of defending themselves and others.”

Trump made it a recurring theme on the campaign trail in both 2016 and 2024. 

He has drawn controversial comparisons between the city and war zones like Afghanistan, and in 2017, vowed to “send in the feds” in response to gun violence — a move that came even as the city was experiencing a broader trend of declining violent crime.

Violent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings are down 37%, and homicides have dropped by 32%, while total violence crime dropped by over 22%.

Crime in Chicago also represents persistent, localized challenges, said Kimberley Smith, director of national programs for the University of Chicago Crime Lab. The neighborhoods with the highest homicide rates experience approximately 68 times more homicides than those with the lowest rates.

Smith attributes much of the drops in violent crime to a focus in Chicago on the systemic drivers of violence, rather than the militaristic approach Trump has touted in Washington, D.C. She encouraged more federal investment in researching these types of violence prevention strategies.

“Kind of out of necessity Chicago has become a hub for innovation in gun violence prevention,” she said.

When asked whether he'd be open to sending National Guard troops into Republican-led states and cities with high levels of crime in addition to as Democratic-led states, the president said, “Sure, but there aren't that many of them.”

On the first day of school in Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she sympathized with the dilemma of immigrant parents who may be keeping their children home for fear of being detained or arrested by ICE agents.

“Parents are anxious. We've heard from a lot of them,” Bowser said, following a ribbon cutting ceremony for a newly renovated bilingual middle school. “Parents who need to make adjustments are going to be making adjustments, and that's a sad thing to say. Schools should be safe places.”

As schools opened across the capital city, parental social media groups and listservs were buzzing with reports and rumors of checkpoints and arrests from the hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel who have flooded the city.

Bowser didn't mention Trump by name, but harshly criticized any immigration crackdown that targets school children.

“Any attempt to target children is heartless, is mean, is uncalled for and it only hurts us,” she said. “I would just call for everybody to leave our kids alone.”

As South Korea's president described a prosecutor appointed by his country's National Assembly, Trump interjected, “Is his name Deranged Jack Smith, by any chance?”

Trump called Smith, who led two criminal cases against Trump before he took office for his second term, “a deranged, sick individual.”

“I'm only kidding. Maybe I'm not,” Trump added.

Trump suggested before his meeting with Lee began that a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place in South Korea.

By way of explanation, Lee talked about investigating what he called “turmoil” after former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly imposed martial law and was ousted from office.

A sizeable bruise on Trump's right hand was exposed during his meeting with the South Korean President Lee.

Last Friday, the president's hand was covered with a noticeable splotch of makeup that did not match his skin tone.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Asked about famine in Gaza, Trump talked about Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and about the people still being held hostage by the militant group.

He said the U.S. is spending a lot of money to help feed the hungry in Gaza and that, “I think within the next two to three weeks you're going to have a pretty good conclusive ending.”

President Trump said he would be traveling to China “at some point probably this year” after he said Chinese President Xi Jinping would like him to go to China. 

Trump called the bilateral ties “a very important relationship.” 

“We're going to get along with China,” he said. The two countries are seeking to strike a trade deal, after both sides called a truce in escalating tariffs and export restrictions.

Trump said he's resetting the economic relations with China, referring to his levying tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Since he took office, Trump has levied 54% tariffs across the board on Chinese goods, though his administration has paused 24%, pending final negotiations

In both of his appearances in the Oval Office Monday, Trump has mused about renaming the Department of Defense to its original name, the Department of War. 

The name was changed in 1949.

Trump said the previous name “had a stronger sound” and there might be an update on the potential name change “over the next couple weeks.”

The U.S. president responded to a question about whether he would return to the Demilitarized Zone that separates the Koreas by fondly recalling the last time he did so in 2019.

“Remember when I walked across the line and everyone went crazy?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon.

He recalled that everyone went crazy, “especially Secret Service.”

But “I loved it,” Trump said. He added that he felt safe because he had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator.

Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil in June 2019 during an unannounced trip to the DMZ.

The president suggested that the U.S. should do away with a lease covering a large joint American-South Korean military base.

“I would like to see if we could get rid of the lease, and get ownership of the land where we have a massive military base,” Trump said.

Osan Air Base is a joint U.S. Air Force and South Korean base on South Korea's west coast.

“I don't know that they'll meet, Trump said. “Maybe they will. Maybe they won't.”

Trump last week following his hosting of European leaders and Zelenskyy for talks, as well as speaking by phone with Putin, said that he was arranging direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy that might be followed by three-way talks in which he'd take part.

But Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made it clear Friday that Putin won't meet with Zelenskyy until the Ukrainians agree to some of Moscow's longstanding demands to end the conflict.

“It takes two to tango. I always say,” Trump said. “And they, should meet, I think, before I have a meeting and probably close the deal.”

While answering a question about the conflict, Trump said “this is a whole new form of war.”

He highlighted to use of flying drones, which have been widely deployed for reconnaissance and weaponry.

“A drone war never existed before,” he said. “We're actually studying it.”

“I would like to ask for your role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula,” President Lee told Trump. He even added that he'd like to see “construction of a Trump tower in North Korea and playing golf.”

Kim added of a possible upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, “I believe that he will be waiting for you.”

Trump said he had a very good relationship in his first term with Kim though he also called him “Little Rocket Man.” 

Trump repeated his suggestions that he could soon meet with Kim and suggested he could help work toward peace.

Lee Jae Myung complimented Trump's decorative touches in the Oval Office, to which Trump has added numerous gold accents around the room.

He told Trump the office “looks very bright and beautiful” and has “the dignity of America.”

He also said, “I think America is becoming great again.”

House Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer wrote that the Republican-led committee will probe “disturbing allegations that DC crime data is inaccurate and intentionally manipulated” in a letter to Metropolitan Police Chief Pam Smith.

Comer cited local reports that a police commander for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department was put on administrative leave after allegedly altering some crime statistics. Mayor Muriel Bowser has confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into the incident.

“In light of these reports and a related whistleblower disclosure made to the committee, the committee requests documents and information, as well as transcribed interviews with the district commanders of each of the seven patrol districts,” Comer wrote.

The move comes two weeks after President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency over crime in the nation's capital. More than 2300 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city along with a surge in federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, ICE, DEA and other agencies.

The Justice Department launched its own investigation into DC's crime statistics. Trump and Republicans have cast doubt on those statistics and scrutinized some local policing policies they allege reduced the reports of criminal acts.

The endowment is “updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the Administration Consequently, we are cancelling existing funding opportunities that fall outside these new priorities,” reads an email sent to novelist Marie Myung-Ok Lee, echoing language received by numerous authors who posted emails from the federal agency.

The fellowships were established in 2001 and have been awarded to hundreds of authors, including such prize winners as Jhumpa Lahiri, Andrew Sean Greer and Terrance Hayes. They offer up to $50,000 to fiction and nonfiction writers.

The NEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Like other federal cultural organizations, the NEA has faced cuts in funding and pressure from the Trump administration to emphasize more patriotic themes.

Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Trump.

He waved to the gathered press as Trump welcomed him on the West Wing driveway.

They are now headed for their meeting at the Oval Office.

Perhaps, the most significant announcement from last week's White House gathering with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leader was Trump affirming that the U.S. would support Europe's security guarantees for Kyiv once the Russian invasion ends.

But Trump said on Monday, “we haven't even discussed the specifics” of just how the U.S. would be involved in assisting a European-led effort. “But we'll be involved, and from the standpoint of backup, we're going to help them.”

Just before wrapping up his comments in the Oval Office, Trump said the administration would soon be reducing drug prices anywhere from 1,000% to 1,500%. He noted that many other countries pay far less for prescription drugs than people do in the U.S. Trump made a similar promise earlier in August.

Drug prices obviously cannot be reduced more than 100%, but experts have told the Associated Press that while the Trump administration has taken steps to lower prescription drug prices, there's no indication costs have dropped such a massive drop.

“I find it really difficult to translate those numbers into some actual estimates that patients would see at the pharmacy counter,” said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. She added that Trump's math is “really hard to follow.”

“I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un and North Korea,” Trump told reporters. He even suggested that he had a better relationship with Kim than almost anyone but Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.

“A lot of people would say, ‘That's terrible.' No it's good,” Trump added, recalling meeting with North Korea's leader during his first term.

“In fact, some day, I'll see him,” Trump said of a possible second-term meeting with Kim. “I look forward to seeing him.”

Israeli officials say of the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, only about 20 remain alive. The rest were either killed during the October 2023 attack or while in captivity, according to Israeli officials.

But Trump on Monday told reporters that are “probably a little bit less than 20 because I think one or two are gone.”

Trump did not elaborate on what his estimate is based on.

In long comments to reporters, Trump mixed up the name of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

“I did a favor for Christie, uh, for Christe Whitman. Uh, Whitmer,” Trump said of the Democratic leader of Michigan.

He was trying to describe an April meeting where Whitmer and the president discussed sparing an Air Force Base in Michigan from being closed.

But the president appeared to be mixing up Whitmer's name with that of Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey.

It was the kind of verbal gaffe Trump routinely says his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, might have made — claiming it was evidence Biden was mentally diminished.

In other comments Monday, Trump suggested Biden “didn't know he was alive” and “didn't know what he was doing.”

In a Truth Social post Monday, the U.S. president blasted critics of the government's new 10% stake in the chipmaker as “stupid,” adding he would make similar deals “all day long.”

Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett signaled the same Monday, telling CNBC that Friday's deal that some conservatives have labeled “socialism” was part of broader strategy of setting up a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in an array of companies.

“I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries,” the National Economic Council director said.

Asked about an overnight Israeli strikes on a hospital in southern Gaza that killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press, Trump said initially he wasn't aware the incident before offering: “I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it.”

“And I think he's very bad for votes,” Trump said. He also criticized “liberal courts” for protecting Abrego Garcia, but added, “We have that under control.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking in the Oval Office at Trump's side, said of Abrego Garcia, “He will no longer terrorize our country.”

“The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be,” Bondi said.

The comments followed Abrego Garcia being detained by immigration authorities to face renewed efforts to deport him.

Trump and members of his administration have made unsubstantiated exaggerations in order to justify bringing the military into Democratic run cities such as Washington and Los Angeles. Here are just a couple examples from today:

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff on Washington: “You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed or mugged, or wearing their watches again. They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again.”

The administration offered no proof to support these statements.

More than 180 current and former employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a letter Monday warning that debilitating cuts to the agency charged with handling federal disaster response risks a catastrophe like the one seen after Hurricane Katrina.

Addressed to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, the letter contains six “statements of opposition” to current policies at FEMA, including a burdensome expenditure approval policy implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem which the signatories say reduces FEMA's ability to perform its missions.

It also critiques a DHS decision to reassign some FEMA employees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA workforce.

About 140 staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency were placed on administrative leave last month for signing a similar statement.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is applauding the decision to arm National Guard troops deployed to fight crime in Washington.

“It's just common sense to make sure they're armed,” Hegseth said. He added that troops are therefore, “Capable of defending themselves and others.”

Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital have started carrying firearms at Trump's direction — a major escalation of his military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by Hegseth.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin is calling on his party to “fight like hell” as he welcomes Democrats from across the nation to the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis.

In his welcome address Monday morning, Martin charged that President Trump is dismantling democracy and peoples' lives.

“This is not politics as usual. This is authoritarianism. It's fascism dressed in a red tie,” Martin said. “And all the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”

Martin is focusing his ire on the Republican president, but he's also confronting internal divisions in the DNC's first meeting since he became party chair. His critics believe the party isn't doing enough to push back against Trump.

“I get it. People are pissed off. I'm pissed off,” Martin said Monday morning. “We are still unified despite our differences.”

Vance slammed Democratic governors who've criticized the Trump administration for using National Guard troops to fight crime in big cities, saying “we want people to welcome us, to ask us” for sending in the military.

“They're angrier about the fact the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades,” Vance said of top Democrats.

He said Trump's Washington crackdown meant people who would have been killed are now “living, breathing” and going on with their lives in the nation's capital.

Trump signed the order that charges the Department of Justice with investigating instances of flag burning. Trump said those who burn the United States flag would be charged with inciting a riot and receive one year in jail with no opportunity for early release.

Trump said burning an American flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before.”

Trump's advisers said the executive order “wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment,” which protects the freedom of speech, but did not expand on what that meant.

The 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson ruled flag burning constitutes “symbolic speech” that's protected by the First Amendment.

Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) warned President Donald Trump against sending the National Guard to Chicago.

Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Monday, Pritzker railed against Trump's proposal to use the National Guard the same way he'd used it in Washington, D.C., arguing that such a deployment wasn't needed.

“We have crime like other cities do, but let's be clear, we are actually in better shape than the 30 biggest cities across the United States,” he argued. “It's important to understand that the president of the United States is doing this for theatrics.”

“Calling the military into a U.S. city to invade our streets and neighborhoods and disrupt the lives of everyday people is an extraordinary action, and it should require extraordinary justification,” Pritzker continued.

He then gestured to his immediate surroundings, implying that the peaceful atmosphere of Chicago's riverwalk was unanimous throughout the city.

“Does this look like an emergency?” Pritzker said.

He said Trump hadn't reached out to coordinate any such deployment.

“No one from the White House or the executive branch has reached out to me or to the mayor,” Pritzker said. “No one has reached out to our staffs. No effort has been made to coordinate or to ask for our assistance in identifying any actions that might be helpful to us.”

The Illinois governor also dabbled in popular Democratic speculation that Trump's mental faculties were slipping, replicating Republican attacks against former President Joe Biden's cognitive state. Pritzker had used the same attack angle during the 2024 campaign, often countering Trump's criticism of Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris's mental state by claiming he was projecting.

PRITZKER SAYS TRUMP ‘NOT IN GOOD SHAPE' AFTER NATIONAL GUARD THREATS: ‘TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE'

Trump has long derided the state of Chicago, complaining of its Democratic administration and crime. He took his criticisms one step further on Friday, saying the city was “a mess” and might require the use of active-duty troops.

“We'll straighten that one out,” Trump said, adding that after Washington, D.C., “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.”

The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said it would abide by any court decision on whether President Donald Trump has the legal authority to fire Board of Governors member Lisa Cook.

The Fed, in a statement from a spokesperson, noted that "Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."

The statement was the Fed's first response to Trump's announcement on Monday night that he was removing Cook as Fed governor because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.

The spokesperson did not explicitly criticize Trump for trying to remove Cook.

But the statement pointedly noted that "Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' "

"Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people," the statement said.

Trump separately told reporters on Tuesday that he would abide by any court decision on Cook's fate at the Fed.

"I abide by the court, yeah, I abide by the court," he said, while also predicting that the Fed's board would soon be comprised by a majority of his appointees after he selects Cook's replacement.

If Trump gains a majority of appointees, he might have better success at getting the Fed to lower interest rates sharply, as he has repeatedly demanded.

Any federal court challenge by Cook to her termination is likely to end with the Supreme Court issuing the final word on the dispute.

In the statement Tuesday, the Fed spokesperson said, "The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates — including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system."

"The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law," the spokesperson said.

"As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision," they said.

"The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses."

Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Tuesday that Trump "has no authority to remove" Cook.

"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis," Lowell said. "We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action."

Cook said Monday night that she would keep working at the Fed despite Trump's claim he had the power to remove her.

The Fed did not respond to CNBC's query about whether Cook was working Tuesday at the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., or remotely.

White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement, said, "The President exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause under 12 U.S.C. 242."

"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions," Desai said.

"KPop Demon Hunters" just made history, and it could make Netflix money for a long time to come.

The K-pop-infused movie is off to a better start than any other film in Netflix's history, the company said Tuesday. "KPop Demon Hunters" has generated 236 million views since its debut, more than any other Netflix movie in its first 91 days — and it achieved that feat in 65 days.

Netflix's animated smash-hit has shown remarkable staying power on the streamer's global charts, thanks to social media buzz and a viral soundtrack that's second on Billboard's Global 200 rankings. Its songs were so popular that Netflix brought a sing-along version to big screens last weekend, where it topped the box office with an $18 million haul in the US and Canada.

Netflix has already struck gold with "KPop Demon Hunters," but it may have found a gold mine.

If the streaming giant can leverage "KPop Demon Hunters" to build its own global franchise, Hollywood powerhouses like Disney should take notice.

"Netflix has always wanted to beat Disney — now it has the chance to try and prove it can match the Mouse House's franchise development," said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics.

Unlike Disney, Netflix doesn't have nearly a century of celebrated IP to lean on. Instead of using nostalgia in reboots and live-action remakes, it has to build its franchises from the ground up.

While Netflix has not created many movies or shows that will inspire generations of fandom, "KPop Demon Hunters" could be a notable exception.

"'KPop Demon Hunters' is Netflix's 'Frozen' — I see a lot of parallels," a Netflix employee who'd previously spent close to a decade at Disney told Business Insider.

Movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore chose a different Disney property as a parallel: "Maybe for young people today, this is like their equivalent of Star Wars."

Media companies from Netflix to Paramount are looking for their next signature franchise that leads to sequels and sparks merchandise sales or theme park visits, Dergarabedian said. A sleeper hit like "KPop Demon Hunters" is what film execs pray for.

"The entertainment industry loves nothing more than a surprise breakout hit," Dergarabedian said.

Netflix's first big challenge — creating a certified blockbuster — is complete, but its work is far from over.

Turning a hit movie like "KPop Demon Hunters" into a full-blown franchise "requires carefully calculated quality IP cultivation," Katz said. That means giving fans much of what they want, from sing-along events in theaters to sequels to merchandise, without overloading them.

Disney learned this the hard way with Marvel. It followed several billion-dollar blockbusters with a deluge of Marvel shows on Disney+, and the ensuing superhero fatigue has proven difficult to shake.

"Quantity trumped quality," Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige told Variety in June regarding Marvel's old more-is-more approach.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will soon have a "majority" of his own nominees on the Federal Reserve board of governors who will back his desire to slash interest rates.

Trump's comment at a Cabinet meeting came hours after he took the unprecedented step of moving to fire central bank Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, from the board.

Trump has already appointed two of the Fed board's seven governors, and he is poised to pick another to replace Adriana Kugler, who announced her retirement earlier this summer.

Trump has selected Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisors, to serve out the rest of Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31, 2026.

"We'll have a majority very shortly," Trump said Tuesday afternoon. "So that'll be great." 

"Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great," he said. "People are paying too high an interest rate. That's the only problem with us. We have to get the rates down a little bit."

The president had been asked who he was considering as a replacement for Cook.

"Well, we have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we're down to," he said. "I think I maybe, in my own mind, have somebody that I like."

He also once again hurled criticism Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has repeatedly rebuffed Trump's demands that he lower benchmark rates by multiple percentage points.

"Because of him and his high interest rates, the housing is less than it could be," Trump said of Powell. "We're going to get that straightened out very quickly."

Trump said in a letter issued Monday night that he was firing Cook over an investigation launched by his Department of Justice into allegations about her mortgages.

Cook will file a lawsuit to block her ouster, her attorney said Tuesday morning.

In a statement issued while Trump's Cabinet meeting was ongoing, the Fed said that Cook has indicated that she will ask the courts to "confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities" as a governor.

The central bank said it will "abide by any court decision."

The statement also noted, "Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people."

When a reporter asked Trump about that statement during the meeting, he said, "I'd abide by the court."

Around the same time, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump "exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause."

Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook will file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Donald Trump, her atto``rney said Tuesday.

"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook," the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, a day after Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud by Cook in firing her.

"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis," Lowell said.

"We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action."

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Lowell's statement.

The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's action, nor replied to CNBC's question about whether Cook is working at her office on Tuesday or remotely.

If Cook does sue, the case could end up being decided by the Supreme Court.

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 says that a president can fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board only "for cause."

That has long been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty while a board member.

The Justice Department last week opened a criminal investigation of Cook after she was accused of making false statements on home mortgage applications by Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte.

Pulte pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia claiming they were each her primary residence, which he claimed was done "in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms."

The documents would have been signed before Cook joined the Fed.

Trump cited those allegations on Monday night in a letter to Cook notifying her of her removal.

Cook responded Monday, saying in a statement, "President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so."

"I will not resign," she said. "I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022."

The Trump administration's latest escalation of the trade war with China has drawn several parallels to its origins back in 2018.

However, there is a significant difference: the degree to which U.S. companies looked to avoid rising tariffs by racing to bring in more and more products from China ahead of them.

When comparing the peak of frontloading that occurred in 2018 compared to 2025, U.S. shippers imported more than double the percentage of Chinese exports this year, according to data from ImportGenius.

To compare the differences, CNBC used data from ImportGenius that dates back to 2016 prior to the Trump trade war rhetoric.

In 2025, there have been three major frontloading events as a result of the changing tariffs.

Ahead of "Liberation Day," importers began rushing in containers from China starting in January, followed by a slight decrease in February and March. A second smaller frontloading occurred between March and April. The peak in the pulling forward of freight from China to the U.S. came in between June to July, where exports soared by 49% after tariff rates were lowered to 34%.

In 2018, the height of freight loading came in the Fall: between the months of September and October where there was a 12.2% increase in containers, and between the months of October and November, there was an additional 22% increase.

But there are signs now that the level of exports from China is starting to drop, seen in key shipping data like ocean freight bookings and ocean container spot rates.

"The difference in exports from China to the U.S. between July and August of this year is a 40% drop," said Lynn Hughes, an investigative analyst at ImportGenius. "Yes, the month isn't over yet, but realistically, we still only have a week. Considering the amount of demand already pulled forward at the beginning of the year and the steady decline, I feel we could be about to start seeing imports drop below 600k TEU for several months."

These orders have been entering U.S. ports in July and August. The ocean freight orders being placed in July and August will start arriving in September and October.

Spot rates on the Transpacific route have also steadily declined, according to maritime data company Drewry. Rates from Shanghai–Los Angeles fell 3% ($2,412/forty-foot equivalent unit/ feu), and the rate on the Shanghai–New York route reduced 5% ($3,463/feu).

On its website, Drewry noted, "The phase of accelerated purchasing by U.S. retailers, which induced an early peak season, has ended. In response to a decelerating U.S. economy and increased tariff costs, they are now scaling back on procurement. Hence, Drewry expects spot rates to be less volatile in the coming weeks."

Hughes said there was a four-month drop in Chinese goods entering the U.S., after the first frontloading event in 2018. The pattern has also been seen in several other frontloading patterns. This includes after the February 2025 frontloading, when US shippers raced to pull forward products ahead of "Liberation Day."

"We know what these patterns look like in shipping now, and this is the most imbalanced frontloading spike we've ever seen," said Hughes.

The Federal Reserve was mum on Tuesday when asked whether Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook was at her office — or working remotely — a day after President Donald Trump said he had fired her.

The Fed's press office and Cook's high-powered lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not reply when CNBC asked if she was working Tuesday, and if so, where.

Security at the central bank's headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., likewise would not say whether Cook was in the building.

On Monday night, Cook said that she would remain in her job despite Trump having told her in a letter posted on Truth Social earlier in the evening that he was removing her "for cause."

The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements on home mortgage applications, which are being investigated by the Justice Department.

"I will not resign," Cook said in a statement late Monday. "I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022."

Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, said that Trump did not have the authority to remove her because there was no legal cause for him to do so.

Pulte as evidence has pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia, which claimed they were each her primary residence. He accused Cook of "falsifying residence statuses ... in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms."

It is unclear how Pulte acquired the applications, and Cook has not been charged with any crime.

Lowell, in his own statement Monday, said, "We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action."

The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's announcement.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that he did not know who had the authority to halt Cook's paycheck or her access to the Federal Reserve buildings.

Lutnick demurred when asked if Trump could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for cause if Powell continued to authorize Cook's paycheck and access after the president had said she was fired.

"These are all 'what-if scenarios,'" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box."

"The answer is, the Department of Justice will go take this on and deal with this," he said.

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook and confirming her successor, then the majority of the seven members of the Fed's board would be Trump nominees.

Uncertainty around tariffs has caused even the wealthiest buyers of Lamborghini supercars to hold off on their purchases, CEO Stephan Winkelmann told CNBC.

While the White House recently announced an agreement with Europe on a 15% tariff rate, that rate hasn't yet taken effect for cars. Lamborghini and other European automakers are still paying a tariff rate of 27.5% on exports to the U.S. With the price of a Lamborghini starting at $400,000, many buyers are choosing to wait for more stable tariff rates before buying, Winkelmann said.

"Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place," Winkelmann said. "Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations."

Wherever the final tariff rate settles, however, Winkelmann said the levies will have some impact on the company's business. He said Lamborghinis can't be produced in the U.S., since the "made in Italy" promise is core to the brand. And he said that even the wealthy are sensitive to price increases.

"They are millionaires or billionaires for a reason, so they know what they're doing and why they're doing things," he said. "For us, free trade is the right approach. We all know that is what we want. But then there is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity, since we are in business. ... We are ready to face whatever comes."

For now, the company is fairly insulated from any immediate drop-off in demand, since it has a large back order. Cars being delivered today were ordered a year or two ago. Lamborghini announced this summer to dealers that prices would increase by 7% for the Temerario and Urus models and 10% for the Revuelto.

The company, owned by Volkswagen's Audi Group, is also riding high from a wave of new models. It reported record revenue in 2024 of more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) and deliveries of 10,867 cars. It's launched three new models since 2023, all plug-in hybrids: the 8-cylinder Temerario, which replaces the Huracan; the 12-cylinder Revuelto, which replaces the Aventador; and the Urus SE, a hybrid SUV.

For an upcoming fourth model, Lamborghini had announced an all-electric grand touring car to debut sometime in 2028. But Winkelmann said with EV demand slowing, the company is considering releasing it as a hybrid instead and will decide by the end of the year.

"There is a flattening in the acceptance of electric cars, not only at the high end and exclusive supercars, but also in the general market," he said. "So the trend is going to be delayed in general, and we have to decide. For a car like Lamborghini, it's not important to be the first one to show a new technology, but to be there when it's accepted and to have the best technology at that time."

Last week at Monterey Car Week, Lamborghini unveiled a new limited-production supercar called the Fenomeno. It's the fastest and most powerful Lambo yet, boasting 1,080 horsepower and 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds thanks to a 6.5-liter, V-12 engine paired with three electric motors.

Lamborghini will make only 29 Fenomenos, which are part of what Winkelmann calls the "few-offs" strategy of super-rare, hyper-performance versions of its current lineup for top clients.

Also helping the company: a surge in wealth around the world that's becoming younger and more diverse. Lamborghini owners have an average of five cars in their garage, and owners of the higher-priced Lambos have an average of 10 cars. The average age of the Lamborghini buyer now is under 45, and in Asia it's under 30, he said.

"There are a lot of countries where we have very young customers," he said. "We have the second generation of wealth. But we also have a very young customer base of entrepreneurs who made their money themselves."

Relative to the growth in global wealth, however, Lamborghini's production has remained small. And while the U.S. is still its largest market, Lamborghini carefully manages supply in every country to make sure the brand remains exclusive and special, Winkelmann said.

"We will always look to make sure we do not crowd one market, and to have always a global view where we are selling the cars," he said.

Women, he said, will also be a key driver. The Urus has welcomed more women buyers to the brand, and Lamborghini is holding more women-focused events, like the "She Drives a Lambo" driving gatherings.

"We have always been a very male-driven brand, very attractive to males with the design and performance," Winkelmann said. "But on the other side, we are seeing that with the Urus, we have a lot more women stepping into the brand and having confidence with the brand."

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has quit its investments in U.S. machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks following a review of the companies' ties to conflict in the West Bank.

The executive board of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population and is valued at around $2 trillion, said Monday there was an "unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to serious violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war and conflict." The decision was based on recommendations from its ethics council, it said.

NBIM said that bulldozers manufactured by New York-listed Caterpillar were "being used by Israeli authorities in the widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property." NBIM had a $2.4 billion stake in the company at the end of 2024, representing around 1.2% ownership. CNBC has contacted Caterpillar for comment.

NBIM said it will divest from banks including First International Bank of Israel and its majority owner FIBI Holdings, Bank Leumi Le Israel BM, Mizrahi Tefahot Bank and Bank Hapoalim BM. The businesses had provided financial services needed for construction activity in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which had been "established in violation of international law," NBIM said. CNBC has reached out to the banks for comment.

NBIM has come under growing political and public pressure to divest from its investments in firms linked to conflict in Palestinian territories, particularly with Norway heading to the polls in two weeks. In an interview with Sweden's Dagens Industri, NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen last week described the fund as facing a "crisis," and said he regretted that he had not flagged an issue with the fund owning a stake in an Israeli fighter jet company while strikes on Gaza escalated.

Earlier this month, NBIM announced it would review its investments in Israeli companies in response to a request from Norway's Ministry of Finance, which flagged questions related to the deteriorating situation in Gaza and the West Bank. NBIM also said it would sell all holdings of Israeli companies outside of its equity benchmark index "as soon as possible," and terminate contracts with external asset managers in Israel. There were 56 Israeli companies in its benchmark index at the end of the first half of the year, which it had reduced to 38 as of Aug. 14.

The fund is meanwhile balancing its mandate to generate the highest possible net returns, while seeking to avoid any political backlash in the U.S., a supporter of Israel.

Around 55% of the fund's equity investments are in the U.S., with 70% of its portfolio allocated to stocks. The fund's high weighting toward the tech sector helped drive a $222 billion annual profit last year, followed by a $40 billion loss in the first quarter.

Critics of calls for Israeli divestment note that the fund continues to invest in the assets of other countries that have faced accusations of human rights violations, along with oil and other politically controversial sectors.

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has risen to a record high this year even as Israel has engaged in war on multiple fronts.

NBIM Deputy CEO Trond Grande told CNBC on Aug. 12 that the fund would continue to be invested in Israel via the benchmark index.

While acknowledging " increased scrutiny" within Norway, Grande said: "What we're doing now is really not down-weighing, I wouldn't put it like that, but we are trying to simplify our portfolio in Israeli equities, because we have ethical guidelines as well."

"What's key to us is that we're not invested in companies that could be in some way, shape or form, contributing to violating the ethical guidelines that we have," he said.

"The exclusions by NBIM highlight the unavoidable collision between business and human rights," Ana Nacvalovaite, research fellow at University of Oxford specializing in sovereign wealth funds, told CNBC.

NBIM "has not engaged in ad hoc sanctioning, but applied criteria long embedded in its mandate. Historical data from the fund has shown that ethical screens have barely dented long-term returns so far and in some cases improved them, it remains to be seen how this move will impact the [sovereign wealth fund's] investments," Nacvalovaite said.

"This has been a clear signal that the mandate is applied universally, whether to U.S. industrials or Israeli lenders."

EchoStar stock roared more than 75% higher on Tuesday after AT&T said it agreed to purchase certain wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for about $23 billion in an all-cash deal.

The sale will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, with the licenses covering more than 400 markets across the U.S., AT&T said. The deal is expected to close in mid-2026, pending regulatory approval.

EchoStar said in a regulatory filing that the transaction is part of the company's "ongoing efforts to resolve the Federal Communications Commission's inquiries."

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr wrote in a May letter addressed to EchoStar cofounder and Chairman Charlie Ergen that the agency's staff would investigate the company's compliance with federal requirements to build a 5G network.

The letter followed complaints from Elon Musk's SpaceX that EchoStar had left "valuable mid-band spectrum chronically underused," and the FCC should take steps to let "new satellite entrants" put it to use.

SpaceX owns Starlink, which provides internet service through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites.

As part of Tuesday's announcement, AT&T and EchoStar also agreed to expand their network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator providing wireless service under the Boost Mobile brand.

"EchoStar and Boost Mobile have met all of the FCC's network buildout milestones," Ergen said in a statement. "However, this spectrum sale to AT&T and hybrid MNO agreement are critical steps toward resolving the FCC's spectrum utilization concerns."

AT&T CEO John Stankey told CNBC that the deal is "a win all the way around."

"It's a fantastic opportunity to see more services put together the way customers want to buy them together," Stankey said in an interview on "Squawk Box." "And as a result of that, I think ultimately regulators are going to look at this and say it's very, very attractive."

AT&T shares fell more than 1%.

The job market's boy problems are getting worse.

A new analysis of publicly available data shows that unemployment is rising among younger men, and their labor force participation is stagnating. The good news is that there are some fixes.

"Over the last year, things have gotten worse for young men," Sara Estep, an economist at the Center for American Progress and one of the report's authors, told Business Insider. While young men's unemployment levels are below historical levels, "things are definitely moving in the wrong direction."

The analysis highlights both the issues plaguing the male workforce and where men are making strides; it also illustrates where policymakers and worker organizations can step in.

Fewer men in the workforce could lead to understaffed industries and weigh on the coffers of Social Security — and the men who aren't working might be at risk of worsening mental health and declining happiness. Funneling younger men toward secondary education and vocational school might help; so can opening up opportunities for workers with disabilities.

The working status — or lack thereof — of younger men and men who are considered prime working-age, which is 25 to 54, has been plaguing the economy over the last few years. A Pew Research Center analysis found that, in 2021, 25-year-old men were less likely than their predecessors in older generations to work full-time and to have achieved financial independence. Young men are more likely to be living with a parent than their female peers.

But once they reach post-education age, there's another reason men may not be participating in the workforce: disability. The average share of men ages 22 to 27 who cited disability as their reason for nonparticipation in the labor force was 4% from April to June 2025, compared to 2% among women. As the report notes, men are more likely to work in environments that lend themselves to injury; the rise in disability might also be chalked up to an aging population, long COVID, and better medical diagnostics.

Estep said that's one place where policy could step in. Eliminating or beefing up measures like the subminimum wage, which allows employers to hire workers with disabilities at a rate below the federal minimum, could make an impact — although a Biden-era proposed rule to bring disabled workers up to the minimum wage was withdrawn in July.

"If wages are rising, that typically pulls people into the labor force that might've been outside of it before," Estep said.

Some younger men might be catching on to a fresh path forward. The analysis found that young men's enrollment in vocational schools jumped from 2022 to 2023, the highest share of young men's enrollment since data first started being collected.

It's unclear whether that's part of a larger trend or a yearlong blip in the wake of a destabilizing pandemic and labor market. It might reflect Gen Z's growing interest in the trades, especially as industries traditionally dominated by men contract and work like healthcare shows robust growth.

"I think there is still a lot to do for men in education. We're seeing worse outcomes for men across the board and boys," Estep said. "And so investments in early childhood, improvements to the way that men move through the educational system and track into college or a skilled trade might be something worth pursuing."

Of course, gender disparities persist across the workforce and labor market; women still contend with wage gaps and are more likely to leave the labor force over caregiving. Estep said that addressing labor market concerns — like those of men eschewing work or women getting shortchanged on pay — is not a zero-sum game. Things like funding toward affordable, high-quality childcare that would mean women can work would also help keep the labor market staffed.

"There are plenty of ways we can grow the labor force, and we hopefully aren't in a situation where we only can pick one thing," she said.

Frontier Airlines is going after customers of Spirit Airlines, whose financial footing has gotten so shaky in recent weeks that it warned earlier this month it might not be able to survive another year without more cash.

Frontier on Tuesday announced 20 routes it plans to start this winter, many of them in major Spirit markets like its base at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. Frontier overlaps with Spirit on 35% of its capacity, more than any other airline, according to a Monday note from Deutsche Bank airline analyst Michael Linenberg.

Some of Frontier's new routes from Fort Lauderdale include flights to Detroit, Houston, Chicago, and Charlotte, North Carolina. It's also rolling out routes from Houston to New Orleans; San Pedro Sula, Honduras; and Guatemala City.

Frontier had tried and failed to merge with its budget-airline rival several times since 2022.

"I'm not here to talk about M&A," Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday when asked whether Frontier would buy Spirit. Biffle said he expects that Frontier would pick up the majority of Spirit's market share if Spirit collapsed.

Both carriers have struggled from changing customer tastes for more upmarket seats and trips abroad, an oversupply of domestic capacity, and higher labor and other costs. Spirit's situation has become more dire however, after it emerged from four months of bankruptcy protection in March facing many of the same problems.

Ultra-low cost airlines are also challenged by larger rivals like United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines that have rolled out their own no-frills basic economy tickets but also offer customers bigger choices of destinations and other perks on board like snacks and beverages.

Stock prices of rival airlines surged after Spirit's warning earlier this month.

Biffle said the carrier wants to become the country's largest budget airline and has rolled out loyalty matching programs to grab more customers. Frontier's capacity was slightly smaller than Spirit's in the second quarter, through the latter had slashed its flying by nearly 24% from a year earlier, while Frontier was down only 2%.

Spirit last week said it drew down the entire $275 million of its revolver and while it reached a two-year extension on its credit card processing agreement with U.S. Bank National Association, it agreed that it would hold back up to $3 million a day from the carrier.

The airline lost $245.8 million in the second quarter. Frontier lost $70 million.

Spirit has been looking for ways to slash costs, including furloughing and demoting hundreds more pilots and cutting unprofitable routes. Hundreds of flight attendants are on unpaid leaves of absence.

Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in an Aug. 12 staff memo after its "going concern" warning that "the team and I are confident that we can build a Spirit that will continue to provide consumers the unmatched value that they have come to expect for many years to come."

The carrier reached a deal with bondholders who agreed to convert debt to equity in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn't cut other costs like renegotiating aircraft leases. Leasing firms have been reaching out to rivals in recent weeks to gauge whether competitors would take any of the Airbus planes that are in Spirit's hands, according to people familiar with the matter.

Top officials at the Pentagon are "thinking about" whether the U.S. should acquire equity stakes in leading defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday.

The Cabinet secretary, in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box," revealed the Defense Department's interest in taking those stakes days after the U.S. government acquired 10% of Intel stock in a roughly $9 billion deal.

Lutnick was asked if the Trump administration would repeat that move with other companies that do business with the government.

"Oh there's a monstrous discussion about defense," Lutnick replied.

Lockheed, which makes most of its revenue from federal contracts, is "basically an arm of the U.S. government," he said.

"But what's the economics of that? I'm going to leave that to my Secretary of Defense and the deputy Secretary of Defense."

"These guys are on it and they're thinking about it," he said.

Lutnick added that President Donald Trump is rethinking how the U.S. ought to finance its munitions and other defense capabilities.

"I tell you, the way it has been done has been a giveaway," Lutnick claimed. His remark could suggest that the Trump administration is considering a major overhaul of Pentagon appropriations, which are approved annually by Congress.

A Lockheed spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, "As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense."

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Lockheed is the world's top defense company by revenue, according to DefenseNews' 2024 list. Other top U.S. contractors include RTX, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing.

Trump's move to take ownership of a chunk of Intel, an embattled chipmaker, is a major escalation in his efforts to achieve his economic goals by exerting more and more government control over the private economy.

Trump said Monday that he would make similar deals "all day long."

Lutnick said Friday that the agreement Trump struck with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan "strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge."

But the move has drawn heated criticism — including from some conservatives, who warn that Trump's action cuts against free-market principles and poses risks for both Intel and the economy.

"The most immediate risk is that Intel's decisions will increasingly be driven by political rather than commercial considerations," economist Scott Lincicome of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., wrote in an X post, "If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn't the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?"

The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened on Tuesday with short-term yields falling and long-term yields rising after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank's board.

The 2-year yield was more than 4 basis points lower at 3.687%, while the 30-year yield added 2 basis points to 4.909%. The 10-year Treasury yield was less than 2 basis points lower at 4.26%. One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors bet on lower rates in the near future, but higher rates over the long-term after Trump chipped away at the Fed's independence by announcing the removal of Cook from her position via a post on his platform, Truth Social.

The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook made false statements on one or more of her mortgage agreements.

Cook will sue her removal by Trump, with her attorney saying in a statement Tuesday that the president has "no authority" to do so. Cook had said in a statement Monday evening that Trump "purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so." Cook, who is the first Black woman to become a Fed Governor, also said: "I will not resign" and that she will continue to serve in her role.

"The President is going to remake the Board Governors of the Federal Reserve over the next year, and he's doing so in very unconventional ways – we've had a resignation and now a termination, opening the door to accelerate this change," said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. "Trump has essentially usurped the Fed's forward guidance function for the time being and telling markets lower rates are coming, which is being manifest in a steeper yield curve, with short term treasuries dropping like a rock."

And so investors bet perhaps the Fed would be less attentive to inflation in the future, making ownership of long-term bonds less favorable and sending those rates lower. The U.S. dollar declined vs. various currencies for a similar reason.

Investors also parsed through a raft of economic reports Tuesday. July's U.S. durable goods orders reading was better than economists polled by Dow Jones had expected. Consumer confidence data for August also came in stronger than expected.

They will now look to the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, later in the week for clues as to whether inflation is in a place where it would make sense for the central bank to lower rates, regardless of the political encroachment by Trump.

"State-owned enterprise" is a term you wouldn't normally bandy about when mentioning the United States — especially not with the country's Republican party, which has been associated with a laissez-faire approach to businesses and the economy.

If White House gets it way, however, it appears that the government's 10% stake in Intel is just the start. U.S. President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post signaled favoring companies that strike similar "lucrative" deals with the government.

Earlier in the day, Kevin Hassett, Trump's economic advisor, told CNBC that "at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries."

Even though Intel's stock popped when news of the deal broke, the chipmaker in a filing on Monday warned that its agreement with the Trump administration could draw "adverse reactions" from investors, customers and foreign governments.

That's not an unwarranted fear: Recall how China has been urging its local companies to avoid Nvidia chips amid the chipmaker's revenue-sharing deal with Washington, or how consumers have steered away from Elon Musk's Tesla because of his stint in the White House.

Perhaps, it isn't so much "state-owned enterprises," but "Trump-associated enterprises," that might be fueling investor worries.

— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report

Trump threatens 200% tariffs on China over rare earths. If Beijing withholds exports of the magnets, Trump will charge the country "200% tariffs or something," he said Monday stateside. One analyst thinks it's a signal that Trump wants a deal soon.

Trump fires Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In a letter posted on Truth Social, the U.S. president said he has determined "sufficient cause" to terminate her "immediately." Cook responded that Trump "has no authority to do so" because "no cause exists under the law."

Countries with digital services tax will attract 'substantial' new tariffs, vows Trump. In addition to tariffs, Trump also said in a Monday post on Truth Social that he would restrict chip exports to those countries.

U.S. stocks lost steam on Monday. All three major indexes fell, giving back some of Friday's gains. On Thursday, Interactive Brokers will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the S&P 500. Asia-Pacific markets declined Tuesday.

[PRO] Consider this Nvidia derivative, CIO says. Nvidia earnings, out Wednesday, are in the limelight this week. But one chief investment officer thinks it's worth looking at a Nvidia partner also benefiting from artificial intelligence.

Ships, planes, billions in investment pledges: South Korea's Lee charms Trump with deals

The U.S. and South Korea announced a series of agreements Monday in Washington, including multibillion-dollar investments, record $50 billion aviation purchases by Korean Air, and new energy cooperation, as leaders from both countries met in the Oval Office.

"We really sort of need each other. We love what they do. We love their products. We love their ships. We love a lot of the things that they make, and they love what we have," U.S. President Donald Trump said during his press conference with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

Trader Notes: Crypto chart analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin sentiment on social media has dropped to its lowest point since June, signaling heightened negativity across the market.



Ted Pillows marked Bitcoin's current level as a key support. A bounce here could trigger a reversal, but a breakdown risks sharper downside.

Glassnode data revealed long-term Bitcoin holders have already realized more profits this cycle than in every previous cycle except 2016–2017, indicating elevated sell pressure. Combined with other indicators, analysts suggest the market may be moving into its late-cycle phase.



Crypto trader Rager added context, noting Bitcoin's setup looks nearly identical to the September–January 4-month uptrend that ended with a swing failure pattern (SFP) and new highs before correcting and then launching another major rally in April 2025.

While the depth of the coming correction remains uncertain, it was around 30% last time, he expects September and October could see a pullback, setting up a potential massive rally into Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

The US Department of Commerce plans to publish official economic statistics, including GDP data, on the blockchain, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday during a White House cabinet meeting.

“The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain because you are the crypto president,” said Lutnick in a wide-ranging address that touched on tariffs, semiconductors, patents, and trade deals.

The plan focuses on releasing GDP figures on-chain to enable people to “use the blockchain for data distribution,” Lutnick said. The department aims to expand its capability across other government agencies.

“We're going to make that available to the entire government so all of you can do it,” Lutnick said. He noted that officials are “just ironing out all the details” to implement the program.

The move would mark one of the first major implementations of blockchain technology for US government economic reporting.

Elon Musk, ex-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously explored the implementation of blockchain technology at the government entity to improve transparency, automate tracking of federal spending, secure sensitive data, and streamline payment processes.

However, the initiative remained in exploratory phases without full-scale implementation before Musk departed from DOGE.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Parallel Finance, a defunct NFT lending platform, imposed a $500 late withdrawal fee after suspending services in August 2025, leaving users with $800K+ in high-value NFTs locked in smart contracts.

- Users struggled to recover assets via Etherscan due to technical barriers and low trading volumes, despite a six-month shutdown notice, sparking frustration over opaque recovery processes.

- CEO Yubo Ruan justified fees as operational cost coverage, while critics accused the platform of exploiting users, highlighting risks of centralized control in DeFi ecosystems.

- Community members like 0xQuit provided free recovery guides, underscoring broader industry challenges in custody, accessibility, and governance for decentralized asset management.

Parallel Finance, an NFT lending platform that announced its closure in January 2025, has sparked controversy by reportedly demanding a $500 fee for late NFT withdrawals. The platform, which suspended its NFT lending services after a six-month notice period ending on August 1, left users with over $800,000 worth of high-value NFTs still locked in its smart contracts. These include notable collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Apes Yacht Club (MAYC), and Doodles. Despite the shutdown notice, many users failed to act before the deadline due to low NFT trading volumes and a lack of technical understanding for manual withdrawal processes [1].

With the platform's front-end no longer operational, users are required to interact directly with the contracts via Etherscan to recover their assets. This process, however, has proven challenging for non-technical users, leading to frustration and backlash. Screenshots shared on social media platforms showed CEO Yubo Ruan stating that a $500 fee would be charged per late withdrawal, citing the need to cover operational costs and protect lenders against potential losses [3]. Ruan also emphasized that if assets remained unclaimed, they would eventually be liquidated to repay lenders, according to publicly shared community guidelines [2].

The situation has drawn attention to the broader challenges of custody and accessibility in the NFT lending space. On-chain analyst 0xQuit, a former team member of Yuga Labs, highlighted the problem on X and provided a step-by-step guide for manual asset recovery. While 0xQuit offered to assist with free guidance, the overall experience underscores the complexities and risks associated with relying on centralized platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem [2]. Many users, particularly those unfamiliar with blockchain mechanics, found themselves unable to navigate the technical hurdles of direct contract interaction, raising concerns about the practicality of "self-sovereign" digital asset management [1].

The closure of Parallel Finance also reflects a broader trend in the NFT market, where platforms struggle to maintain relevance amid declining trading volumes and shifting user interests. The incident illustrates how even well-publicized shutdowns can lead to unforeseen complications for users who may not be actively engaged with the market at the time of notice [3]. It also highlights the potential for opportunistic behavior by platform operators, as some users have accused Parallel Finance of leveraging the situation to impose exorbitant fees for asset recovery [2].

In response to the platform's absence of support, independent community members like 0xQuit have stepped in to bridge the gap. However, the episode has raised questions about the need for clearer governance structures and more user-friendly interfaces in the NFT lending space. As the market continues to evolve, incidents like these emphasize the necessity for robust user education and standardized protocols for asset recovery in decentralized systems [1].

 Ethereum price forecasts range from $7,500 by year-end and up to $20,000 in the most bullish scenarios. 

Key takeaways:

Dormant whale buys $28M in ETH as price drops 13%, signaling accumulation.

Whales, BitMine, and ETFs add billions in ETH, reinforcing bullish demand.

“V-shaped” recovery pattern emerges, with analysts eyeing $7.5K–$20K targets.

An Ethereum whale wallet has resurfaced after four years of silence, scooping up $28 million worth of Ether (ETH) in a move that has stirred bullish chatter across the market.

On Tuesday, the entity withdrew 6,334 ETH (worth around $28.08 million) from Kraken in the past hour, according to onchain data cited by analyst CryptoGoos. The same address last interacted with the exchange in 2021. 

Ether has dropped more than 13% since Sunday, slipping from above $5,000 to around $4,315, a decline the whale appears to have treated as a buying opportunity. 

The transfer is noteworthy because whale outflows from exchanges are typically seen as a bullish signal, suggesting accumulation and long-term holding, rather than imminent sell pressure.

Other whale wallets have made even larger ETH purchases. 

On Tuesday, crypto exchange Bitstamp sent 20,000 ETH to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. That indicates an exchange-to-self-custody flow typically associated with accumulation.

Moreover, according to data resource Arkham Intelligence, a single whale bought and staked around $2.55 billion in ETH via Hyperliquid on Monday. 

These moves coincide with BitMine's continued push into Ethereum. Over the past week, the firm added $252 million in Ether, which has pushed its total holdings to 797,704 ETH (valued at roughly $3.7 billion).

BitMine has an additional $200 million in reserves for further Ethereum purchases.

Spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted more than $1 billion in inflows since Aug. 21, according to Farside Investors data, thus almost erasing $925.70 million in outflows witnessed four days prior.

The steady capital adds to whale and corporate buying, reinforcing the view that ETH's dip is being treated as an entry point rather than a breakdown.

Ether's ongoing rebound from summer lows near $3,350 to above $4,000 resistance is forming a “V-shaped” recovery, echoing past cycle bottoms that preceded major bull runs, according to analyst GalaxyBTC.

In late 2020, ETH carved out a similar “V,” rising to more than $4,000 a year after plunging to roughly $100 during the March pandemic crash. A smaller version of this scenario unfolded in late 2022 when ETH recovered above $2,000 in early 2023 from under $1,200.

Ethereum's technical setups suggest ETH's price could climb toward $10,000-20,000 in the coming months. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, anticipates it to hit $7,500 by the year's end.

VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 26, 2025

USA News Group News Commentary

Issued on behalf of CEA Industries, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group News Commentary – Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $124,000 in August as institutional demand reached unprecedented levels, with digital asset treasuries raising $15 billion in 2025 alone—eclipsing traditional venture funding for the first time in crypto history. The surge reflects a seismic shift as public companies now hold 951,000 BTC worth over $100 billion, while crypto treasury firms have become the most liquid trading vehicles on U.S. exchanges. This transformation from speculative betting to strategic corporate finance has attracted Fortune 500 companies, mining giants, and technology leaders who recognize digital assets as essential hedges against inflation and currency debasement in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion. Leading this corporate revolution are CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC), Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL), Upexi, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPXI), Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (TSX: BITF), and MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA).



 



Wall Street analysts project corporate Bitcoin allocations could reach $330 billion over the next five years, up from $80 billion currently, as companies deploy sophisticated capital market strategies including convertible debt, equity offerings, and specialized treasury vehicles. The regulatory landscape has fundamentally shifted under Trump's crypto-friendly administration, with Treasury Secretary Bessent declaring America's digital asset frontier "open again" while the landmark GENIUS Act provides clear stablecoin frameworks that institutional investors have long demanded.

CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC) isn't your typical cryptocurrency story. While other companies scrambled to catch the Bitcoin wave or jumped on the latest trend, this Colorado-based firm made a calculated bet that could reshape how institutional investors think about digital assets.

In August 2025, CEA Industries completed a massive $500 million private placement specifically earmarked for one purpose: building the world's largest corporate treasury of BNB tokens. The company immediately signaled its commitment by changing its ticker symbol from VAPE to BNC, reflecting its new identity as the premier publicly traded gateway to the BNB ecosystem.

But what exactly is BNB? Think of it as the fuel that powers one of the world's busiest blockchain networks. BNB (originally called Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which processes millions of transactions daily for everything from trading and payments to smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold, BNB has real-world utility baked into its design. Users can stake it to earn rewards, pay transaction fees at discounted rates, and participate in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly, BNB features a quarterly "auto-burn" mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation, creating built-in scarcity that could benefit long-term holders.

Here's where CEA Industries gets interesting. The company didn't just raise money and hope for the best. They assembled what might be the most impressive crypto-focused management team on Wall Street.

David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital (one of the largest crypto investment firms), stepped in as CEO. Russell Read, former Chief Investment Officer at CalPERS (managing over $400 billion in assets) and Deputy CIO of Deutsche Bank Asset Management, joined as CIO. The board welcomed Hans Thomas, founding partner of 10X Capital, the firm managing BNC's treasury strategy.

This isn't a group of crypto newcomers making speculative bets. These are seasoned financial professionals who've managed billions of dollars and understand institutional-grade risk management.

The results speak for themselves. In August 2025, BNC announced the purchase of 200,000 BNB tokens worth approximately $160 million, officially making it the largest corporate holder of BNB globally. This wasn't just a headline grab—it demonstrated the company's ability to execute on its strategy quickly and at scale.

The timing appears strategic. While BNB consistently ranks among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, most U.S. investors still can't buy it directly through traditional brokerage accounts. CEA Industries recognized this gap and positioned itself as the solution, offering regulated, SEC-compliant access to BNB exposure without the complexity of crypto wallets or exchange accounts.

The company's financial backing adds credibility to its mission. The $500 million raise attracted over 140 institutional and crypto-native investors, including Pantera Capital, Arche Capital, ExodusPoint Capital Management, and Blockchain.com. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. served as lead financial advisor, bringing Wall Street expertise to the strategy.

What sets BNC apart from other crypto treasury companies is its singular focus. While competitors diversify across multiple digital assets, CEA Industries made an all-in bet on BNB Chain's ecosystem growth. The company believes this focused approach will allow it to capture maximum value as institutional adoption accelerates.

The potential upside follows historical patterns. When MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset in 2020, the stock gained nearly 2,000% at its peak. Similar treasury strategies by companies like Janover (Solana) and MetaPlanet (Bitcoin) produced dramatic stock price moves following their announcements.

CEA Industries has positioned itself to potentially benefit from this same dynamic, but with an asset that powers one of the most active blockchain ecosystems on Earth. With plans to deploy the remaining treasury capital and potential access to an additional $750 million through warrant exercises, BNC appears built for the long game in an ecosystem that's just getting started.

Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL) has achieved record-breaking growth in its USDC stablecoin circulation, reaching $61.3 billion at quarter end—a 90% year-over-year increase that has continued expanding to $65.2 billion as of August 10, 2025. The company's total revenue and reserve income grew 53% year-over-year to $658 million while completing a successful $1.2 billion IPO that established Circle as the leading regulated stablecoin issuer. USDC now commands a 28% stablecoin market share with 5.7 million meaningful wallets holding the digital currency.

"Circle's successful IPO in June marked a pivotal moment—not just for our company, but for the broader adoption of stablecoins and the growth of the new internet financial system," said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman at Circle. "This is an extraordinary moment for our company and industry, and we are seeing accelerating interest in building on stablecoins and partnering with Circle across every significant sector of the financial industry, with major internet companies and commercial engagement all around the world."

Circle is launching Arc, an open Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments with USDC as native gas, while expanding strategic partnerships with Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, and OKX to accelerate adoption. The company projects 40% compound annual growth for USDC circulation through multi-year cycles while building the world's largest stablecoin network.

Upexi, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPXI) has surpassed 2 million SOL in its treasury holdings worth approximately $334 million, representing a dramatic 172% increase from 735,692 SOL at the end of June 2025 following a $200 million capital raise. The company holds approximately 0.0339 SOL per common share and generates approximately $65,000 daily through an 8% staking yield on substantially all treasury holdings. Upexi strategically acquired approximately 57% of its Solana portfolio as locked SOL at mid-teens discounts to spot prices.

"During the month, we raised over $200 million and grew our Solana holdings by over 172% to 2 million SOL," said Allan Marshall, CEO of Upexi. "And we continued to generate additional value for shareholders via an estimated 8% staking yield and additional purchases of discounted locked Solana."

Upexi continues expanding its Solana treasury through strategic purchases while benefiting from network upgrades including increased block limits to 100 million compute units and the launch of REX-Osprey's Solana Staking ETF. The company trades at competitive valuations with a Basic mNAV of 0.88x while maintaining its core consumer products business alongside its cryptocurrency treasury strategy.

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (TSX: BITF) has reported strong operational results with $78 million in revenue and earned 718 Bitcoin at an average direct cost of $48,200 per BTC while maintaining 1,402 Bitcoin holdings (as of August 11, 2025). The company generated $100 million in proceeds from selling 1,052 Bitcoin at an average price of $95,500 during Q2 2025, demonstrating effective treasury management alongside mining operations. Bitfarms operates 17.7 exahash per second of mining capacity while expanding into high-performance computing and AI development.

"Our North American energy portfolio positions Bitfarms to be a leader in HPC and AI infrastructure," said Ben Gagnon, CEO of Bitfarms. "With over 1 GW in our Pennsylvania pipeline, anchored by our flagship Panther Creek campus which is in close proximity to Amazon and CoreWeave sites, we aim to capture significant market share in what is quickly emerging as a new AI infrastructure hub."

Bitfarms has commenced a corporate share buyback program purchasing 4.9 million shares at an average price of $1.24 per share while establishing a second principal executive office in NYC and committing to convert to U.S. GAAP. The company is advancing its multi-year pipeline of over 1.3 GW capacity with partnerships including T5 Data Centers for HPC/AI development at its Panther Creek campus.

MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) has produced 703 Bitcoin in July 2025 while increasing its Bitcoin holdings to 50,639 BTC, solidifying MARA's position as the second-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally. The company won 207 blocks during July and increased energized hashrate by 3% to 58.9 exahash per second despite facing higher global network difficulty. MARA maintains over $5 billion in liquid assets with nearly $1 billion raised recently to fund domestic growth and international expansion.

"Our Bitcoin holdings surpassed 50,000 BTC in July, a milestone that solidifies MARA as the second-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally," said Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of MARA. "More importantly, this is a treasury we built through disciplined infrastructure development, scaled operations, and focused execution. Looking ahead, what sets us apart is our thought leadership, worldwide operational scale, and capital and operational efficiency."

MARA is preparing to energize its Texas wind farm data center in the second half of 2025 while treating Bitcoin as a productive, risk-managed asset through disciplined treasury management strategies. The company's operational scale and capital efficiency position it for continued expansion in digital energy infrastructure and Bitcoin accumulation.

The Pudgy Penguins ecosystem is facing bearish pressure, as both its NFT collection and native token PENGU endure heavy selling pressure.

Despite this, trading activity spiked dramatically with 24-hour sales soaring to 400% and volume jumping to 338.5%. 

According to CoinGecko, the surge in activity was largely driven by forced liquidations on the Blur marketplace, which only fueled the decline further.

According to CoinGecko, the surge in activity was largely driven by forced liquidations on the Blur marketplace, which only fueled the decline further. 

In the past 24 hours alone, Pudgy Penguins NFTs shed another 5%, leaving holders in an uncertain position.

Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) has seen a fair bit of volatility of late. The stock fell about 13% over the last five trading days to roughly $125 per share. That's a sharp pullback, but it's worth remembering Circle listed at $31 during its blockbuster IPO in June and is still up roughly  4x since. The recent decline comes as investors worry about potentially lower interest rates ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted last Friday that a cut could be coming in September. Most futuristic stocks tend to celebrate that kind of news, but Circle is in a slightly different spot. Roughly 95% of its revenue last quarter came from interest on the cash and bonds backing its stable coins. So what's the outlook like for Circle as the interest rate cycle likely turns?

USDC Is Core of Circle's Business

Circle is best known as the issuer of USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin that runs on blockchains like Ethereum and Tron. The token is widely used across crypto trading, payments, and decentralized finance. The business is growing fast. Over the most recent quarter, revenues rose 53% year-over-year to $658 million, although IPO-related charges pushed Circle into a net loss. The real standout metric was USDC circulation, which jumped 90% from a year ago to $61.3 billion. Circle expects the circulation to compound at about 40% annually over the long run. And it's not just trading volume that's driving growth – USDC is also increasingly being used in cross-border payments and remittances by both individuals and businesses.

The U.S. has made significant progress toward regulatory clarity for stablecoins with the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. That could open the door to mainstream adoption, especially as large companies outside crypto explore stablecoins for remittances, B2B transactions, and e-commerce. That said, it still trails behind Tether's USDT, which dominates with about 67% of the dollar-backed stablecoin market versus USDC's 26%, per CryptoQuant. For the upside case, see Circle Stock To $300?

Big Bet on Arc Blockchain

Now Circle wants to go a step further. The company recently unveiled Arc, a new public blockchain built specifically for stablecoin payments. The move puts Circle in direct competition with payments giants like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), as well as the crypto networks it already relies on such as Ethereum and Solana. The shift is notable, as Circle would not just issue digital currency but also run the system that facilitates transactions and potentially collects fees.

USDC will continue to exist on public blockchains, but Arc represents a push to own the rails of the payments ecosystem. The challenge, however, is adoption. A network only works if enough players use it, and several others are building their own systems. Circle will need to prove that Arc is worth building on.  Can Visa And Mastercard Survive The Stablecoin Revolution?

Circle Risks

There are other challenges, too. Circle's non-interest revenues are also expected to soften in the second half of the year. Add in the interest rate factor, and the near-term growth of Circle's core revenue stream looks vulnerable if conditions shift.  Moreover, stablecoin demand is also tied to broader crypto cycles. Usage tends to rise during bull markets, when trading activity spikes, and fades during downturns. To illustrate just how volatile the crypto sector can be, let's look at crypto trading bellwether Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).

While COIN stock touched all-time highs of over $340 per share in late 2021, a few months after its IPO, it plunged to levels of around $30 by early 2023 – a roughly 90% collapse. The sell-off was driven by a broader unwinding of the crypto market. Coinbase has indicated that the crypto prices are subject to multi-year cycles, which is typically two to four years. And unlike Circle, Coinbase posted $3.6 billion in profit on $7.4 billion in revenue in 2021. Circle has yet to prove it can scale to these levels. Circle's revenue stood at $1.89 billion for the fiscal year ended March 2025, with profits coming in at about $172 million.  A deep downturn in crypto markets or weaker interest income could push the stock down further. Could Circle fall to $20?

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said it agreed to form a joint venture with Crypto.com that will invest in the exchange's CRO token as a treasury asset and go public by combining with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC).

As part of the agreement, Trump Media will buy about $105 million worth of CRO, roughly 2% of the token's total market cap, while Crypto.com will buy $50 million in Trump Media stock. CRO surged after the announcement, taking its 24-hour gain to 25%, according to CoinDesk data. It was recently 22% higher at 19.60 cents. DJT shares rose 3.5% to $17.82.

The venture will be called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy Inc. and plans to merge with Yorkville Acquisition Corp (YORK). It will trade under the ticker MCGA, which stands for “Make CRO Great Again,” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said on X. The company will become the world's largest holder of CRO with around 6.3 billion tokens, valued at roughly $1 billion at the time of announcement.

The move comes as publicly traded companies worldwide are jumping into crypto, buying assets including bitcoin BTC$109,820.14 and ether (ETH) as core investments and restyling themselves as crypto treasury companies even as their day-to-day operations still rely on industries as varied as such as pharmaceuticals, software development and online casino gaming. 

The trend was kicked off in 2020 by Strategy (MSTR), which now owns $69 billion worth of BTC. More than 3.6 million BTC valued at $396 billion is held in treasuries across 174 public companies and 60 private companies, according to bitcointreasuries.net.

Several companies are also buying altcoins, with billions of dollars being spent acquiring tokens like solana SOL$193.52 and ether ETH).

Marszalek described the initiative as “a historic day for CRO,” pointing to an initial $200 million in cash earmarked for further token purchases, plus additional commitments that could bring total available funds to around $420 million, alongside a $5 billion credit line. 

“This presents a differentiated opportunity for investors in the digital asset treasury space,” he said, adding that the mission of Trump Media Group CRO Strategy is to maximize what he called a “flywheel effect,” which involves raising funds to acquire more CRO.

The deal includes the creation of a new rewards system that will allow users to convert platform “gems” into CRO tokens, with further plans to enable subscription payments and discounted services using CRO.

Trump Media said it will custody and stake its CRO holdings with Crypto.com for additional revenue.

Despite a wider market sell-off over the past week, CRO performed well in the lead up to the news being released, rising from to 16 cents from 14 cents. Trading volume rose by 700% in the past 24 hours to $310 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

 Bitcoin is repeating earlier BTC price behavior, analysis suggests as a Coinbase Premium comeback joins positive ETF flows for a crypto market rebound. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is “getting closer” to its next local bottom after a trip below the $109,000 mark.

A positive Coinbase Premium returns, raising hopes of a US demand recovery.

ETF flows end Monday positive in a surprise comeback despite the BTC price downside.

Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around $110,000 at Tuesday's Wall Street open amid signs of a crypto market recovery.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility cooling after a fresh round of losses.

These had resulted in a wave of crypto long liquidations worth over $700 million for the 24 hours to the time of writing, per data from CoinGlass.

BTC/USD bottomed at $108,717 on Bitstamp, below old all-time highs seen at the start of the year. 

Amid fears of a $100,000 support retest or worse, some market participants saw reason for optimism.

“BTC is now getting closer to the bottom,” popular trader BitBull wrote in part of his latest X analysis. 

BitBull referenced encouraging signals from the US, where the Coinbase Premium Index reentered positive territory on Tuesday.

The Index measures the difference in BTC prices between the Coinbase BTC/USD and Binance BTC/USDT pairs, and when green, it implies strengthening US market demand.

“Coinbase Bitcoin Premium turned positive during bottom and long liquidations were huge. This shows that max. pain is here and a short rally is expected,” BitBull concluded.

Others also expected a rebound, with fellow trader Mister Crypto seeing a short squeeze next thanks to a significant build-up of short positioning above $115,000 on exchange order books.

Elsewhere, Cas Abbe, a contributor at onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, suggested that current price action is, in fact, familiar.

Bitcoin, he noted, had behaved similarly during a retracement in June, when BTC/USD reached all-time highs of $112,000 before dropping to around $98,000.

“BTC chart resemblance to Q2 2025 fractal is uncanny. Similar lower-lows and a capitulation which forced everything to think ‘it's over,'” he commented on the day.

An accompanying chart underscored the similarities.

In common with previous price drawdowns, institutional flows added to souring sentiment, with analytics resource Ecoinometrics drawing attention to the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

“The macro uncertainty of the past few weeks is showing up directly in the flows,” it concluded, adding that ETF outflows were “pulling Bitcoin lower.”

On Monday, the ETFs nonetheless achieved positive flows of just under $220 million, per data from UK-based investment firm Farside Investors.

Ethereum's pullback from all-time highs creates a "great entry point" for investors, according to Standard Chartered.

The bank's head of digital assets, Geoffrey Kendrick, believes Ethereum will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025 as institutional interest grows.

In a research note seen by Decrypt, he explained that Ethereum treasury companies and exchange-traded funds have purchased 4.9% of the ETH in circulation since June.

Kendrick argues that this buying pressure has played an instrumental role in helping the world's second-largest cryptocurrency surge to $4,953 on Sunday—eclipsing the previous all-time high set in November 2021.

"Although these inflows have been significant, the point is that they are just getting started," he added.

Last month, Kenrick had predicted that treasury companies will soon own 10% of all ETH in circulation—and now, he says that target is well on track to be met.

"ETH and the ETH treasury companies are cheap at today's levels," he wrote.

At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap data shows Ethereum is now trading at a 10.9% discount to the record highs set just two days ago.

Kendrick previously argued that it makes more sense for treasury companies to hold ETH rather than BTC as a reserve asset.

"ETH corporate treasuries can capture both staking rewards and decentralized finance (DeFi) leverage opportunities, which U.S. Ethereum ETFs currently cannot. As such, we think ETH treasury companies have even more growth potential than BTC ones," he wrote in a note on July 29.

That hasn't deterred investors from gaining exposure to ETH ETFs. SoSoValue data shows inflows stood at $443.9 million on Monday—more than double the $219 million that flowed into BTC-focused alternatives. And while BTC ETFs suffered outflows throughout the whole of last week, ETH funds managed to attract more than $628 million of capital across Thursday and Friday.

ETH has rallied by 32.6% in the year to date, considerably ahead of Bitcoin on 17.3%.

Oops, something went wrong

Following the all-time highs last week, Ethereum price has seen a strong pullback of over 10% and is currently flirting with $4,400.

As a result, some of the top non-fungible token (NFT) collections, such as Pudgy Penguins and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), have seen a sharp fall over the past week.

Data from DeFi aggregator DefiLlama indicates that leading NFT projects have experienced double-digit declines in floor prices over the past week, with blue-chip collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Doodles seeing the steepest drops. This comes despite growing demand for Pudgy Penguins' NFT Treasury.

Pudgy Penguins, the leading NFT collection, tanked 17.3% to a floor price of 10.32 ETH.

Similarly, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) declined 14.7% to 9.59 ETH, while Doodles saw one of the largest corrections, sliding 18.9% to 0.73 ETH.

Other notable collections, including Moonbirds and Lil Pudgys, dropped 10.5% and 14.6%, respectively.

However, with the Ethereum price pullback, not every NFT collection has faced the heat.

CryptoPunks, the largest NFT collection by market cap, showed relative stability with just a 1.35% weekly decline.

Even as floor prices fell, trading activity remained strong. Pudgy Penguins led the market with roughly 2,112 ETH (about $9.36 million) in volume, followed by Moonbirds at 1,979 ETH ($8.77 million).

CryptoPunks came in third position with 1,879 ETH (about $8.33 million), while BAYC recorded 809 ETH ($3.59 million).

Amid the double-digit declines in blue-chip NFTs, the broader NFT space has tanked by 5%, to $7.7 billion.

On August 13, data from NFT Price Floor indicated that the total NFT market capitalization reached $9.3 billion, marking a 40% jump from $6.6 billion in July.

The surge came as NFT activity picked up alongside an ETH price rally.

After hitting an all-time high of $4,900 last week, Ethereum price has seen some pullback.

Popular crypto analysts Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH will see some more fall to test its 200-EMA, currently at $4,088 levels.

The analyst noted that the higher timeframe structure is still bullish until the support for $4,000 is lost.

“Alternatively, a break and hold above ~$5K should be the green light for a proper price discovery phase,” noted the analyst.

Amid the broader crypto market volatility, degen meme coin Maxi Doge has seen a good demand upside, and has already raised more than $1.5M. This milestone comes within a month of launch, reflecting strong investor sentiment.

Branded as Dogecoin's “frustrated but ripped cousin,” Maxi Doge is positioning itself alongside established memecoins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and Bonk in the 2025 memecoin trend.

The project combines humor with utility, offering staking rewards (195% APY), exclusive access to an alpha-trader community, and planned integrations with perpetual trading markets.

Ether (ETH) set a new all-time high at $4,946 earlier this week, but the fuel from on-chain finance looks weaker than in prior cycles.

However, the total value locked (TVL) across the network's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem stalled at $91 billion, significantly below the $108 billion record set in November 2021, according to DefiLlama data.

In ETH terms, the gap is sharper: just under 21 million ETH are locked on Tuesday, compared to 29.2 million ETH in July 2021. Even earlier this year, the figure topped 26 million ETH. That means fewer tokens are actively tied up in DeFi than at any point since the protocol hit its price highs.

Charts show the disconnect. DEX volumes and perps flows remain active, but they have not returned to past peaks even with prices breaking fresh records.

Part of the shift is structural as layer 2s draw inflows. Coinbase-backed Base's DeFi TVL  is standing tall at $4.7 billion, alongside the growth of Arbitrum and Optimism. Capital efficiency has also changed the equation, with staking protocols like Lido concentrate liquidity without requiring the same bulk deposits that once inflated raw TVL.

“Despite ETH reaching record new highs, its TVL remains below past records due to a combination of more efficient protocols and infrastructure, as well as increased competition from other chains amid a lull in retail participation,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message.

“To reclaim those TVL peaks, we'd need a resurgence in retail DeFi engagement, broader adoption of Ethereum-native yield opportunities, and a slowdown in capital migration to competing chains or off-chain investments. Ethereum's scaling solutions also need to balance efficiency with incentivizing robust on-chain liquidity to drive TVL growth,” Ruck added.

Back in 2020 and 2021, TVL was the market's favorite growth metric. “DeFi Summer” turned yield farming into a speculative loop, with tokens flooding into Maker, Aave, Compound, and Curve in search of double- and triple-digit returns.

The rapid climb in TVL became a shorthand for Ethereum's dominance and eventually a signal of price momentum. But that dynamic looks weaker this cycle. Volumes on DEXs and perpetuals remain steady, but they haven't returned to levels that once defined Ethereum's breakout.

Part of the shift is structural. The rise of liquid staking protocols like Lido has made capital more efficient, concentrating liquidity without requiring the bulk deposits that once inflated TVL.

The divergence also reflects how this cycle is being driven. ETF inflows, institutional allocations, and macro positioning have been the dominant catalysts for ETH's record price, with net assets on such products jumping from $8 billion in January to over $28 billion as of this week.

Retail DeFi activity, the fuel of prior booms, has yet to follow. That leaves ETH looking less like the center of grassroots crypto speculation and more like a macro asset.

For ETH bulls, the hope is that record prices eventually reignite on-chain experimentation and pull capital back into DeFi.

Until then, the gap between token value and protocol usage serves as a reminder that this cycle is unfolding differently. If on-chain engagement doesn't return, ETH's record prices could end up leaning on thinner foundations than bulls would like to admit.

Trump fires Fed Governor Cook over alleged mortgage fraud

Is the U.S. economy currently 'too hot'?

The cryptocurrency market, which was stable over the weekend, faced a quick sell-off after political issues arose with President Donald Trump's move to fire Fed member Lisa Cook on Monday.

At the end of last week, statements from Fed chair Powell at the Jackson Hole meeting were seen as a clear sign of an interest rate cut in September, which was positively received by risky markets. However, events in the last 24 hours have led to increased selling, erasing the gains made from Powell's comments.

Bitcoin is trying to stabilize around $110,000 after dropping to $108,000. Ethereum, meanwhile, is looking to maintain its short-term upward trend after nearly reaching $5,000 on Friday.

BNB, a major altcoin, also hit a record high, reaching $900 by the end of the week. However, profit-taking and concerns about the Fed's independence led to a downward adjustment, bringing BNB back to its upward trend line.

Solana has been trying to break into the $200 range since July. Recently, it made a strong attempt to stay above $200 and was performing well over the weekend. However, the latest negative events, including the Trump-Fed tensions, also impacted Solana negatively. As a result, despite growing interest from institutions, SOL's price dropped sharply to around $185.



Over the weekend, Ethereum reached a new high of $4,955 but couldn't maintain that level or achieve a daily closing record. Recent price movements indicate ongoing selling pressure in the $4,670-$5,000 range, marking it as a strong resistance area.

Yesterday, the rapid selling slowed down at the 21-day EMA ($4,320), which has been a reliable support level since early August. This alignment with Ethereum's short-term trend suggests that it has been following an upward trajectory due to increasing bullish momentum since last month.

Globally, many believe that the Fed will soon start cutting interest rates, particularly after Powell's comments. This positive outlook has prompted signals that Ethereum's upward trend might continue. However, a surprise event yesterday caused market instability, causing the Stochastic RSI, which was rising, to shift back into the selling zone.

If Ethereum (ETH) can maintain daily closes above the $4,320 support level, it could continue its uptrend. This stability might encourage more buying activity, potentially allowing ETH to test the resistance levels again. Initially, the $4,670 level will serve as the first resistance point. If ETH can surpass this, the next target would be the $5,000 level. Should a breakout occur beyond these points, ETH could potentially move toward the $5,500 range in the short term.

On the downside, if selling pressure persists and ETH falls below $4,320, it could first drop to around $3,980. Falling further could result in a retreat to the main uptrend, meaning a potential decline to approximately the $3,600 range.



After reaching a record high in August and hitting $900, BNB experienced a pullback. During the recent sell-off, it found some stability at an intermediate support level between $835 and $840, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.414 level. However, the recent peak at the Fibonacci 1.618 level suggests that the bullish phase might be ending. To confirm this, short-term support levels will be monitored closely.

The first key support to watch is around $835, where the parabolic uptrend intersects with the 21-day EMA. If BNB closes below this level, the correction might become more noticeable. Additional support levels to watch out for are at $810 and $750 according to Fibonacci levels.

Conversely, if BNB experiences a strong buying wave this week and rises above $840 with significant volume, it could attempt another move towards the $900 level.



SOL has been trying to break the Fibonacci 0.618 level at $200 since last month, maintaining its uptrend that began in April. This level was tested again over the weekend but couldn't be surpassed due to market negativity about the Fed.

Currently, SOL's closest support level is around $185. If SOL stays above this level, and if the market can overcome the negative sentiment, it might make another attempt to reach $200. However, the market is currently more sensitive to negative news.

So, if global market conditions worsen further, SOL's price could drop to its second support level at $165, continuing the downward trend. On the other hand, if SOL remains above its rising trend line during this week's market fluctuations, its chances of establishing a base around the $200 mark will improve.

The US Department of the Treasury has opened a request for comments on ‘innovative or novel methods, techniques or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.'

The move fulfils a requirement under the relatively high-profile Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), which was signed into law by president Donald Trump last month (18 July) to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the US.

In particular, the Treasury Department is asking for views about ‘application program interfaces [APIs], artificial intelligence, digital identity verification, and use of blockchain technology and monitoring,' the department highlighted in a press release (18 August).

‘Innovative tools are critical to advancing efforts to address illicit finance risks but can also present new resource burdens for financial institutions,' the department states. ‘As required by the GENIUS Act, Treasury will use public comments to inform research on the effectiveness, costs, privacy and cybersecurity risks, and other considerations related to these tools.'

Comments need to be submitted by 17 October.

STABLECOINS & APIs: EXPLAINED Stablecoins are a type of digital asset / cryptocurrency, minted on a blockchain network, that seek to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. The world's two biggest stablecoins (by market capitalisation) are Tether and USD Coin – both are, like most stablecoins, pegged to the US dollar |An API is a connection (or type of software interface) between computers or between computer programmes.

The White House has described GENIUS as a ‘historic piece of legislation that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital currency revolution.'

The GENIUS Act ‘prioritises consumer protection, strengthens the US dollar's reserve currency status and bolsters our national security,' the White House stated in a ‘fact-sheet', adding that the law ‘will make America the undisputed leader in digital assets, bringing massive investment and innovation to our country.'

Trump backs the GENIUS Act ‘because it protects consumers from nefarious actors in financial markets,' the White House continued in the fact-sheet, explaining that the law – which requires stablecoins to have 100 per cent reserve backing with ‘liquid assets like US dollars or short-term treasuries and requires issuers to make monthly, public disclosures of the composition of reserves' – will ‘ensure [stablecoins'] stability and trust through strong reserve requirements.'

Under the new law, stablecoin issuers ‘must comply with strict marketing rules to protect consumers from deceptive practices', the White House stated, explaining that ‘they are forbidden from making misleading claims that their stablecoins are backed by the US government, federally insured or legal tender.'

The law was signed after the House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act on 17 July by 308 votes to 122 during what US lawmakers dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC. The Senate (upper house) had already given its approval the previous month.

RELATED ARTICLE Trump signs stablecoin act into law as Washington steps on crypto gas – a news story (21 July 2025) on the presidential signing of the GENIUS Act into law

The GENIUS Act is not immediately effective. It takes effect on the earlier of either the date that is 18 months after the enactment of the act (which would be 18 January 2027) or 120 days after the date on which the main federal payment stablecoin regulators issue any final regulations implementing the act.

On the challenge of ‘combatting illicit activity in digital assets,' the White House highlighted in its fact-sheet that the new law explicitly subjects stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act, ‘thereby clearly obligating them to establish effective anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programmes with risk assessments, sanctions list verification and customer identification'; and stated that it also improves the Treasury Department's ability to tackle illicit stablecoin activities by ‘enhancing its sanctions evasion and money laundering enforcement capabilities.'

Beyond Washington DC, the state of Wyoming last week announced the ‘mainnet' launch of its own stablecoin – the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT). A mainnet launch is a reference to the official activation of a blockchain network – meaning FRNT is moving from a testing environment (‘testnet') to a live, operational state where real transactions and applications can occur.

FRNT, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is a groundbreaking digital money programme for the public sector as the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US – an eye-catching development given that traditional stablecoins are issued by private companies.

Meanwhile other government agencies worldwide are stepping up their use of identity verification to tackle financial fraud. For example, the UK's Companies House confirmed earlier this month (5 August) that legal requirements for directors and ‘people with significant control' of companies to verify their identities will begin on 18 November. ‘Companies of all sizes will benefit from more accurate and trustworthy register data and greater protections against fraud,' the agency said, explaining that people can verify their identity through GOV.UK One Login or through an ‘Authorised Corporate Service Provider' (ACSP).

Bringing Crypto & Finance Closer to You

Home » Cryptocurrency

The Middle East is emerging as a pivotal region in global crypto regulation. Governments are crafting frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. In sectors such as real estate and payments, we've already seen tangible usage, while CBDC pilots offer a glimpse into future financial infrastructure. Explore the full article to see how regulations are shaping the digital asset landscape across the region.

Crypto regulation across the Middle East is shifting from ambiguity toward structured frameworks. Licensing regimes, from VARA in Dubai to Bahrain's CRA module, are enabling legitimized platforms, drawing both startups and institutional giants. Clear tax positions, such as Saudi Arabia's zero personal capital-gains policy and Bahrain's tax-free atmosphere, further attract digital investment. Meanwhile, GCC-wide CBDC pilots and growing KYC enforcement indicate a region preparing for a digital financial future. As regulatory clarity continues to converge, the Middle East stands poised to lead in regulated crypto innovation and adoption.

For years, the SEC has been painted as the cop on the beat when it comes to crypto, more likely to file an enforcement action than to roll out the welcome mat.  But SEC Chairman Paul Atkins' announcement this summer of a new “Project Crypto” initiative is the latest and clearest signal that there's a new sheriff in town with a pro-reform agenda. Instead of another warning shot, the SEC is launching a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities laws so America's financial markets can move from off-chain to on-chain and be positioned as the global leader in crypto markets.

Digital Asset Reboot

In his July 31, 2025 speech at the America First Policy Institute, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins described the initiative as nothing less than a reboot of the SEC's approach to digital assets. Rather than twisting 80-year-old securities laws to fit blockchain-based innovation, the SEC is looking to rewrite the playbook. Atkins framed it simply: Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities.  But confusion over the application of the Howey test has led some innovators to treat all crypto assets as such. On the other hand, when tokens are securities, the rules need to make sense in an on-chain environment.  Chairman Atkins stated that these entrepreneurs need and deserve bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses.

The speech came a day after the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. Chairman Atkins said the report is “the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology”.  

This is a sharp turn from the days when every token distribution risked being labeled an unregistered offering. With Project Crypto, the SEC is signaling that it wants innovation in digital assets to happen in the U.S., not overseas.

What's on the Table?

The plan has several moving parts, but the big themes should be easy to grasp:

Clarity on Classifications. For years, one of the biggest headaches in crypto has been figuring out whether a token is a security, a commodity or something else.  Project Crypto calls for bright-line rules to end the guessing game. That includes tailored disclosures and possible safe harbors for early-stage tokens.

Custody that Makes Sense. One of Chairman Atkins' most striking points is that self-custody is a core American value. In other words, the SEC wants to protect the right of investors to hold their own digital assets, while also fixing outdated custody rules so institutions can safely offer crypto services.

Super-Apps Instead of Silos. Right now, crypto activity is fragmented: staking here, trading there, lending somewhere else.  A key priority for Chairman Atkins is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps”, platforms that can offer multiple services under one roof, with regulators coordinating across agencies like the CFTC to make that possible.  Securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license.

“Innovation Exemption”.  Arguably the most ambitions component of Project Crypto is the “Innovation Exemption”, a fast-track pathway for new crypto projects to launch without being crushed by legacy compliance obligations, so long as they meet core investor protections. Under Chairman Atkins' vision, innovators would be able to enter the market immediately with new technologies and business models by complying with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the SEC, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features.tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features.

What Happens Next

Chairman Atkins stated in his speech that he has directed the SEC staff to draft clear and simple rules for crypto asset distributions, custody and trading, and submit those rules for public comment. He also stated that as the SEC staff works to finalize these regulations, the SEC and its staff will in the meantime be considering using interpretative, exemptive and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America.

While Chairman Atkins' speech announcing Project Crypto doesn't immediately change current rules, it does instruct the SEC staff to focus on critical areas of digital asset regulatory reform.  These include safe harbors for token issuance, authorization for custody and trading and the development of on-chain securities markets powered by decentralized finance or DeFi, an emerging financial system built on blockchain and cryptocurrency that aims to remove intermediaries like banks from financial services. A well-structured safe harbor would allow tokens to be created and distributed with clear guidelines, avoiding outdated securities laws.

Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates near current levels as capital inflows extend along the risk curve toward Ethereum and broader altcoins, according to Bitfinex Alpha's Aug. 25 report.

The report noted that the shift represents a measured rotation of institutional liquidity following Bitcoin's all-time high formation.

Bitcoin declined 4.5% from the weekly open on Aug. 18 until Aug. 22, sliding to local range lows as investors de-risked ahead of the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium.

The asset reached $111,990 amid renewed weakness in US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) flows, with Bitcoin ETFs recording $1.18 billion in net outflows over the week. As of press time, BTC lost the $110,000 threshold and is priced at $109,795.71.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole triggered a sharp rebound in risk assets, sparking a broad-based short squeeze across crypto.

Ethereum led the recovery, surging to a new all-time high of $4,958.70 on Aug. 24 and demonstrating its role as a liquidity driver for institutional markets.

Spot ETH ETFs registered $197 million in outflows on Aug. 18 alone, marking the third-largest daily exit on record. However, Ethereum treasury companies absorbed substantial selling pressure, with preliminary estimates suggesting meaningful institutional support.

Corporate treasuries, including SharpLink Gaming, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, and BTCS, accelerated accumulation, with on-chain treasury balances exceeding $10 billion. The report noted that the rotation reflects softer capital inflows into Bitcoin following its Aug. 14 all-time high of $123,640.

Bitcoin's realized cap expanded at 6% per month during the current move, compared to 13% monthly growth during late-2024 breakouts above $100,000, indicating more cautious investor appetite.

Global liquidity conditions remain supportive, with the combined M2 money supply from major central banks approaching $100 trillion. The structural upward trend in global liquidity reinforces the long-term bullish case for digital assets, though capital allocation has become more selective.

Solana climbed above $200 to reach $212.60 as the broader digital asset class pushed higher alongside equities, reflecting tightening correlations between crypto and traditional risk assets. Meanwhile, network development continues to advance, showcased by DBS Bank's recent tokenized note issuance on Ethereum.

In this backdrop, Bitfinex expects Bitcoin to remain range-bound while Ethereum attracts heightened institutional demand, mirroring Bitcoin's dynamic from early 2024.

The report anticipated more significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins later in the cycle, with broader market re-rating dependent on renewed Bitcoin ETF inflows and new altcoin investment vehicles.

Saxitoxin (STX, 1), a potent neurotoxin from shellfish, first isolated in 19571, offers immense pharmaceutical potential due to its interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels2, that are ubiquitously present in all excitable cells of the central and periphperal nervous system3. Hundreds of synthetic studies towards this end have been disclosed thus far, yet, a fully modular and scalable approach to the family remains elusive4-12. Thus, here we show how a tactical combination of radical retrosynthesis, biocatalysis, and C–H functionalization logic can be combined to solve this problem resulting in a scalable approach to the STX family in less than 10 steps including the first total synthesis of neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 4), a hydroxylated naturally occurring STX analog previously under clinical investigation13. The modular nature of the synthesis enables access to diverse analogs, that were previously inaccessible, and now have been evaluated through electrophysiological assays for biological activity.

If true, it could explain where dark matter comes from, and a possible twist in our understanding of neutrinos.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists believe there could be an “anti-universe” somewhere out there that looks like the mirror image of our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do. If this theory holds true, it could explain the presence of dark matter.

First, some background: the “Big Bang” is a collective term that includes a variety of theories studied by cosmologists, the scientists who try to rewind the clock as close to the very beginning of the universe as possible. Most agree that matter exploded forth, but there are different opinions on, for example, whether the temperature was extremely hot or absolute-zero cold at that initial moment.

There are also disagreements about what may have happened prior to the bang itself. Could it be that what we call the Big Bang was the inflection point of an even bigger bounce in progress? Think of the point when you bounce on the trampoline and your feet almost touch the ground beneath—then imagine only seeing the subsequent bounce upward; it's meaningless without the first, downward half of the bounce!

Dark matter is, if such a thing exists, maybe even more perplexing to scientists than the Big Bang. That's because dark matter is a key piece that helps to complete an unclear puzzle— the question of what forms the universe around us today, not billions of years ago. Dark matter forms the bulk of the matter in the universe, but we've never been able to see it anywhere.  

How is dark matter hidden in plain sight, and what are its qualities? These are huge mysteries upon which a ton of other ideas must rest. For the time being, one way to describe dark matter is very literal: by “dark,” we mean that it is not luminous, which is the technical term for matter that doesn't reflect or emit any photons in a way we can identify. But we can measure the physical (not visual) effects of dark matter in things like gravitational waves.

Now we arrive back at the theory. Could it be that an “anti-universe” might run parallel to our own universe, but backward in time? If so, it would essentially spread out “backward” in time, prior to the Big Bang, in the same way our universe progressed “forward” in time. In a paper published in 2018 in the journal Annals of Physics, researchers from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, suggest that the Big Bang might have been smaller and more symmetrical than we think.

“Among other things, we shall describe in detail a remarkable consequence of this hypothesis, namely a highly economical new explanation for the cosmological dark matter,” the researchers write.

One cool thing about this model of the Big Bang is that it removes the need for what scientists call “inflation,” a period of time in which the universe massively expanded in order to account for its size soon after birth. Instead, the matter could have naturally expanded over time in a less forceful way, which could simplify our explanation for what happened.

And in order for these two before-and-after universes to be truly symmetrical, we would need to add a particle to our existing understanding of the universe around us. Today, we know about neutrinos, extra-tiny mysterious particles involved in gravity and weak interaction only. If our universe is mirrored by a similar universe running backward in time from the Big Bang, then what we call dark matter could actually be a version of a neutrino that is “right-handed,” a term that refers to the direction of motion in the neutrino. It would be the natural opposite of the left-handed neutrinos in the other universe.

If this sounds like wild and heady stuff, you're absolutely right. But iteration using this kind of new theory is a critical part of cosmology, because scientists must have existing, published theories in order to study them and decide what their next theoretical step is. It's so much easier to do that by responding publicly using your own observations and measurements, and that leaves a beautiful trail of ideas over time as we refine our understanding and develop more sophisticated ways to observe the universe.

For the first time, a research team at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities demonstrated a groundbreaking process that combines 3D printing, stem cell biology, and lab-grown tissues for spinal cord injury recovery.

The study was recently published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, more than 300,000 people in the United States suffer from spinal cord injuries, yet there is no way to completely reverse the damage and paralysis from the injury. A major challenge is the death of nerve cells and the inability for nerve fibers to regrow across the injury site. This new research tackles this problem head-on.

The method involves creating a unique 3D-printed framework for lab-grown organs, called an organoid scaffold, with microscopic channels. These channels are then populated with regionally specific spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs), which are cells derived from human adult stem cells that have the capacity to divide and differentiate into specific types of mature cells.

"We use the 3D printed channels of the scaffold to direct the growth of the stem cells, which ensures the new nerve fibers grow in the desired way," said Guebum Han, a former University of Minnesota mechanical engineering postdoctoral researcher and first author on the paper who currently works at Intel Corporation. "This method creates a relay system that when placed in the spinal cord bypasses the damaged area."

In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. The cells successfully differentiated into neurons and extended their nerve fibers in both directions -- rostral (toward the head) and caudal (toward the tail) -- to form new connections with the host's existing nerve circuits.

The new nerve cells integrated seamlessly into the host spinal cord tissue over time, leading to significant functional recovery in the rats.

"Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research," said Ann Parr, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. "Our laboratory is excited to explore the future potential of our 'mini spinal cords' for clinical translation."

While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications.

In addition to Han and Parr, the team included Hyunjun Kim and Michael McAlpine from the University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering; Nicolas S. Lavoie, Nandadevi Patil and Olivia G. Korenfeld from the University of Minnesota Department of Neurosurgery; Manuel Esguerra from the University of Minnesota Department of Neuroscience; and Daeha Joung from the Department of Physics at Virginia Commonwealth University.

This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the State of Minnesota Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Grant Program and the Spinal Cord Society.

Indole, a molecule made up of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing nitrogen, forms the core structure of many biologically active compounds. Derivatives of indole, where hydrogen atoms are replaced by various chemical groups, are naturally produced by plants, fungi, and even the human body.

Due to their properties, indoles have gained attention as a backbone for synthesizing a wide variety of drugs. Since 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 14 indole drugs to treat conditions, such as migraines, infections, and hypertension. Chemists have developed many strategies to attach different chemical groups to indoles. Some approaches introduce new groups directly onto the ring, while others involve temporary structural changes through intermediates. However, modifying specific positions on the indole ring, such as the C5 carbon, remains a challenge due to its low reactivity.

In a recent study, researchers at Chiba University, Japan, reported a method for selectively attaching an alkyl group to the C5 position of indole using a relatively inexpensive copper-based catalyst, which produced the desired product in yields of up to 91%. This method offers a more affordable and scalable approach for modifying indoles, which could be especially valuable in drug development.

The study, led by Associate Professor Shingo Harada, included Mr. Tomohiro Isono, B.Pharm., Ms. Mai Yanagawa, M.Pharm., and Professor Tetsuhiro Nemoto from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Chiba University, and was published online in the journal Chemical Science.

"We developed a direct, regioselective C5-H functionalization reaction of indoles under copper catalysis. The resulting compounds contain structural features commonly found in natural indole alkaloids and drug molecules, highlighting the usefulness of this approach for making biologically important compounds," says Dr. Harada.

The reaction uses carbenes, highly reactive carbon species that can form new carbon-carbon bonds. In an earlier study, the team used rhodium-based carbenes to attach groups at the C4 position of indole, guided by unsaturated enone groups placed at the 3-position. In this study, they used a similar strategy but altered the reaction conditions to target the C5 position instead.

They tested the reaction using a model compound, N-benzyl indole with an enone group, together with dimethyl α-diazomalonates as the carbene source and different combinations of rhodium, copper, and silver salts as catalysts. Initially, the desired C5-functionalized product formed only in small amounts, with yields up to 18%. However, when they used a combination of copper and silver salts (Cu(OAc)2·H2O and AgSbF6), the yield rose to 62%. Upon carrying out further optimizations, such as adjusting the solvent volume and increasing the concentration, they improved the yield to 77%.

The reaction proved to be highly versatile, working with a wide range of indoles. When the enone group was replaced at the 3-position with a benzoyl group, the yield increased to 91%. Successful reactions were also observed with indoles bearing other substituents, such as methoxybenzyl, allyl, and phenyl groups, opening the door to the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules.

To uncover the reaction mechanism, the team carried out quantum chemical calculations, which suggested that the carbene does not react directly at C5. Instead, it first forms a bond at the C4 position, creating a strained three-membered ring. This intermediate then rearranges, shifting the new bond to the C5 position. The copper catalyst plays a critical role in making this pathway possible by stabilizing the intermediate and lowering the energy barrier for the rearrangement.

This copper-catalyzed strategy offers a reliable and cost-effective approach for modifying indoles at the C5 position, producing compounds that closely resemble biologically active indole-based agents. Dr. Harada highlights the method's potential for drug discovery by stating, "While it may not cause a significant shift right away, it could foster steady progress in drug discovery, leading to a small yet beneficial long-term impact."

The team is continuing its research, exploring other metal-carbene reactions to develop more selective and efficient strategies for constructing indole-based molecules that might one day contribute to the treatment of specific diseases.

DMT is a mysterious neurochemical that may ferry us to the great beyond, some researchers say.

In Greek mythology it was Charon, the grim ferryman, who paddled souls across the rivers Styx and Acheron to the underworld. But the real-life ferryman transporting our human souls between the realms of the living and the dead may have been inside us all along, science suggests. 

DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine)—the mysterious psychedelic molecule that occurs naturally in plants, animals, and possibly the human brain—plays an intriguing role in guiding consciousness at the moment of death, research shows. A 2018 study in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, for instance, hypothesized that DMT could induce a state as intense as an actual near-death experience (NDE), suggesting that it may play a role in the vivid euphoria many survivors report at the threshold between life and death.

A more recent study, published in 2023 in the same journal, compared the experiences of a person who had both a near-death experience and a trip on 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful psychedelic cousin of DMT secreted by the glands of the Colorado River toad. The researchers' goal? To find out whether the two experiences overlapped—and, if so, whether DMT could be the brain's own way of ferrying us into the great beyond.

“There is good indirect evidence to suggest that DMT is released in greater quantities at the point of death in the human brain. We have evidence from animal brains, but we don't have any direct evidence from humans. However, we can infer that this also happens,” says David Luke, PhD, a coauthor of the 2023 study and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Greenwich in London.

The researchers found that experiences with the psychedelic drugs had a lot in common with NDEs, “offering insights into altered states of consciousness,” says Pascal Michael, PhD, another coauthor of the 2023 study and a psychology lecturer at the University of Greenwich. “These include mystical experiences characterized by feelings of unity and timelessness, ego dissolution where a sense of self merges with a larger reality, and encounters with entities or presences.” 

While the idea of DMT as the chemical behind NDEs is compelling, it's just one part of a much larger puzzle. According to Luke, animal studies have shown that their brains at the point of death undergo a cascade of neurochemical changes, including massive releases of serotonin and noradrenaline—brain chemicals that help regulate mood, emotions, and stress. Scientists have inferred that the same occurs in the human brain. In other words, Luke suggests, DMT could indeed act like a psychopomp—a creature, spirit, or deity that transports the newly deceased to the afterlife. But the story of death doesn't end there. 

Michael explains that the brain's biological state during an NDE might shape the experiences differently than psychedelics do. 

“The neurobiological context of NDEs—potentially involving hypoxia [lack of oxygen in the body or brain], hypercapnia [too much carbon dioxide in the blood], and endogenous neurochemical release—might differ from the effects of 5-MeO-DMT,” he says. This distinction could influence the experience, with NDEs more likely to evoke autobiographical and relational memories tied to loved ones. “By contrast, 5-MeO-DMT tends to induce archetypal or abstract encounters, perhaps due to its intense focus on ego dissolution and the broader existential dimensions of experience,” Michael says.

In his seminal book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Rick Strassman, MD, a psychiatrist and clinical researcher, attributed spiritual connotations to DMT by virtue of the engrossing and transcendent experiences it's reported to induce. Since then, some scientists have ramped up the conversation by finding that DMT may be released in large quantities at death. Despite that, some still say we know nothing about the role of endogenous DMT. 

Enter the pineal gland hypothesis. It states the human pineal gland—a tiny, pea-shaped structure in the brain that produces melatonin, the sleep-regulating hormone—produces DMT in large amounts before death. This idea remains controversial.

“While intriguing, the role of endogenous N,N-DMT in humans remains largely speculative, particularly the idea that it is produced by the pineal gland in the brain,” says Amy Reichelt, PhD, a neuroscientist and an expert in neurodegenerative disease. DMT is structurally similar to serotonin and has been detected in human blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, but most of the research is in animal models. “They can have distinctly different ways of producing neurotransmitters and metabolizing compounds,” she says. 

In any case, the notion that a molecule within us might serve as the final boatman across the rivers Styx and Acheron is as haunting as it is fascinating, opening a Pandora's box of questions about the greatest mysteries of existence.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The brain may lie at the biological center of our lived experience, but the scientific underpinnings of the brain—specifically, how it forms subjective consciousness—remain mysterious. Sadly, one truth is well-known: As we age, so does our brain. Because this all-important organ filled with 86 billion neurons forms our experience, dysregulation within the brain has outsized impacts on someone's quality of life. 

For years, scientists have tried to find ways to stave off these negative effects and make a person's healthspan largely match their ever-increasing lifespan. In 2021, Stanford University investigated the debris-cleaning role of the myeloid cells within the brain, and three years later, a study from the University of Rochester on the broader glymphatic system (which interacts with myeloid cells) found ways to restart the flow of brain-cleaning fluids. 

In another installment of this ongoing research to improve the aging brain, scientists from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) identified a protein that's central to aging the brain in humans. By analyzing how genes and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. When scientists reduced the presence of this protein in the hippocampus, the mice regained some of their youthful characteristics, including improved nerve connections and better permorfance on memory tests. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Aging.

“It is truly a reversal of impairments […]. It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said in a press statement. “We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.”

To test this idea even further, the team artificially stimulated the production of FTL1 in young mice, and soon, their mental abilities began to match those of older rodents. When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells. 

“To identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain,” the authors wrote. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.”

The authors also note that a 2015 study found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. The researchers hope that by targeting FTL1, future therapies may not only improve natural cognitive decline, but will also benefit people with neurodegenerative diseases.

As this study—and many studies before it—have clearly demonstrated, there is no singular cause of mental decline. But with each new study, scientists work toward a holistic picture of neurodegenerative decline as we age, and with that new perspective comes the hope of new therapies that could make cognitive decline a thing of the past.

The zone from the center of your eyebrows to the corners of your mouth is best left alone.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

You're a sophomore in high school again, begrudgingly getting out of bed after snoozing your alarm one too many times. As you look into the mirror while getting ready for school, a painful, red bump stares back at you. Every teen's worst nightmare: a pimple. You may be tempted to squeeze and prod at the lump until it pops, but a recent account suggests you should hesitate before your next skin-picking session. One woman, Lish Marie, tried to pop a pimple beneath her nose and ended up in the hospital with facial paralysis—and experts say the infection could have been deadly.

While pimples primarily occur during puberty, they can appear at any time on anyone. Puberty in particular causes hormone changes that can lead to sebaceous glands becoming overactive. Typically, healthy sebaceous glands produce oil to keep your skin from drying out, but when the glands are overactive, they can get clogged, leaving your back, face, chest, and shoulders riddled with those painful red spots. 

Not all pimples are dangerous to pop, however. Lish was unlucky and popped a pimple in a zone that dermatologists call the “triangle of death” or the “danger triangle.” The term refers to the area from between your eyebrows to the corners of your mouth, and dermatologists recommend avoiding picking at the area all together because it's practically an infection highway to your brain, thanks to your cavernous sinus (a bundle of nerves just behind your eyes). Its main job is to drain blood from the brain, so if an infection is introduced to the area (like it was in Lish's case), there's not much in its way before it reaches your body's control center.  

“There is the possibility for a facial infection to become an infection that impacts the rest of your body,” dermatologist Alok Vij said in an interview with Cleveland Clinic. “The infection may start to get bigger, spreading to cover more of an area, and you may start to feel more systemically ill—a fever, shaking, chills. If this starts to happen, see a doctor as soon as you can for diagnosis and treatment.”

Luckily, Lish unknowingly followed Vij's advice and sought medical help pretty much right away. She was treated with multiple antibiotics to fight the infection, and now claims that while the crooked smile and inflammation caused by the infection remained for a few days after treatment, she ultimately received a clean bill of health. Unfortunately, others haven't been so lucky. In one extreme instance, a woman contracted a staph infection from picking at a blemish. Severe cases of Staphylococcus bacterial infections (staph infections) can lead to inflammation of the heart, toxic shock syndrome, and even sepsis. 

Now, before you spiral over how many times you may have unintentionally put yourself at risk in the name of a satisfying pimple pop, know that cases like Lish's don't happen every day—otherwise, millions of teenagers would be at risk each year. 

“Thankfully, it's relatively unlikely,” Vij explained, “but whenever there's a violation of the skin and interaction with bacteria, there's always a possibility for infection, which can lead to greater health concerns.” 

So, next time you go to pop a pimple, wash your hands and maybe avoid the triangle of death.

The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) has successfully completed filling its 20,000-tons liquid scintillator detector and begun data taking on Aug. 26. After more than a decade of preparation and construction, JUNO is the first of a new generation of very large neutrino experiments to reach this stage. Initial trial operation and data taking show that key performance indicators met or exceeded design expectations, enabling JUNO to tackle one of this decade's major open questions in particle physics: the ordering of neutrino masses -- whether the third mass state (ν₃) is heavier than the second (ν2).

Prof. Yifang Wang, a researcher at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and JUNO spokesperson, said: "Completing the filling of the JUNO detector and starting data taking marks a historic milestone. For the first time, we have in operation a detector of this scale and precision dedicated to neutrinos. JUNO will allow us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the universe."

Located 700 meters underground near Jiangmen city in the Guangdong Province, JUNO detects antineutrinos produced 53 kilometers away by the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants and measures their energy spectrum with record precision. Unlike other approaches, JUNO's determination of the mass ordering is independent of matter effects in the Earth and largely free of parameter degeneracies. JUNO will also deliver order-of-magnitude improvements in the precision of several neutrino-oscillation parameters and enable cutting-edge studies of neutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and the Earth. It will also open new windows to explore unknown physics, including searches for sterile neutrinos and proton decay.

Proposed in 2008 and approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Province in 2013, JUNO began underground construction in 2015. Detector installation started in December 2021 and was completed in December 2024, followed by a phased filling campaign. Within 45 days, the team filled 60,000 tons of ultra-pure water, keeping the liquid-level difference between the inner and outer acrylic spheres within centimeters and maintaining a flow-rate uncertainty below 0.5%, safeguarding structural integrity. Over the next six months, 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator were filled into the 35.4-meter-diameter acrylic sphere while displacing the water. Throughout, stringent requirements on ultra-high purity, optical transparency, and extremely low radioactivity were achieved. In parallel, the collaboration conducted detector debugging, commissioning, and optimization, enabling a seamless transition to full operations at the completion of filling.

At the heart of JUNO is a central liquid-scintillator detector with an unprecedentedly large effective mass of 20,000 tons, housed at the center of a 44-meter-deep water pool. A 41.1-meter-diameter stainless steel truss supports the 35.4-meter acrylic sphere, the scintillator, 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 25,600 3-inch PMTs, front-end electronics, cabling, anti-magnetic compensation coils, and optical panels. All PMTs operate simultaneously to capture scintillation light from neutrino interactions and convert it to electrical signals.

Prof. MA Xiaoyan, JUNO Chief Engineer, remarked: "Building JUNO has been a journey of extraordinary challenges. It demanded not only new ideas and technologies, but also years of careful planning, testing, and perseverance. Meeting the stringent requirements of purity, stability, and safety called for the dedication of hundreds of engineers and technicians. Their teamwork and integrity turned a bold design into a functioning detector, ready now to open a new window on the neutrino world."

JUNO is hosted by the IHEP and involves more than 700 researchers from 74 institutions across 17 countries and regions. "The landmark achievement that we announce today is also a result of the fruitful international cooperation ensured by many research groups outside China, bringing to JUNO their expertise from previous liquid scintillator set-ups. The worldwide liquid scintillator community has pushed the technology to its ultimate frontier, opening the path towards the ambitious physics goals of the experiment," commented Prof. Gioacchino Ranucci, Deputy spokesperson of JUNO and a Professor at the University of Milano and INFN-Milano.

JUNO is designed for a scientific lifetime of up to 30 years, with a credible upgrade path toward a world-leading search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Such an upgrade would probe the absolute neutrino mass scale and test whether neutrinos are Majorana particles, addressing fundamental questions spanning particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, and profoundly shaping our understanding of the universe.

Directed evolution is usually a laborious process that often takes weeks in which that accelerates protein mutations over many cycle.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

All current life on Earth is the result of billions of years of slow, laborious, and endlessly fascinating evolution (if you include our time spent as single-celled microbes, of course). While that's an acceptable timeline on geological scales, this rate of evolution isn't going to cut it for biotechnology companies. 

Instead, these companies rely on a technique known as directed evolution—the process of rapidly evolving proteins, introducing beneficial mutations, and selecting advantageous variants. While this can drastically speed up the clock (at least, compared to Mother Nature's method of doing things), directed evolution can still be a pretty long process. And because these hyper-evolved proteins can be used in a wide variety of potential cancer and neurodegenerative therapies, we want this laboratory process to be as fast and as streamlined as possible. 

Luckily, scientists have been making some pretty astounding progress. In May of this year, a study led by the University of Sydney and published in Nature Communications detailed a process called PROTein Evolution Using Selection (PROTEUS) that leverages chimeric virus-like vesicles to rapidly evolve biomolecules. Now, a second study (led by Scripps Research and published in the journal Science) showcases yet another method for directed evolution called T7-ORACLE. According to the researchers, this breakthrough behaves like an “evolution engine” capable of introducing mutations 100,000 times faster than normal. 

“This is like giving evolution a fast-forward button,” Pete Schultz, a co-senior author on the paper from  Scripps Research, said in a press statement. “You can now evolve proteins continuously and precisely inside cells without damaging the cell's genome or requiring labor-intensive steps.”

Schultz's team circumvents typical directed evolution bottlenecks by engineering the bacterium and model organism E. coli  to host what they call a “second, artificial DNA replication system derived from bacteriophage T7.” T7 phage is a virus that infects bacteria and has been widely studied, as it's remarkably good at that particular job. This system is orthogonal, meaning it operates outside of the cell's own biological machinery, and it also targets only plasmid DNA—small, circular DNA that replicates separate from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Because the cell's genome remains untouched, scientists can introduce mutations every time the cell divides (roughly every 20 minutes). 

“This system represents a major advance in continuous evolution,” Christian Diercks, another co-senior author of the study from  Scripps Research, said in a press statement. “Instead of one round of evolution per week, you get a round each time the cell divides—so it really accelerates the process.”

To test this new platform, the team introduced TEM-1 β-lactamase—an antibiotic resistance gene—into the platform and exposed the E. coli bacterium to escalating levels of antibiotics. In less than a week, the system produced enzymes capable of withstanding antibiotics at levels 5,000 times higher than the original. So, not only can T7-Oracle be an important tool for developing new medicines, it could also give scientists a better understanding of how antibiotic resistance builds up over time. While a nice benefit, the paper's authors are more interested in the therapeutic possibilities. 

“What's exciting is that it's not limited to one disease or one kind of protein,' Diercks said in a press statement. “What matters is that we can now evolve virtually any protein, like cancer drug targets and therapeutic enzymes, in days instead of months.”

Microplastics Could Be Turning Bacteria into Drug-Resistant Superbugs

Microplastics are seemingly everywhere—and now growing research suggests they could be breeding grounds for drug-resistant bacteria

By Marta Zaraska edited by Lauren J. Young

For bacteria, microplastics are the perfect meetup spot—tiny, intimate surfaces where microbes can cling, huddle close and swap genes. And these crowded bacterial breeding grounds may pose a threat to human health. A growing body of new research shows that microplastics may fuel antimicrobial resistance—the phenomenon in which pathogens adapt to withstand drugs, making it challenging to treat infections. The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis claimed about five million lives in 2019, a number projected to double by 2050. In an August research review, scientists called attention to the “silent tsunami” of plastics-driven antibiotic resistance. Several other recent papers suggest microplastics serve as better homes for pathogens than some natural substances do, although the mechanisms are not fully understood.

“We've just really scratched the surface,” says Timothy Walsh, a microbiologist at the University of Oxford, who has previously studied antimicrobial resistance and microplastics.

When bacteria encounter a surface—a sliver of wood floating in water or a door handle—they stick to it and to one another, forming a biofilm. As they attach, “they grow and proliferate,” says Muhammad Zaman, a biomedical engineer at Boston University. In a biofilm, bacteria live close together, making it easier to transfer genetic material from one cell to another in what's “basically bacterial sex,” says Emily Stevenson, a public health researcher at the University of Exeter in England and lead author of the August review paper. The more chances microbes get to swap genes in general, the more chances they have to spread DNA that codes for antibiotic resistance.

Scientists in Germany, Costa Rica and the U.K. first detected the troubling trend in 2018, when they showed that bacteria on microplastics were more inclined than free-living bacteria to exchange genes encoding resistance to trimethoprim, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bladder infections and traveler's diarrhea. Other research has since shown that antimicrobial resistance genes were more common in the plastisphere—the community of microbes living on plastics—compared with those in water or soil.

But scientists have questioned whether detecting high quantities of antimicrobial resistance genes actually translates to higher amounts of resistant bacteria—pathogens surviving despite being doused with drugs.

A study published in March offers strong evidence that it does. Scientists tested lab-grown Escherichia coli biofilms in various environments, including on microplastics, on tiny glass fragments and in cell culture media. They found that pathogens in the plastisphere not only grew faster—reconfirming earlier research—but, importantly, were harder to kill when treated with several different antibiotics. The effects “were significantly larger than what we were expecting,” says Zaman, who was senior author of the study. For example, after applying the widely used antibiotic ciprofloxacin, resistance was 75-fold higher among E. coli grown on microplastics than those grown alone.

These effects do not appear to be limited to lab-grown bacteria. Researchers in Germany and Poland added microplastics to water samples taken from the Oder, a major European river. The results, published in May in Scientific Reports, revealed that after a week of incubation, disease-causing bacteria—such as E. coli, Klebsiell pneumoniae and Salmonella—were more abundant in samples with the added plastics than in those without them. What's more, the number of antibiotic resistance genes was also higher among the plastisphere.

Stevenson points to another insightful study, published in May, that involved a bay in Xiamen, China. Scientists submerged individual bags of different microplastics and natural surfaces into the water and performed various tests on the resulting biofilms—running analyses on biofilm formation, metabolic activity, antibiotic resistance genes and actual resistance against three antibiotics. The results suggest that biofilms containing metabolically active, resistant bacteria were about 10 times more likely to form on microplastics than on natural surfaces, equating to about a 10-fold higher human health risk, according to the study authors.

So how do antibiotic resistance genes arise on microplastics in the first place? A July study in Scientific Reports investigates one theory: antibiotics can cling to microplastics, too. The study's authors showed that common antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and tetracycline, stuck to microplastics—and that, the older the microplastics were, the more readily the antibiotics attached to them. As they age, microplastics become rougher and more electrostatic, which makes them even better at trapping antibiotics. The combination of antibiotics and pathogenic bacteria biofilms on microplastics could theoretically drive the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.

Stevenson says that the question of whether microplastics are significantly better at spurring antimicrobial resistance than other surfaces such as wood or glass is far from settled, but the mere fact that plastics have the potential to carry both dangerous pathogens and antibiotics is reason enough to worry.

Microplastics have been detected in nearly everything from air, water, plants and food, and as they are ingested, they bioaccumulate in animals' tissues—including human brains. A preliminary mouse study suggests that microplastics in the gut microbiome may also be fertile ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria: mice exposed to both microplastics and tetracycline had more antibiotic resistance genes in their gut microbiota than rodents exposed only to the antibiotic. “These kinds of things merit serious investigation,” Zaman says.

What's more, microplastics travel and do not degrade. Pieces of plastic carrying multidrug-resistant bacteria have been found as remotely as Antarctica. Microplastics' potential to shuttle antimicrobial-resistant bacteria around the globe makes Zaman particularly worried about plastic pollution that may pick up pathogens in wastewater treatment plants, hospital sewage or refugee camps—the latter of which he is currently investigating.

“I think it's pretty clear that you see an enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes on plastic particles,” says Johan Bengtsson-Palme, a microbiologist at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, whose research focuses on antibiotic resistance. But how much of a threat plastic-derived drug-resistant pathogens pose to humans is a question that remains to be fully understood, he says.

Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions.

As collections of grains flow, free-surface deformations often develop. These typically suggest the presence of secondary flows, smaller in magnitude than the primary motion but driving complex three-dimensional internal structures. While one can infer such behaviour from boundaries or simulations, we have not previously been able to directly observe secondary flows experimentally. In this paper we present an experimental confirmation of secondary kinematics within granular media using dynamic x-ray radiography, without needing to stop motion for tomography. Specifically, we create a bulldozing mechanism of conveyor-driven grains. This generates a non-uniform, indented free-surface, hinting that secondary mechanisms are at play alongside the primary regime. Discrete element method simulations are shown to be consistent with this secondary-flow explanation. We then probe further experimentally using two perpendicular x-ray source/detector pairs to measure the velocity inside the bulk. This indeed unveils a complex three-dimensional flow pattern that deviates from the primary vertical planes and must include vortices and convection rolls. This advancement is pertinent for industrial and natural scenarios where grains impact obstacles, and has broader relevance for studying the rheology associated with secondary flows in other amorphous materials such as emulsions, pastes and colloids.

Understanding the complex behaviour of dense amorphous soft materials, ranging from granular materials to emulsions, remains a fundamental challenge in soft matter physics1,2. These materials exhibit intricate flow dynamics that significantly influence their macroscopic properties. This is particularly apparent in granular media3,4, which are ubiquitous in both nature and industry, appearing in forms as diverse as sand, mineral ores, and cereals. The physical description of these materials is challenging due to their propensity to transition between solid-, liquid-, and gaseous-like phases based on external excitation rather than on their thermal temperature. Modelling the fluid-like phase of granular materials is particularly involved when one wishes to take into account the complex interactions with boundaries. For instance, when a geophysical granular flow encounters an abrupt change in topography, or when grains on industrial conveyors impact an obstacle, the flow can exhibit a sudden change in surface height, known as a shock or discontinuity. It is widely understood that such surface discontinuities conceal complex interactions and displacements beneath the free surface, yet measuring the corresponding internal flow field remains a significant challenge.

A commonly proposed internal flow mechanism in granular systems is ‘secondary flows'. These represent displacements in directions different from the flow's primary component that are typically smaller in magnitude. For example, grains in a granular avalanche predominantly move in the downslope direction, but there may also be smaller recirculating or convection-like motion in the transverse or normal directions to the slope5,6,7. Secondary flows are not unique to granular media; they also occur in classical Newtonian fluids such as water8, where they are much better understood thanks to the water's transparency, which allows for extensive volumetric observations9,10, often through the use of tracers11,12, and thanks to the well-established rheological properties of water13,14. Our understanding of secondary flows in water currents is crucial, for instance for designing open-channel structures15,16,17 and in fluvial geomorphology18,19.

However, the experimental study of secondary flows in granular media remains challenging due to the opacity of the grains. We often rely on numerical simulations, usually in the form of particle-based discrete element method (DEM) computations. While these provide valuable insights into the internal flow, they only represent a simplified model of the actual physical system. On the other hand, we can make experimental observations at either the free surface or lateral sidewalls to deduce the existence of secondary flows. For example, Forterre and Pouliquen made surface velocity and thickness measurements to infer the existence of longitudinal vortices20, which accurately matched the results of a linear stability analysis21. However, boundaries are known to alter the flow itself due to the formation of granular boundary layers22,23, and therefore, such measurements do not provide the full internal picture. There have been some experimental studies of secondary flows in granular suspensions using refractive-index-matched particles submerged in viscous fluids24,25. However, in these regimes, the development of secondary flows cannot be attributed purely to granular effects, as similar flows inevitably occur in pure fluids12.

The experimental study of secondary flows underneath the free surface of dry granular media requires advanced imaging techniques capable of seeing through the bulk of opaque grains. One such method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has been used to effectively measure internal particle velocities in continuously flowing Couette geometries26 but has not previously detected the existence of secondary flows. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is another non-invasive method that constructs a three-dimensional (3D) density map from which grain locations can be retrieved. This technique works by successively capturing x-ray radiographs from multiple directions, which requires intermittent pauses between flow periods to accommodate the extended time needed to obtain such radiographs without grain motion and imaging artifacts27,28,29. For this reason, most research on secondary flows in dry granular media focuses on quasi-static conditions, such as those achieved using a Couette cell30,31,32,33,34,35,36. While much can be learned from this approach, the majority of natural and industrial granular flows are continuously moving, which presents a fundamentally different deformation regime that is never left to relax to a static state. Up until now, investigations of secondary flows in continuous flow configurations have been limited to DEM simulations or inferred from experimental observations at boundaries.

Here, we advance the experimental investigation of the development of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media. This is done without requiring interstitial fluid or intermittent halting of motion for volumetric measurements. Similarly, the methods presented here can be applied to any form of granular media – whether dry, saturated, or partially saturated – as well as to general heterogeneous flowing media, such as foams and active matter. The particular laboratory setup consists of a bulldozed granular flow in an open channel, which is established by driving grains from the base using a rubber conveyor belt and colliding these with a perpendicular wall. This creates a non-uniform free surface, known as a heap37,38. Crucially, the flow is significantly faster than in the Couette cell geometry previously used to investigate secondary flows. Similar conveyor-belt-driven configurations have previously been used to examine strain localisation at sidewalls using optical particle image velocimetry (PIV)39. Here, we instead use fast x-ray radiography from two perpendicular positions and develop a measurement technique to study the 3D shape of the strongly deformed free surface. This suggests the presence of secondary flows beneath the free-surface, which we explore with DEM models. We then experimentally measure the 3D velocity field along the main flow direction using x-ray rheography40. When combined with velocity fields averaged across both the width and the height of the flow, this provides a robust experimental volumetric observation of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media.

The experimental setup giving rise to secondary flows is sketched in Fig. 1. The configuration is an open flume positioned above a conveyor belt, imaged through two x-ray radiography systems. The flume has a reservoir of grains at one end, and a wall suspended with a gap from the conveyor belt at the other. An initial pile of grains is carried by the conveyor belt and forms a heap upon reaching the suspended wall. This heap stabilises when the effect of its weight on the outgoing flow under the wall balances the incoming flow from the emptying reservoir. According to the inertial numbers analysed in the Supplementary Information, the granular flow is largely faster than the quasi-static regime but slower than the collisional regime. High-speed x-ray radiography is then employed to analyse the heap, enabling the investigation of internal flow dynamics within the granular media, with reduced influence from the sidewalls on the images. Radiographs are obtained during motion from two perpendicular directions: vertically through the conveyor (z direction), and horizontally through the lateral sidewalls (y direction). Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 show example radiographs obtained for the corresponding two x-ray detectors. Note that a third detector parallel to the x direction is not considered as the x-ray beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir, which would attenuate the signal too much to make meaningful measurements. Supplementary Video 1 is also available online, showing the two sets of dynamic radiographs alongside the physical experimental setup. A DEM simulation is also conducted that complements the experimental flow observations. Technical details of this simulation and of the experimental setup and procedures are described in the Methods section. While the results section focuses on a single set of parameters, the robustness of the findings is further illustrated for other values in the Supplementary Information.

Here, h is the flow thickness, L the heap length, and h* its height. The wall at the exit of the reservoir and the outgoing wall are elevated at heights h1 and h2, respectively, which control the steadiness of the heap. The conveyor belt moves at a velocity Ub in a counter-clockwise direction, as indicated by the circular arrows at the edges of the belt. The conveyor belt transports the particles in the direction indicated by the dashed arrows. a and b show example radiographs captured during the steady state for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. The origin of the global coordinate system (x, y, z) is at the centre of the line connecting the wall and the conveyor belt. Coordinate systems (η, ζ) are local to each x-ray detector. The experimental geometry and radiographs are illustrated using Supplementary Video 1 (available online).

The granular flow was first analysed by developing an x-ray image reconstruction method with which the 3D details of the deformed free surface along the heap were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. The key idea is to use the time-averaged intensity fields from one x-ray direction to estimate the absorption coefficient of the material in the other direction. The technical details of this reconstruction process are described in the Methods section.

a and b show the experimental free surface and relative height profiles at various x-positions, respectively. c and d display the free surface in the DEM simulation using coarse-grained density field and synthetic radiographs, respectively. The different colours in the three free-surface plots represent the relative heights at each given x-axis position (h(x, y)/hmax(x)). The arrows indicate the direction of the conveyor belt velocity (Ub).

After the heap has fully stabilised in the flume, it exhibits a relatively uniform appearance across the width. Surprisingly, however, the reconstruction also reveals a pronounced dip at the start of the heap. This can be seen in the 2D height profiles at different positions, depicted in Fig. 2b. Note that there are also smaller fluctuations in the free-surface profile that are attributed to the discrete, granular nature of the material. These are not fully smoothed out when averaging the x-ray intensity over time, especially at the slower-moving section near the wall. Note also that the height profile displays a minor overall slope across the width, which is also apparent in the supplementary tests. This is attributed to x-ray scattering or to the conical shape of the x-ray beam, leading to uneven illuminating intensity in y.

In light of past research revealing secondary flows under non-uniform free surfaces30,32,33,34,41, the dip at the start of the heap raises the question of whether such flow might develop beneath the bulldozed grains. In this scenario, the primary flow moves along the x direction, as it is primarily driven by the belt, and in the normal z direction, as the development of a heap necessitates particles climbing upwards to conserve mass, irrespective of secondary flows. Conversely, any bulk motion in the transverse y direction should be attributed directly to secondary flows, as this direction is orthogonal to the main stream of material.

To investigate the possibility of secondary flow, we thus focus on the coherent existence of velocities along the y direction. We begin by developing a DEM simulation, which is designed to replicate the experiment. The technical details of the simulation are described in the Methods section.

The DEM simulation was first used to evaluate the free-surface x-ray measurement technique described in full in the Methods section. To achieve this, the free surface in the DEM simulation was analysed using both its coarse-grained density field (Fig. 2c) and the same x-ray technique applied to synthetic radiographs, which were generated from the DEM model as in previous work40 based on particle positions and assumed x-ray attenuation properties (Fig. 2d). The strong agreement between Fig. 2c, d confirms the validity of the free-surface x-ray technique, thereby supporting the experimental findings in Fig. 2a and the existence of the dip at the start of the heap.

Second, the simulation also allowed us to obtain the three velocity components Ux, Uy, and Uz parallel to their respective axes through the flow. Following the visualisation method proposed by Krishnaraj & Nott32, the coarse-grained field of Uy and the streamlines normal to the belt motion are shown in Fig. 3 in order to highlight secondary flows. Indeed, the Uy velocity field and the cross-sectional streamlines display strong evidence of secondary flows. This is particularly visible through cross-section 3b around the dip at the start of the heap. The cross-sectional streamlines at this position reveal a flow directed upwards, displacing horizontally from the walls towards the centre. The secondary flows are around one order of magnitude smaller than the basal velocity Ub driving the primary flow at this position.

Left plot shows the value of the horizontal (Uy) velocities at the surface of the flow. Here, the arrow indicates the direction of the conveyor belt velocity (Ub). a–c show the value of Uy on three different slices along the flume at xa = 41.8 cm, xb = 34.1 cm, xc = 20.5 cm from the exit wall, respectively, as well as cross-sectional streamlines of Uy and the vertical (Uz) velocities. Supplementary Video 2 (available online) shows the Uy velocity component and the cross-sectional streamlines along the x-axis.

Moreover, the secondary flows are not constrained to only this position. Figure 3a reveals that the incoming flow before the heap also displays secondary flows, this time even smaller at around three orders of magnitude below Ub. These weak secondary flows are in the form of small rollers near both lateral walls, rotating inwards toward the centre of the flume. Elsewhere at this x position, the flow established by the DEM model is influenced predominantly by the conveyor belt with minimal vertical or transverse displacements (Uy ≈ 0, Uz ≈ 0), and hence the streamlines in Fig. 3a display more incoherent patterns.

The secondary flow is also weaker after the dip vanishes, as illustrated in cross-section 3c, where the free-surface becomes more uniform along the width of the flume. Here, there is only a weak signal of secondary flow, again in the form of convection rollers near the lateral boundaries. However, the corresponding motion changes direction again, now heading outwards from the centre towards the walls. Supplementary Video 2 (available online) illustrates the emergence and disappearance of these different phenomena when moving along the flume in the x direction.

Having obtained strong evidence of secondary flows in the DEM simulations, we now return to the experimental configuration to establish whether we can detect similar secondary flows in the physical system. Rather than the free-surface profile already obtained using the x-ray reconstruction method, attention is now shifted to the velocity fields, specifically the internal flow field.

A 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity field was obtained using the two perpendicular sets of radiographs and the x-ray rheography technique developed by Baker et al.40, with the results shown on Fig. 4a. The undisturbed flow, before the heap, was found to move at velocity Ub with no slip at the bottom at the centre of the flume, demonstrating a well-controlled conveyed flow set-up. The presence of the sidewalls, however, induces some shearing across the width with velocities decreasing toward the walls. In the heap, two different layers are observed parallel to the x-axis, producing a horizontal band of shearing through the height, emanating from around the height of the incoming flow h1. Below  ~ h1, the average velocity of the flow is slightly below Ub. The thickness of this horizontal shear band appears to be influenced by the heap's weight. Above  ~ h1, the flow shows little motion.

The x-axis velocity fields (Ux) derived through the experimental x-ray rheography technique and the discrete element method simulations are shown in a and b, respectively, with additional slice views in y − z and x − z planes. The arrows indicate the direction of the conveyor velocity (Ub), which moves from right to left in all panels.

The DEM result of the Ux velocity field seen in Fig. 4b accurately replicates the main features of the rheography result, including the velocity variation along the width of the channel, and the presence of the horizontal shear band. The interaction between the heap and the flow underneath also appears similar to the results from the numerical simulation of Sauret et al.37 (referring specifically to their figure 18 (a)). One notable difference between the x-ray experiments and the DEM results is the slope of the heap. Despite both tests producing similar heap height, h*, the experiment exhibits a shorter heap length compared to the DEM result. However, the qualitative evolution of the Ux-velocity field is similar to the one obtained from the experimental x-ray rheography, suggesting that should secondary flow also exist in the physical reality, it would not influence the main flow direction.

In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity component, we apply correlation-based particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of the two sets of radiographs to obtain Uy and Uz velocity fields, depth-averaged in the direction of the x-ray beams23. This complementary imaging method provides insight into all velocity components, which strongly consolidate our finding of secondary granular flows in the experimental setup. For the purpose of cross-validation, these analyses were conducted on both real experimental radiographs and simulated radiographs, the latter based on particle positions from DEM and assumed x-ray attenuation properties. Technical details are available in the Methods section.

Figure 5 displays the contours of the depth-averaged velocity fields from both the experimental and simulated radiographs. The Ux velocity fields present multiple similarities, as displayed in Fig. 5a, b, e, f, consistent with Fig. 4. When viewed from above using detector 2 (see Fig. 5a, b), both the experiment and simulation show an incoming flow at the centre of the flume that follows the conveyor velocity. The velocity gradually decreases when moving towards the heap, as well as when moving from the centre toward the walls. When viewed from the side using detector 1 (see Fig. 5e, f) both cases show a similar shear band between the bottom of the flow and the heap, where the lower material flows at velocities close to Ub. Above the shear band, the flow develops very slowly. The DEM simulation accurately reproduces the observed shear band.

These results are cross-validated with the corresponding depth-averaged velocity fields of the discrete element method simulation (right column), recreated from artificially generated radiographs. a and b refer to the x-axis velocity fields (Ux) seen from the top (detector 2). Similarly, c and d display the y-axis velocity fields (Uy). x-axis velocity fields from the side (detector 1) are shown on e and f, and z-axis velocity fields (Uz) are displayed on g and h. All velocity fields are normalised by the velocity (Ub) of the conveyor, which transports particles from right to left in all the above panels.

More importantly, as depicted from the top view of detector 2 by both the experiment and simulation in Fig. 5c, d, respectively, the horizontal velocity component Uy reveals distinct secondary flows at the start of the heap, which move from the walls toward the centre. All velocities in Fig. 5 are normalised by the belt velocity Ub, allowing easy comparison of the corresponding magnitudes. This indeed confirms that the secondary flow is significantly slower than the primary conveying motion, being an order of magnitude less than Ub. As the dip vanishes, the secondary flow shifts direction, moving from the centre of the flume toward the walls. This transition is more prominent in the experimental velocity field in Fig. 5c, implying potential issues of replicating the exact boundary conditions and particle interactions in the DEM simulation.

Side-view analysis from detector 1 of the Uz vertical velocity fields in Fig. 5g, h shows a robust upward flow where the free surface starts to ascend, with higher magnitude in DEM simulations compared to the experiments. In addition, a pronounced downward flow is observed near the outgoing gate, influenced by the exit wall. The area of this downward flow is more extensive in the DEM results.

Note that, in general, x-ray rheography can be applied to recover the full three components of velocity in three dimensions40. However, this requires three mutually perpendicular imaging direction. For this particular experimental setup, this would involve positioning an x-ray source and detector along the x-direction, meaning the beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir. This would have caused excessive attenuation, making it virtually impossible to measure the components Uy and Uz in 3D. Nevertheless, the 3D measurements of Ux, combined with the depth-averaged values for the other components, support the secondary flow observations.

This paper has presented experimental confirmation of a secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media. Using a confined chute and conveyor belt to establish a bulldozing mechanism, we are able to probe the system through a variety of x-ray radiography techniques and establish the presence of secondary vortices within the dry granular bulk. These techniques enable such secondary flows to be internally measured experimentally without having to artificially change the system (e.g., restricting to quasi-static motion, as in CT) or change the material (e.g., add viscous interstitial fluid, as in refractive index matching scanning).

Note that several methods exist to estimate grain velocities along the surface of a granular bulk, and these measurements have previously been used to infer secondary flow within the material20,21. However, in general, two significant limitations exist from such a surface measurement approach. First, surface velocity measurements must carefully account for and exclude the effects of particles seeping into or emerging from the bulk. Second, and more critically, surface measurements alone cannot provide conclusive insights into the flow within the bulk because surface particles represent only a negligible fraction of the total particles in the system. In fact, visual inspection of our system has revealed surface disturbances in the form of localised and often gaseous backward-avalanching surface-grains that, in isolation, would mislead conclusions about the flow within the bulk. Similarly, bulk quantities such as depth-averaged velocities are not necessarily related to boundary or surface measurements. For example, in the rotating cylinder system previously investigated by Baker & Einav42, positive and negative displacements cancel each other out, making the beam-averaged velocity equal to zero. However, just measuring from the sidewall of the cylinder (if it was made of transparent material) would suggest all lateral velocities are non-zero and moving in the same direction. In contrast, the method proposed in this article directly addresses these limitations by considering the flow of all grains throughout the thickness or depth of the bulk, rather than focusing solely on surface particles. As such, the results presented here offer an experimental validation of secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media.

In establishing the presence of secondary flows in this system, we have developed an x-ray methodology for measuring the 3D surface profile of flowing granular media. This could be useful beyond the specific geometry and material investigated here, for example where the free surface is obstructed by airborne grains or rigid structures making optical imaging difficult but where x-rays could still be transmitted through. We have also applied existing dynamic x-ray radiography23 and rheography40 methods to a new geometry, further strengthening the value of these tools both in isolation and, crucially, in conjunction with each other and the free-surface measurements to build a more complete picture of the secondary flows. A further methodological innovation is the use of dynamic x-ray radiography to measure depth-averaged velocities. While the same approach has previously been applied to compute quantities averaged in the lateral directions (avoiding sidewall effects)23, depth-averaged quantities are of particular interest because they can be compared directly to shallow-water type flow models. These models have been particularly pivotal in studying geomorphological changes caused by soil erosion and landslides, as well as glacial landforms and snow avalanches43,44,45. Combining the x-ray method for 3D free surface profiling with the application of x-ray radiography for measuring depth-averaged velocities provides a powerful means of comprehensively evaluating the predictions of shallow-water-type models.

The experimental observations made in this paper allow us to investigate the secondary flow patterns and mechanism. To further our understanding of this and other geometries, it is important to isolate the controlling factors that determine the presence and magnitude of such secondary flows. Since the secondary vortices are confined and placed symmetrically between the lateral sidewalls, a key question here is whether these boundaries are required to produce such flow patterns. To this end, we have also studied the dependence of the secondary flows on sidewalls using DEM simulations of a similar configuration but with either frictionless sidewalls or periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions (see Supplementary Information). In the frictionless sidewall case, some traces of secondary flows could still be detected. On the other hand, the analysis using the periodic boundaries appears to entirely eliminate the secondary flows, suggesting that the boundedness is indeed a necessary condition and that secondary flows would not form spontaneously in an unconfined setting. A more comprehensive study of the exact role of the wall properties in the development of secondary flows remains open. While most bulldozed grain systems will, in practise, be bounded by the finite domain of the bulldozer cap, this observation helps inform higher-order constitutive models incorporating, for example, non-local effects4. These models can, in turn, contribute to our understanding of other potential secondary mechanisms in unbounded flows, such as the presence of longitudinal ridges on Martian landslide deposits46, which have been postulated to occur during the transition from thick to thin flow regimes.

Building on the results presented here, future work could apply the same general tools to different materials to investigate, for example, the role of grain shape and convexity, which has previously been found to induce qualitatively distinct secondary mechanisms27,30. Furthermore, the complementary imaging approach, key to the success of this study, could be extended further to allow us to study an even broader range of granular and glassy media. In particular, to elucidate whether the granular or viscous fluid phase drives secondary flows in suspensions, one could combine the dry granular tools presented here with submerged refractive index-matching scanning experiments. This would provide insight into the behaviour of saturated and partially saturated systems.

The experimental flume is divided into three sections: a reservoir to supply incoming grains, the flow region of interest, and an outflow region where grains leave the system and fall into a bucket. The length of the flow domain is 0.55 m, and it has a width of 0.10 m. The walls separating these regions are elevated at heights h1 and h2 above the belt and the lateral sidewalls. The sidewalls confine the flow for the whole length of the experimental domain, including the outflow. The conveyor belt is made of rubber with uniformly distributed asperities of size 3 mm. The two cross-flow walls and the flume are all made out of 1cm-thick acrylic sheets, whereas the front wall, which accumulates the heap, is made of aluminium. To avoid vibrations during tests, the flume was first pressed against the conveyor belt under its weight and then anchored tightly using beams at the top of the system, out of the line of x-rays. This anchoring approach prevented grains from slipping under the walls or even getting stuck during the tests, thus averting any potential belt damage.

The granular material comprises spherical glass beads with an average diameter of d = 3 mm. The test is set up by first filling up the reservoir with grains, as well as placing an additional pile of grains with a height > h1 next to the reservoir gate, inside the flow region of interest. As the belt starts moving, the new grains entering the flowing domain join the pile and eventually either impact the outgoing wall or flow through the downstream opening, so their aggregated bulk eventually forms a steady heap a few seconds after impact. The online Supplementary Video 1 captures this process. The steady state concludes when the reservoir empties, which ceases the incoming flux and gradually reduces the heap's size until it levels and disappears. Through trial and error it was found that by taking h2 = h1 − d/2 the flow maintained a sufficiently prolonged steady state geometry for x-ray imaging that lasted up to 2 minutes, limited by the capacity of the reservoir.

Multiple tests were performed, all with the belt velocity Ub fixed at 2 cm s−1 to eliminate motion blur on the x-ray radiographs. On the other hand, we varied h1 from 25 to 60 mm, and the height of the heap h* from 50 mm to h* ≈ 100 mm by changing the initial amount of grains on the conveyor belt. The test results show that the heap length L solely depends on the heap height h* − h1, and the heap maintains a constant slope α ≃ 18o. Given this trend, a single test is analysed in this study, with h1 ≈ 25 mm and h* ≈ 77 mm. Additional test results confirming the robustness of the mechanism are presented in the Supplementary Information.

The x-ray sources were positioned ~2 m from the flume to minimise non-parallel beam effects. Similarly, the x-ray detectors were situated around 20 cm from the flume in the opposite direction of their respective sources, as depicted in Fig. 1. Steel panels were positioned to prevent undesired illumination of the detectors from their non-associated sources. During tests, the sources were set to produce x-ray at a maximum energy of 190 keV and 4 mA current for source 1, and 190 keV and 5 mA for source 2. Radiographs were captured at a frequency of 30 fps with a resolution of 960 × 768 px at 16-bit with a spatial resolution of 0.29 px mm−1 and 0.22 px mm−1 for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. In addition to the full, flowing system, radiographs were also obtained of the empty chute to aid subsequent analysis. The accuracy of the 2D and 3D velocity measurement methods presented in this work has been studied using known velocity fields23,40. While the methods sometimes introduce quantitative errors, they qualitatively recover a range of underlying fields and therefore the secondary flow findings in this paper are believed to be robust.

Here, we introduce a reconstruction method for establishing 3D profiles of free surfaces of granular flows using x-ray radiography from two orthogonal directions. The starting point of the method assumes that the radiograph intensity Ii from the i-th detector follows the Beer-Lambert absorption law47:

where Ii,R is the i-th detector's reference intensity of the radiograph of the empty flume, μ ≡ μ(ξ) is the local absorption of the material at the ξ location, while the integral is over the x-ray beam length.

In the case of detector 2, assuming that there is no significant spatial change in the volume fraction of the dense flowing material, Eq. (1) simplifies and rearranges to:

where hBL(x, y) is the theoretical Beer-Lambert surface height profile, and μc is the effective material absorption of the grains on detector 2, which is assumed constant. The radiograph intensities Ii, used in this process, are depicted in Supplementary Video 3, along with their values normalised by Ii,R. In order to capture additional effects such as beam hardening and x-ray scattering, which are not considered by the Beer-Lambert law, we consider the following empirical linear relation for the actual surface height profile:

with βc a constant.

In order to obtain μc and βc, we first calculate a nominal profile of the averaged height along the y direction, \({ < h > }_{y}\equiv { < h > }_{y}(x)\) using detector 1. This is done from direct thresholding of the time-averaged absorption field \({ < \ln ({I}_{1}/{I}_{1,R}) > }_{t}\), and is well-defined thanks to the very different absorption of air and grains, and the fact that the material height does not vary much across the y direction of the flume, even near the dip.

To first order, the surface height at the centre of the flume is estimated by \(h(x,0)\approx { < h > }_{y}\). Then, the effective material attenuation coefficient μc on detector 2 can be found by fitting a linear law from the time-averaged absorption field observed at each pixel along the centre line:

where we obtain μc = 0.01117 mm−1, as well as βc = 0.2304 which was introduced to allow for additional effects of beam hardening and x-ray scattering. The fit can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 2.

As a last step, h(x, y) from Eq. (3) is smoothed with a 2D Gaussian filter of standard deviation 6 px.

The physical experiments were computationally modelled using the DEM through the open source code YADE48. The simulations involved N ≈ 120,000 spherical particles, which were modelled using a viscoelastic contact law with a linear spring for normal contacts and a Coulomb threshold for tangential contacts49. These particles have the same average diameter 3 ± 0.75 mm as the glass beads used in experiments, with some added polydispersity to avoid crystallisation while preventing segregation. Their interparticle friction was set at 0.5, their stiffness at 1 × 107 Pa, their density was set at 2500 kg m−3 to mimic the material and ensure maximum interparticle deformation of 10−4d. The normal restitution coefficient was set at 0.5, and the Poisson's ratio at 0.3. To mimic the geometric effects of the rubber conveyor belt, its texture of was simulated using a set of spheres with a fixed spacing of every two rows along the y-axis, at a height z = 0, with a longitudinal row at a height of z = − d. These boundary grains were set in motion at velocity Ub and had an increased friction coefficient of 1.0. A similar friction coefficient was set to describe the acrylic walls, aligning with literature values for the friction coefficient between glass with acrylic and rubber50. Fictitious rolling friction was not implemented since the boundary spheres provide an actual physical rolling resistance. However, different friction coefficient values and belt arrangements were tested, with the stated combination of parameters above exhibiting the closest similarity to the experimental result while also aligning with the physical properties of the simulated materials.

The experimental setup for the simulations mirrored the physical experiment: a reservoir initially filled with grains and a pile of grains situated inside the flume. The pile height was adjusted to match h* upon reaching a steady state. Once a constant state was achieved, the grains' locations, velocities, and radii were recorded to a file at a frequency of 30 fps, mirroring the experimental setup. 2700 frames were used for the simulations presented in this work. Next, a coarse-graining method51 was employed to obtain the velocity and density fields of the recorded flowing spheres, using a Lucy windowing function with a radius of 2d.

Synthetic radiographs were generated from DEM data as in previous studies40,42 using the sphere positions and radii to calculate the attenuation along the x-ray path. This was based on an idealised system where the sample consists of solid particles, each of the same uniform x-ray attenuation coefficient, and interstitial air of negligible attenuation compared to the solid phase. Assuming a parallel x-ray beam with no scattering, the Beer-Lambert attenuation law then simplifies to

where I0,DEM is the initial x-ray intensity before travelling through any grains, μDEM is the constant attenuation coefficient and D is the total thickness of grains that the x-ray beam travels through. This thickness will depend on the pixel position (η, ζ) in the local imaging coordinates and can be calculated by summing each of the N projected particle thicknesses. For detector 1 the depth is then given by

and similarly for detector 2 the depth is

where (xi, yi, zi) and ri represent the position and radius of particle i. These two thicknesses are calculated for each frame and Eq. (5) is then used to generate the corresponding artificial radiographs with an arbitrary attenuation coefficient of μDEM = 10, initial intensity I0,DEM = 100,000 and spatial resolution 3 px mm−1.

In order to emphasise the density fluctuations within the flow, the radiographs are first divided by the time-averaged intensity of the steady-state frames \({ < I > }_{t}\). The absorption fluctuation field (μfluct) is then calculated by

as depicted in Supplementary Video 3. The 3D velocity field is reconstructed using the x-ray rheography technique40 applied to the normalised intensity fields μfluct. We focus on the x-axis velocity component, which is common to both imaging directions. X-ray rheography is a correlation-based algorithm that first reconstructs the distribution of in-plane displacements through the out-of-plane direction by solving a deconvolution problem42. It then solves an optimisation problem to combine velocity distributions from two perpendicular directions and reconstruct internal velocity fields. The accuracy and sources of errors of x-ray rheography have previously been investigated for both the initial distribution reconstruction42 and the whole rheography process40 (see Supplementary Information within).

Here, we apply the initial correlation analysis on successive pairs of images using an interrogation window size of 32 px and a maximum displacement of  ±16 px. The deconvolution process was conducted utilising regularisation parameters α = 0.1 and p = 2.0 (see Baker et al.40), and this was repeated for multiple pairs of images to improve accuracy, up to a maximum of 100,000 evaluations. The optimisation problem was solved by averaging the best 100 configurations with the smallest errors from a total of 10,000 to give the resulting internal x velocities. Note that this velocity field assumes a uniform free surface across the width of the flume, and thus disregards the obtained dip along with any other variation in the free surface. The calculated velocity fields are therefore trimmed using the free surface measurements in order to eliminate extrapolated velocities out of the granular domain.

The experimental depth-averaged velocity fields were computed from successive x-ray radiographs using the methodology developed by Guillard et al.23 for granular silos, which was validated against known flow rates from a mass balance. PIV analysis was performed on the attenuation fluctuation fields μfluct from the experiments and the DEM synthetic radiographs using the software PIVLab52. For the DEM radiographs, the analysis was conducted using auto contrast, with FFT window deformation as the PIV algorithm. The interrogation width area was set at 64 px with a step of 32 px for the first pass, and a width of 32 px with a step of 16 px for a second pass. A Gauss 2 × 3 point for the sub-pixel estimator and a standard correlation robustness setting were applied. Similar settings were applied for the experimental radiographs, with the addition of a CLAHE filter of 64 px during image preprocessing. For the side detector analysis, a mask drawn at the free surface of the side view detector (1) was implemented to ignore all displacements above the free surface. Obtained displacements for detector 1 were calibrated using height h2 and for detector 2 using the known flume width. The final results were averaged in time with no additional filtering.

Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are common over-the-counter medications that many of us reach for when we're sick. But new research from the University of South Australia shows that these trusted staples are quietly fuelling one of the world's biggest health threats: antibiotic resistance.

In the first study of its kind, researchers found that ibuprofen and acetaminophen are not only driving antibiotic resistance when used individually but amplifying it when used together.

Assessing the interaction of non-antibiotic medications, the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) -- a common bacteria that causes gut and urinary tract infections ­­- researchers found that ibuprofen and acetaminophen significantly increased bacterial mutations, making E. coli highly resistant to the antibiotic.

It's an important finding that has serious health implications, particularly for people in aged care homes, where multiple medications are regularly administered.

The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.

Lead researcher UniSA's Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.

"Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria," Assoc Prof Venter says.

"This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications -- not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure -- making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.

"In this study we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut or urinary tract infections.

"When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and acetaminophen, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.

"We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective."

The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery) , temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).

Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.

"Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore," Assoc Prof Venter says.

"This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications -- particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.

"This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics -- and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations."

The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.

Melania Trump has picked her project as first lady: proliferating AI. On Tuesday, she announced the Presidential Artificial Intelligence Challenge, a “Presidential Fitness Challenge” for the less phys. ed. inclined that will task K-12 students with using AI tools to solve community-based problems, and made it clear that she will be the face of the Trump administration's AI push.

Frankly, she's perfect.

Firstly, she'd be right for just about any cause you put in front of her because she is simply an ambient human. She can serve as the face of just about anything, and it is acceptable to most audiences because she's a largely inoffensive and sometimes even sympathetic figure. She's basically always polled with higher approval ratings than her husband despite standing by him for everything, like she's lovely wallpaper placed on the wall of a torture chamber. During her modeling career, she served as the spokesmodel for Camel cigarettes and faced basically zero pushback or objection for doing so because the attitude of the general public seems to be, “Who cares what Melania Trump does or did?”

But taking on AI is ideal for a person who is constantly doing an impression of someone else's work in a way that just isn't quite right. Melania has cribbed a lot from Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of John F. Kennedy. She's done everything from fashion to taking a page out of her book and redesigning the White House Rose Garden—the Melania's take is much less serene and more concrete, a real “paved paradise and put up a parking lot”-ass interpretation of Kennedy's work. Trump has even insisted that Melania is the “Jackie O” of our time, which, much like AI chatbots, is an innovation most of us simply never asked for.

She also famously plagiarized a speech from Michelle Obama, which is a quality befitting the plagiarism machine that is AI. That whole situation also raised some interesting and previously underconsidered questions about copyright, which is something Big Tech firms (sucking up as much data and information as possible, regardless of copyright protections, to train their large language models) can certainly relate to.

She got hit with plagiarism charges again in 2018 when she launched her first cause as First Lady, tackling cyberbullying, after it was discovered that her “Be Best” campaign bore a striking resemblance to an almost identical initiative that was started during the Obama administration. But hey, it's way easier to do the work when it's already been done for you.

Melania told the New York Post that she hopes to become the “First Lady of Technology,” and she's already done a fair amount of embracing tech with very little discernment as to whether it's actually good or not. She's got some ideas, to be fair: the TAKE IT DOWN Act that she backed in an effort to stop non-consensual deepfakes of people from proliferating has its intentions in the right place, whether the approach is good policy is another question, and her anti-cyberbullying campaign had the right spirit (though she should maybe talk to her husband about his social media presence).

But she's also happy to embrace tech without any real consideration of the consequences, whether that is the mostly harmless decision to publish an audiobook in which an AI model trained on her voice serves as the narrator or lend her name and likeness to a crypto memecoin that cost people millions. Much like AI, she could be useful if applied correctly, but mostly, she does more harm than good.

Anthropic has reached a preliminary settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by a group of prominent authors, marking a major turn in of the most significant ongoing AI copyright lawsuits in history. The move will allow Anthropic to avoid what could have been a financially devastating outcome in court.

The settlement agreement is expected to be finalized September 3, with more details to follow, according to a legal filing published on Tuesday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Anthropic declined to comment.

In 2024, three book writers, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, sued Anthropic, alleging that the startup illegally used their work to train its artificial intelligence models. In June, California district court judge William Alsup issued a summary judgment in Bartz v. Anthropic that largely sided with Anthropic, finding that the company's usage of the books was “fair use” and thus legal.

But the judge ruled that the manner in which Anthropic had acquired some of the works, by downloading them through so-called shadow libraries, including a notorious site called LibGen, constituted piracy. Alsup ruled that the book authors could still take Anthropic to trial in a class action for pirating their works; the legal showdown was slated to begin in December.

Statutory damages for this kind of piracy start at $750 per infringed work, according to US copyright law. Because the library of books amassed by Anthropic was thought to contain approximately 7 million works, the AI company was potentially facing court-imposed penalties amounting to billions, possibly more than $1 trillion dollars.

“It's a stunning turn of events, given how Anthropic was fighting tooth and nail in two courts in this case. And the company recently hired a new trial team,” says Edward Lee, a law professor at Santa Clara University who closely follows AI copyright litigation. “But they had few defenses at trial, given how Judge Alsup ruled. So Anthropic was starting at the risk of statutory damages in ‘doomsday' amounts.”

Most authors who may have been part of the class action were just starting to receive notice that they qualified to participate. The Authors Guild, a trade group representing professional writers, sent out a notice alerting authors that they might be eligible earlier this month, and lawyers for the plaintiffs were scheduled to submit a “list of affected works” to the court on September 1. This means that many of these writers were not privy to the negotiations that took place.

“The big question is whether there is a significant revolt from within the author class after the settlement terms are unveiled,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and internet law at Cornell University. “That will be a very important barometer of where copyright owner sentiment stands.”

Anthropic is still facing a number of other copyright-related legal challenges. One of the most high-profile disputes involves a group of major record labels, including Universal Music Group, which allege that the company illegally trained its AI programs on copyrighted lyrics. The plaintiffs recently filed to amend their case to allege that Anthropic had used the peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent to download songs illegally.

Settlements don't set legal precedent, but the details of this case will likely be watched closely as dozens of other high-profile AI copyright cases continue to wind through the courts.

Seattle-area tech veteran Matt Fisher is joining immersive media startup Adventr as a late-stage co-founder to help the company evolve how people use AI to create and interact with games, videos, music, movies and more.

With previous stints at Amazon, Microsoft, Nordstrom, Auth0 and elsewhere, Fisher was most recently co-founder and CTO at Daydream, a startup that raised a $50 million seed round last year to shake up the way people find and buy clothing online.

Fisher left Daydream in October, and set out to find what he wanted to do next in the AI space. He'd already been serving as a technical advisor to Adventr founder and CEO Devo Harris and the two decided it was time for Fisher to come onboard and help build the next evolution of the company.

“We've gone all-in on gaming and immersive experiences,” Fisher said. “What we're building takes the jump from just watching movies, videos, and games to actually stepping inside them. Suddenly, every player or viewer isn't just along for the ride, they can shape their own version of reality.”

Fisher is especially bullish about how voice will be the dominant method of building content as well as interacting with it, especially in gamified media. Creators can talk to Adventr's system and tell it what they want, prompting and editing with a suite of tools that is driven by voice. And voice will drive “play” inside that specific piece of content.

The company has already launched Adventr.tv, a streaming platform for console-less gaming.

“We're strong believers that voice tears down the old walls and flips audiences into creators, opening the door to generative, interactive worlds that feel real,” Fisher said.

Harris is a Grammy award-winning producer and co-founder of G.O.O.D Music, the independent record label founded by his cousin, Kanye West. His early work in interactive video creation included the choose-your-own-adventure music video “Attack of the 5 foot Hipster” by the band Riot In Paris.

While Harris is based in New York, Fisher said he believes deeply in the Seattle area's talent pool and he plans to hire engineers in the region.

Current Adventr offerings include a variety of assets, games and videos, from “Lab Rat,” a multiplayer interactive movie, to a workout with Megan Thee Stallion, to a Volvo video that lets you control the owners manual, to numerous games.

For Fisher, a realistic future feels like what's depicted in the sci-fi novels he's a fan of, such as “Ready Player One.”

“As we evolve into this more AI-centric community and civilization, we want to be immersed,” Fisher said.

Looking to upgrade your Sonos setup? The Sonos Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is 20 percent off from Amazon, bringing it down to just $359 and tying its lowest-ever price. That's a great deal on our editors' favorite surround sound Sonos speaker, and it would make a perfect upgrade to your existing Sonos configuration or a place to start building your audio empire.

The big draw here is spatial audio, which our team feels performs even better than Apple's Homepod (5/10, WIRED Review) when it comes to filling a room with sound. That's largely thanks to the array of drivers, including six speakers, four tweeters, and a pair of mid/bass drivers all packed into one vaguely robot-butt-shaped device.

We also appreciate that the Era 300 has physical controls, in case you need to make quick adjustments without pulling out your phone. There's a volume slider, track controls, and a button to activate either Amazon Alexa or the Sonos Voice Control. There's also Bluetooth pairing if you want to skip the Sonos app altogether and just hook your phone up directly.

The app (now finally working again after some woes last year) provides a lot of value, though, letting you connect all of your speakers together for whole home audio, and it supports distinct speaker types, like soundbars and bookshelf speakers. Sonos speakers are easy to set up and configure, have a wide support for streaming services and smart home options, and just sound great. They even found their way onto our favorite Bluetooth speakers list, despite having their own protocol for home audio.

Our reviewer was particularly impressed with the audio quality on the Era 300, saying it sounded detailed and expressive whether they were listening to music or spoken word and calling it a “poised and eloquent listen.” Make sure to check out the full review for more details on why we like this speaker over the many other Sonos options.

If you want to double up for true multichannel surround sound, you can pick up two speakers as a bundle, but you won't save any cash, just packaging. The big downside to Sonos speakers is that they tend to be expensive, but if you're looking to get started in the ecosystem and have a great television to pair it with, these are worth a serious look.

A top Social Security Administration official turned whistleblower says members of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server, putting the personal information of most Americans at risk of compromise.

Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration's chief data officer, said in a newly released whistleblower complaint published Tuesday that other top agency officials signed off on a decision in June to upload “a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,” despite Borges raising concerns.

The database, known as the Numerical Identification System, contains more than 450 million records containing all of the data submitted as part of a Social Security application, including the applicant's name, place of birth, citizenship, and the Social Security numbers of their family members, as well as other sensitive personal and financial information.

Borges said members of DOGE, the team of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server “apparently lacking in independent security controls,” such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. 

The lack of security protections violated internal agency security controls and federal privacy laws, the complaint alleges. 

Borges said by allowing DOGE to be administrators of the agency's cloud, the DOGE operatives would be able to create “publicly accessible services,” meaning that they could allow public access to the cloud system and any of the sensitive data stored inside.

Borges warned in the complaint that if this information were compromised, “it is possible that the sensitive [personally identifiable information] on every American including health diagnoses, income levels and banking information, family relationships, and personal biographic data could be exposed publicly, and shared widely.” 

The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have “catastrophic impact” on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone's Social Security numbers.

While a federal restraining order in March initially blocked DOGE staffers from accessing the country's database of Social Security records, the Supreme Court lifted the order on June 6, paving the way for DOGE's access. 

In the days that followed, DOGE allegedly worked to seek internal approvals from the agency's top brass, per Borges' complaint.

The agency's chief information officer Aram Moghaddassi approved the move to copy the database to the agency's cloud, saying he “determined the business need is higher than the security risk” and that he accepts “all risks” with the project. The complaint also says Michael Russo, a senior DOGE operative who previously served as the agency's chief information officer prior to Moghaddassi but remains at the agency, also approved moving live Social Security data to the cloud.

Borges said he first raised issues internally at the agency but later blew the whistle to urge members of Congress to “engage in immediate oversight to address these serious concerns,” according to a statement by his attorney, Andrea Meza, at the Government Accountability Project.

This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives, including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. Since January, members of DOGE have taken sweeping control of most U.S. federal departments and their datasets of citizens' data.

When reached by TechCrunch, Elizabeth Huston, a spokesperson for the White House, would not say if the administration was aware of the complaint and deferred comment to the Social Security Administration. 

In an emailed response, Social Security Administration spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency “stores personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.”

“The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA's Information Security team,” the spokesperson added. 

The spokesperson said the agency was “not aware of any compromise to this environment.”

Data breaches involving federal government data stored in the cloud are rare but not unheard of. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that the U.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emails online due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure's separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfiguration allowed the contents of a military unit's emails to publicly spill online.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated where the DOD's exposed email was hosted. The story now accurately reflects that the exposed data was hosted on Microsoft's Azure.

Samsung's hybrid 990 Evo Plus SSD has hit a wonderful new all-time low price. We're outside of any sales event, with Labor Day being the next opportunity to pick up some sort of tech bargain if retailers participate. But that doesn't stop Amazon from offering this drive at the best price we've ever seen for this particular SSD.

1TB SSDs are very reasonably priced these days, with 1TB being the minimum size you'd want in a modern computer, as just the operating system can take up a hefty portion of the available storage, and only a couple of AAA games sucking up the rest, thanks to their ever-increasing installation sizes.

Checking the Camelizer extension, we can confirm that $64.99 is the lowest-ever price offered for the 1TB 990 Evo Plus SSD. With an original MSRP list price of $104.99, you're saving around 38% or $40, but the 990 Evo Plus has been selling regularly for around $74 - $79, so a more realistic saving discount is $10 - $15.

The Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality.

Samsung's discount makes the 990 EVO Plus 1TB one of the best low-budget options in the M.2 space. Similar 1TB options in the same price range can have less performance, feature slower QLC flash memory, and don't have PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 compatibility.

The 990 Evo Plus 1TB sports sequential read performance of up to 7,450 MB/s and sequential write performance of up to 6,300 MB/s. This 1TB variant shares the same 236-layer (V8) V-NAND TLC as its bigger brother, the 990 Pro, which also boasts 600 TB of write endurance and a five-year warranty. (The main differentiating factor is that the 990 Pro has LPDDR4 memory, while the 990 Evo Plus is a DRAM-less drive.)

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus is one of our favorite SSD drives thanks to its price and capacity ratios. The drive rectifies all the earlier mistakes that Samsung made with the vanilla 990 EVO, and provides excellent hardware for the price, with performance that can approach the 990 Pro in some cases. Chuck into the mix that you can install this SSD in either an older Gen 4 system or a newer Gen 5 build. This is a great low-budget option for an easy storage upgrade.

A plan to bolster the nation's cybersecurity that will cost virtually nothing was unveiled Tuesday by the Internet Security Alliance (ISA).

In a 21-page document, the alliance offers five recommendations that it maintains “will cost the federal government virtually nothing” and, as a bonus, save private industry billions.

The document titled “A Zero Cost Path to American Cybersecurity” outlines initiatives that operationalize the Trump administration's philosophy of government.

“These are pragmatic programs that can be implemented quickly,” the document noted. “They will generate significant material improvements in our nation's cybersecurity almost immediately.

“These steps will also put our nation's intermediate and long-term security on a measurably effective and economically sustainable path that will enable us to address newly growing threats of systemic failure,” it continued.

“With White House backing,” it added, “these initiatives can transform cybersecurity from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage — and secure both the nation's digital future and the president's legacy as the leader who turned deregulation into a national security triumph.”

One recommendation from the alliance is that the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should utilize its existing authority to eliminate duplicative cybersecurity regulations.

“The scope of duplicative cybersecurity regulations is staggering,” declared David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark, N.J.

“A recent GAO analysis found that among just four major federal agencies, 49% to 79% of cybersecurity requirement parameters were in direct conflict with each other,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The most glaring example is incident reporting, where we currently have 45 different cyber incident reporting requirements spread across 22 federal agencies, each with their own forms and websites.”

“This regulatory chaos is severely undermining our cybersecurity capabilities,” he continued. “Large financial institutions report their cyber teams now spend more than 70% of their time on regulatory compliance rather than actually improving security. Some companies are spending nearly half their entire cybersecurity budget just filling out duplicative compliance reports.”

“When cybersecurity professionals are buried in paperwork instead of defending networks, we're essentially doing the attackers' work for them,” he said. “Eliminating these duplicative requirements would immediately free up billions of dollars in resources that could be redirected toward actual threat detection, incident response, and security improvements.”

The problem is not only that duplicative regulations waste time for anyone involved with them, but they are often different and sometimes at cross-purposes with each other, added Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider, in Clearwater, Fla.

“NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] recommends not having a minimum password size, removing the need to change it on a periodic basis and removing the complexity requirement,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Most other cybersecurity guides, including many governmental regulations, require the exact opposite.”

There may also be a significant hurdle in implementing the ISA's recommendation through the OMB. “The OMB's role is to coordinate regulations and look to see if they're inconsistent or duplicative or whatever,” said Berin Szóka, president of TechFreedom, a technology advocacy group, in Washington, D.C. “They can't repeal regulations as this document claims.”

“It's up to the agencies to repeal rules,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Then the question that you get into is whether the agencies can short-circuit the normal rulemaking process. The Trump administration has claimed that agencies don't have to go through normal rulemaking if they think that a rule is unlawful. That's just not true. That's not how the Administrative Procedure Act works.”

The ISA is also recommending that a cost-benefit analysis be required for all cybersecurity regulations. “Despite spending trillions of dollars on cybersecurity regulatory compliance, no study has ever documented that the cybersecurity regulations actually enhance security,” it contended.

However, Heath Renfrow, CISO and co-founder of Fenix24, a cyber disaster recovery firm in Chattanooga, Tenn., pointed out that while on the surface, a cost-benefit analysis seems like an economic safeguard, in cybersecurity, the cost side is tangible while the benefit side is probabilistic.

“How do you quantify the avoided cost of a ransomware event that didn't occur because of MFA adoption?” he asked. “Traditional cost-benefit frameworks, like OMB Circular A-4, break down because cyberattacks are low-frequency, high-impact events with cascading second-order effects.”

“That said, forcing agencies to at least articulate assumptions, model scenarios, and test proportionality would raise the quality of regulatory drafting,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The danger is in weaponization. Companies may argue that unless you can prove a breach will cost X amount of money, the regulation isn't worth it. The balance is ensuring analysis informs regulation, without paralyzing it.”

NJIT's Bader agreed that the risk of using cost-benefit analysis to avoid necessary regulations is real and concerning. “Many cybersecurity benefits are preventative and systemic, making them difficult to capture in traditional economic models,” he said. “The cascading effects we've seen from supply chain attacks like SolarWinds demonstrate that the true cost of cyber incidents often far exceeds initial estimates.”

“However,” he continued, “when properly implemented with methodologies that account for these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis could actually improve cybersecurity by ensuring resources go to the most impactful security measures. The key is developing models sophisticated enough to handle the unique characteristics of cyber risk, rather than applying standard regulatory cost-benefit frameworks that weren't designed for this domain.”

Another recommendation by the ISA is that the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act should be reauthorized and modernized.

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA 2015) — the legal foundation for public-private cyber collaboration — will expire on September 30, 2025, unless reauthorized, the ISA explained. “Allowing it to lapse would severely limit the government's ability to share threat intelligence with industry, undermining national security,” it maintained.

Bader argued that CISA needs urgent modernization because it was written for a threat landscape that no longer exists. “The 2015 law was crafted before we understood AI-enabled attacks, sophisticated supply chain compromises, or the unique vulnerabilities of cloud infrastructure,” he said. The definitions of what constitutes shareable cybersecurity information are too narrow for today's threat environment.”

“With the advent of AI and the ability to build malicious code a lot faster than we've ever seen before, traditional ways of sharing information can't keep up with the threat,” added Matt Stern, chief security officer at Hypori, a mobile infrastructure security firm, in Reston, Va.

“If we're going to even get parity with the threat,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We have to be able to modernize the regulation so that it can deal with getting threat information into the hands of the people that need it in a much more realistic and quicker fashion.”

Fenix24's Renfrow added that private sector participation in sharing is still weak under the existing act. “Modernization should include liability safe harbors for companies that share indicators of compromise in good faith and reciprocal obligations for the government to return actionable intel in real time,” he said.

The ISA is also recommending that a cost-effective cybersecurity workforce be created for the government, largely through the PIVOTT Act currently before Congress.

Under PIVOTT (Providing Individuals Various Opportunities for Technical Training), students can enroll in existing cybersecurity programs offered by colleges, community colleges, and certificate programs. The federal government would pay for their tuition. In return, the students would be required to perform a specified amount of government service.

PIVOTT's target is to enroll up to 10,000 students a year eventually. “At that rate, PIVOTT would solve the federal government's cybersecurity workforce gap (35,000) in less than 4 years,” the ISA noted.

“The PIVOTT Act's apprenticeship and rotation model is promising because it treats cyber talent like a renewable resource,” Renfrow said. “You move skilled practitioners across agencies rather than each agency trying to grow its own siloed pipeline.”

“Four years is optimistic,” he added, “but without structural change like PIVOTT, the problem will persist indefinitely.”

While finding the PIVOTT concept a good one, Ida Byrd-Hill, CEO and founder of Automation Workz, a reskilling and diversity consulting firm in Detroit, Mich., argued that more money should be directed at the workforce development system in the Department of Labor. “Most people do not realize that just getting technology training at a university, college, or community college is not sufficient if you don't have a certification,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“The problem could have long been solved if the government supported learn and earn programs,” she added. “The government has not acquiesced to do that yet. They have to step up. It's not just about scholarships and training.”

A fifth recommendation by ISA is to establish a national macroeconomic cybersecurity dashboard.

The ISA explained that the federal government is spending tens of billions of dollars every year on an extensive range of cybersecurity projects. “Yet without a sophisticated model, policymakers are blind to the full economic cost of cyber threats, the ROI of defenses, the usefulness of alternative methods such as incentive programs rather than regulation, the systemic impacts of major incidents, and the most cost-effective ways to eliminate, mitigate, or transfer risk,” it noted.

It advised the National Cyber Director to collaborate with federal government agencies to promote a more sophisticated cyber risk assessment methodology based on the proven NACD-ISA framework.

“We desperately need a national cybersecurity dashboard because our current approach to cyber risk assessment is fundamentally broken,” Bader said. “Right now, we have dozens of agencies doing their own cyber risk assessments with no coordination or common methodology. It's like trying to understand the health of the U.S. economy by looking at 22 different, incompatible financial reports.”

“The NACD-ISA framework that would underpin this dashboard has been independently validated by MIT and PwC research,” he continued. “Organizations using these principles have 85% fewer cyber incidents and significantly better risk management outcomes. This isn't theoretical — it's a proven approach that works at the enterprise level.”

“Think of it as a Cyber Dow Jones Index — not predicting daily movements but measuring the structural health of the economy under cyber stress,” Renfrow added. “Without that visibility, policymakers are steering blind in a domain where adversaries are already treating cyber as macroeconomic warfare.”

IBM and AMD are partnering to develop next-generation computing architectures that integrate IBM's quantum systems with AMD's AI-specialized chips. The move could position both the tech giant and chipmaker as key infrastructure players as they look to regain ground after falling behind on the generative AI boom.

Together, IBM and AMD will attempt to launch a commercially viable quantum computing architecture — one that's scalable and open sourced. In other words, it will be more widely accessible to researchers and developers solving complex real-world problems in fields like drug and materials discovery, optimization, and logistics, per IBM.

“Quantum computing will simulate the natural world and represent information in an entirely new way,” said Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, in a statement. “By exploring how quantum computers from IBM and the advanced high-performance compute technologies of AMD can work together, we will build a powerful hybrid model that pushes past the limits of traditional computing.”

Google is rolling out a new AI-powered experimental feature in Google Translate designed to help people practice and learn a new language, the company announced on Tuesday. Translate is also gaining new live capabilities to make it easier to communicate in real time with a person speaking a different language.

The new language practice feature is designed for both beginners starting to learn conversational skills and advanced speakers looking to brush up on their vocabulary, the company says. To do so, it creates tailored listening and speaking practice sessions that adapt to a user's skill level and unique learning goals.

With this new language practice feature, Google is taking on Duolingo, the popular language learning app that uses a gamified approach to help users practice over 40 languages. 

To access the feature, you'll select the “practice” option in the Google Translate app. From there, you can set skill level and goals. Google Translate then generates customized scenarios where you can either listen to conversations and tap the words you hear to build comprehension, or you can practice speaking. The exercises track users' daily progress, Google says.

The beta experience is rolling out in the Google Translate app for Android and iOS starting Tuesday. The feature is available first for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as for Spanish, French, and Portuguese speakers practicing English.

Google is also introducing the ability for users to have back-and-forth conversations with audio and on-screen translations through the Translate app.

“Building on our existing live conversation experience, our advanced AI models are now making it even easier to have a live conversation in more than 70 languages — including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil,” Google wrote in a blog post. 

You can tap the “Live translate” option in the Translate app and then select the language you want to translate by simply speaking. You'll then hear the translation aloud alongside a transcript of your conversation in both languages. The app will translate and switch between the two languages that you and the other person are speaking. 

Google notes that the feature can identify pauses, accents, and intonations to allow for a natural-sounding conversation.

The feature uses Google's voice and speech recognition models to isolate sounds, which means you would be able to use the live capabilities in a loud restaurant or busy airport.

These live translation capabilities are available starting Tuesday for users in the U.S., India, and Mexico.

“These updates are made possible by advancements in AI and machine learning,” Google wrote in its blog post. “As we continue to push the boundaries of language processing and understanding, we are able to serve a wider range of languages and improve the quality and speed of translations. And with our Gemini models in Translate, we've been able to take huge strides in translation quality, multimodal translation, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.”

Google says that people translate around 1 trillion words across Translate, Search, Lens, and Circle to Search. The company believes these new AI-powered features will help overcome language barriers.

Summer is speeding by, and the return to school in Seattle next week would be a good time to slow down, especially in 19 new spots across the city where Speed Zone Safety Cameras have been added.

The Seattle Department of Transportation shared a reminder this week that its technology will target drivers going more than 20 mph in a school zone. And it doesn't take a numbers geek to appreciate the penalty — tickets for such an infraction are $237.

Many of the 38 School Zone Safety Cameras — located near public schools in Seattle — will be active when school starts on Wednesday, and the remainder will be installed during the school year, SDOT said in a blog post earlier this summer.

The zones are marked with yellow flashing beacons on speed limit signs. They are turned on at certain times based on when students are most likely to be present. Cameras in the zones photograph passing vehicles and license plates, and speeders receive a ticket in the mail. Pictures and video of any alleged camera violation can be viewed online.

The new locations were chosen based on safety and equity data analysis, according to SDOT, with the goal of adding cameras where they could have the biggest safety benefit. All revenue is invested in traffic safety upgrades in the city, including  new sidewalks, crosswalks, Safe Routes to School projects, and more.

The City of Seattle also uses cameras to enforce stopping at red lights; HOV, bike and bus lane infractions; and obstructing traffic or “blocking the box.”

Here's a list of where new School Zone Safety Cameras will be located:

When we talk of “desktop replacement” laptops, we usually speak in terms of raw performance, not upgradability. Framework, the company behind several generations of ultra-repairable and modular laptops and mini PCs, is the only company that can call its devices an option if you demand true customizability. The company is back again with a new iteration of its Framework 16, packing new CPU and GPU options with a full-fledged removable Nvida option. If the feel is as good as it was with the Framework Laptop 13, the new model could prove to be the last laptop you'll ever need, literally.

The revitalized Framework Laptop 16 now comes with an option for up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070. Nvidia's mid-range GPU is at its best with gaming at around 1440p resolution. The GPU is mostly limited by its 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which is going to hinder it for higher resolutions and for real future-proofing. If you don't want to upgrade for a while, you're better off with a discrete graphics processing unit with at least 16GB of VRAM. Normally, I would caution anybody with this fact if they thought about a system with these limited graphics. Instead, Framework's modularity means that you could upgrade your GPU rather than having to buy an entire new and increasingly expensive gaming laptop.

On the CPU side, you still have options of AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series CPUs, which will either be a Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9. The higher-end 12-core CPUs will be necessary if you expect to do any intensive tasks up to and including gaming.

If you have the older Framework Laptop 16, the new RTX 50-series module should be backwards compatible, according to Framework. Even beyond the graphics uplift, the new module has numerous other benefits, including power and external monitor support through the rear USB-C port. This module will support up to 100W TDP, which on older modules would push the fans to jet engine levels. Framework claims it reengineered its thermal design to keep the device cool while being less noisy. There's also a new 240W power brick to supply the necessary power and—better yet—it's using USB-C rather than any proprietary port.

The last-gen Framework 16 made use of an AMD Radeon RX 7700S graphics module. It was enough for some graphics scenarios, but in the end it wasn't nearly as capable as a full discrete Nvidia GPU. While AMD still has not offered any hint it plans to bring its Radeon RX 9000 series desktop graphics cards to laptops, gamers' only choice for mobile graphics capable of playing the latest AAA releases is still Team Green. Now that it's inside a removable module built for Framework's laptops, I can already see it becoming a go-to for DIY builders trying to come up with their own unique PCs.

If you eschew the new graphics module, you can still opt for the Radeon RX 7700S. If you don't want either, you can go for the Expansion Bay shell with room for other components. The device will support four display outputs through its four expansion card slots. These dongles stick into the open expansion slots on the laptop shell for any version of I/O your heart desires. As for RAM and storage, you can opt for RAM up to 96GB and up to 10TB of storage through the two M.2 SSD slots.

I'm still using my Framework Laptop 13. There's something intrinsic about knowing you put something together—that you know what's inside it and how to take it apart if necessary. That sense of ownership unfortunately comes at a premium. The Framework Laptop 16 starts at $1,500 without the GPU. The device comes stock with a 2,560 x 1,600 IPS LCD panel that goes up to a 165Hz refresh rate with Nvidia G-Sync. Gaming laptops that range from $2,000 on up normally offer mini LED or OLED displays with better contrast and/or brighter screens.

The starting price is $100 more than the 2023 model, and you can expect individual modules will cost more, as well. Still, the thought of finally having a true gaming-ready laptop with Framework's customizability is enough to spark a hint of joy, even from somebody who has clacked away on way too many gaming laptops in 2025 alone.

Uber Eats has agreed to pay $15 million to more than 16,000 delivery workers in Seattle after reaching a settlement with the city's labor standards office over allegations that the tech giant violated laws regulating how workers are paid.

A majority of the settlement was related to the city's Independent Contractor Protections (ICP) Ordinance, which passed in 2021 and aims to ensure pay transparency. The City alleged that Uber Eats misled workers by not disclosing that its “Boost” multiplier feature only applied to a portion of a fare and that the upfront payment amount already included the “Boost” promotion's contribution. 

Uber ended the “Boost” program in Seattle in August 2023, after the City contacted the company, according to the Office of Labor Standards (OLS).

Regulators also investigated Uber Eats for allegedly failing to provide minimum pay for certain canceled orders, per the city's App-Based Worker Minimum Payment (ABWMP) Ordinance, which passed in 2022. 

The City also alleged that Uber Eats failed to provide required notice of rights, electronic receipts, and weekly statements as required by the laws.

“As the largest settlement in OLS history, this sets a new benchmark and represents a significant milestone for the protection of worker rights in Seattle in the rapidly growing industry of app-based work,” Steven Marchese, director of the Office of Labor Standards, said in a statement. 

The alleged violations covered work between September 2022 and May 2025. 

Uber denied wrongdoing but agreed to the settlement. It also paid more than $33,000 in fines to the City of Seattle and will adopt a new policy that lets workers provide more information about cancellations.

“We value the work couriers do and want them to be successful,” the company said in a statement to GeekWire. “We've worked with the City of Seattle to resolve claims about information provided to couriers on offers and pay — and we're focused on improving the experience for Seattle's couriers, consumers and restaurants.”

Payment to workers is scheduled to be distributed by Labor Day next week.

“This historic $15 million settlement is a major win for workers and a strong reminder that in Seattle, we hold large companies accountable when they sidestep their responsibilities and shortchange workers,” Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement.

Seattle has been a leader in establishing worker protections for gig workers who make deliveries and drive people around town. 

Uber previously paid $3.4 million in a settlement with Seattle in 2021. The City also reached a $1.6 million settlement with DoorDash in 2023.

Regulatory costs are part of why Uber fares in Seattle are the highest in the U.S., the Seattle Times reported.

DoorDash recently increased delivery fees in Seattle in response to what it called “extreme regulations” passed by Seattle lawmakers, including a new law that gives app-based workers more transparency when they're removed from platforms.

I only wanted to point out that you're almost forced to come up with some theory you have to explain genomic findings. Over time, yes, most of those theories have historically been shown to be bunk. (My gut tells me this one will share a similar fate.)But that's the scientific method. Propose a hypothesis (theory). Design experiments to test said theory. Present the results. Which should lead you to another hypothesis.In the "propose a hypothesis" phase, at least in fields like this one, the proposals will tend to be informed more by world view than by science. That's how humans think. I don't think there's any changing that. The control, or "check and balance", is supposed to be the objective review and validated replication of the results. Which is, I grant you, lacking at times.

A security researcher has found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories.

Seyfullah Kiliç, founder of cybersecurity company SwordSec, said he found over 1,300 internet-exposed TeslaMate dashboards on the internet, likely made public by mistake, allowing anyone to access the person's Tesla data stored inside without needing a password.

TeslaMate is an open source data logger that allows Tesla owners to self-host and visualize their vehicle's data from their own computers, such as their vehicle's temperature, battery health, and charging sessions, but also more sensitive information, like vehicle speed and the location data of recent trips. 

In a blog post, Kiliç said he scanned the internet for public-facing TeslaMate dashboards and scraped the vehicle's last-seen location and Tesla model names, and visualized the vehicles on a map to show their locations. 

“You're unintentionally sharing your car's movements, charging habits, and even vacation times with the entire world,” wrote Kiliç.

Kiliç told TechCrunch that this was to raise awareness of the number of exposed servers, and urged TeslaMate users to secure their dashboards.

“The goal was to show Tesla owners and the open source community that without basic [authentication] or firewall rules, sensitive data (GPS, charging, trips) can be leaked,” said Kiliç.

While not a new problem, Kiliç shows that the number of exposed TeslaMate dashboards has gone up significantly since the last count back in 2022, when a security researcher at the time found dozens of public TeslaMate dashboards exposed to the web. 

Now, more than three years later, another security researcher has found more than a thousand self-hosted TeslaMate servers on the web and mapped them, showing that the problem has seemingly gotten worse.

TeslaMate's founder, Adrian Kumpf, told TechCrunch in 2022 that a bug fix was rolled out that aimed to protect against public access to customers' dashboards, but warned that the project could not protect against users accidentally exposing their TeslaMate servers to the internet. 

Kiliç said TeslaMate users should enable authentication on their servers to prevent public access.

“If you plan to run TeslaMate on a public-facing server, you must secure it,” wrote Kiliç.

Built on Intel's 18A node, the all-E-core Xeon packs 288 cores per socket and promises big efficiency gains.

Intel pulled the wraps off its first all-E-core Xeon at Hot Chips on Monday, August 25, in Cupertino, California. Dubbed Clearwater Forest, it's the first Xeon built on the company's next-gen 18A process.

Scheduled to ship in 2026, the processor packs a punch with 288 efficiency cores and a two-socket ceiling of 576 cores, as well as over 1,152 MB combined last-level cache. On paper, it's Intel's next attempt to close the performance-per-watt gap in the data center, and it's a shot across the bow at AMD's EPYC line.

Architecturally, Clearwater is a spiritual sequel to Intel's 144-core all-E-core Xeon, Sierra Forest, but with a few notable upgrades. The new Darkmont E-cores offer a wider 3x3 decode engine, deeper out-of-order windows, and enhanced execution ports, resulting in approximately 17% better IPC than the Crestmont generation.

Four cores share 4MB of L2 cache, and the chip doubles L2 bandwidth compared to the Sierra. Multiply that across 288 cores, and you've got a throughput monster designed to eat multithreaded web services and AI inference jobs alive.

The choice of process matters just as much as core count. Clearwater is one of the first real-world testbeds for Intel's 18A node, which pairs RibbonFET transistors with backside power delivery.

This is effectively Intel's answer to the density and power efficiency questions that have enabled TSMC and AMD to dominate in recent years. By separating power and signal routing, Intel claims higher cell utilization and lower IR drop, features that hyperscalers care about when power bills stretch into megawatts.

Compared to AMD's 128-core Bergamo, Clearwater plays an entirely different game. AMD cores support SMT, AVX-512-class vector units, and higher single-thread performance. In contrast, Intel's cores don't chase peak IPC; they chase scale. That means Clearwater might not top benchmarks in HPC or AI training, but in raw thread count and total throughput, Intel says it's well ahead. A two-socket Clearwater box can theoretically support over 1,000 vCPUs per rack, while Intel is claiming 3.5x better perf-per-watt versus its previous Xeons.

The bigger question is whether customers buy into Intel's efficiency-first bet. For decades, Xeon has been synonymous with P-cores, but Clearwater is different. It's a data center processor that doesn't care about prestige benchmarks, but rather how many workloads it can cram into a rack without blowing the power budget. If Intel's numbers hold, the firm expects Clearwater Forest to redefine what Xeon is supposed to be, rather than simply being a new iteration.

A convenient way to get extra screens for your favorite content

Don't have room for a multi-monitor setup, or need extra screens when travelling? How about wearing the extra screens on your face? That's one of the use case examples for Xreal's AR (Augmented Reality) glasses, which include gaming and movie watching as ways to experience your favorite content in an AR setup.

On Amazon, Xreal is bundling together its Pro One AR glasses along with the Beam Pro for the princely sum of $798.00. Currently, the Xreal One Pro is selling for $769.00, and the Xreal Beam Pro is on sale for $199.00. This means that the bundled deal saves you $170 compared to buying the two items separately.

The Xreal AR glasses boast impressive specs for such a compact device. Sony's 0.55-inch Micro-OLED display technology gives the Pro One's flat-prism lenses a Full-HD experience with up to a 120 Hz refresh rate, powered by Xreals X1 spatial processor.

You can view AR screens with a viewable 171-inch area, and scalable screens up to 191 inches max. Experience an improved 57-degree FoV (Field of View), an increase over the 50-degree FoV of the Xreal One AR glasses, with sound provided by Bose-tuned open-air speakers. Easily connect via USB-C to a multitude of devices with video output, such as your phone, laptop, or even a gaming handheld like the Steam Deck or Switch, for a novel viewing experience.

Save a whopping $170 when you pick up the Xreal bundle deal on the Xreal One Pro AR glasses and Xreal Beam Pro. View content in AR with 120Hz Full-HD when you connect the One Pro glasses to devices such as an iPhone, laptop, or Steam Deck.

Xreal's Beam Pro is the companion device for Xreal AR glasses. Download apps and connect to the glasses for movies, TV, or gaming content. 

We've had the chance to review the Xreal One Pro AR glasses and found them to be some of the best examples of AR glasses on the market. The glasses are lightweight and of high-quality construction, using thinner, flat-prism lenses that allow for a larger field of view than the non-Pro Xreal One glasses.

Electrochromic dimming helps the screen images to stand out against the background for a less busy experience, but as a con, the image quality from the Xreal Eye accessory for these AR glasses is pretty poor. The other major negative is the price. The Xreal One Pro has crept up in price to $769, thanks to influences such as tariffs and more, and this makes jumping on the AR bandwagon a costly experience.

Yes, ChatGPT can draft a tricky email. But can a general-purpose AI assistant for the masses contribute to a big scientific breakthrough, without hallucinating or screwing up the research? The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) isn't holding its breath.

The Seattle-based institute's new project, dubbed Asta, lets research scientists create and deploy specialized AI agents, working autonomously to help them tackle and solve some of the world's toughest problems.

Ai2 bills Asta as a “bold initiative to accelerate science by building trustworthy and capable agentic assistants for researchers.” It's also an open-source project, following the nonprofit institute's ethos of making the digital plumbing of its projects available for others to analyze, adapt, and build upon.

There are three major components to Asta:

With entry-level jobs in some industries already under pressure, Ai2 is careful to call Asta a collaborator for scientists, not a replacement. But most grad students would envy the kind of praise the institute is heaping on the project.

Ai2's chief scientist, Dan Weld, said the inspiration came from the institute's own need for AI tools that can execute complex plans, explaining how they came up with their ideas, and stay grounded in scientific evidence.

“That's what Asta delivers,” Weld said in the announcement. “It's not just another assistant but a collaborator designed to think like a scientist.”

The institute sees this open approach — where developers use Asta's resources to build agents and Asta's benchmark to test them — as a way to create “a flywheel of scientific improvement” for the broader community.

The news caps what will no doubt go down as one of the busiest months in Ai2 history, including the announcement of a new AI robotics initiative and a $152 million grant from Nvidia and the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of the future AI backbone for U.S. scientific research.

In their spare time, the team has also been settling into new offices in a mass-timber building on the north end of Seattle's Lake Union. 

Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, and funded largely by the late Microsoft co-founder's estate, Ai2 is a non-profit research institute that builds open-source AI systems for the good of science and humanity. 

Ai2's team of 225 people includes some of the top AI researchers in the world, many of them also affiliated with the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Ai2 is known for OLMo (open language models), Molmo (multimodal models), Tülu (instruction-tuned language models), and other open-source AI systems.

OpenAi, Anthropic, and other Silicon Valley startups have grabbed headlines for turning their proprietary AI models into widely used consumer and commercial products, while Ai2 has worked more quietly behind-the-scenes on foundational research and fully open-source tools for scientists and developers.

Asta is an outgrowth of Semantic Scholar, Ai2's long-running project to create a massive research database that indexes more than 200 million scientific papers. Asta's agents use this database through a dedicated “Scientific Corpus Tool,” an extension of the Semantic Scholar API.

Ai2 has been burnishing its open-source credentials under CEO Ali Farhadi, an entrepreneur and University of Washington professor who returned to Ai2 in 2023 after leading machine learning at Apple — which acquired his Ai2 spinout Xnor.ai for an estimated $200 million in 2020.

Yes, ChatGPT can draft a tricky email. But can a general-purpose AI assistant for the masses contribute to a big scientific breakthrough, without hallucinating or screwing up the research? The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) isn't holding its breath.

The Seattle-based institute's new project, dubbed Asta, lets research scientists create and deploy specialized AI agents, working autonomously to help them tackle and solve some of the world's toughest problems.

Ai2 bills Asta as a “bold initiative to accelerate science by building trustworthy and capable agentic assistants for researchers.” It's also an open-source project, following the nonprofit institute's ethos of making the digital plumbing of its projects available for others to analyze, adapt, and build upon.

There are three major components to Asta:

With entry-level jobs in some industries already under pressure, Ai2 is careful to call Asta a collaborator for scientists, not a replacement. But most grad students would envy the kind of praise the institute is heaping on the project.

Ai2's chief scientist, Dan Weld, said the inspiration came from the institute's own need for AI tools that can execute complex plans, explaining how they came up with their ideas, and stay grounded in scientific evidence.

“That's what Asta delivers,” Weld said in the announcement. “It's not just another assistant but a collaborator designed to think like a scientist.”

The institute sees this open approach — where developers use Asta's resources to build agents and Asta's benchmark to test them — as a way to create “a flywheel of scientific improvement” for the broader community.

The news caps what will no doubt go down as one of the busiest months in Ai2 history, including the announcement of a new AI robotics initiative and a $152 million grant from Nvidia and the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of the future AI backbone for U.S. scientific research.

In their spare time, the team has also been settling into new offices in a mass-timber building on the north end of Seattle's Lake Union. 

Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, and funded largely by the late Microsoft co-founder's estate, Ai2 is a non-profit research institute that builds open-source AI systems for the good of science and humanity. 

Ai2's team of 225 people includes some of the top AI researchers in the world, many of them also affiliated with the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Ai2 is known for OLMo (open language models), Molmo (multimodal models), Tülu (instruction-tuned language models), and other open-source AI systems.

OpenAi, Anthropic, and other Silicon Valley startups have grabbed headlines for turning their proprietary AI models into widely used consumer and commercial products, while Ai2 has worked more quietly behind-the-scenes on foundational research and fully open-source tools for scientists and developers.

Asta is an outgrowth of Semantic Scholar, Ai2's long-running project to create a massive research database that indexes more than 200 million scientific papers. Asta's agents use this database through a dedicated “Scientific Corpus Tool,” an extension of the Semantic Scholar API.

Ai2 has been burnishing its open-source credentials under CEO Ali Farhadi, an entrepreneur and University of Washington professor who returned to Ai2 in 2023 after leading machine learning at Apple — which acquired his Ai2 spinout Xnor.ai for an estimated $200 million in 2020.

Farhadi says the goal is to hold AI to standards grounded in the scientific method: He said in a statement that Asta represents Ai2's “bet on a future where AI doesn't just keep up with science, it helps drive it forward.”

Much of the American public is dubious to neutral when it comes to artificial intelligence. A recent poll found that 71 percent of Americans were concerned about the technology “permanently” displacing human workers.

Since we ostensibly live in a democracy, you'd think that would be bad news for the AI industry; unfortunately, many of the folks who are central to our economy are all-in. What do you do when you can't win in the court of public opinion?

The next best thing is to work the refs, and that appears to be Silicon Valley's plan for ensuring the political viability of its golden calf.

Some of tech's biggest names are injecting $100 million into a newly announced network of political-action committees that will push for stripping AI regulation. Lead the Future, a PAC network that was announced in a press release on Monday, will seek to make America safe for AI. The press release states:

A coalition of leading AI companies and innovators today announced the launch of Leading the Future (LTF), a new national political operation committed to ensuring the United States leads the world in AI innovation, development, and governance. LTF's mission is to ensure the United States remains the global leader in AI by advancing a clear, high-level policy agenda at the federal and state levels and serving as the political and policy center of gravity for the AI industry.

LTF claims as its allies many tech luminaries, including “Andreessen Horowitz, Greg and Anna Brockman, Ron Conway (SV Angel), Joe Lonsdale (8VC), and Perplexity, with other prominent firms and individuals from across the tech and investment sectors expected to join in the coming weeks,” the press release states.

“There is a vast force out there that's looking to slow down AI deployment, prevent the American worker from benefiting from the U.S. leading in global innovation and job creation, and erect a patchwork of regulation,” Josh Vlasto and Zac Moffatt, the group's leaders, told the newspaper. “This is the ecosystem that is going to be the counterforce going into next year.”

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, Lead the Future referred us to the previously circulated press release.

Increasingly, Silicon Valley is one of the biggest political donors in the nation. The cryptocurrency industry poured money into the U.S. presidential election last fall and came out the other side with a POTUS intent on making America the “crypto capital of the world,” and a Congress that's eager to sign anything to make it happen.

Then there's Elon Musk, who spent nearly $300 million all by himself just to get Trump in the door. The business world clearly sees super-soaking lawmakers with bundles of cash as the winning formula, so why wouldn't the AI industry and its proponents jump on the bandwagon?

Budget laptops are finally improving. Extra RAM and more efficient processors are making cheap laptops significantly more pleasant to use and recommend.

However, the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 is somewhat of an old-school budget laptop. It uses a cheaper Intel chip, which compromises performance and battery life, and at first glance, it appears to be overpriced. While this machine doesn't move the needle for budget PCs, if you need a 16-inch laptop, there's just barely enough here to make it worth buying on discount. Just know exactly what you're getting into.

The Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 is a large, 16-inch laptop that is 0.72 inches thick and 4.41 pounds. It's a hefty laptop. To be fair, it's actually lighter than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. That's partially because the IdeaPad 5i is made out of plastic. Fortunately, it's still fairly well-built. The lid is sturdy and doesn't flex, and it's the only part made of aluminum. There's a bit of give in the keyboard if you push hard enough, but it's nothing too egregious.

It's not necessarily a bad-looking laptop. Just generic. There's a slightly more attractive Cosmic Blue color that might look nicer, but I haven't seen it in person. Unfortunately, you can't open it with one hand, even though it has a 360-degree hinge. That's what makes it a 2-in-1 laptop, allowing you to position it in tent mode or lay it flat. The heft of this thing pretty much guarantees that you won't be holding it as a tablet—that's for sure. I've never understood the appeal of 2-in-1 capabilities on a laptop this large, but the addition of a touchscreen is always a plus.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 has a decent port selection. On the left, you get two USB-C ports (one for charging), HDMI, and a headphone jack. The right side has two USB-A ports, a micro SD card slot, and the power button. Not having a USB-C port on the right side is annoying, as it means you can only charge from one side. It's a constant point of frustration on many laptops.

The keyboard and touchpad are often compromises made on budget laptops, and the same is true here. The keys feel like they take a lot of effort to push through, as if the actuation force is too high. It can feel a bit tiring to type, which led to a lot of ghost typing where I was missing letters. It does have a number pad, but I don't prefer them, as they force the touchpad to be off-center.

Speaking of the touchpad, this isn't the worst I've used. The click feels nice, as it's not overly loud or difficult to press—a common problem with cheap touchpads. The issue here, as per usual, is the tracking. It feels choppy to glide your finger across the surface, and precise actions like text selection feel clumsy. It's certainly not a unique problem to the IdeaPad 5i, but it's one of the things that makes cheap laptops feel low quality.

You buy a laptop of this size for its screen. But with the IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1, you're not getting a high-quality panel. It's a 1920 x 1200 resolution display with a 60-Hz refresh rate. That's not bad per se, but stretched out on a 16-inch laptop, you can definitely see the pixels. That's why I often recommend smaller laptops if you're on a tighter budget. Like many laptops at this price, the IdeaPad uses a crummy panel. It's IPS, but it has a strong green tint that makes colors look off. It's noticeable right away, and once I measured it with a colorimeter, it proved true, covering just 63 percent of the sRGB color space.

It is, however, glossy. That's the one positive trait about it, as many budget laptops use a matte display that makes the screen look even more washed out. It also means the display doesn't have those really ugly plastic bezels that come with matte displays. That goes a long way toward improving the look of the IdeaPad 5i. One of the reasons these cheap laptops opt for matte is because their displays aren't very bright. This one maxes out at 334 nits, and yes, that means you will be fighting glare and reflections if you are near light sources.

But let's be clear: No 16-inch laptop under $800 has a better display. There are smaller laptops like the M1 MacBook Air or the Dell 14 Plus that have far better screens, but nothing in this size range.

The webcam is a point of favor for the device. It's 1080p, and the quality is quite good. It doesn't overcorrect in low-light situations, a common problem with laptop webcams. Not surprisingly, the speakers are terrible. Get some computer speakers.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1's main problem is the chip inside. I've been a fan of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chip, which has found its way into some very affordable laptops, such as the Asus Vivobook 14. They're efficient chips, leading to decent performance and great battery life. The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 uses the Intel Core Ultra 7 255U, and doesn't enjoy those benefits. Battery life isn't terrible, thankfully, lasting around 15 hours in local video playback.

Performance shouldn't be too big a hindrance to your work, though, especially since you've got 16 GB onboard. The integrated GPU isn't good; in fact, it'll slow you down from doing anything graphics-related, such as gaming or 3D rendering. You really need something far more capable on that front if you need a media or content creation machine.

The configuration of the 16-inch IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 I tested costs $770. That's a solid deal, though I've already seen it dip to $650 on sale. The Dell 14 Plus presents a problem. It's a 14-inch laptop, but it's a superior product in almost every way imaginable and costs $750 right now. Not only does it have a much better screen, but it also gets great battery life. If we're going apples-to-apples, the Dell 16 Plus is far more expensive.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not easy to find another 16-inch laptop that's better—at least, not one that I've tested. The HP Omnibook 5 16 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon X and is $750. Similarly, the Asus Vivobook 16 costs $750 and uses that same chip. Those might provide better battery life, but I can't say for sure until I've gotten my hands on them for testing. For now, this IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 barely squeaks by as a solid option for budget laptops and college students—so long as you buy it when it's on discount. If it rises over $800, you should be able to find a better 16-inch laptop for less money.

Trump wants nations to stop taxing American big tech.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


President Donald Trump has once again raised the threat of putting further tariffs on semiconductors and technology. The U.S. president wants to apply these import taxes against countries that impose digital services taxes, especially those against American tech companies, as reported by Bloomberg.

“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology. They also outrageously, give a complete pass to China's largest Tech Companies. This must end, and end NOW!” Trump posted on his social media platform. “With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips.”

It's unclear what kind of taxes Trump is talking about here, as there are multiple types of taxes applied to digital services. These include consumption tax, which is based on the sales any entity, digital or otherwise, makes in a jurisdiction; digital services taxes (DST), based on a company's digital sales; digital withholding taxes, which are applied against the revenue made by digital firms in a particular area; among others.

Many nations, especially in Europe and East Asia, have put some kind of tax on digital services. The argument here is that governments want to level the playing field, as domestic firms, both physical and digital, are required to pay taxes on their sales. However, foreign companies that do not have a physical presence in a country and deliver goods and services online do not have to report their sales, thus they do not get taxed.

Most digital service providers are based in North America, particularly in the U.S., according to tax research firm Tax Foundation. This means that American firms are hit hardest by DSTs and other forms of taxes that governments apply. So, to combat these alleged ‘discriminatory' rules, Trump is threatening to place retaliatory import taxes and stop the flow of advanced chips to countries that do not lift them.

If the White House proceeds with this plan of action, many of the U.S.'s biggest allies will be hit hard. At least 18 countries around the globe apply DSTs on online sales, including France, the U.K., Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Hungary. On the other hand, the major chip-making nations in East Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, do not have DSTs, but still apply value-added taxes (similar to sales tax) on digital sales.

Even with Trump's threat of sanctions and tariffs, this will likely be an uphill battle for most nations. Tax laws usually go through Congress in most democratic nations, meaning it might take years, if not decades, for the law to change. Resistance is also likely, as the move could be viewed by governments as U.S. interference with their sovereignty. Nevertheless, these threats are often just used to force partners to the negotiating table and open the issue. But if the U.S. follows through with tariffs and sanctions, this could spiral out of control and lead to an expansion of the ongoing trade war.

The service, Mobility, was unable to accept requests for rides or changes to already-booked rides following a ransomware attack.

The Maryland Transit Administration says it is actively investigating a cybersecurity incident, namely a ransom attack, that has rendered it unable to accept new requests for rides for its Mobility paratransit service for the disabled.

MTA, which says on its website that it's responsible for "one of the largest multi-modal transit systems in the United States," said that it's "actively investigating a cybersecurity incident that involves unauthorized access to certain systems" with assistance from the Maryland Department of Information Technology.

The good news is that MTA said its "core services (Local Bus, Metro Subway, Light Rail), MARC, Mobility [sic], Call-A-Ride, and Commuter Bus are operating normally." It's also planning to continue to offer Mobility rides that were booked prior to the incident; it just doesn't have the requisite systems in place to handle requests for new rides.

"The agency is actively working to resolve this issue as quickly and securely as possible and will provide updates as they become available," MTA said. "In the meantime, eligible riders should consider using the Call-A-Ride program, which can be accessed at www.mtacallaride.org or (410) 664-2030." (Guidelines can be found here.)

This isn't a one-off incident. Ransomware gangs seem to be making a habit of targeting these services: The Record reported that "over the last two years, cities in Missouri, Virginia, and other states have had to provide alternatives to disabled residents after cyberattacks or ransomware incidents took critical systems offline."

"Our primary goal is to ensure the safety and security of our transit customers and employees," MTA said. "MDOT/MTA are working with our partners to support all communities impacted. We will work with our media partners to keep the public updated."

Despite allusions to nepotism and corruption, the Commerce Department hasn't made clear what it wants to do with the newly clawed-back funds.

The U.S. Commerce Department has seized control of a $7.4 billion semiconductor research fund from the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (NATCAST), a private non-profit set up during the Biden administration, as per Reuters. Describing it as a "slushfund," for ex-Biden admin officials, the Commerce Department promised greater oversight and accountability for where the funds are being spent, but didn't provide any further detail.

One of the defining investments of the Biden administration was the CHIPS Act, which authorized close to $300 billion in investments to encourage the design, development, and manufacturing of cutting-edge semiconductors in the United States. The creation of NATCAST was a part of that, with $11 billion allocated for it to establish a range of research centers around chip design.

The Trump administration's Commerce Department wants to bring this non-profit under its umbrella of control, though, and has announced it will be taking over a large portion of the organization's funds moving forward.

“From the very beginning NATCAST served as a semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the statement. He's recently heralded a serious change in the way the U.S. handles its technology investments and grants.

The Commerce Department statement also described NATCAST as an "effort to skirt clear legal restrictions prohibiting government agencies from establishing corporations," and that it was full of "former Biden officials," making some generalized allusions to nepotism and corruption.

NATCAST hasn't released a public statement about these cuts, but last week did highlight how it was aligned with the priorities of the White House and tried to make clear how important its role was in making the US competitive in the cutting-edge chip industry.

In July, NATCAST celebrated the creation of its new CHIPS for America Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Accelerator facility within the NY Creates Albany NanoTech Complex. Designed to accelerate the U.S.'s fabrication of the latest EUV semiconductors, it gives visitors full access to ASML's latest EUV chip design tools. It was also hoped to attract the top talent in semiconductor design and manufacturing, but now the future of the center and any other NATCAST efforts remains uncertain.

In January, NATCAST and the then-Biden administration announced plans to build a further research and development facility in Tempe, Arizona. It was set to open sometime in 2028, but that seems increasingly unlikely to come to pass without appropriate funding.

The Commerce Department hasn't said what it plans to use the billions in funding it now has control over.

If you're within a certain age range, you may have spent weekend afternoons in your youth playing Mario Kart, the seminal Nintendo game. You may even remember passing the sticks around between friends and competing in the game's individual time trials, one driver at a time.

Among that game mode's defining features: A translucent “ghost car” that represented the current leader in a given trial, allowing other drivers to chase after it or, ideally, pass it on the way to a faster time. Similar features have dotted various other racing video games through the years, from the Gran Turismo series to Forza and F-Zero.

And now, we've begun to see this Mario Kart feature show up on television broadcasts for real auto races. In the same way it added intrigue to the video game, it brings real excitement to the process of watching a single car drive around a track solo. But it's not just for fans; this technology is even making an impact on the inner workings of the sport of auto racing itself.

The ghost car seen from the cockpit camera's view on an IndyCar broadcast. The translucent car is superimposed on the video image during televised broadcasts.

Auto racing broadcasters have long struggled to make qualifying trials entertaining. Qualifying involves just a single car on the track at one time, racing against the clock for the best times to determine their starting order in the event's actual race.

“Qualifying, candidly, is boring,” says Gerard J. Hall, founder and CEO of SportsMedia Technology, known in the industry as SMT. “From a TV standpoint, you've got a camera taking a picture of this car, it's in the center of the frame, and you've got one announcer saying to the other announcer, ‘Sure looks like he's going fast, doesn't it?'

“There's not really much to compare it to … Until you get something relative to that car to let you know, is it winning? Losing? Is it gaining for the qualifying lap?”

Hall and his team have solved this problem; auto racing viewers can now see a visual indicator of the leading qualifying car's positioning during its qualifying lap, helping them instantly discern whether the current driver is improving on or falling behind the leader's time. But the ghost car has traveled a long road to find its way onto these broadcasts.

The ghost car in a wide shot.

Hall and SMT have been involved in auto racing broadcasts and displays for three decades. While working with ESPN Motorsports in the mid-1990s, the company helped pioneer a small five-car leaderboard in the upper left of the screen for full-field race broadcasts. Initially, it was powered by a spotter sitting in the press box with binoculars and furiously typing updates into a laptop.

The team's methods have become more streamlined and high-tech since. Simple picture overlay tools allowed for varying leaderboards on racing broadcasts through the 2000s. These quickly became as synonymous with car racing as score bugs for baseball or football, growing more advanced with time.

By the mid-2010s, satellite-based GPS had become advanced enough to consider its use for tracking high-speed race cars with solid accuracy. Hall and SMT began to look at ways to spice up Nascar's broadcasts of its qualifying runs, which were still relatively bland outside minor additional features like car speed or time split graphics.

Nascar offered a few helpful advantages in these early efforts. For one, all its tracks are dimensionally similar or identical: Sloped ovals without any sharp turns. There aren't many tall buildings or structures near the track that might interfere with GPS signals. And because Nascar vehicles are fairly heavy, adding GPS sensors didn't cause any balance or speed issues. Even within that context, though, tracking objects moving so quickly is no small feat.

SMT developed a proprietary tracking device it calls a “vector” (or “vector box”) to sit on each car. Today's vector boxes, which have been upgraded multiple times since the original version, combine three tracking formats.

The first is GPS, but this is not the same GPS your Google Maps app is using. Vector boxes receive signals not just from the American Global Positioning System but also from Russia's GLONASS, Europe's Galileo, and China's BeiDuo satellites. Hall says the combination allows vector boxes to be connected to anywhere from two to three times as many satellites at one time as standard GPS setups.

Inertial measurement unit (IMU) tracking is also used to gauge precise speed and related movement data. Combined with the bulked-up GPS setup, Hall says, SMT can access real-time kinetic metrics and achieve centimeter-level accuracy for both positioning (horizontal and vertical) and car velocity to gauge precisely where the vehicle is on the track at any time.

Real-time drive data from the car's engine control unit for things like throttle, braking, steering, and gear info are also fed into the vector box. The vector can even be battery powered so that it draws no energy from the car itself.

Using all of this detail from the vector box, SMT created what Hall believes is the first iteration of the live “digital twin” concept in any sport: An entire 3D re-creation of the cars and track.

“Here's a sporting event I can look at with cameras, and here's the digital twin that I've created this 3D model with a computer, where everything is moving around based on the live data coming off the objects in the real world,” Hall says. “It gives me the ability to do what we call temporal shifting, and that's really what the ghost car is.”

The first Nascar broadcast featuring these tools, which SMT collectively terms its Broadcast Analytics suite, ran on NBC in 2018. The same suite has been used by Fox in each season since. The ghost car has featured prominently as a live companion to qualifying, allowing broadcasters to swap into a live 3D world and show accurate digital renderings of both the active car and the ghost car it's competing against.

Formula 1's broadcast team has also been playing around with various ways of creating a qualifying ghost car for over a decade. Its first attempts involved retrofitting the tools used to analyze golf swings. But as the F1 organization also moved to GPS-based methods, logistical challenges arose. Unlike Nascar's clean oval of a racetrack, F1 tracks in different locations differ wildly from one another. Plus they are often built within cities, so each course is dotted with tall buildings and crowded with wireless communications that can interfere with GPS signals.

The IndyCar broadcast control room.

“GPS is good in places, but we go to places like Monaco, Baku, Singapore, where all that infrastructure and buildings really make GPS drift,” says Dean Locke, director of broadcast media and digital for Formula 1.

F1 cars are also much lighter than their Nascar counterparts, necessitating lower-weight sensors. Its broadcast teams struggled to put together full laps of ghost car or related overlay features as a result.

To get around these limitations, F1 built several internal prediction models based on past seasons' GPS data and lidar scans of each track. It then integrated those models into an in-house application that overlayed a synchronized video feed of those same past qualifying trials, then compared the two data inputs side by side. By first manually identifying discrepancies where GPS data from qualifying clearly was out of whack based on video footage, the team was able to train its models to spot anomalies and correct them.

F1's own ghost car feature launched across its broadcasters for the 2025 season. It features both an in-car driver view and a “helicopter” view above the car—especially helpful for qualifying laps where the current driver is ahead of the ghost car, since the ghost car would be invisible during in-car views in these situations.

A drawback, though: F1 can't yet show its ghost car on live broadcasts. Because the team's process still requires that final bit of manual fine-tuning to ensure the translucent ghost car is positioned accurately, Locke says it takes around 90 minutes to pass the ghost car overlay to broadcast partners after each qualifying run. The team's goal is a 30-minute turnaround to facilitate quicker post-qualifying analysis. Still, Locke says, ghost car broadcasts have been immensely popular on F1's social channels.

F1's single-car competitors at IndyCar, meanwhile, have pushed the envelope further this season as Fox, the home of Nascar, has taken over from NBC as the IndyCar series' broadcaster, bringing SMT's vector box technology with it. Starting with Indy 500 qualifying earlier in May, a fully live ghost car animation has been used as a superimposed overlay for Fox's in-car driver camera. This isn't a 3D rendering, like SMT's prior Nascar ghost cars, which swap into a separate digital view (either the full screen or smaller box format); it's the actual, real-life driver camera from the broadcast with a centimeter-accurate ghost car overlayed onto the screen.

Ghost cars are still in their relative infancy, especially for truly live broadcasts. Hall sees the uses of this underlying technology quickly expanding as broadcasters become more familiar with them—including for full-field races in addition to qualifiers.

“Maybe you want to compare tire wear,” Hall posits. “Let me show you this car now running live, and let me show you this car five laps ago where it was running on different tires.”

Hall also suggests the idea of multiple ghost cars for qualifying; one for the pole sitter, but perhaps others for bubble positions or other relevant spots.

It's easy to see how the ghost cars zipping around on your TV could just be the beginning of the way this ultra-specific car data will be used. Just look at Nascar; SMT received interest from multiple teams within less than a year of pioneering its vector box. The teams wanted to use data from the box for tactical purposes like postrace analysis or comparisons to competitors, and SMT developed a Team Analytics application.

Demand was so high that in 2018, Nascar opened this data up to allow all teams full access. They can view everything from car positioning to gear and throttle data, not just for their own drivers but for the whole field. Team Analytics has a feature that allows multiple ghost car overlays of prior races, allowing crews to compare driving lines or turn speeds.

“Now at every pit stall, it is the center application,” Hall says. “Because the teams, the crew chiefs, they want to know: How is my car doing relative to other cars? And because it's not just positioning on the track, it's also gears, throttle, et cetera, different drivers can compare their performance against” each other.

It's likely only a matter of time before these features trickle into IndyCar and F1 teams.

Locke says those teams “will use absolutely anything they can to get an improvement over another team,” though he notes that F1 teams already collect a wealth of internal data on their vehicles.

Who'd have thought a funky Mario Kart feature used for bragging rights among friends could have such an influence in the world's highest-stakes car races?

Two Long Island UFO hunters have been called upon by some domestic law enforcement to investigate unexplained phenomena.

On a Friday evening last December, every tier of US law enforcement—federal, state, and local—was dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a military research installation outside Boston. A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base's restricted airspace. The culprits could not be found.

One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he's ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick's municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well.

The event, which barely made local news, was only the latest in a series of purported drone sightings along the US East Coast that November and December. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump's golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. But official answers were less forthcoming.

The Tedescos' roving aerial surveillance unit, which they've dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.

“It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who're telling me that there's this ship in the ocean that's launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. He recalls attending one presentation by an FBI expert in uncrewed aircraft systems who showed police unhelpful scare videos of improvised drone strikes in Ukraine, in which tiny aircraft rained grenades down on bloodied soldiers.  

The telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made.

By late January, the incoming Trump administration would assert that the entirety of the New Jersey drone wave had been benign, with each and every UAS “authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.” Their surety, however, stood in stark contrast to the warnings from top military brass, including the Air Force general at the head of NORAD, Gregory Guillot. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.” 

Lacking better coordination, or much clarity from the White House, the Pentagon, or the US intelligence community, some in domestic law enforcement—including members of the FBI's counterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions—have turned to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York, John and Gerald Tedesco. 

The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard's alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Since then, aviation safety advocates, astronomers, physicists and other researchers, and at least one journalist (I, myself) have made the trek out to Long Island's South Shore to kick the tires on the roving aerial surveillance unit they've dubbed “the Nightcrawler.”  

Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don't know how much you've talked to those guys. They're freaking awesome.” 

Grooms joined the Tedescos last January, when the brothers publicly shared some of their findings from training the Nightcrawler's sensors on a few of these unidentified drones. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.”

As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren't so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights.

“It wasn't actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. “It was actually changing its spectral signature—it was drifting into an infrared range.”

John likened it to “signature management,” a military term for the ability to tailor anything from radio emissions to light sources so that they remain detectable to one's allies but undetectable to one's foes. The clue, which likely would have been lost to police without the Tedescos' broad range of infrared sensors, was not unlike the kind of citizen-science fieldwork that had gotten them on the radar of academia's UFO hunters in the first place. 

Why all this attention? As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies. 

What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a fully maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world. 

For domestic law enforcement and the general public, two communities lacking the requisite national security clearances, the Tedescos' work promises a transparent, open-source solution to the past several years' worth of bizarre and troubling drone incursions into US airspace. For academics hunting for UFOs and other aerial anomalies, the Tedescos have become informal collaborators and a font of new ideas for novel data collection equipment. But for better or worse, some of the secrets they might be revealing may be the government's own.

The term “UFO” has officially gone out of fashion. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It's an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today's more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint.

Ryan Graves, a former US Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F fighter pilot who testified before Congress on the safety and security risks that UAPs posed to his own squadron, now heads a committee on the issue for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation's premier society for aerospace engineers. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024.

John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love.

“It's incredible what they've been able to put together,” Graves says, praising the Tedescos' ability to collect “very actionable data.” 

Gerry once held a security clearance to develop reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition sensors for a Pentagon contractor. John has helped conceive and construct analytical test hardware for Underwriters Laboratories, a federally approved safety, testing, and certification firm, and served for a time as the product safety chair for the Long Island branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like Star Trek, Chiller Theatre, and Lost in Space.

I got my first tour of their rig during an overnight expedition just off the beach at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York, the weekend before the AIAA's trip last fall. A klatch of camping chairs and cameras on tripods flanked one side of the Nightcrawler like a tailgate party. Inside, the lived-in kitchenette, the wood paneling, and the hum of over half a dozen monitors—including radar, night-vision, and radio-frequency (RF) scanners—made it feel like the cabin of a cramped marine research vessel.

The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler's roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”) 

With tests of humanoid bots and new developments in military applications, the year ahead will intrigue even the skeptics.

Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses.

One prototype I saw, a multispectral camera mounted on a sturdy yellow DeWalt surveyor's tripod, looked like a Gatling gun of multiple cameras and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) sensors. This jerry-rigged device spans the entire visible spectrum and beyond, from deep invisible ultraviolet all the way up to long-wave infrared. They've used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. “We've done this as far as a half a mile, but if you had a campfire, they could detect campfires from 28,000 feet,” John told me over the noise coming from the Nightcrawler's gas-powered electric generator. They've also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can't explain.

“We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.) 

The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. But the implication that the Nightcrawler has caught “gravitational lensing” off some warp-drive craft has rankled a few Galileo Project collaborators. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. Although Galileo scientists have visited and conferred with the Tedescos on UAP-hunting instruments, the brothers' more rough-and-courtroom-ready “forensic science” approach has caused turbulence in the relationship. 

In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos' “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.” 

But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said.

Ultimately, the Tedescos didn't have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach's Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025. 

“We are talking about over the airport, over taxiways, over runways,” Suffolk County's chief deputy sheriff, Chris Brockmeyer, told local news. “That's a serious safety concern. It's impacted air operations, and we're not going to stand for it.” On Christmas Day alone, the airport was besieged by 17 drone incidents, according to the Suffolk County sheriff, who has staff that collaborate informally with the Tedescos. Some of these drones, Suffolk County executive Ed Romaine asserted at a press conference, were “as large as a car.” 

The Tedescos couldn't use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. Through the cloud cover and the snowfall, the Tedescos said, they were able to track about two or three objects with this device.

But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they've picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters.

I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It's used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC.

Granted, many portions of this band are devoted to less cloak-and-dagger agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Valley Authority. But the signals suggested that whatever the Tedescos were tracking above Gabreski Airport, they were likely not from hobbyists. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast.

“For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment.

Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. “We're working closely with the FBI,” John says. Gerry adds, “We gauge it by their interest level in what we're doing.” 

“When they get more enthusiastic,” he continues, before John finishes his thought: “… we know we're closer and closer to something.”

It's hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute's b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law. 

Nevertheless, one senior-level law enforcement official, who has worked with the FBI on counterterrorism cases, did tell me that “the FBI is genuinely interested in the Tedescos' work.” The official, whose current police role bars them from speaking publicly without prior approval, recalls speaking to an FBI agent who “alluded to the help that the Tedescos have been.” But the problem, the official continued, is that “for the relationship to work, it has to be very low-key.” 

When I did briefly manage to get one of the Tedescos' FBI collaborators on the phone, the agent seemed to confirm their shared efforts, at least tacitly, but asked not to be identified. “As much as I'd like to, we're kept to pretty strict guidelines,” they said, before alluding to the new Trump administration's pervasive personnel cuts. “We're not allowed to talk to media—and with how things are right now, I'm not going to take any risks.” 

Featuring the world's largest digital camera, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will capture these mysterious phenomena in more exquisite detail than ever before. 

At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers' Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I've seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I'd say some are certainly ours.” 

As to the mystery of why the FBI would even want investigative assistance from two civilians in an RV over partners within the executive branch, it comes down to conflicting priorities—as well as over a dozen or so laws that restrict domestic intelligence collection on drones by either the Pentagon or the US intelligence community. “It's one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn't go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation.  

The desire of the NSA or some other agency to spy on foreign powers, Manget says, might override the desire to share pertinent information with police—information that could lead to jail time for the drones' operators. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they're being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There's things they can do that will end NSA's ability to collect.” 

On my short call with my FBI source, I did my best to explain this working hypothesis about the Bureau's collaboration with the Tedescos. “I wouldn't say that's wrong,” the source replied. “That's about as far as I could go.” By this past June, however, even the recent head of the Pentagon's dedicated UAP-hunting group, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was admitting publicly that the Defense Department itself has cribbed notes from the Tedescos.

“We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO's former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. “We thought it was a great plan. We actually looked at the sensors in that book.” 

On another podcast, Phillips said AARO's own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. “We thought that was brilliant.”

Earlier this year, partially in a concession to the economic toll their side project has taken, the Tedescos started offering versions of some of their devices for sale on the Nightcrawler's charmingly GeoCities-esque home page. One of them, a handheld multispectral detector, is effectively the consumer model of that EMF Gatling gun they showed me.

Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town's fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful.

When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos' equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team's consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Absolutely not. Just like they have to be trained with a radar gun, they'd have to be trained with these other tools.” 

Lauzon, Natick's deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos' “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don't have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA. 

But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all.

“We're seeing anomalies in our airspace and we're just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me. “Eventually, something is going to come home to roost—and then we're going to regret the fact that we didn't look deeper and try to understand what was going on.”

Could humanoid robots get a lot more human? Nvidia may have made that possibility a bit realer today with a smarter robot brain that has less energy demands. 

The tech giant's latest robotics offering is Jetson Thor, a super computer built for real-time AI computation on humanoid robots and smart machines alike, Nvidia announced in a press release on Monday.

The new module is built to handle larger amounts of information at less energy than previous model Jetson Orin. Powered by the latest Blackwell GPUs, Jetson Thor has more than seven times the AI compute power and twice the memory at more than three times speed and efficiency than its predecessor, Nvidia claims.

All this new power is supposed to unlock higher speed sensor data and visual reasoning that can help humanoid robots get better at autonomously seeing, moving, and making decisions.

“Jetson Thor solves one of the most significant challenges in robotics: enabling robots to have real-time, intelligent interactions with people and the physical world,” the company wrote.

It's a considerable performance leap that Nvidia hopes will appeal to engineers. The company says early adopters include Amazon, Meta, Caterpillar, and Agility Robotics, a startup that makes commercially available humanoid robots for warehouses and other manufacturing facilities. The model is being considered for adoption by John Deere and OpenAI.

It's also being adopted by research labs at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Zurich, to power autonomous robots in medical research settings and more, Nvidia said in a blog post on Monday.

The developer kit Jetson AGX Thor, which includes the Jetson T5000 module plus a reference carrier board, power supply, and an active heatsink with a fan, is now on sale on the company's website starting at $3,499.

Coming soon—and available now on pre-order—is Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, a developer kit using the same technology but for autonomous vehicles instead. Deliveries for that are slated to start in September, the company said.

Although AI chips are Nvidia's bread and butter, the tech giant is betting big on robotics and autonomous vehicles.

“This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview in June.

Huang elaborated on his trust in just how much the robotics industry can scale at the company's annual shareholders meeting later that month.

Along with AI, Nvidia expects robotics to provide the largest growth for the company, and combined, the two represent “a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang told investors.

Earlier this year, the company also released a family of AI models that can be used to train humanoid robots, called Cosmos.

Huang's bet isn't an empty one. Humanoid robots are advancing.

Just last week, China, one of the key players in the global robotics race, hosted its first-ever robot Olympics, World Humanoid Robot Games. At the three-day spectacle, companies showcased robots that can complete a 1,500-meter race in just a little over six seconds and achieve practical job skills like sorting medicine or taking food orders.

But still, the technology is hugely limited and far from widespread adoption. Even at the great robotics showcase in China, many of the robots suffered technical difficulties. One robot in the track and field race even ran straight into and knocked over a bystander walking off-course. 

Nvidia made the announcement at a rather convenient time for the company. The tech giant is reporting fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and the market is buzzing already.

Nvidia dominates the AI market, so the company's earnings always draw huge speculation, but the importance this week is boosted by volatile policy changes and questions around the economic value of wide-scale AI adoption.

The company has been on a policy rollercoaster ride in its efforts to sell AI chips in China amidst the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington. China is a major market for Nvidia, and the uncertainty is keeping company investors at the edge of their seats.

Also keeping investors occupied is a concerning new AI report from MIT researchers. The report found that despite the bold bets on AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in 10 AI pilot programs have translated to real revenue gains.

Nvidia just hit $4 trillion market value last month, becoming the first public company to achieve the feat. Now, the stakes are high, as it's up to the tech giant to prove that it's valuation is not just built on AI hype.

People with lower interleukin-6 activity have a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, a new LMU study reveals.

Lowering the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) - a key immune signal regulating inflammatory responses in the body - could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease without making people more vulnerable to infections, according to new research from LMU's Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research and international collaborators.

The team led by Dr. Marios Georgakis, Junior Group Leader at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD) and member of the SyNergy cluster of excellence, used large-scale human genetic analyses to mimic the effects of drugs that block IL-6. Previous genetic studies had focused on variants in the IL6R gene, which encodes not IL-6 itself but the corresponding receptor. "These studies suggested that suppressing the IL-6 receptor could be associated with cardiovascular benefits, but raised concerns about increased infection risk," explains Georgakis. Whether these findings would translate to under-development drugs that directly inhibit IL-6 remained unclear. And so the LMU researchers turned their attention to genes that encode IL-6.

In the new study, published in Nature Cardiovascular Research, they analyzed genetic data from over half a million people of European and East Asian ancestry. They found that individuals carrying variants in the IL6 gene linked to lower IL-6 signaling had a reduced lifetime risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Strikingly, these variants were also associated with a lower risk of pneumonia and sepsis - countering fears that blocking IL-6 might impair the body's ability to fight infections.

Our study shows that genetic variants mimicking IL-6 inhibition are associated with lower cardiovascular risk and, potentially, even a lower risk of specific infections."

Lanyue Zhang, first author of the paper

"Our findings highlight how human genetics can be used to anticipate the benefits and risks of new therapies. The results support both the efficacy and safety potential of under-development IL-6 inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease," says Georgakis. The genetic evidence also pointed to potential improvements in type 2 diabetes risk and lipid profiles, hinting at broader metabolic benefits.

A new HIV antiretroviral shows promise as a long-acting, oral prophylactic agent, according to a new study by Izzat Raheem, Tracy Diamond and colleagues from Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, published August 26th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key part of reducing the number of new HIV infections. The most common oral PrEP therapies, consisting of once-daily pills, are highly effective at protecting people from acquiring HIV, but they only work if taken properly. Currently, the only long-acting PrEP therapies require injection by a healthcare provider, which isn't always feasible for people. Long-acting, oral PrEP therapies could facilitate adherence, provide greater privacy and discretion, reduce concerns about stigma, and improve accessibility for more people to initiate and continue on PrEP, ultimately helping to stem the tide of the nearly 1.3 million new HIV infections globally per year.

Researchers from Merck engaged in a lead optimization campaign to develop a novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI). NRTTIs are a new class of anti-HIV drugs that have shown potential for long-acting prophylaxis. They inhibit viral replication by more than one mechanism, including blocking translocation of reverse transcriptase on the growing viral DNA chain.

Using a known NRTTI, islatravir, as a starting point, researchers used several medicinal chemistry strategies to modify the structure and optimize it using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The lead compound, dubbed MK-8527, showed robust antiviral activity in vitro, and pharmacokinetics in animal studies demonstrated that it may be suitable as a long-acting oral therapy. Studies in humans are underway to assess the safety and tolerability of MK-8527 as a once-monthly oral pill in volunteers at low likelihood of HIV exposure, and at least one completed clinical study shows promising results.

With chronic disease rates rising across the U.S., healthcare systems face ongoing challenges in reducing hospital stays and readmissions. Nearly 1 in 4 heart failure patients is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, and fewer than 20% receive all four guideline-directed medical therapy pillars post-discharge, despite strong evidence showing these therapies improve patient outcomes.

At the same time, the number of people living with chronic illness is expected to double from 2020 to 2050. Remote patient care fills a critical gap, offering a scalable way to support the most vulnerable patients, improving adherence to evidence-based care and reducing avoidable hospitalizations, no matter the geographical location.

To help close critical gaps in heart failure care, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, has developed American Heart Association Connected Care™, Powered by Cadence, a virtual care program that delivers ongoing heart and cardiometabolic care to patients at home after their hospital stay.

Hospitals can refer eligible patients to the Connected Care program prior to discharge. The Association is working with participating hospitals to integrate the program into discharge workflows. Cadence enrolls patients in the program, teaching them how to use their devices, monitoring vital sign readings and providing ongoing clinical support.

Our legacy is built on bringing science to life and meeting people where they are to reimagine how healthcare is delivered. By combining advanced remote patient monitoring technology with our expertise in guideline-directed care and chronic condition management, we can help extend the high-quality care hospitals provide, ensuring people with heart failure receive proactive, timely support at home when they need it most."

John Meiners, chief of mission-aligned businesses at the American Heart Association

The Association spearheaded this collaboration with Cadence to extend the reach of its trusted science into homes and communities, utilizing Cadence's remote platform and 24/7 virtual provider group.

"Hospitals struggle to extend consistent, evidence-based care once patients leave their doors," said Chris Altchek, chief executive officer and founder of Cadence. "By pairing the American Heart Association's gold-standard scientific guidelines with Cadence's AI-driven remote monitoring and always-on care team, American Heart Association Connected Care, Powered by Cadence, makes proactive, personalized heart-failure support available anytime, anywhere."

American Heart Association Connected Care aims to:

"Too often, people with heart failure get discharged from the hospital only to find themselves back within a month," said Marat Fudim, M.D., MHS, associate professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and heart failure cardiologist at the Duke University Medical Center. "With timely interventions and evidence-based support, remote patient monitoring allows us to bridge that gap by keeping a close eye on patients' health while they're at home, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and achieving better long-term outcomes."

Rooted in a century of innovative scientific breakthroughs, trusted clinical guidelines and science-backed educational content, Connected Care offers patients timely, remote care and support to help them adhere to treatment plans, adopt heart-healthy habits and avoid preventable readmissions.

The Connected Care pilot program is currently underway at four hospitals:

These antibodies, which target the viral protein A35, blocked viral spread in laboratory in vitro tests and, most importantly, protected rodents from severe disease and fully prevented death. The findings, published August 22 in Cell, also reveal that humans previously infected with mpox carry high levels of these protective antibodies in their blood, and that their presence is associated with milder symptoms and the absence of hospitalization.

Mpox is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus (the family of viruses that causes smallpox, which killed more than 300 million people in the 20th century alone). This virus spreads mainly through close contact with an infected individual. The virus causes a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scars.

A global outbreak of mpox began in 2022 and continues to this day. In the last three years, the World Health Organization twice declared the disease a public health emergency of international concern, yet effective treatment for this virus family is lacking. Recent human clinical trials for the leading candidate therapy did not show it to have efficacy. Thus, there is currently no approved drug to treat mpox. This study from Mount Sinai might change that.

A previous study published in 2023 by our team showed that human antibodies targeting the viral protein A35 were unusually increased in sera in response to mpox infection compared with vaccination for smallpox or antibodies against other viral proteins. Based on this earlier finding, we hypothesized that antibodies targeting A35 from mpox-infected individuals would be highly protective against orthopoxviruses, since the viruses in this family share high genetic similarity. We aimed to address the urgent unmet need for effective treatments for orthopoxviruses, and with the help of our outstanding collaborators, I am very proud to say that we are close to achieving that goal."

Camila Coelho, PhD, MBA, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine and senior author of the paper

The newly discovered antibodies bind to a region that is highly conserved across not only the orthopoxvirus genus, to which MPXV belongs to, but also the entire poxvirus family, which means the region is conserved among different viruses and is not prone to mutations or antibody escape. The ability of these antibodies to block viral spread, protect from severe disease, and fully prevent death suggests that they are promising drug candidates that could be tested in humans for the prevention or treatment of mpox. The antibodies have been patented by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

"Ours is the first report of the crystal structure of a human antibody bound to an mpox virus protein, providing a detailed map of a vulnerability in the virus," said Raianna Fantin, PhD, the postdoctoral researcher who is the first author of the study. "It is also the first time that monoclonal antibodies against orthopoxviruses were quantified in human sera. We were surprised by how consistently people recovering from mpox infection produced antibodies targeting the same A35 epitope of the virus as the antibodies we discovered."

While the researchers see this as a promising next-generation therapy against mpox in humans, it is important to note that this is still in the research stage. Future testing in human clinical trials is needed to evaluate how the antibodies behave in the body, how long they last, where they go after being administered to the human body, and how well they prevent orthopoxvirus infection.

The research team plans to move the newly discovered antibodies into advanced preclinical safety and efficacy testing. Simultaneously, they are using the structural and immunological insights from the study to guide future work on understanding and enhancing the human immune response to mpox.

The study was conducted by the following laboratories from Mount Sinai's Department of Microbiology: Coelho, Schotsaert, Simon, Bajic, and Krammer.

A natural compound could help fight aggressive leukemia and amplify the effect of chemotherapy drugs.

Forskolin, a natural compound derived from a plant, could significantly improve treatment outcomes for an aggressive form of leukemia, known as KMT2A-rearranged Acute Myeloid leukemia (KMT2A-r AML), according to a new study from the University of Surrey.

The study, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, shows that not only does forskolin directly stop the growth of leukemia cells, but it also enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs. Researchers from Surrey found that forskolin activates Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and stops the expression of several cancer-promoting genes (MYC, HOXA9 and HOXA10).

The research also shows a significant and unexpected finding, as forskolin was found to substantially increase the sensitivity of KMT2A-r AML cells to daunorubicin, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug. This effect, however, was not dependent on PP2A activation: forskolin appeared to block P-glycoprotein 1, which allows cancer cells to pump chemotherapy drugs out, leading to drug resistance. By blocking P-glycoprotein 1, forskolin allowed for more daunorubicin to go inside the leukemia cells, making the chemotherapy much more potent.

Our findings have highlighted an exciting dual mechanism of action for forskolin. Not only does it have direct anti-leukaemic effects, but it also acts as a powerful enhancer to conventional chemotherapy. Combining forskolin with daunorubicin could lead to a more effective treatment strategy, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing the severe side effects often associated with AML treatments."

Dr. Maria Teresa Esposito, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry, University of Surrey

Dr. Simon Ridley, Director of Research and Advocacy at leukemia UK, says:

"We are committed to funding innovative research and are proud to have supported Dr Esposito's work. AML is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancer types, and this study not only deepens our understanding of KMT2A-rearranged AML but also opens the door to kinder, more effective treatments. Work like this is essential if we are to achieve our goal of doubling the five-year survival rate for AML within the next decade."

The study, funded by leukemia UK, was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Surrey, University of Roehampton, Barts Cancer Institute-Queen Mary University of London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London- UCL and the Genomic Regulation, CRG Barcelona (Spain).

Conference MDAngle offers personal perspectives from conference attendees, showcasing their anticipation, quick takeaways, and insights into how the presented research will affect their patients.

The 2025 Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) Annual Meeting will be held in Houston, Texas, on September 3-6. This year's program will spotlight the latest breakthroughs in blood‐cancer care, from next-generation immunotherapies to precision-medicine strategies, and will feature dedicated sessions on myelofibrosis, including strategies for disease management, risk assessment, and solutions for managing patients with anemia. Attendees can also look forward to data on novel JAK inhibitors, emerging antifibrotic agents, and combination regimens — including those for JAK inhibitor-naive patients — designed to improve quality of life and alter disease trajectory.

John Mascarenhas, MDProfessor of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute; Director, Center of Excellence in Blood Cancers and Myeloid Disorders, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York“A lot of clinical trial data, both in the form of trials in progress, as well as updated data and baseline data, will be presented at SOHO and subsequent meetings. And this gives an opportunity for practitioners in the community to get a glimpse of where the field is going.”

SOHO 2025: Previewing Advances in Myelofibrosis Dr Mascarenhas highlights numerous ongoing and upcoming clinical trials in myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, including innovative combination therapies and non-JAK inhibitor options. Studies such as SENTRY-2, POIESIS, MANIFEST-2, IMproveMF, VERIFY, and SURPASS-ET are exploring ways to achieve deeper, more durable responses and potentially expand approved treatments. These trial updates and baseline results signify substantial progress and new directions for patient care.

Coming soon: Dr Mascarenhas highlights new data and progress regarding myelofibrosis and related syndromes immediately following SOHO.

Coming soon: Reflections from Dr Mascarenhas on how new data from SOHO will affect his patients.

People with type 2 obesity-driven diabetes tend to have more aggressive breast cancers, but no one knows exactly why. A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and published in Springer Nature found that tiny particles in the blood, known as exosomes, which are altered by diabetes, can reprogram immune cells inside tumors making them weaker and allowing the cancer to grow and spread more easily.

This is the first study to directly link exosomes from people with type 2 diabetes to suppressed immune activity inside human breast tumors."

Gerald Denis, PhD, corresponding author, the Shipley Prostate Cancer Research Professor at BU

In the study, researchers used tumor samples from breast cancer patients to grow 3D tumor models in the lab. Known as patient-derived organoids, these models contain the immune cells originally found in the tumor. These mini tumors were treated with blood exosomes from people with and without diabetes but also without any cancer. Then researchers analyzed the organoids using single-cell RNA sequencing to see how the exosomes affected the immune cells and the tumor itself.

The patient-derived organoid system developed by Denis and first author Christina Ennis, PhD, is the first to preserve original immune cells from human tumors, letting scientists study tumor-immune interactions in a lab setting that closely mimics real life. In addition to breast cancer, this study also may be relevant to other cancers affected by immune suppression and metabolic disease.

"Breast cancer is already challenging to treat, and people with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes, but clinicians don't fully understand why," said Denis. "Our study reveals one possible reason: diabetes changes the way the immune system works inside tumors. This could help explain why current treatments, like immunotherapy, don't work as well in patients with diabetes. Knowing this opens the door to better, more personalized treatments for millions of people." Over 120 million Americans are diabetic or prediabetic, yet if they develop cancer, they are not treated differently in any significant way by the standards of treatment in oncology. Thus, this work addresses a serious public health challenge.

Chemicals used to replace bisphenol A (BPA) in food packaging can trigger potentially harmful effects in human ovarian cells, according to McGill University researchers.

A new study examined several chemicals commonly used in price stickers on packaged meat, fish, cheese and produce found early signs of potential toxicity.

The findings, published in the journal Toxicological Sciences, raise concerns about the safety of BPA-free packaging and whether current regulations go far enough to protect consumers.

The research began with the 2023 discovery by Stéphane Bayen, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry, that label-printing chemicals like bisphenol S (BPS), a BPA replacement, were leaching through plastic wrap into the food. He teamed up with colleagues in reproductive toxicology to investigate what these substances could be doing inside the body.

Lab-grown human ovarian cells were exposed to four commonly used BPA substitutes: TGSA, D-8, PF-201 and BPS. Several of the chemicals, particularly TGSA and D-8, caused a buildup of fat droplets in the cells and changed the activity of genes that help cells grow and repair their DNA.

These are major cellular functions. Disrupting them doesn't prove harm in humans, but it gives us a strong signal that these chemicals should be further investigated."

Bernard Robaire, co-senior author of the study and James McGill Professor in McGill's Departments of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Obstetrics & Gynecology

BPA is a chemical that can interfere with the body's hormones, and has been linked to problems with fertility, early development and metabolism. Because of these risks, it has been banned in baby bottles and restricted in some products in Canada.

Many of the chemicals used to replace BPA are not regulated or routinely tested, the researchers explained.

"'BPA-free' is an incredibly misleading label," said Robaire. "It usually means one bisphenol has been swapped for another, and there are more than 200 of them. Some may be just as harmful, or even worse. We need to test these compounds before they're widely adopted, not after."

Health Canada has now added all four substances to a list of chemicals requiring further investigation.

For consumers looking to err on the side of caution, Robaire suggests removing labels and plastic wrap from fresh foods before storing. He also recommends choosing items from the top of store display piles rather than the bottom, where pressure from stacking may push chemicals more deeply into the packaging and food.

"High-content imaging and transcriptomic analyses of the effects of bisphenol S and alternative color developers on KGN granulosa cells" by Lama Iskandarani, Stéphane Bayen, Barbara Hales and Bernard Robaire was published in Toxicological Sciences.

The study was supported by the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative.

For the most part, Keyanna Jones and her husband thought they knew what to expect when their daughter Chloë had eye surgery last fall.

Even Chloë, who was in kindergarten, had a good understanding of how things would go that day. Before the procedure, a hospital worker gave her a coloring book that explained the steps of the surgery — a procedure to correct a condition that could have eventually interfered with her vision.

"Chloë is very smart," Jones said. "She reads at almost a third-grade level now, and she's only 6."

Jones did her homework, too. With no pediatric ophthalmologists near their home in Wentzville, Missouri, who would take their insurance, she asked the insurer to cover Chloë's out-of-network care as if it were in-network. The insurer agreed to let her see an out-of-network specialist.

Chloë made it through surgery without a hitch. Jones said her daughter enjoyed a few popsicles at the hospital before going home.

" I slept with her every night because she was so worried she would wake up and not be able to see," she said. "But it healed beautifully, and she was absolutely ready to go back to school."

Then the bill came. 

Chloë was born with a droopy left eyelid, a condition known as ptosis. To correct the problem, an ophthalmologist surgically lifts the eyelid, preventing it from disrupting the patient's line of sight.

Ophthalmologists, unlike optometrists and opticians, hold medical degrees and can provide advanced eye care, including surgery.

$15,188, including $10,382 for the procedure and $2,730 for anesthesia. Initially, insurance paid just $1,775.79, leaving the Jones family owing $13,412.21 — until Chloë's uncle, who had recently finished his term as a state senator, asked a colleague to look into it.

Months before Chloë inhaled bubblegum-scented anesthetic at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Jones discovered that it can be hard to find a pediatric ophthalmologist. The doctor recommended by Chloë's pediatrician wasn't contracted with their insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and the closest in-network specialist was in Wisconsin, hundreds of miles away.

So Jones requested what's called a network gap exception, under which the insurer would cover the recommended doctor's services as in-network.

Before the surgery was scheduled, she received a letter saying UnitedHealthcare had approved her request "because currently there isn't a doctor, health care professional, or facility in your area to provide these services." The letter listed several medical billing codes for eye services and said they would be covered "at the network level."

About a week later, the insurer sent a prior authorization letter approving Chloë's surgery.

But UnitedHealthcare declined to pay most of the surgery bill, covering it as out-of-network. With approval letters in hand, Jones said, she did not understand why the insurer apparently was not honoring its agreement to cover her daughter's treatment.

In fact, the similar-looking letters granted different kinds of approval.

UnitedHealthcare's gap exception approved Chloë's exams before the surgery as in-network. But in its prior authorization letter for her surgery with the same doctor, the insurer said only that it would cover it — without offering network discounts.

After receiving the bill, Jones contacted the insurer online, but she said a representative told her there was no record of its approval to cover the surgery as in-network.

"At that point, I didn't even know what to do," she said. "I'm like, 'This is crazy.'"

She said she sent over a copy of one of the approval letters, which was on the company's letterhead, but a representative told her the letter hadn't come from UnitedHealthcare.

"They said, 'You saw this surgeon, they're not covered and you didn't have permission, so, no, we're not going to pay,'" Jones said, recounting the phone call.

An insurance representative told Jones she owed more than $13,000 because of "a balance billing issue." That meant the Jones family would have to pay the $13,000-plus balance.

Spokespeople for UnitedHealthcare confirmed the company provided a gap exception and prior authorization for Chloë's care. Eric Hausman, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group, said in a statement to KFF Health News that "we empathize with anyone who finds themselves in the unfortunate situation of being balance billed by an out-of-network provider for an amount significantly above market rates, and without any advance knowledge."

Maryanne Wallace, a spokesperson for SSM Health, the health system that includes Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, provided a statement that said SSM followed "standard patient billing procedures."

"Occasionally, an insurance company may process a claim as an out-of-network service, which can result in a balance being billed to the patient," the statement said.

Jones said she was blindsided by the big bill. She tried to fix the problem on her own, she said, keeping track of every interaction with the insurer and the hospital. She filed appeals with UnitedHealthcare.

Nothing helped — until she reached out to her brother Caleb Rowden, who had been a Missouri state senator for eight years after serving four years in the state House.

" I've never used my brother's political clout for anything," she said. "I actually hate politics."

Rowden told KFF Health News that he reached out to Travis Fitzwater, the state senator representing his niece's district. Jones contacted Fitzwater's office, too, and sent a complaint to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.

Fitzwater said his office did no more for Chloë than it would for any constituent.

"We're not going to take a lot of credit for the result of it, because we didn't ask for anything other than a resolution, so that everybody can be at peace and move on with their lives," he said in an interview. "We just did what we do every day."

After Fitzwater's staff contacted the hospital and the insurer, representatives from both separately called Jones and notified her that UnitedHealthcare had paid the bill in full.

In the end, Chloë's family paid nothing for her procedure — not even a copay.

When it comes to insurance approvals, read the fine print carefully; "covered" does not mean an insurer will pay, let alone at in-network rates.

Rowden and Fitzwater said reaching out to your elected representative's office can help. Advocating for constituents is part of their job.

"They usually have an open line of communication with these insurance companies and hospitals," Rowden wrote in an email. "They may not always be able to get to a positive outcome since every situation is a little different, but they can usually get you to a next step."

Jones is grateful that her brother was able to help, though she acknowledged that she probably would not have called him without a nudge from their mother. "I think I would still be fighting," she said.

A recent PNAS study adopted a long-term perspective. It demonstrated that internal climate variability (ICV) is a significant source of uncertainty about the climate's suitability for vector-borne diseases (VBD) transmission.

Climate change is altering the dynamics of VBDs. For example, the population of Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit dengue, is increasing in Europe and North America. In 2023, local dengue transmission was reported for the first time near both Los Angeles and Paris, and even in the United Kingdom, the Aedes albopictus has been detected. Scientists combine climate projections with vector and pathogen dynamics to quantify the risks of future outbreaks.

Three primary sources of uncertainty affect climate projections produced by general circulation models (GCMs). The first stems from model uncertainty driven by differences in the formulation of GCMs. It is often quantified using multimodel ensembles. The second source of uncertainty concerns scenarios, e.g., future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathways. It is analyzed by running GCMs under different scenarios. Finally, ICV could cause aleatory uncertainty due to the climate's unpredictable nature. ICV concerns the natural fluctuations that occur regardless of external factors, such as GHG emissions.

In existing research, ICV is often neglected while considering model and scenario uncertainty in climate-VBD studies. The current study, in the context of future VBD risks, partitioned climate uncertainty and exhibited the potential role of ICV in producing suitable climate conditions for future outbreaks. These outbreaks could occur sooner than expected under climate change alone.

Daily temperature projections for London between 2030 and 2080 were obtained, and recorded weather station temperature data for 2020 were gathered. Next, existing temperature-suitability models for dengue transmission caused by Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti were combined with temperature data to project the annual number of days suitable for transmission.

Uncertainty in projections was divided into contributions from ICV, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Cubic polynomials were fitted to estimate the extent of ICV and single-model and scenario ensemble means. The focus was on average uncertainty due to ICV over different models and scenarios.

ICV was noted to drive a significant part of the uncertainty in the number of suitable days. This was notably true even decades into the future. For example, in 2080, 38% of the annual mean temperature's prediction interval (PI) could be attributed to ICV. ICV accounted for 48% of the PI for the days suitable for transmission. These effects were consistent with other studies that assessed uncertainty in nonlinear, climate-dependent effects.

Five other cities were selected for equivalent analyses to ensure the robustness of the findings. These cities are not currently deemed to be at high risk of dengue transmission but may be at risk in the future. The suitability of transmission using recorded 2020 weather data was also evaluated.

The exact uncertainty contributions between cities showed heterogeneity, which was expected given heterogeneity in climate conditions. However, the common theme was the substantial contribution of ICV in driving the proportion of uncertainty in transmission-suitability projections. ICV-associated year-to-year temperature fluctuations led to the acceleration of heightened suitability. For example, on considering model and scenario uncertainty alone in a model of dengue transmission by Ae. albopictus in London, the annual risk of greater than or equal to 120 days of suitability first exceeds 5% in 2047, relative to 2038 when ICV is also factored in.

The current study demonstrated that ICV may lead to suitable climate conditions for VBD transmission and recommended its inclusion alongside model and scenario uncertainty when generating climate-sensitive VBD projections.

The authors emphasized that this has direct public health implications: proactive preparedness is needed, including vector surveillance at points of entry, breeding site control, clinical testing capacity, public information campaigns, and outbreak response planning.

A few assumptions were made here, which could be relaxed in future studies. More complex methods could be employed to relax assumptions regarding the fitting of cubic polynomials to estimate ensemble mean values, uniformly weighting the climate scenario-model pairs when partitioning uncertainty, and assuming that the extent of ICV is time-invariant.

The study also noted that additional climate factors (e.g., precipitation and humidity) and non-climate-related factors (e.g., human population density and intervention strategies) should be incorporated in future models to give more policy-relevant projections.

A new study led by researchers at National Jewish Health has found that recent infection with the common cold - often caused by rhinoviruses - may offer temporary protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The research provides fresh insight into why children are less likely than adults to develop symptoms and could point toward new ways to reduce the severity of respiratory illnesses.

Published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases earlier this month, the study analyzed data from the nationwide Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS) study, which tracked more than 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021.

Researchers found that people, particularly children who had a recent rhinovirus infection, were significantly less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the following weeks. This effect is thought to be linked to the body's antiviral defenses. Rhinoviruses trigger a strong interferon response in the airways, which can temporarily prime the immune system to fight off other viruses.

Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold. This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases."

Max Seibold, PhD, senior author of the study, researcher and Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health

Using thousands of self-collected nasal swabs, the team tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, in participants of all ages. They also analyzed airway gene expression to see how recent viral infections influenced the body's antiviral defenses. Children were found to have higher baseline expression of interferon-related genes - proteins that act as the immune system's first line of defense against viruses - compared to adults.

While this phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, has been observed with other respiratory viruses, this is the first prospective study to show it may also occur with SARS-CoV-2.

"This doesn't mean people should intentionally try to catch a cold," said Camille Moore, PhD and lead author of the study at National Jewish Health. "But understanding how one virus can affect the body's response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations."

The research builds on earlier findings from the HEROS study showing that children are six times less likely than adults to develop symptomatic COVID. The new data highlights the role that both age-related immune differences and recent viral exposures may play in that protection.

National Jewish Health researchers conducted the study in collaboration with partners from 12 cities across the United States.

Over seven million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the heartbreaking day-to-day battle with the effects of cognitive decline. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the brain changes that cause the disease actually begin 20 years or more before symptoms start, highlighting the critical need for early and accurate diagnosis. However, current diagnostic tools involve painful spinal taps, expensive scans and cognitive tests that can be limited in their accuracy.

New research led by biomedical engineers at USC Viterbi School of Engineering has uncovered the key role the brain's blood flow dynamics play in AD, offering a simpler, non-invasive diagnostic tool that could reshape decades of conventional thinking about how this debilitating disease is understood and treated. Led by Vasilis Marmarelis, Dean's Professor in the Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering, the work was published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring.

For years, the prevailing consensus in Alzheimer's research and clinical care has been the "amyloid cascade hypothesis." This theory suggests that a protein fragment called amyloid beta is the main culprit in Alzheimer's. When too much amyloid beta builds up in the brain, it triggers the accumulation of another protein, Tau, that forms twisted clumps known as "tau tangles" within brain cells. These tangles are then thought to cause brain cells to malfunction and eventually die, leading to the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's.

Current diagnostic methods largely revolve around detecting these amyloid and tau pathologies. This often requires uncomfortable and risky spinal taps to draw cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. More recently, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, or "amyloid or tau PET," emerged, where a radioactive tracer is injected to visualize amyloid plaques or tau tangles in the brain, a test that is so costly it is usually confined to academic research settings. Most recently, blood biomarkers that serve the same purpose show promise for the future.

Physicians take the emissions from that PET radioactive tracer as an approximate measure of how much amyloid or tau the person has in their brain. Speaking from experience, after having seen data in my own study, I tell you that it's very inadequate. But it's the gold standard, although most physicians don't do it because it's very expensive."

Vasilis Marmarelis, Biomedical Enginering Department, University of Southern California

Without these costly and invasive biological tests, many neurologists turn to cognitive assessment tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), behavioral interview-based questionnaires aimed at testing cognitive function.

"The MoCA does give you an idea about the cognitive abilities of a person," Marmarelis said. "But these are not biological or physiological tests. These are just behavioral tests that are subject to all kinds of biases, imperfections and errors."

Instead of looking at the brain's amyloid plaques, Marmarelis and his collaborators focused on the way blood flow through the brain is autoregulated in order to oxygenate the brain tissue, and whether possible dysregulation may cause cognitive impairment. Think of it like a meticulous inspection of how your home's plumbing system is functioning rather than just looking at the rust on the pipes.

The research team's National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded study harnessed data from 200 participants over five years, investigating the intricate dynamic relationship between natural changes in arterial blood pressure, carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in the blood, and the resulting fluctuations of cerebral blood flow and cortical tissue oxygenation.

"When we exert cognitive effort, we generate CO₂ from the metabolism in our cerebral cells, which obviously has to be taken away by our blood to avoid acidosis," Marmarelis said. "Our body is endowed with this regulatory mechanism called vasomotor reactivity, which dilates (widens) our cerebral vessels when CO₂ goes up in the blood, so that more blood can go through and the excess CO₂ be washed out."

Fifteen years ago, Marmarelis made a serendipitous observation: Alzheimer's patients show impaired vasomotor reactivity. "They cannot dilate the cerebral vessels to bring more blood in and provide adequate blood perfusion to the brain. This means they don't get the oxygen, nutrients and glucose that we need for cognition in a timely manner," he said.

In their new study, Marmarelis' team tested this observation, developing a novel "physio-marker" called the Cerebrovascular Dynamics Index (CDI). This non-invasive test uses non-invasive Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow velocity in some main arteries of the brain, and near-infrared spectroscopy to measure oxygenation in the front part of the brain's cortex. This "input-output type of conceptualization" uses sophisticated "dynamic modeling" methods developed in our lab to quantify how quickly and effectively the brain's blood supply responds to subtle changes in pressure and CO₂.

The research team obtained some encouraging results - The CDI showed excellent diagnostic performance, differentiating individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's from cognitively normal control subjects with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96.

AUC is a common statistical measure of diagnostic performance; a value of 1.0 is perfect, and 0.5 is random chance. For context, the amyloid PET test achieved an AUC of only 0.78, while the MoCA and MMSE cognitive tests were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively.

Marmarelis stressed that the difference between 0.78 and 0.96 translated to a "very substantial improvement" in the test's ability to correctly identify those with and without the condition.

"What we have that others didn't have before is a methodology to quantify these dynamic relations that's extremely robust and accurate," Marmarelis said. "We can now differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's from cognitively normal controls far better than the PET measurement and even better than the MoCA neurocognitive test. This indicates that the particular aspect of dysregulation of cerebral perfusion regulation may be the critical aspect in the pathogenesis of this disease, probably in conjunction with other factors, including amyloid accumulation."

This profound shift in the understanding of Alzheimer's could pave the way for new treatment and prevention strategies focused on improving the regulation of brain blood flow and oxygenation. Marmarelis said this could involve several promising avenues that are still being evaluated for their potential efficacy:

Other beneficial interventions can be developed and tested in the future. Marmarelis said that in addition to Alzheimer's, these results hold broader implications for the treatment and diagnosis of other dementias.

The research was supported by NIH grants. Other co-authors on the paper included Helena C. Chui, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and Sandy Billinger, professor of neurology at Kansas University Medical Center, as well as collaborators from the Department of Neurology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Inflammatory bowel disease, in which the immune system attacks the gut, is a painful chronic condition that affects three million Americans. Rates of IBD are rising, and there's currently no cure. IBD can also be deadly: up to 8% of people with the disease develop blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.

New research has uncovered why blood clotting malfunctions in IBD-and identified drugs that normalize blood clotting in human cells and animal models of IBD.

We think we can leverage these findings to reduce inflammation and the risk of blood clots. This could be lifesaving."

Aaron Petrey, PhD, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at University of Utah Health, associate director of the U's Molecular Medicine Program, and senior author on the paper

The results are published in Blood.

Most research into IBD has focused on immune cells. But blood cells called platelets are another key contributor to IBD symptoms. In healthy people, platelets clump together into clots in response to injuries to stop bleeding, and don't form clots otherwise. But in patients with IBD, platelets are on a hair trigger, ready to form clots at the slightest provocation.

Surprisingly, platelets from IBD patients weren't clotting via the normal pathways that trigger clotting, says Rebecca Mellema, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in pathology and the first author on the paper. "It's completely independent of what we would expect."

"There's an innate mechanism by blood vessels to tell platelets to stay quiet and not form a clot yet," Petrey explains. "Once there's injury or inflammation, that signal can switch over and tell them to form a clot. That's the process that's broken in IBD patients."

IBD platelets appear to clot more often because they don't have enough of a key protein called layilin, the researchers found. In healthy people, layilin acts as a molecular brake for clotting: it senses the difference between healthy and injured blood vessels and prevents platelets from clotting as long as blood vessels are intact.

But when the researchers deleted the layilin gene in mice, the brakes came off. Without layilin, platelets were extra sticky, forming clots when they shouldn't.

The researchers also found that platelets from IBD patients only had about 60% of the layilin protein that they should, leaving them constantly on the verge of clotting.

Layilin prevents unwanted clotting by tamping down the activity of a clot-triggering molecule called Rac1. In mice without the layilin gene-and in people with IBD-Rac1 is always a little bit too active, which means platelets are too prone to forming clots.

But there's good news. Drugs that prevent Rac1 activity are already in clinical trials for other conditions, and the researchers' results suggest that these Rac1 inhibitors could be powerful therapeutics for IBD.

One Rac1 inhibitor reduced excessive clotting in human platelets in a dish. The inhibitor also decreased the level of tissue damage in the gut in a mouse model of IBD.

Promisingly, the drug decreased clotting in platelets from IBD patients even more strongly than it affected healthy cells. "We have shown a hyperactivation pathway in resting IBD patient platelets, but they're also incredibly sensitive to treatment, moreso than those from a healthy person," Mellema says.

Normalizing Rac1 activity might not only reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke-it could also help alleviate day-to-day IBD symptoms, the researchers say. Excessive clotting can block blood flow in the gut and make inflammation worse, which means that preventing clotting could reduce inflammation.

Unlike established anti-clotting drugs, the researchers say, Rac1 inhibitors shouldn't lead to an increased risk of dangerous bleeding, which is a serious concern for IBD patients with chronic inflammation. Blocking Rac1 won't interfere with other, independent pathways that can trigger platelet clotting, so the cells should still be able to form needed clots in response to injury.

"We're targeting a pathway that is not pre-activated in healthy people," Petrey says. "So we can address that step of the pathway, and if there's a significant injury, the platelets can overcome that inhibition."

Other groups had been looking into the potential of Rac1 inhibitors to reduce inflammation in IBD. The new work emphasizes the potential of these drugs to address multiple symptoms. "Paying more attention to what we can do to address these blood clotting risks could significantly improve patient lives," Petrey says.

The results are published in Blood as "Layilin inhibits integrin activation, and its loss results in platelet hyperactivation via Rac1 in inflammatory bowel disease."

Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine developed a new and highly effective application of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to quickly scan notes in electronic medical records and identify high-risk patients who may have been infected with H5N1 avian influenza or "bird flu", according to new findings published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Using a generative AI large language model (LLM), the research team analyzed 13,494 visits across University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) hospital emergency departments from adult patients in urban, suburban, and rural areas in 2024. These patients all had acute respiratory illness (such as, cough, fever, congestion) or conjunctivitis-symptoms consistent with early H5N1 infections. The goal was to assess how well generative AI could find high-risk patients who may have been overlooked at the time of initial treatment.

Scanning all of the emergency department notes, the model flagged 76 because they mentioned a high-risk exposure for bird flu, such as working as a butcher or at a farm with livestock, like chickens or cows. Usually, these exposures were mentioned incidentally-for example, documenting a patient's occupation as a butcher or farmworker-and not because of clinical suspicion for bird flu.

After a brief review by research staff, 14 patients were confirmed to have had recent, relevant exposure to animals known to carry H5N1, including poultry, wild birds, and livestock. These patients were not tested specifically for H5N1, so their potential bird-flu infections were not confirmed, but the model worked to find those "needle in a haystack" cases among thousands of patients treated for seasonal flu and other routine respiratory illnesses.

"This study shows how generative AI can fill a critical gap in our public health infrastructure by detecting high-risk patients that would otherwise go unnoticed," said study corresponding author Katherine E. Goodman, PhD, JD, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM and a faculty member of the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC). "With H5N1 continuing to circulate in U.S. animals, our biggest danger nationwide is that we don't know what we don't know. Because we are not tracking how many symptomatic patients have potential bird flu exposures, and how many of those patients are being tested, infections could be going undetected. It's vital for healthcare systems to monitor for potential human exposure and to act quickly on that information."

Since early 2024, H5N1 has infected more than 1,075 dairy herds across 17 states, and over 175 million poultry and wild birds have tested positive during this outbreak period. Identified human cases remain rare, with 70 confirmed infections and just one fatality in the U.S. by mid-2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are, however, likely many more infections that have gone undetected due to a lack of widespread testing. In addition, new strains could arise enabling human-to-human airborne spread, which would lead to an uptick in cases and a potential epidemic.

The AI review required only 26 minutes of human time and cost just 3 cents per patient note, demonstrating high scalability and efficiency. This method has the potential to create a national network of clinical sentinel sites for emerging infectious disease surveillance to help us better monitor newly emerging epidemics."

Anthony Harris, MD, MPH, study co-author, Professor and Acting Chair of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM

The LLM (GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrated strong performance in identifying mentions of animal exposure, with a 90% positive predictive value and a 98% negative predictive value when it was evaluated on a sample of 10,000 historical emergency department visits from 2022-2023, before bird flu was circulating in U.S. livestock. However, the model was conservative when identifying exposures specifically relevant to avian influenza-sometimes flagging patients with low-risk animal contact, such as exposure to dogs-underscoring the need for human review of any flagged cases.

As the risk of infections transmitted by animals grows, researchers suggest that large language models could also be used prospectively to alert healthcare providers in real time. This could prompt them to be more vigilant about asking about potential exposure to infected animals, targeted testing, and controlling infections by isolating patients. The CDC currently relies on mandated lab reporting to track avian influenza but lacks systems to assess whether clinicians are asking about or documenting relevant exposures in symptomatic patients.

The researchers hope to next test the large language model for prospective surveillance and deployment within the electronic health record, for faster real-time identification of high-risk patients. As respiratory virus season resumes in the fall, having a fast and accurate way to identify those patients needing special testing for bird flu, or precautionary isolation while receiving treatment, will be especially critical.

"We are at the forefront of a disruptive but incredibly promising revolution around big data and artificial intelligence," said UMSOM Dean Mark T. Gladwin, MD, who is also the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor. "The engineer and physician researchers working at the Institute for Health Computing have secure access to medical records from the two million patients that we serve throughout Maryland, and as this study demonstrates, can use AI and big data to identify early signals of emerging infectious diseases like bird flu to enable us to take action sooner to test for these diseases and keep them from spreading."

Other UMSOM faculty co-authors on the paper include Laurence S. Magder, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM, Jonathan D. Baghdadi, PhD, MD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM who is also on faculty at the UM-IHC, and Daniel J. Morgan, MD, MS, Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM.

The study would not have been possible without the contributions of the UM Institute of Health Computing, which was established two years ago in North Bethesda, Maryland as a collaboration between the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the University of Maryland Medical System. The Institute merges the computational expertise, clinical expertise, biomedical innovation, health data and academic resources of the three institutions.

"As an academic health system, we have the responsibility to prepare for the cures of tomorrow while delivering the care of today, and have long been a national leader in data driving medical research and patient care," said Mohan Suntha, MD, MBA, University of Maryland Medical System President and CEO. "We also recognize that the value of the data across our System is representative of the diversity of the communities that we are privileged to serve."

Funding for the research was provided by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Computing and data storage costs for LLM analyses were supported by the UM Institute for Health Computing.

The UT Health San Antonio School of Nursing has earned the prestigious Center of Excellence in Nursing Education designation from the National League of Nursing, for promoting the pedagogical or teaching expertise of its faculty.

The school will be one of only 21 nursing education programs around the country that will awarded at the Honors Convocation during the 2025 NLN Education Summit in Orlando, Florida, on Sept. 19. It becomes the only school in San Antonio with the designation of NLN Center of Excellence.

"The School of Nursing is proud to be named among the 2025 Centers of Excellence in Nursing Education," said Sonya R. Hardin, PhD, RN, the school's dean. "This designation elevates the value of our education and underscores our commitment to graduating highly skilled nursing professionals."

The awards represent the spectrum of higher education in nursing, from certificate-granting programs through advanced-degree academic institutions.

I am so appreciative of the magnitude of the effort it requires of everyone involved in educating an outstanding nursing workforce to earn this national recognition. Congratulations to all the wonderfully deserving 2025 NLN Centers of Excellence designees."

Patricia Sharpnack, DNP, RN,  NLN chair, dean and professor at the Breen School of Nursing and Health Professions at Ursuline College, Ohio

"We have all heard, 'It takes a village,' " said NLN president and CEO Beverly Malone, PhD, RN. "Nowhere is that truer than in the shared vision and values, mutual support, respect and inclusivity among faculty, leadership and students that must come together for an extraordinary nursing program to be nationally recognized for their innovation and commitment in becoming an NLN Center of Excellence."

Ibuprofen and paracetamol are common over-the-counter medications that many of us reach for when we're sick. But new research from the University of South Australia shows that these trusted staples are quietly fuelling one of the world's biggest health threats: antibiotic resistance.

In the first study of its kind, researchers found that ibuprofen and paracetamol are not only driving antibiotic resistance when used individually but amplifying it when used together.

Assessing the interaction of non-antibiotic medications, the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) – a common bacteria that causes gut and urinary tract infections ­­– researchers found that ibuprofen and paracetamol significantly increased bacterial mutations, making E. coli highly resistant to the antibiotic.

It's an important finding that has serious health implications, particularly for people in aged care homes, where multiple medications are regularly administered.

The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.

Lead researcher UniSA's Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.

"Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria," Assoc Prof Venter says.

"This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications – not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure – making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.

"In this study we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut or urinary tract infections.

"When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.

"We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective."

The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery) , temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).

Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.

Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore.

This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications – particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.

This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics – and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations."

Rietie Venter, UniSA's Associate Professor 

The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.

A Mediterranean-style diet, in combination with reduced caloric intake, moderate physical activity, and professional support for weight loss, may cut the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 31%, according to a new study co-authored by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study will be published August 25, 2025, in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

We're facing a global epidemic of diabetes. With the highest-level evidence, our study shows that modest, sustained changes in diet and lifestyle could prevent millions of cases of this disease worldwide."

Frank Hu, co-author, Fredrick J. Stare Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology and chair of the Department of Nutrition

Prior research has linked the Mediterranean diet-which emphasizes high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, moderate intake of dairy and lean proteins, and little to no intake of red meat-to better health outcomes, including lowered risk of T2D through improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation. 

A team of collaborators from the PREDIMED-Plus clinical trial, the largest nutrition and lifestyle randomized trial in Europe, sought to understand how the diet's benefits may be enhanced with additional healthy lifestyle changes.

The researchers, from 23 universities in Spain and Harvard Chan School, split 4,746 PREDIMED-Plus participants into an intervention group and a control group and followed their health outcomes for six years. The intervention group adhered to a Mediterranean diet; reduced their caloric intake by about 600 calories per day; engaged in moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking and strength and balance exercises; and received professional support for weight loss control. The control group adhered to a Mediterranean diet without calorie restriction, exercise guidance, or professional support. Participants ranged from age 55 to 75, were overweight or obese, and had metabolic syndrome, but were free of T2D at baseline.

The study found that those in the intervention group had a 31% lower risk of developing T2D compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the intervention group lost an average of 3.3 kilograms and reduced their waist circumference by 3.6 centimeters, compared to 0.6 kilograms and 0.3 centimeters in the control group.

"In practical terms, adding calorie control and physical activity to the Mediterranean diet prevented around three out of every 100 people from developing diabetes-a clear, measurable benefit for public health," said co-author Miguel Martínez-González, professor at the University of Navarra and adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School.

The study was funded by the European Research Council, the Spanish National Institute of Health, the Biomedical Research Networking Centre (CIBER), and the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (1R01DK127601).

While healthy diets show links to better brain aging, researchers caution against overhyping “brain foods” and argue for combined approaches that target multiple lifestyle factors.



Review: Dietary Patterns and Brain Aging: Enthusiasm Before Evidence? Image Credit: Elena Eryomenko  / Shutterstock

Measuring brain aging is surprisingly tricky: Research faces challenges like inconsistent cognitive tests across studies, unknown reliability of these tests for detecting meaningful change, and relying on dietary intake measured only once, often late in life.

In a recent study published in the Annual Review of Nutrition, researchers examined the role of dietary patterns in brain aging and questioned whether current enthusiasm is supported by strong evidence.

The global population is aging at an unprecedented rate. As the population ages, chronic disease prevalence has increased, which mounts a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines healthy aging as the process of developing and maintaining functional ability that allows well-being in older age. Functional ability includes physical and mental capacities, highlighting the importance of healthy brain aging.

Non-pathological or healthy brain aging leads to non-disabling declines in function, which is distinct from neurodegenerative disorders that occur due to pathological brain aging. Diet quality is one of the determinants of healthy aging, with the public already believing that dietary strategies will delay the onset and decrease the risk of dementia and brain aging.

Consumer surveys in the US suggest that more than half of adults view diet as key to maintaining brain health, although scientific evidence remains mixed. As such, the present study analyzed available evidence on the role of dietary patterns in brain aging, while cautioning that enthusiasm often outpaces the strength of evidence.

Early-life education builds cognitive foundations: The level of education achieved during brain development strongly influences synaptic pruning, shaping the baseline cognitive function from which age-related changes are measured.

Diet quality is deemed a crucial modifiable risk factor for the risk of chronic diseases and promotion of healthy aging. An overall healthy diet is critical in brain development and aging.

Various studies in worms, rodents, and yeasts indicate a role of calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting in health and lifespan. Studies in rodents report that long-term CR could affect the trajectory of brain aging.

While unhealthy dietary patterns can lead to gut dysbiosis, CR and fasting are believed to create favorable effects on the gut microbiota composition. The resultant favorable effects lead to an increased autophagy, ketosis, DNA repair, mitochondrial function, and insulin sensitivity, which reduce microglial inflammation. However, the review stresses that there is little current evidence in humans to support or refute these effects, and most studies are too short or small to draw firm conclusions.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are considered modifiable risk factors for dementia. Data suggest that human obesity, especially in the middle ages, increases dementia risk, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

Evidence from animal studies indicates that elevated neuronal senescence and neuroinflammation occur after the consumption of a hypercaloric diet. A central feature of T2D is insulin resistance (IR), with reports suggesting that the brain can also develop IR.

The brain's 'pruning' process matters: Synaptic pruning, where unnecessary neural connections are eliminated, is significantly influenced by external factors like education during youth, impacting lifelong cognitive capacity.

Brain IR can occur in people with dementia, even without concurrent T2D. It presents as an impaired ability to regulate metabolism in peripheral tissues or the brain and could lead to impaired cognition, neurodegeneration, and neuropathology. However, it remains unclear whether T2D and dementia are mechanistically related. Individual food components and nutrients have long been identified with decreased risk of cognitive decline and delay in dementia progression.

Growing evidence suggests that a low vitamin D or K status may have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Vitamin D is abundant in fatty fish and fortified foods, while vitamin K is mainly found in green leafy vegetables.

The review emphasizes, however, that evidence for individual nutrients is inconsistent and insufficient for public health recommendations. In line with this, the WHO advises against supplementation with B vitamins, vitamin E, or omega-3 fatty acids for dementia prevention.

Polyphenols are a group of phytochemicals in plant foods, with observational studies linking flavonoid-rich diets to a lower ADRD risk. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of polyphenols include the ability to reduce inflammation, scavenge radicals, and modulate autophagy, cellular signaling, gene expression, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity. The authors caution that these mechanisms remain largely speculative.

Dementia risk isn't set in stone: Up to 40% of dementia risk globally may stem from modifiable factors identified by the Lancet Commission, ranging from early-life education to mid-life hypertension and later-life social isolation.

The review highlights the concept of cognitive resilience, the ability to resist, adapt to, or cope with brain pathology, as an important lens through which diet may influence brain aging. A healthy diet may help enhance both resistance to pathology and resilience in its presence.

Evidence from the three most comprehensive global systematic reviews highlights a lower risk of age-related neurodegenerative disease associated with a healthy dietary pattern intake during adulthood. The healthy dietary pattern reflects increased intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, unsaturated vegetable oils or fats, fish, and seafood, and lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat.

A secondary analysis of the 5-year PREDIMED trial of older adults at high cardiovascular risk found that those following the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts or extra virgin olive oil had better cognitive function than controls (who received advice on following a low-fat diet). Moreover, the incidence of mild cognitive impairment was not different between intervention groups, with no cases of dementia observed during the follow-up.

However, a recent randomized controlled trial did not find beneficial effects of the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for the neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, with respect to brain volumes or cognitive performance in adults aged ≥65 years with overweight/obesity, a family history of dementia, and no baseline cognitive impairment. This has led to substantial speculation, given the popularity of the MIND diet. It is plausible that this diet might not directly affect brain aging within the three years in the studied population.

Some researchers also noted that dietary improvements in the control group, aimed at weight loss, may have obscured potential effects of the intervention.

The review also highlights broader research limitations, including heterogeneous cognitive tests across studies, reliance on dietary intake measured at a single time point, and difficulties in detecting dietary effects in cognitively healthy populations.

Taken together, evidence suggests that any dietary pattern comprising higher intake of vegetables, fish/seafood, nuts, fruits, and unsaturated vegetable oils or fats, and lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and processed and red meat is associated with a lower risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the biological mechanisms of these protective cognitive effects remain unknown.

The authors emphasize that diet alone is unlikely to achieve clinically meaningful reductions in dementia risk and that multidomain interventions, combining diet with exercise, cognitive training, and cardiovascular risk management, may be more effective.

Emerging metabolomics research may help identify diet-related biomarkers linked to dementia risk, but this field remains in its infancy.

Christian Pulisic is back with the U.S. men's national team after skipping this summer's Gold Cup. But there was no place for Pulisic's fellow 2022 World Cup starters Weston McKennie and Matt Turner as USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino named his 23-player roster for the Americans' September friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan.

Pulisic is among a number of regulars who missed the continental championship in June and July, when the Americans lost the final to chief rival Mexico. Also returning are 2022 veterans Tim Weah, Sergino Dest and Josh Sargent, who will get another chance to compete for the No. 1 striker job with Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang still recovering from hernia surgery and Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi having just returned from serious injuries of their own.

Sargent has started the new campaign in fine form, scoring in each of English second tier club Norwich City's first four games.

Like Balogun and Pepi, Fulham left-back Antonee "Jedi" Robinson will also remain with his club during the international break, having just seen his first Premier League action of the season on Sunday. So will Malik Tillman, who has yet to debut for new team Bayer Leverkusen because of a calf problem.

McKennie played only the final minutes of Italian titans Juventus's Serie A opener last weekend. He was unavailable for international duty earlier in the summer because of Juve's participation at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Turner recently returned to the New England Revolution after three seasons in the Premier League with Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace. 

McKennie and Turner aren't the only  interesting omissions. Central midfielders Aidan Morris and Tanner Tessmann were also left out despite starting the 2025-26 European campaign strong for Middlesbrough and Lyon, respectively. 

So was Johnny Cardoso, who joined Spanish power Atlético Madrid for $35 million last month. Cardoso has started each of Atléti's first two La Liga matches. 

Gold Cup depth center backs Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman were passed over in favor of Hawaii-born Noahkai Banks, an 18-year-old who made eight Bundesliga appearances last season for Augsburg, and Vancouver Whitecaps journeyman Tristan Blackmon, 29.

"We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall," Pochettino said in a statement. "We continue to strengthen the squad and narrow in on the pool of players who can help us achieve our goals at the 2026 FIFA World Cup."

With just four more international windows remaining before Pochettino names the USMNT's 26-player squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil, the September camp represents one of the former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager's last chances to look at players he hasn't seen yet. Banks and Blackmon are among four uncapped players on the roster. The others are keepers Roman Celentano and Jonathan Klinsmann, son of former U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann.

The full September roster is as follows:

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati (MLS); Matt Freese, NYCFC (MLS); Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena (Italy) 

Defenders: Max Arfsten. Columbus Crew (MLS); Noahkai Banks, Augsburg (Germany); Tristan Blackmon, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando City (MLS); Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union (MLS), Tim Ream, Charlotte FC (MLS); Chris Richards, Crystal Palace

Midfiedlers:  Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England); Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Luca de la Torre, San Diego (MLS); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS); Jack McGlynn, Houston Dynamo (MLS); Sean Zawadzki, Columbus Crew (MLS) 

Forwards: Damion Downs, Southampton (England); Christian Pulisic, AC Milan; Josh Sargent, Norwich City (England); Timothy Weah, Marseille (France); Alex Zendejas, Club América (Mexico)

Pulisic will be back with the US after asking out of summer games

22 players named to roster, with a 23rd expected

Christian Pulisic will return to the US men's national team for the first time since his self-imposed absence from the team's summer slate, having been named to the team's roster for two friendlies against South Korea and Japan in the upcoming international window. However, in a surprise move, Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was not named among head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad.

Pochettino named 22 players for the friendlies, with US Soccer adding that a 23rd player is expected to be rostered at a later time. The federation did not elaborate as to whether this player could be McKennie, a US regular who came on as a sub for Juventus over the weekend, or some other player.

The roster is also notable for a few other absences. Goalkeeper Matt Turner, who made an offseason loan move back to MLS in search of regular playing time, misses out, as will strikers Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, and Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman, and defender Antonee Robinson, all of whom are either injured or returning to action after time on the sideline.

Some players, though, will be celebrating a return. That includes Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who has been on fire to start the season, scoring in all four matches he's played in all competitions for the Canaries. Sergiño Dest also makes his return to the US team after recovering fully from last season's ACL tear. Tim Weah is back in the fold as well after Club World Cup duties kept him from participating in the Gold Cup.

The squad is also notable for the holdovers from that Gold Cup squad: 12 in total, including goalkeeper Matt Freese, defenders Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten, and Nathan Harriel, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Damion Downs.

There are also a couple of surprise inclusions: 18-year-old center back Noahkai Banks, the Hawaii-born German-American who made his Bundesliga debut earlier this year with Augsburg, and goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, the son of former US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann.

The US play South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey on 6 September at 5pm ET. They then travel to Columbus to take on Japan at Lower.com Field on 9 September at 7.30pm ET.

Here's the full squad, with breakdowns for each position:

Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena)

Klinsmann's inclusion, and Turner's exclusion, is one of the bigger surprises on the roster. Klinsmann may still be most notable to many US fans for his jab at Landon Donovan on social media after his exclusion from the 2014 World Cup squad – an incident that occurred when he was 17. He has struggled for regular playing time for most of his professional career but has found it in Serie B, where he's been a starter for Cesena since midway through last season.

All in all, this competition is fairly open, though Freese should have the upper hand after starting for the US through the Gold Cup. Celentano will be looking for his first cap with the US, having only appeared in training camps before.

Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Noahkai Banks (FC Augsburg), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace)

There are some regulars in this group one would think could easily start at the 2026 World Cup (Richards, Ream and Dest), but the rest are all players looking to secure a spot on next year's roster. Tristan Blackmon, 29, has been rewarded after years of solid center-back play for the Vancouver Whitecaps. Banks is an intriguing prospect who has made appearances for the US youth teams. Arfsten will have the inside track to start at left back with Dest, Freeman and Harriel all being more natural on the right.

Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew)

Tyler Adams will lead this young group after doing the same at the Gold Cup over the summer, but the bigger news may be about who is not here. McKennie misses out, as does Milan's Yunus Musah, Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson, and Atlético Madrid's Johnny Cardoso, with the latter two having been on the 2025 Gold Cup roster. Sean Zawadzki returns to the team after being part of the team's pre-Gold Cup camp.

Damion Downs (Southampton), Christian Pulisic (Milan) Josh Sargent (Norwich), Tim Weah (Marseille), Alex Zendejas (Club América)

Pulisic's return is notable if only because of how his past absence kicked off a war of words through the media between him and USMNT pundits and past stars of the team. He'll have a point to prove in this camp, where he'll be joined by the red-hot Sargent and Weah, who moved from Juventus to Olympique Marseille over the summer. Southampton's Damion Downs was a surprise inclusion on the 2025 Gold Cup roster and he returns here, with injuries impacting the availability of numerous other options as detailed above. Winger Alex Zendejas returns to the team for the first time in 2025 after impressing with Mexican giants Club América.

East Coast Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualified Nations Korea Republic on Sept. 6 in New Jersey and Sept. 9 in Ohio; CONCACAF Gold Cup Best XI Man Luna Returns to RSL Ahead of Next MLS Match

ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Tuesday, August 26, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 23 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sat., Sept. 6 and Tues., Sept. 9 against World Cup-bound opponents Korea Republic and Japan. A total of 22 players have been rostered, with one addition to be confirmed. Players will begin reporting to New Jersey on Aug. 31.

“We continue to strengthen the squad and narrow in on the pool of players who can help us achieve our goals at the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said Pochettino. “We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall.”

Real Salt Lake (9-14-4, 31 points, 10th West / 20th Shield) will host a “mini-preseason” the next few weeks, with four of its next five matches to be played at home beginning with a Sporting Kansas City visit to America First Field in Sandy on Sat., Sept. 13. This weekend's originally scheduled road trip to Seattle has been moved to Sat., Oct. 11, due to the Sounders' advancement in Leagues Cup.

The USA will first host Korea Republic, presented by Haleon, on Sept. 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J. Kickoff from the home of the New York Red Bulls is set for 3:00 p.m. MT, with the match broadcast live on TNT and Telemundo, and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock.

USA-Japan, presented by Allstate, comes nearly 25 years after the USMNT's first visit to Columbus, Ohio and what has become a special place in U.S. Soccer history. Lower.com Field and the USMNT welcome the 15th-ranked Japanese side on Sept. 9, with the match kicking off at 5:30 p.m. MT and available on TNT, Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary from on-site for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT, Instagram (@USMNT, Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

Luna – RSL's leading 2025 scorer with eight goals and five assists this season, equaling his goal output from last year in half as many MLS matches – is one of 12 players on the friendly roster returning from the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup runner-up U.S. roster. Luna is one of two players –joining defender Chris Richards – who were named to that tournament's Best XI. Richards started all six matches and scored two goals, while Luna tallied three goals and two assists and earned Man of the Match honors after scoring twice in the semifinal win against Guatemala.

Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica. During the CONCACAF Nations League consolation match, Luna was bright and assertive against Canada, as the 2024 MLS All-Star selection and reigning MLS Young Player of the Year continues to press for 2026 FIFA World Cup inclusion.

DETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (Club/Country; Caps/Goals)

GOALKEEPERS (3): Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati; 0/0), Matt Freese (New York City FC; 7/0), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena/ITA; 0/0)

OTHER NOTES:

CP THE CAPWINNER

Christian Pulisic leads all players on the roster with a total of 78 appearances. Tim Ream (74) and Tyler Adams (50) round out the 50 and over club with Tim Weah having 44 under his belt. SergiñoDest will be looking to add to his 33-cap total – more below - while Luca de la Torre and Chris Richards each reached 31 caps during this summer's second-place finish at the Gold Cup.

MOVING ON UP

After two years at Juventus in Italy's Serie A, forward Tim Weah is back to France and Champions League football. The 25-year-old transferred to Olympique de Marseille in Ligue 1, completing his tenure at Juventus with seven goals in 78 appearances. Marseille finished second in Ligue 1 last year behind Champions League winners PSG.

Weah follows in the footsteps of his father, George, who also played for Marseille during his career.

DOWNS AND UP

Damion Downs' Southampton will be looking to make a quick return to the English Premier League after being relegated at the end of last season. For now, they will compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.

After contributing 15 goals + assists to lead the second-tier German side FC Köln to a division title and promotion to the Bundesliga, Downs will look to do the same for Southampton. He was part of the Gold Cup roster for the United States and delivered the game-sealing penalty kick against Costa Rica in Minneapolis that sent the U.S. through to the semifinals.

SERG-ING

Sergiño Dest is poised to make his first appearances for the USMNT since helping the USA claim the Concacaf Nations League title in March 2024. After recovering from a ruptured ACL, Dest joined the camp this past summer, but the timing proved a bit too early for his return to game action during the Gold Cup. The PSV defender has started the Eredivisie campaign strongly, posting two goals and an assist in four matches including the game-winner in the Dutch Super Cup.

HOME BOYS

The stadiums in Harrison and Columbus will feel like home to a host of the U.S. players on this roster. Tim Ream was drafted 18th overall by the New York Red Bulls in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft and was a finalist for Rookie of the Year that season. Tyler Adams had a well-documented rise through the Red Bull Academy all the way to the First Team. Tim Weah spent a year in the same academy before beginning his European adventure at PSG.

Meantime, Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki currently lace them up for the Columbus Crew. The pair were members of the 2023 MLS Cup winning side hosted at Lower.com Field, the site of the tilt on Sept. 9 against Japan. In addition to making his USMNT debut in 2025, Arfsten was selected to this year's MLS All-Star Team.

FIRST TIME IN ‘25

Several players will join the USMNT fold for the first time in 2025. Alex Zendejas appeared in each of the first four matches during Mauricio Pochettino's tenure last fall. The 27-year-old had 12 goals in 48 matches across all competitions for Club América last season.

The MLS duo of Roman Celentano and Sean Zawadzki took part in the 2024 January Camp with Zawadzki earning his first appearance on Jan. 20 against Slovenia. Tristan Blackmon gets his first crack since January of 2022.

Meantime, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann gets another look for the senior MNT for the first time since 2018. Now with Cesena in Serie B in Italy, he won the Golden Glove during the 2017 U-20 Concacaf Gold Cup winning run and appeared in all five matches in the FIFA U-20 World Cup that same year.

CARPE DIEM

Four players are looking to seize the opportunity to earn their first cap for the senior National Team. While Blackmon, Celentano and Klinsmann are getting a return gig, 18-year-old defender NoahkaiBanks makes his debut in a USMNT camp. A dual national of the United States and Germany, the FC Augsburg defender has appeared at the Youth National Team level for the U-17, U-19 and U-20 Men's National Teams.

Real Madrid legend Pedja Mijatovic has advised his former club to sell Vinicius Junior this summer, while slamming the Brazilian winger for his on-field behaviour. The Selecao star came off the bench to contribute with a goal and an assist last weekend, as Los Blancos registered a comfortable 3-0 win over Real Oviedo in La Liga.

ATLANTA & ST. LOUIS (August 26, 2025) – The U.S. Soccer Federation and Purina are teaming up to honor the furry teammates who bring joy, energy, and unconditional support to fans and players alike. Announced today, Purina becomes U.S. Soccer's first-ever Official Pet Care Partner, marking a signature national sports partnership for the pet care leader and a bold celebration of the powerful bond between pets and the beautiful game.

The partnership, which runs through 2030, comes at a pivotal moment for the sport, as the U.S. prepares to host some of the world's most iconic soccer events, including the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. With global attention turning to soccer in the U.S., Purina and U.S. Soccer are celebrating the shared values at the heart of both fandom and pet ownership – support, joy, and community. Together, they'll spotlight the many ways pets enrich the lives of players, fans, and families during this defining era for the sport.

“Soccer is more than just a game, it's a shared experience that connects players, fans, families, and, for me personally, the two dogs who are part of my own family,” said David Wright, Chief Commercial Officer of U.S. Soccer. “As a huge pet lover, I know firsthand the joy and connection pets bring to our lives. This partnership reflects U.S. Soccer's commitment to building community, inspiring connection, and growing the game in unexpected and inclusive ways. Purina shares our values and brings a fresh, joyful perspective to how we engage fans and their pets, especially the four-legged ones, across the country.”

The partnership includes exclusive rights for Purina across a wide range of categories, including pet food, treats, supplements, litter, connected pet products, and pet adoption initiatives. Fans can expect a national creative campaign that celebrates the human-pet bond, custom player-and-pet content, on-site adoption events, co-branded merchandise, retail promotions and pet-forward experiences from brands across the Purina pet care portfolio. Additionally, Purina and U.S. Soccer will work together to concept and create a permanent pet presence as part of the Federation's new Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center in metro Atlanta.

“Together with U.S. Soccer, we will celebrate the amazing role pets play as our teammates and in supporting the mental and physical wellbeing of fans and players alike,” said Andrea Faccio, President and Chief Growth Officer of Purina. “This partnership is the newest way that Purina is combining our shared love of pets and sports with soccer fans across the country and around the world.”

Purina's presence as the Official Pet Care Partner of U.S. Soccer will quickly come to life as the U.S. Men's National Team resumes its preparations for international competition. During an international friendly against Korea on September 6, Purina will bring its Purina Club concept, an in-stadium, pet-friendly experience for soccer fans and their dogs, to Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey. The following Tuesday, Purina's Incredible Dog Team will perform during halftime of the Men's Team's international friendly versus Japan in Columbus, Ohio.

As U.S. Soccer stands on the threshold of one of the most exciting periods in its history, this partnership with Purina adds a unique and joyful dimension to the journey ahead. Together, they'll celebrate the role pets play in uniting soccer families, from pre-game traditions to post-match celebrations, and elevate the moments that connect fans, players, and their four-legged companions during this transformative era for the sport.

Yunus Musah joins "The Football Reporters" podcast to explain why he chose not to be a part of the USMNT's 2025 Gold Cup squad. (1:38)

United States and AC Milan midfielder Yunus Musah's target for the next year is as clear as it is ambitious.

"The nearest goals and achievement for me are winning trophies here at Milan," he tells ESPN. "This season we have the possibility to win three trophies [Serie A, Coppa Italia, Italian Supercoppa]. I'd love to win all three of them. And also then go to the national team and win more trophies as well."

So, a club treble in Italy followed by the FIFA World Cup? "That's it!"

- Is Gladbach the place to revive Reyna's beleaguered career?

The likelihood of that scenario becoming reality has been tested at both club and international level this summer. As Musah sits down in his Milan home for an interview on ESPN's "The Football Reporters" podcast, there are two pressing issues to address. Firstly, the reason for his omission from the USMNT squad which reached last month's Concacaf Gold Cup final, losing narrowly 2-1 to Mexico. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino said Musah had "communicated to us a personal reason, so he needed to withdraw from involvement." What was it?

"Honestly, I was gutted that I couldn't go to the Gold Cup," says Musah. "The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. I needed that time off. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team."

It was a decision criticised by some but in an era where concerns over player welfare are often voiced but rarely acted upon, the 22-year-old took charge of his situation.

"It was a very tough decision because people could easily say 'everyone else is playing, why aren't you?' But no one else is in my body, no one else is in my head," Musah adds. "Everyone that knows me knows I am honest and a hardworking guy but when times are like how they were and I couldn't carry on playing for that summer, I had to take that decision for myself.

"No one else knows how I feel and I hope that people understood my decision and it was about taking care of myself and being able to come back ultimately and be able to give my best for the rest of the season."

Musah now looks likely to begin that task at Milan despite encountering difficulties since Massimiliano Allegri replaced Sérgio Conceição as head coach in May. The following month, Milan sporting director Igli Tare claimed Musah "doesn't have the characteristics" to play in Allegri's preferred three-man midfield, hinting strongly at his departure.

Napoli, Nottingham Forest and, most recently, Atlanta have all been tracking Musah but, amid reports that Allegri is more inclined to utilize him this season, remaining in Italy is clearly the player's focus.

"I am happy at Milan," he says. "It is a great club. I'd love to win some great things here. It felt really nice winning the Super Cup last season so I'd love to win more things. This is what we're expected to do here. I am just happy here and I am looking to work hard and be a main player in the team."

Musah joined Milan from Valencia in 2023, finishing second in his first season with the club. The Rossoneri beat Paris Saint-Germain at home and Newcastle United away in the UEFA Champions League, but missed out on qualification for the knockout phase on goal difference, dropping down to the Europa League where they exited at the quarterfinal stage to AS Roma. Last season was tougher, finishing eighth in Serie A but winning the Italian Supercoppa and reaching the final of the Coppa Italia, losing 1-0 to Bologna in Rome.

He has had Christian Pulisic, who arrived in the same summer two years ago, for company and the USMNT pair have become closer over time.

"We've actually bonded very well since both joining AC Milan," Musah says. "Before that, we weren't so close but now I'd say we are quite close. I get to learn a lot from him every day and in the matches. He has had a great seasons here. I am just learning off him. He's a great guy so I am enjoying playing with Christian."

Musah's positive and measured response to recent challenges is indicative of a player who has long demonstrated bravery beyond his years, right back to when he turned down a new contract at Arsenal to join Valencia in 2019 aged just 16.

"My parents weren't so keen because it wasn't like Arsenal were releasing me or anything," says Musah, who was born in New York City to Ghanaian parents before moving to Italy and then to London aged nine. "I was making a bold decision to leave a club that still wanted me, to go to another country to gamble if I was going to make it out there or not. It was a big decision but I felt really good about it because I felt confident that I was at the level and I was capable of getting into the first team like I hoped.

"There were a few hard things in that process, like convincing my parents and then settling in at Valencia, settling in with the language, the style of play, new people, new surroundings. But ultimately, with hard work, patience and lots of prayer and everything, things turned out well."

His Muslim faith is extremely important to him.

"When you go through good moments, you thank God and when you go through bad moments you thank God as well because I think everything happens for a reason," he says. "When tough things happen to me, I might dwell on them for a minutes but afterwards I understand there is a bigger purpose. I don't take anything to heart, I don't take anything too deeply."

And yet, talking his parents around was not easy. "[There were] a lot of months of just not giving up on it," he continues. "There were a lot of months that I just kept on pushing it, convincing them and going on and on and on about it. Ultimately, we managed to convince them somehow. My brother [Abdul] was with me, he was on my side and we managed to convince them."

Yunus Musah names a list of Premier League and Serie A greats who helped inspire him to become the player he is today.

Musah cites Mesut Özil and Yaya Touré as inspirations growing up watching the Premier League and remains fond of Arsenal -- friends, even, with several current players including Bukayo Saka. He reached out to in support after the England winger was racially abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy in which Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho all missed in the penalty shootout.

"I'm always rooting for them since I left until now," he says. "Arsenal is really embedded in me. I always support them. I have friends that play in that team. It is nice to see my old friends doing well, doing really well actually. I am just supportive of the team that helped me get to where I am today."

Musah simply saw a quicker route to first-team football in Spain. "When I left Arsenal for Valencia, I told myself that if things turned out to be not great or anything, I wouldn't think 'what if I went back to Arsenal?' I would stick to the plan until it worked," he said.

And work it did. So much so that international teams began circling by the time he was 17 with his nomadic life to that point creating eligibility for four nations: Ghana, the U.S., England and Italy. Musah played for four England age groups up to the under-18s but first contact by the USMNT came in 2020 through assistant Nico Estévez, who had connections at Valencia after eight years working at the LaLiga club. Then Gregg Berhalter, head coach of the USMNT for five years across two spells, began his charm offensive.

"Gregg called me and that was really huge for a 17-year-old to get a call from the men's national team coach," Musah says. "It was amazing. He was very nice. He was very keen to have me amongst the group and he made it feel really easy. He said there were no strings attached, I could just come to the camp, see what it's like, enjoy it and that's what I did. I never looked back.

"It was a tough decision. I had a lot of options, which is a good thing. And also I had an amazing time with the England setup. I went to so many camps, played with great players, great coaches and ultimately I started my career playing in Valencia's first team and then Gregg called me to play for the [U.S.] men's first team as a 17-year-old. It was a huge opportunity I couldn't turn down and I've been loving every minute since."

Musah went on to play at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and would win that year's U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award. Berhalter has since been replaced -- via interim stints for B.J Callaghan and Mikey Varas -- by Pochettino, who led a run to the final of the Gold Cup earlier this summer in Musah's absence.

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

"I have a lot of love for Gregg," Musah says. "So, so grateful for all the opportunities. I had most of my caps under Gregg. We have a great manager again now so I am lucky to be able to play under two great managers. Now I'm just learning under Mauricio.

"First of all, we train very hard. We work very hard in training so that we are prepared in matches to be able to play at that intensity. He is very keen on the energy we bring out on the field and how much we want it. That's something that we have to bring back in our team, the fire we bring into matches that helped us in a lot of games against the big teams.

"Sometimes it is about who wants it more. Mauricio is trying to get that fire in us and make sure when teams come to play us they have a really tough time."

And Pochettino, formerly head coach Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, is not shying away from the expectation of the biggest tournament of all on the horizon: next year's home men's World Cup, hosted along with Mexico and Canada.

"Us as players, we go into every tournament believing we can win it," Musah says. "That's the beauty of football. We are a very talented group in a tournament where there are huge players, huge teams who are probably way more expected to win the tournament.

"But we've seen it time and time again where you can say the underdog goes on and does it. We go into the tournament with that belief. I think if you go into the tournament thinking you are not going to win it is quite pointless, so we will go into the tournament thinking we can do it and give our fans, ourselves, our families, the best satisfaction we can.

"I know that non-football fans, celebrities, you name it, are going to be behind the team just because we are the U.S.. They are very proud to support anyone that's from the U.S.. We are going to have so much support, we are going to feel it and it is going to drive us to do great things, I'm sure."

Yunus Musah joins "The Football Reporters" podcast to explain why he chose not to be a part of the USMNT's 2025 Gold Cup squad. (1:38)

United States and AC Milan midfielder Yunus Musah's target for the next year is as clear as it is ambitious.

"The nearest goals and achievement for me are winning trophies here at Milan," he tells ESPN. "This season we have the possibility to win three trophies [Serie A, Coppa Italia, Italian Supercoppa]. I'd love to win all three of them. And also then go to the national team and win more trophies as well."

So, a club treble in Italy followed by the FIFA World Cup? "That's it!"

- Is Gladbach the place to revive Reyna's beleaguered career?

The likelihood of that scenario becoming reality has been tested at both club and international level this summer. As Musah sits down in his Milan home for an interview on ESPN's "The Football Reporters" podcast, there are two pressing issues to address. Firstly, the reason for his omission from the USMNT squad which reached last month's Concacaf Gold Cup final, losing narrowly 2-1 to Mexico. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino said Musah had "communicated to us a personal reason, so he needed to withdraw from involvement." What was it?

"Honestly, I was gutted that I couldn't go to the Gold Cup," says Musah. "The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. I needed that time off. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team."

It was a decision criticised by some but in an era where concerns over player welfare are often voiced but rarely acted upon, the 22-year-old took charge of his situation.

"It was a very tough decision because people could easily say 'everyone else is playing, why aren't you?' But no one else is in my body, no one else is in my head," Musah adds. "Everyone that knows me knows I am honest and a hardworking guy but when times are like how they were and I couldn't carry on playing for that summer, I had to take that decision for myself.

"No one else knows how I feel and I hope that people understood my decision and it was about taking care of myself and being able to come back ultimately and be able to give my best for the rest of the season."

Musah now looks likely to begin that task at Milan despite encountering difficulties since Massimiliano Allegri replaced Sérgio Conceição as head coach in May. The following month, Milan sporting director Igli Tare claimed Musah "doesn't have the characteristics" to play in Allegri's preferred three-man midfield, hinting strongly at his departure.

Napoli, Nottingham Forest and, most recently, Atlanta have all been tracking Musah but, amid reports that Allegri is more inclined to utilize him this season, remaining in Italy is clearly the player's focus.

"I am happy at Milan," he says. "It is a great club. I'd love to win some great things here. It felt really nice winning the Super Cup last season so I'd love to win more things. This is what we're expected to do here. I am just happy here and I am looking to work hard and be a main player in the team."

Musah joined Milan from Valencia in 2023, finishing second in his first season with the club. The Rossoneri beat Paris Saint-Germain at home and Newcastle United away in the UEFA Champions League, but missed out on qualification for the knockout phase on goal difference, dropping down to the Europa League where they exited at the quarterfinal stage to AS Roma. Last season was tougher, finishing eighth in Serie A but winning the Italian Supercoppa and reaching the final of the Coppa Italia, losing 1-0 to Bologna in Rome.

He has had Christian Pulisic, who arrived in the same summer two years ago, for company and the USMNT pair have become closer over time.

"We've actually bonded very well since both joining AC Milan," Musah says. "Before that, we weren't so close but now I'd say we are quite close. I get to learn a lot from him every day and in the matches. He has had a great seasons here. I am just learning off him. He's a great guy so I am enjoying playing with Christian."

Musah's positive and measured response to recent challenges is indicative of a player who has long demonstrated bravery beyond his years, right back to when he turned down a new contract at Arsenal to join Valencia in 2019 aged just 16.

"My parents weren't so keen because it wasn't like Arsenal were releasing me or anything," says Musah, who was born in New York City to Ghanaian parents before moving to Italy and then to London aged nine. "I was making a bold decision to leave a club that still wanted me, to go to another country to gamble if I was going to make it out there or not. It was a big decision but I felt really good about it because I felt confident that I was at the level and I was capable of getting into the first team like I hoped.

"There were a few hard things in that process, like convincing my parents and then settling in at Valencia, settling in with the language, the style of play, new people, new surroundings. But ultimately, with hard work, patience and lots of prayer and everything, things turned out well."

His Muslim faith is extremely important to him.

"When you go through good moments, you thank God and when you go through bad moments you thank God as well because I think everything happens for a reason," he says. "When tough things happen to me, I might dwell on them for a minutes but afterwards I understand there is a bigger purpose. I don't take anything to heart, I don't take anything too deeply."

And yet, talking his parents around was not easy. "[There were] a lot of months of just not giving up on it," he continues. "There were a lot of months that I just kept on pushing it, convincing them and going on and on and on about it. Ultimately, we managed to convince them somehow. My brother [Abdul] was with me, he was on my side and we managed to convince them."

Yunus Musah names a list of Premier League and Serie A greats who helped inspire him to become the player he is today.

Musah cites Mesut Özil and Yaya Touré as inspirations growing up watching the Premier League and remains fond of Arsenal -- friends, even, with several current players including Bukayo Saka. He reached out to in support after the England winger was racially abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy in which Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho all missed in the penalty shootout.

"I'm always rooting for them since I left until now," he says. "Arsenal is really embedded in me. I always support them. I have friends that play in that team. It is nice to see my old friends doing well, doing really well actually. I am just supportive of the team that helped me get to where I am today."

Musah simply saw a quicker route to first-team football in Spain. "When I left Arsenal for Valencia, I told myself that if things turned out to be not great or anything, I wouldn't think 'what if I went back to Arsenal?' I would stick to the plan until it worked," he said.

And work it did. So much so that international teams began circling by the time he was 17 with his nomadic life to that point creating eligibility for four nations: Ghana, the U.S., England and Italy. Musah played for four England age groups up to the under-18s but first contact by the USMNT came in 2020 through assistant Nico Estévez, who had connections at Valencia after eight years working at the LaLiga club. Then Gregg Berhalter, head coach of the USMNT for five years across two spells, began his charm offensive.

"Gregg called me and that was really huge for a 17-year-old to get a call from the men's national team coach," Musah says. "It was amazing. He was very nice. He was very keen to have me amongst the group and he made it feel really easy. He said there were no strings attached, I could just come to the camp, see what it's like, enjoy it and that's what I did. I never looked back.

"It was a tough decision. I had a lot of options, which is a good thing. And also I had an amazing time with the England setup. I went to so many camps, played with great players, great coaches and ultimately I started my career playing in Valencia's first team and then Gregg called me to play for the [U.S.] men's first team as a 17-year-old. It was a huge opportunity I couldn't turn down and I've been loving every minute since."

Musah went on to play at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and would win that year's U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award. Berhalter has since been replaced -- via interim stints for B.J Callaghan and Mikey Varas -- by Pochettino, who led a run to the final of the Gold Cup earlier this summer in Musah's absence.

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

"I have a lot of love for Gregg," Musah says. "So, so grateful for all the opportunities. I had most of my caps under Gregg. We have a great manager again now so I am lucky to be able to play under two great managers. Now I'm just learning under Mauricio.

"First of all, we train very hard. We work very hard in training so that we are prepared in matches to be able to play at that intensity. He is very keen on the energy we bring out on the field and how much we want it. That's something that we have to bring back in our team, the fire we bring into matches that helped us in a lot of games against the big teams.

"Sometimes it is about who wants it more. Mauricio is trying to get that fire in us and make sure when teams come to play us they have a really tough time."

And Pochettino, formerly head coach Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, is not shying away from the expectation of the biggest tournament of all on the horizon: next year's home men's World Cup, hosted along with Mexico and Canada.

"Us as players, we go into every tournament believing we can win it," Musah says. "That's the beauty of football. We are a very talented group in a tournament where there are huge players, huge teams who are probably way more expected to win the tournament.

"But we've seen it time and time again where you can say the underdog goes on and does it. We go into the tournament with that belief. I think if you go into the tournament thinking you are not going to win it is quite pointless, so we will go into the tournament thinking we can do it and give our fans, ourselves, our families, the best satisfaction we can.

"I know that non-football fans, celebrities, you name it, are going to be behind the team just because we are the U.S.. They are very proud to support anyone that's from the U.S.. We are going to have so much support, we are going to feel it and it is going to drive us to do great things, I'm sure."

KANSAS CITY, Mo — We are less than a year out from the FIFA World Cup taking center stage in the Heart of America. We know, Kansas City will host six matches including two knockout games, but what can we really expect a year from now? 

Chris Donahoo lives in Kansas City and to say he's a die-hard soccer fan is understatement. 20 years ago, he and a group of 9 friends grabbed their passports and traveled to Cologne, Germany for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. 

"We traveled there, there wasn't a lot going on as far as fandom around the World Cup for Team USA, and when we were there, we were thinking the whole time, how cool would it be if there was a meeting place, or some kind of event set up for the U.S. for fans that are going, because we'd see U.S. jerseys, we'd run into U.S. fans everywhere, but there was no organization," recalled Donahoo. 

Donahoo says the desire to rally behind Team USA  inspired the creation of the American Outlaws — a nonprofit dedicated to organizing support for the U.S. men's, women's, and youth soccer teams. He's part of the KC chapter, and his passion for all things World Cup has even taken him as far as Brazil in 2014.

"I knew from the second I walked in the stadium that this was gonna be something that I participated in for the rest of my life," said Donahoo, "I can't imagine that there's any other sporting event that rivals this. People talk about the Super Bowl, but it's just, it's nothing in comparison to that." 

Sharing that same passion is Kurt Austin, who is the current Senior Director of Communications at Sporting KC. Austin grew up in Kansas City and also attended his first World Cup tournament in Germany while in college with friends and family. He says it was a life-changing experience that led him to attend men and women's World Cup tournaments across South Africa, Brazil, Germany, Quatar and more. 

"So many fans look forward to this every four years, and they save up for it for years to be able to go to a World Cup. They really make the most of the experience," explained Austin. 

Roger Espinoza, Sporting KC legend who proudly wore an Honduras jersey during the 2010 and 2014 World Cup tournaments and represented La H in the 2012 Olympics tells KSHB41, playing in the World Cup was a moment he has been working for all his life. 

"The World Cup, I think, is the pinnacle of where every soccer player wants to reach," said Espinoza. "As a little kid, you just dreamed of that, and being able to get to that level in 2010 and then 2014, it just brought back all the memories, when you were young, dreaming and working hard. So it is an emotional moment, but it is also, you know, a proud moment for you, just because you work so hard and you think of your family and all the hard work your parents did for you, for you to make it to that level."

KC 2026 estimates 650,000 fans will come to KC for the biggest sporting event in the world, which is why Donahoo's biggest piece of advice is securing a babysitter and planning to be at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, if you're lucky enough to score a ticket. 

"I'm going to take my oldest son, so I'm going to be working with a babysitter for my youngest son, so my wife and I will probably be heading out to Arrowhead very early," said Donahoo." It's going be the summer, there's going be some heat, but I promise you will not regret getting out there early and taking in all the things, all the activities, talk to as many people as possible, welcome people to our city. It doesn't matter where you're from, what religion you are. None of that matters, because soccer transcends people."

Austin says if you don't have tickets, the FIFA Fan Fest at the World War I Memorial will be a fiesta you don't want to miss. 

"You can watch all the games, you can be around all the fans, it's a free experience to participate in, so I think that's certainly one way that locals can enjoy the World Cup," said Austin. "But I also think already you're seeing cities and the business community plan events to be able to embrace the visitors that are here. I think you're gonna see a huge amount of interest, and you're gonna see a lot of different activities and events available for the community to participate." 

The final match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held on Sunday, July 19, 2026, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. But once the tournament is over both players and fans believe KC will be triumphant in winning the hearts of all that came to visit. 

"I have no doubt that it will be a very loud stadium, fans traveling, but you know, every country has its unique way, and I think that any country that Kansas City hosts is going to be  a special moment and the United States being a country of immigrants, I don't think any team will have a problem having fans," said Espinoza.

The France international played his part in last season's success but his start to the current campaign is too poor to ignore

Plenty of people wanted to talk about Alexander Isak before, during and after Liverpool's chaotic clash with Newcastle on Monday night. Arne Slot wasn't one of them, though.

When asked about his club's interest in the Swedish striker after the dramatic 3-2 win at St. James' Park, Slot told Sky Sports: "I think the story should be about Hugo Ekitike. He has been with us for three games now and scored three goals. So, this is not the place to talk about anything other than that, although I can understand why you would ask the question."

Slot knows full well how big a talking point Isak's strike has become. It has become the saga of the summer and the media frenzy won't die down until the dispute is resolved one way or another. However, the game on Tyneside really wasn't about Isak - at least not from Liverpool's perspective. Slot doesn't necessarily need the Swedish striker to arrive at Anfield before the summer transfer window closes, as Ekitike delivered more evidence of how capable he is of leading the line.

What is painfully imperative, though, is that the Reds stop procrastinating and sign Marc Guehi - because continuing to count on Ibrahima Konate could cost them their Premier League title.

Carlo Ancelotti is aiming to continue a strong World Cup qualification campaign after naming his Brazil squad for the next round of matches in September.

Former Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, 65, was appointed as the head coach of Brazil in May.

The appointment was great news for Manchester United midfielder Casemiro, who had appeared to be losing his place in the national team. Ancelotti changed that and recalled Casemiro, along with Antony, to his first squad as Brazil boss earlier this year.

Before Ancelotti's arrival, Antony and Casemiro missed out on a place in Brazil's 2024 Copa America squad and had not represented their country since 2023.

Ancelotti recalled Casemiro after the midfield veteran, who starred under the Italian at Real Madrid, forced his way back into the United first team under Ruben Amorim during the second half of the season. He played a key role in United's run to the Europa League final, after scoring three goals and two assists in the knockout stages of the competition.

Meanwhile, Antony was rejuvenating his career on loan at Real Betis, earning a recall by scoring goals and assists in La Liga before returning to Old Trafford at the end of the season.

United currently have three Brazilian internationals in Amorim's squad.

Matheus Cunha completed a transfer to United from Wolves this summer to become the latest Brazilian to wear the red shirt.

The 26-year-old has shown encouraging signs in his first two competitive appearances for United, although he is still waiting for his first win since joining the club.

Cunha has done enough to warrant a place in Brazil's squad for Brazil's final round of South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup against Chile and Bolivia. He is joined by Casemiro who is likely to be a mainstay under Ancelotti in the national team.

The biggest headlines from Ancelotti's latest squad focus on Neymar missing out due to injury, while Real Madrid duo Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo were overlooked because the Italian wants to get to know his other players better.

Brazil have already booked a place at the World Cup next year, which allows Ancelotti to experiment with his squad over the next two matches.

The latest Brazil squad will come as a blow for United outcast Antony.

The 25-year-old has been left out of the United squad all summer, and it is clear he is not part of Amorim's plans for the future.

As a result, Ancelotti has had no other choice but to overlook the winger, as he's missed pre-season and is not playing regular football for his club. That is why it was important for Antony to secure a move away from United earlier this summer.

Real Betis want to re-sign Antony, which has been the case since his previous loan deal at the Spanish club expired at the end of last season. It remains to be seen if the La Liga outfit will be able to reach an agreement with United before Monday's deadline.

Antony's chances of representing Brazil in the near future are slim if the tricky winger fails to secure a move to a new club.

Neymar's chances of appearing at the 2026 FIFA World Cup are looking slimmer by the moment. 

Once a stalwart for Brazil's squad, the 33-year-old was left off manager Carlo Ancelotti's 23-man roster for the Seleção's final two World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia next week.

It now extends Neymar's absence from international duty to nearly two years.

Ancelotti cited a leg muscle injury sustained last week as the reason for Neymar's latest omission. Brazil have already secured their place at the 2026 World Cup.

The former Barcelona and PSG superstar, who now plays at boyhood club Santos in Brazil, last donned the iconic yellow jersey in October 2023. Numerous knee injuries have seen plagued his comeback attempts.

"Neymar sustained a minor injury last week. This will be the final two matches of the qualifiers and it will be very demanding, so we need players in their prime conditions so we can perform at the highest level," Ancelotti said Monday.

The Italian coach, who has previously expressed his commitment to getting Neymar match-ready for the 2026 World Cup, opted for caution over the 33-year-old's fitness. 

"We don't need to evaluate Neymar, we all know who he is and what he is capable of. We need him in peak condition so he can help the national team the way we all know he can," the former Real Madrid and AC Milan coach said.

The squad features a blend of established stars like Alisson, Marquinhos and Casemiro alongside emerging talents including Chelsea teenager Estevao and the comeback of West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta, as Brazil look to end their qualifying campaign on a high note. 

Ancelotti's list:

GOALKEEPERS: Alisson (Liverpool), Bento (Al-Nassr), Hugo Souza (Corinthians).

DEFENDERS: Alexsandro Ribeiro (Lille), Alex Sandro (Flamengo), Caio Henrique (Monaco), Douglas Santos (Zenit), Fabricio Bruno (Cruzeiro), Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal), Marquinhos (PSG), Vanderson (Monaco), Wesley (Roma).

MIDFIELDERS: Andrey Santos (Chelsea), Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle), Casemiro (Manchester United), Joelinton (Newcastle), Lucas Paqueta (West Ham).

FORWARDS: Estevao (Chelsea), Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal), Joao Pedro (Chelsea), Kaio Jorge (Cruzeiro), Luiz Henrique (Zenit), Matheus Cunha (Manchester United), Raphinha (Barcelona), Richarlison (Tottenham).

 Daniil Medvedev is unlikely to look back fondly on the 2025 Grand Slam season. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has ended his year at the majors with just one match win after he fell to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat against Benjamin Bonzi on Sunday night at the US Open. After stealing the third set amid chaotic scenes, Medvedev twice surrendered a break in the fifth set. After shaking hands with Bonzi, he tossed six racquets from his bag to fans in the stands.

Despite a courageous comeback and some excellent shotmaking, Medvedev produced an error-strewn performance on Louis Armstrong Stadium, offering up 64 unforced errors overall. For Bonzi, it was a second consecutive Grand Slam victory against Medvedev following his four-set triumph in the pair's clash at Wimbledon in late June. 

 The 20-time tour-level champion Medvedev began his Grand Slam year by rallying from two-sets-to-one down to defeat then-World No. 418 Kasidit Samrej at the Australian Open. He then fell to Learner Tien in five sets in the second round in Melbourne, before falling to Cameron Norrie in five at Roland Garros, and Bonzi at both Wimbledon and now the US Open. 

“I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” Medvedev said of his 2025 Grand Slam season. “Everything: serve, return, volley, whatever… I just need to play better, and I'm going to try to do it next year.”

 Sunday night's encounter between Medvedev and Bonzi in New York did not lack drama. Bonzi appeared set to wrap a comfortable upset when he stepped up to serve on match point at 5-4, 40/30 in the third set, but an unexpected interruption acted as a catalyst for wild scenes on Louis Armstrong Stadium. 

The bedlam began when a photographer ran from the court entrance onto the court surface inside the side court signage to take his position in the photographers' pit after Bonzi missed his first serve on the match point. Umpire Greg Allensworth awarded the Frenchman another first serve due to the disturbance. Medvedev ran towards the umpire's chair to remonstrate and soon after encouraged the crowd to raise as much noise as they could muster. 

 Sustained crowd noise delayed play for about five minutes. As Bonzi paced near the back of the court, even Medvedev was concerned things had spiralled out of control and he signalled for an end to the chaos. Upon resumption, a Bonzi fault drew an enormous roar from fans. When Medvedev won a baseline exchange to get back to deuce, fans erupted. 

 Massive roars rang out when Medvedev then earned – and converted – a break point to level at 5-5. The former US Open champion, who once fancied himself a villain to the New York crowd – made a heart symbol with his hands to thank them for their support. After clinching the set in a tie-break, he repeated the gesture.

Medvedev raced away with the fourth set and broke in the first game of the fifth. But he handed back the break immediately. He also handed back a break at 3-3. Despite serving below full strength due to a leg injury, Bonzi fought off five break points to hold for 4-3 and soon after broke Medvedev in the final game of the match to secure a dramatic win for new coach Nicolas Mahut.

“It's a very important win, it's my first Grand Slam with Nico, our first week together,” Bonzi said on court after the victory. “I gave all my heart on the court and I have the win today.

“I'm very proud of myself, the scenario of the match, the match point in the third. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. It's kind of crazy, this match. For me it's like my best victory ever. It's very special to do it here.”

Medvedev has enjoyed some success away from the majors in 2025, reaching an ATP Masters 1000 semi-final in Indian Wells and an ATP 500 championship match in Halle. But the 29-year-old's horror show at the Slams represents a dramatic dropoff for a player who has been of the most consistent performers at that level in recent years: Medvedev reached at least one Grand Slam final per year from 2021 to 2024.

Venus Williams put on a show for the fans in attendance at Arthur Ashe Stadium but ultimately fell to No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova in the first round. Muchova secured the win 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in exactly two hours.

Venus Williams made a spirited return to the US Open after a year away, taking a set off No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova before falling in the first round Monday night.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Despite the loss, the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium was treated to glimpses of “Vintage Venus.” The two-time US Open champion's crisp ball-striking and powerful serve were on full display -- especially in the second set, when it briefly looked like she might pull off the upset.

Ultimately, Muchova, last year's semifinalist, proved too strong on this occasion for the seven-time Grand Slam winner, closing out a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory in exactly two hours.

The result marked Williams' fourth consecutive first-round exit in New York.

This was Williams' 25th US Open appearance, coming just a month after she returned to competition with a surprise win over then-World No. 35 Peyton Stearns in Washington D.C., following a 16-month absence.

Her return to the Big Apple didn't start as smoothly.

She was broken in the opening game and quickly fell behind 0-2, facing three break points in her second service game at risk of going down a double break early. But she saved all three and rallied to win three straight games, taking a 3-2 lead before dropping the next four to concede the first set.

Williams committed seven double faults in the opener.

The second set told a different story. She broke Muchova in the opening game and never looked back, hitting 10 winners to just five unforced errors, and limiting herself to one double fault.

But the momentum didn't last. Williams faded in the third set, allowing Muchova to regain control and seal the win.

While it's unclear when Williams will next take the court, she showed she still has what it takes to compete with the world's best. The fans responded in kind, showing they'll continue to support her -- wherever and whenever that may be.

Muchova, meanwhile, advances to face either Sorana Cirstea or Solana Sierra in the second round. Reflecting on the match, she acknowledged the challenge and the honor of sharing the court with a legend.

“I was stressed, you guys made me stressed,” Muchova said after the match. “But no, it was an unbelievable atmosphere. I mean, she's such a legend of our sport, I understand. It's so nice to play and to share a court with her, and I'm just glad that I was lucky to win today.”

At just 5-foot-3 and ranked No. 82, Zarazua had never gone past the second round of a major. She had lost in the first or second round of all eight previous Grand Slam appearances, including a second-round finish at the 2024 US Open. Facing world No. 6 Keys was another daunting task—Keys had beaten her last year at Roland Garros, and Zarazua carried a 0-6 record against Top 10 players.The turning point came from a piece of mom's advice.“I spoke to my mom and I was almost crying,” she said. “I didn't want to go on court at all, and I told her that. She said, ‘You have to be the professional that you are. You have to go out there and give everything.' And I did, but it was very tough to go out there today.”

At an Open celebrating Althea Gibson, fans had a chance to see another trailblazer in person.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 26, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—The central theme of this year's US Open is barrier-breaking. Specifically, the barrier that Althea Gibson broke 75 years ago when she became the first African-American to play the U.S. Nationals at Forest Hills.So it made sense that fans had a chance to see one of the inheritors of Gibson's legacy, and a trailblazer of equal importance, Venus Williams, play in person on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. In 1997, the year that Ashe made its debut, a teenage Williams also made her Open debut, and went all the way to the final. Twenty-eight years later, we can see the product of that breakthrough in the many Black women tennis players who have come after her, and who populate the draw at Flushing Meadows today.👉 Watch on the Tennis Channel app: TenniStory, Althea Gibson

Williams' presence would have been enough, no matter how her first-round match with Karolina Muchova went. And for the first three games, it looked like we might not get much more than that from Venus. She started the way you would expect a 45-year-old who hasn't played a Grand Slam match in two years, and who has played very few matches anywhere since 2021, to start: slowly. Williams had trouble catching up to Muchova's pace, and trouble getting her service motion in gear. She was down 0-2 before most fans had entered the building. Many of them may have wondered: Was she going to get a game?Venus put those fears to rest by saving three break points and holding for 2-1. From there, she began to get comfortable in the rallies. Which is never going to be good for her opponents, no matter what her age is, because Venus has never lost her power. She can't cover the court the way she once did. Her service toss gets away from her—she committed 10 double faults in this match. She starts breathing hard much more quickly than she once did. But for all of that, she can still put a flat wallop on the ball. When she does, even a highly-ranked 20-something pro like Muchova isn't going to catch up with it.

For the next set and a half, Williams played Muchova evenly. She drilled winning returns off her second serves. She found the corners with her ground strokes. She even jumped up to knock off a smash. When she broke to take the lead in the second set, she celebrated with a fist-pump—a rarity for her. The Open fans cheered every point she won, and stayed dead silent for every point she lost. I'm not sure Muchova received any applause at all over three sets.“I was stressed,” Muchova told the crowd later. “You guys had me stressed.”Even then, the fans stayed silent.

But Muchova overcame it when she needed to. After losing the second set, she walked off court, “collected myself,” and came back out and played much cleaner tennis. Just as in the first set, she started with an early break, and quickly led 3-0. The winners stopped exploding off Venus' racquet, and the end came quietly, 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 for Muchova.Still, even in the third set, there was a vintage Venus moment. Serving at 0-3, she took a solid return from Muchova and obliterated a forehand. The ball went through the middle of the court, but way too fast for Muchova to respond. By the time she started her swing, it was through the hole in the back tarp.The cameras caught Venus' scream as she swung. If it turns out to be this barrier-breaker's last blast on Ashe, she made it a good one.

Madison Keys had the first-round jitters in her surprising loss to Renata Zarazua, a 3 hour and 10 minute marathon in which she committed 89 unforced errors.

NEW YORK -- Even in a breakthrough season capped by her first Grand Slam title, Madison Keys faltered on Monday, falling to unseeded Renata Zarazua in the first round on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The sixth-seeded American, who won her first Grand Slam title earlier this year in Melbourne, fought off the Mexican World No. 82 for three painstaking sets before finally succumbing, 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5, in a 3-hour and 10-minute marathon.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Keys, 30, said she felt fine in warm-ups, but it was evident early in the first set that she wasn't at her strongest.

"I was just, for the first time in a while, my nerves really got the better of me," the former US Open finalist admitted. "And it kind of became a little bit paralyzing. I felt like I was just slow. I wasn't seeing things the way that I wanted to, which I feel like resulted in a lot of bad decisions and lazy footwork."

The sloppiness was evident, as Keys made 89 unforced errors against 46 winners.

"I think it was probably building a little bit," Keys said when asked about the pressure of playing her first US Open as a major champion. "The reality is it usually builds a little bit. You always kind of feel first-round jitters, and as the day is getting closer, you feel a little bit more and more nervous.

"But I feel like, for whatever reason, today I just couldn't separate myself from the ... and it's more than just saying, 'I want to win.' Just feeling like winning matters just way too much, and I just couldn't quite separate myself from that. Then once you start playing badly, it just kind of all snowballs."

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

It was a particularly stunning upset, and not just because of Zarazua's far lower ranking. Prior to Monday's win, she had never beaten a Top 10 player in six tries in her nine-year career. It was also only her ninth appearance in the main draw of a Slam, and she's never advanced past the second round.

It's equally surprising because of Keys' success in tight matches this year. She currently leads the Hologic WTA Tour with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins.

As for Zarazua, she too felt the nerves -- who wouldn't on Ashe, in the first round of a Slam? -- but her recent experience at majors has helped her feel like she belongs, and made the moment feel more manageable. (Until 2024, she had never played in the singles main draw at all four majors in a season.)

"I was really nervous coming in," Zarazua told reporters. "I think the few minutes right before you go on court, it's probably the worst moments. But in a way, I feel like the experiences of playing in the other stadiums at the other Slams kind of helped me a lot today.

"Obviously I didn't want the nerves to be what let me down in the match. I thought I was playing really well the past few days and practicing well, so I was like, I've just got to find a way to use that [to] my advantage. The fear, the nerves, all of that, [I] just tried to leave them on the side and just focus on my game and what I had to do."

Next up for the feisty 5-foot-3 player is Diane Parry, who dropped just one game in a dominant effort over now-retired Petra Kvitova.

 It would be hard for Marin Cilic's past at the US Open not to somehow inform his latest campaign at the hard-court major. 

 The 2014 titlist is back to compete in New York for the first time in three years and walking around the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center has perhaps inevitably brought back memories of his past successes there. Cilic's intention is to put them to good use as he prepares for his 15th main-draw appearance at Flushing Meadows. 

 “There are flashes. Obviously, I am not thinking only about my victory here, more into details,” Cilic, who takes on 23rd seed Alexander Bublik in the first round, told ATPTour.com. “What things did I do well in those years when I played well, especially the one that I won? What helped me to find my game? What helped me to just find my inner peace and compete at that level? 

 “I'm just trying to pick a couple of things and if I can incorporate those into my game, great. The feeling that you know you played well here is maybe an extra boost to lift your game.” 



 The US Open naturally stands out as a special tournament for Cilic, but not just for his 2014 title run in which he dropped just three sets and included a straight-sets victory against Roger Federer in the semi-finals. 

 “It means an achievement of a lifetime [to me], absolutely,” said the 36-year-old Croatian. “Obviously, everything came to life over here. I had some great success prior to my victory here, playing in the era of not only the Big Four but also other guys from Andy Roddick to [James] Blake to [Fernando] Gonzalez to [Tomas] Berdych to [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga to [Juan Martin] del Potro to [David] Nalbandian to many incredible champions we had on the Tour. 

 “Here, all my dreams came true, so coming here again always brings the goosebumps and always brings a little bit of a sensation of, ‘Can I do it again?' You never know what's coming, so you've always got to keep your mind open and work as hard as you can to achieve those things.”

 There were no guarantees that Cilic was going to get the chance to compete again at an event where he holds a 41-13 record. He missed almost all of the 2023 season and half of 2024 due to a right knee injury, a tough absence for any player to bounce back from in their mid-30s. 

 “It was a huge struggle to come back,” reflected Cilic. “It's an extremely difficult position, unknown territory, when you need to do a surgery. Who to trust? What to do? What if it went wrong? Obviously, you are feeling, ‘I'm 35, 36, do I need these things?' For me it came down to just a feeling, an idea of wanting to come back and needing to do it for my past self. I was so diligent and professional for so many years, and I want to come back to give myself another chance. 

 “Coming back here is just a plus. To play here, to enjoy myself. My family is here, my boys. They walked here through the corridors, and they were like, ‘Oh dad, that's you! That's you on the photo, I can't believe it!' It's fun to have new memories.” 

 When Cilic steps on court to face Bublik on Tuesday afternoon in New York, it will be the 36-year-old's first US Open outing since 2022, when he reached the fourth round. A 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz ended Cilic's run in a five-set thriller before going on to lift his maiden major title and simultaneously become the youngest No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history. 

 “I played him that year also in Miami, where he won his first Masters 1000 and I was like, ‘This guys is unbelievable',” recalls Cilic of the 2022 incarnation of Alcaraz. “Not many guys just blew me off the court like that. Playing here, I was ready to go full on, and it was a tough match, five sets, and he went on to win the trophy and be No. 1. To even have that kind of a run in 2022 when he was 19, with so many tough matches and five setters, it was just incredible.”

 With Cilic having played most of his career in the ‘Big Four' era, the way Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have dominated the majors across 2024 and 2025 could give Cilic a sense of déjà vu. Yet the Croatian is happy to focus on his two younger rivals' own unique paths to the top of the sport. 

 “Carlos and Jannik deserve [their success],” said Cilic. “They are so diligent, so professional. They worked on their game and have incredible ability. For me, it is also great to be a part of this generation as well.” 

 As a player who notched plenty of successes in the Big Four era, does Cilic have any advice for other top ATP Tour stars currently trying to reel in the red-hot Alcaraz and Sinner? 

 “It comes down to every individual. What do you want to achieve, what is your goal?” said the 21-time tour-level champion. “Everybody has different goals, but if you want to be better than those guys, you have to be prepared to work better than them and be smart with training, smart with decisions. Many things, because these guys are just on a run for the past couple of years and are not meaning to stop.”

Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up?

Cadillac opt for Perez and Bottas for inaugural 2026 season

Jonathan Wheatley has embarked on a new challenge with Kick Sauber this season, having previously acted as Sporting Director for Red Bull across many years.

Jonathan Wheatley has shared what he has been able to carry forward from his time with Red Bull through to his new role as Team Principal at Kick Sauber, with the Briton having “immersed” himself in the Hinwil-based outfit since joining back in April.

After starting his F1 career as a mechanic for Benetton back in 1991, Wheatley climbed the ranks within the squad over the years that followed – and through their subsequent guise as Renault in the early 2000s – before joining Red Bull in 2006.

Acting as Sporting Director, Wheatley worked for the championship-winning team until 2024, when it was confirmed that he would join Kick Sauber as their new Team Principal in April 2025 ahead of the outfit transitioning into Audi's works squad for the 2026 season.

When asked during a chat with Sky Sports F1 if he had taken anything from his extensive stint at Red Bull to his new position, Wheatley reflected on delivering a “cultural philosophy”.

“You have to absorb yourself in the team, you have to immerse yourself in it,” he explained.

“You have to listen to what everyone has got to say, you have to try and work out why decisions have been made, why processes are the way they are, and you can very rarely just move a complete procedure from one team across to another – it just doesn't work.

“But what you can bring is a philosophy, you can bring a cultural philosophy as well. There's low-hanging fruit, there's been some of that to be had.

“It's a very young team and I think people forget that. A lot of people here only started in January or February so we're knitting together the team.

“We're on a journey, we're very much in the early part of that journey and we have to understand that we're starting from a humble beginning. I'm excited about it – we're making steps, we're gaining momentum, and of course this business is all about momentum.”

Entering into the second half of the season, Kick Sauber are in seventh place of the Teams' Championship. Nico Hulkenberg is currently an impressive P9 in the Drivers' Standings on 37 points, while rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto sits in P17 on a tally of 14.

	The moment has finally arrived: Kpop Demon Hunters has officially become Netflix's most popular film of all time.


	The animated musical produced by Sony Pictures Animation added another 25.4M views from August 18 to 24, bringing its total since its June 20 premiere to 236M views. It has now surpassed Red Notice to take the top spot on the Most Popular English Films list, as expected.


	What's even more impressive is that this doesn't seem to be even close to the end of the road for the title's performance. Last week marked the third consecutive week that the film has exhibited nearly 0% audience decline, after two straight intervals of 26M views.

					'KPop Demon Hunters' Sing-Along Version To Debut On Netflix		
			








	Thanks to the launch of KPop Demon Hunters The Sing-Along Event, the film is likely to see another big boost in viewing over the course of this week. Deadline understands that Netflix plans to combine the viewership for the sing-along and the original movie, even though they are separate titles on the streamer, so we expect some pretty huge numbers in the next report as audiences tune into this new version. The singalong was also released theatrically this weekend, delivering a huge win for Netflix as the film beat out Weapons for No. 1 at the box office with $19M.




			Watch on Deadline		







KPop Demon Hunters has 24 days left in its 91-day premiere window to keep racking up views and widening the distance between it and now-No. 2 Red Notice (which had 230M views in 91 days).


	Over on the TV side of things, the first episodes of Wednesday Season 2 took the top spot with 13.4M views. Season 1 also made an appearance at No. 4 with 4M views as audiences refreshed their memories and/or caught up before diving into Season 2. 

	











Wednesday is likely to stick around the charts for quite a while, as Part 2 of the second season is poised to launch on September 3. 


	In second place was the British political thriller Hostage, which generated 10.8M views. The series stars Queen Charlotte‘s Corey Mylchreest as the activist stepson of the president of France (Julie Delpy), who costars alongside Suranne Jones as the British prime minister whose husband has been kidnapped.


	Speaking of Mylchreest, he also had a presence on the film list with My Oxford Year‘s 5.9M views putting it at No. 4.


	As always, there were also some reality titles on last week's Top 10. Fit For TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser took No. 3 with 8.5M views, while America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys came in ninth place with 1.9M views.


	Elsewhere in film, Happy Gilmore 2 enjoyed a fifth week in the Top 10 at No. 6 with 4.5M views.

K-pop is a juggernaut..
This is like the girl version of the Spiderverse movies.
Beatifully animated with a fantastic story. It's not perfect, but it was a lot of fun, and the songs were catchy as hell.

“who could have seen this coming??”

	Swifties, rejoice — our girl is officially engaged! Earlier today, Taylor Swift announced on her Instagram account that she and longtime beau, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, are tying the knot.


	In a joint post, the two shared: “Your English teacher and gym teacher are getting married.” Now, if that isn't a real-life “Love Story,” we don't know what is. Within minutes, the slideshow racked up more than 6.3 million likes, with fans immediately zeroing in on one big question: what was Taylor wearing when Travis dropped to one knee?

The Forge has acquired North American rights to the drama that bowed at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


Kristen Stewart's directorial debut The Chronology of Water has been picked up for U.S. distribution with plans for an awards-qualifying December theatrical release.


	The Forge has acquired North American rights to the film based on Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir of the same name. An exact release date has yet to be announced. Still, according to today's announcement, the distributor plans to release the film theatrically in North America this December, followed by a wider release in early January.




	The film, which premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of this year's Cannes Film Festival, follows a once-hopeful Olympic swimmer as she loses her scholarship and battles addiction while discovering her own sexuality and love of literature. Stewart, The Hollywood Reporter's review reads, “appears to have found her voice, announcing the seriousness of her intentions not with auteurist self-importance but with unimpeachable commitment to honoring her subject's story.”

	WME Independent handled the deal on behalf of the filmmakers. Les Films du Losange is handling international sales and French distribution.


	Said Stewart in a statement, “After eight long years of gestation, I am overwhelmed by the privilege of having The Chronology of Water be released in theaters with the full support and ambition of like-minded artists like the partners we've found at The Forge. Films like ours should be birthed onto the screen and I am grateful we found a team as committed to supporting independent filmmakers as they are.”

Now this is a funny idea for a remake of one of our bitterest, darkest satires about the pains of marriage: What if we spent some serious time in the salad days of our central relationship? Such is the somewhat bold conceit of Jay Roach's “The Roses,” a reimagining (and truly so) of Warren Adler's novel “The War of the Roses” and, to a lesser extent, Danny DeVito's incredibly funny 1989 hit film of the same name. On paper, this may sound silly and strange — isn't the joy of “The War of the Roses,” uh, the war? — but Roach and stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman find such fun in the happy days that it nearly distracts from what's inevitable.

Armed with a script from Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”), Roach's film opens far from those happy days, with Theo Rose (Cumberbatch) and Ivy Rose (Colman) going head to head at a couple's counseling session that is actually at its best when Ivy is calling her husband the c-word. Ah, British humor! But while their therapist is horrified by the tension and name-calling before her, going so far as to announce that the Roses are beyond repair, the two can't help but giggle about the whole thing.

 










Zipping us back in time, we soon see how this all began: with a meet-cute for the ages, but one that also hints at what might tear these two apart in the coming years. Theo is an architect bummed about the state of his work, forced to celebrate the completion of a soulless apartment building at a glitzy lunch with his coworkers. When he sneaks off for a break, he ends up in the kitchen, right in front of a smiley chef Ivy, busy prepping a salmon carpaccio and dealing with her own professional worries. What if, they wonder within mere seconds of meeting each other, they just ran off to America together?

If you're willing to take the plunge on that particular (and peculiar) plot movement, you'll likely vibe with what's to come. Ten years later, Theo and Ivy's American gamble has paid way off. Happily ensconced in California's Mendocino County (the film actually shot on location in Devon in the southwest of England, so while the film's locales look absolutely stunning, they sure as hell don't look like Northern California; this is no disrespect to fertile NorCal, but that place does not have cliffs like these), Theo's career is booming, their spunky twins seem happy, and Ivy has turned her attention to cooking for fun.

And yet, little cracks have begun to appear. Theo is still holding out hope to one day build the family's dream house, Ivy's life seems mostly relegated to being a wife and mother, and it sure seems as if the couple have, well, discordant ideas about parenting. McNamara weaves these bits in well, and Cumberbatch and Colman — so naturally giddy around each other — slowly start to, if not come apart, at least poke at each other. 

 










When Theo opts to spend their house money on a seafood restaurant for Ivy, it's the first step toward their undoing. And when Theo's latest project — a massive museum dedicated to sea-faring life and shaped like a ship — literally collapses during a particularly bad storm (an event that immediately goes viral), ending his own professional dreams, it's just another nail in the coffin. While Adler's book and DeVito's movie imagined Mrs. Rose as a rising catering star, Roach's film turns her into a massive culinary brand, with Ivy's success propelling her toward the very top of the food world heap. One day she's making Big Ben-shaped cookies at home, the next, she's jet-setting with David Chang.

This does not sit well with Theo. While previous incarnations of the story provided the Roses with a pair of nearly-grown children, McNamara's script ages the kiddos down (Hattie and Roy, played by Delaney Quinn and Ollie Robinson as ten-year-olds, with Hala Finley and Wells Rappaport taking over when they turn 13), providing a new dimension to Theo and Ivy's problems. As she's off setting up new restaurants — aided by longtime employees, played by Sunita Mani and Ncuti Gatwa, none of them bothered by the fact that the chain is called “We Got Crabs” — newly-minted stay-at-home dad Theo is busy remaking the kids in his image. That means lots of physical activity, fewer sugary desserts.

 










Such are the seemingly small disagreements that start to chip away at their marriage. And while much of this might sound deadly serious, Roach's film is frequently very funny. Moments in which the Roses are nitpicking at each other — a bit involving some ill-advised donuts is great — stand up to bigger comedic setpieces that bond them together, such as a trip to a local gun club with their loopy American pals (Andy Samberg, Kate McKinnon, Zoë Chao, and Jamie Demetriou). But while these sequences are smart and amusing, they also continually sand away the most bitter bits of the original story at the film's heart.

Or, again, where is the war?

Oh, it's coming, but while the genuinely horrifying and also extremely funny dinner party that arguably tips everything over the edge ranks among some of the best comedic work of Roach, Cumberbatch, and Colman's careers, what follows feels at odds with everything that's happened before. That McNamara has written a truly new spin on Adler's novel is genuinely refreshing, but the lighter tone and greater reliance on actual romance between its leads makes what's to come all the harder to swallow.

DeVito's film wasn't afraid to get dark, deep, and mean from the jump, but in the last act of Roach's film, the attacks that Theo and Ivy launch against each other surprise, and not always in entertaining ways. It may sound silly to wonder if this take on “The Wars of the Roses” is too cruel, but that's precisely how it feels. Too cruel, too pointed, and way too out-there, at least in the world that Roach and McNamara have previously knit together. It's all fun and games, until someone gets hurt.

 










Searchlight Pictures will release “The Roses” in theaters on Friday, August 29.

This year's Cannes — specifically the Un Certain Regard sidebar — was home to directorial debuts from three major actors, including Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” and Kristen Stewart‘s “The Chronology of Water.” And though Stewart has been a Cannes mainstay for nearly a decade, the film was well-reviewed, and Stewart's star power is as strong as ever, even movies with that pedigree manage to sit on the shelf. We've asked distributors time and again to look alive.

Today, someone did, and Stewart's “The Chronology of Water” has been acquired for North American distribution by The Forge, an upstart distributor that last year handled the release of Mexico's Oscar submission “Sujo,” as well as films like “Black Dog” and “The Balconettes.” Stewart's film is by far the distributor's highest profile release (terms of the deal were not disclosed), and it's planning to give the film a robust awards campaign with a release in theaters this December. It will open limited for a qualifying run and expand in January.

“The Chronology of Water” is Stewart's adaptation of a memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch, a competitive swimmer who dealt with an abusive childhood, sexual experimentation, toxic relationships, and addiction, all before finding her voice as a creative writer. Anchored by a powerfully honest performance by Imogen Poots, the film is framed much like a visual poem, absent identifying time stamps or title cards and told in “a constellation of scattered quotes and half-invented memories,” as IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich described it out of Cannes. He praised the film and particularly Stewart's direction for being innately comfortable and gifted behind the camera, writing that “some movies are shot. This one was directed.”  

 










“There isn't a single millisecond of this movie that doesn't bristle with the raw energy of an artist who's found the permission she needed to put her whole being into every frame, messy and shattered as that might be,” the review reads. “And it's largely for that reason why ‘The Chronology of Water' works even when it doesn't: Because, on an almost subatomic level, Stewart communes with the liquid spirit of a woman who only became whole by allowing herself to dissolve into the smallest essences of her being — over and over again until it seemed impossible she might ever regain a recognizable shape.”

Stewart had been developing “The Chronology of Water” for eight years before it finally found funding from Ridley Scott's Scott Free production banner, and Stewart announced she would be directing it way back in 2022 before it finally was ready for Cannes this summer. At the time she called it “fiercely, ragingly female,” and at Cannes this year, the process didn't deter her from going back to the well again, saying that not only will she direct again, she's got several projects in the works. 

“Oh, man, it felt so good. I'm dying,” Stewart told Anne Thompson. “It's going to be a lot easier this time. I've always said that as long as I can make another movie after my first one, that I don't need to be precious or clever about it at all. It just needs to feel pure. I've earned the right to try one more time. I never want to make the same movie twice. So whatever comes out next is going to not be anything like this. I can't fucking wait.”

 










Alongside Poots in the film are Jim Belushi, Thora Birch, Charlie Carrick, Susannah Flood, Kim Gordon, and Tom Sturridge. Producers on “The Chronology of Water” include Charles Gillibert (CG Cinema International); Yulia Zayceva, Max Poklov, and Svetlana Punte (Forma Pro Films); Michael Pruss, and Rebecca Feuer (Scott Free); Stewart, Maggie McLean, and Dylan Meyer (Nevermind Pictures); and Andy Mingo in association with Scott Aharoni, Alihan Yalcindag, and Sinan Eczacibasi for Curious Gremlin; Christian Vesper for Fremantle; Yan Vizinberg, Abigail Honor and Chris Cooper for Lorem Ipsum Entertainment; Mélanie Biessy for Scala Films.

“Kristen [Stewart] hasn't just directed a film, she's carved out a world with unmistakable vision: one that pulses with pain, desire, and defiance,” said Mark Mathias Sayre, CEO of The Forge, in an official statement. “'The Chronology of Water' is unlike anything we've ever released: visceral, expansive, and anchored by a performance from Imogen Poots that wrecks and rebuilds you. The film is a major achievement on every level, and we're honored to bring it to North American audiences.”

“After eight long years of gestation, I am overwhelmed by the privilege of having ‘The Chronology of Water' be released in theaters with the full support and ambition of like-minded artists like the partners we've found at The Forge,” Stewart added in her own statement. “Films like ours should be birthed onto the screen and I am grateful we found a team as committed to supporting independent filmmakers as they are.”

 










The North American deal was brokered by Mark Mathias Sayre (CEO), Steven Michael Swadling (Partner), and Decker Sadowski (Head of Acquisitions) on behalf of The Forge, and WME Independent on behalf of the filmmakers. Les Films du Losange is handling international sales and French distribution.

	On July 14, officers with Los Angeles Police Department were called to conduct a welfare check at a home in Encino. Inside, they found two people dead — Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor for American Idol, and her husband, Thomas Deluca. 


	The pair had been shot and killed several days earlier, with authorities later determining that Kaye and Deluca sustained their fatal injuries on July 10. Not long after their bodies were discovered, police quickly identified, arrested, and charged a suspect, 22-year-old Raymond Boodarian, in the shocking killing that has rattled a neighborhood and a longtime reality TV tentpole. 


	Here's everything we know about the case so far.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Kaye spent more than a decade working as a music supervisor on American Idol. She joined the show in 2009 and is credited on nearly 300 episodes. After her death, a spokesperson for the show called Kaye “a cornerstone of the Idol family,” and was “truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.”

	











	The statement continued: “Robin will remain in our hearts forever as we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.”


	Former American Idol judge Randy Jackson called Kaye “a dear friend” and said she “consistently went the extra mile, meticulously ensuring songs were placed and cleared for the show. She was truly one of a kind. Forever loved and deeply appreciated.”


	Along with American Idol, Kaye worked as a music supervisor on several other major shows, including Miss Universe, Lip Sync Battle, The Dance Scene, and Crashed. 

	











	Deluca also worked in music, a guitarist and songwriter who spent many years plying his trade in Nashville. He co-wrote songs that were recorded by Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Jennifer Rush, Meredith Brooks, Molly Hatchett, and David Allen Coe. (The song he co-wrote for Coe, “Son of the South,” was later reworked by Kid Rock as ‘Son of Detroit.”) Deluca also played in a band called the Piggies and recorded a solo, Down to the Wire, which Epic released in 1986.

	Per People, Kaye and Deluca met at a concert in 1983, when Kaye was also in Nashville and working for Waylon Jennings. The couple later relocated to Los Angeles in the middle of the decade and married soon after. They moved into their house in Encino in 2023. 


	According to authorities, Kaye and Deluca had returned from the grocery store on July 10 when they confronted a stranger in their house. Police say the suspect, Boodarian, had entered through an unlocked door, and that the house's alarm system was off at that time; a previous LAPD statement said “there were no signs of forced entry or trouble.” During the confrontation that ensued, Boodarian allegedly shot Kaye and Deluca multiple times with a gun that belonged to the couple. 


	While Kaye and Deluca's bodies weren't discovered until the welfare check on July 14, it was later revealed that two 911 calls were made on the day of the killing — including one allegedly from Boodarian himself. The first call from a neighbor about a possible burglary came at around 4:10 p.m. and prompted LAPD officers to check the home and walk the perimeter, while a helicopter conducted a fly-over. It's believed Boodarian was inside the home at this time, though no suspicious activity was detected.


	The second call came around 4:44 p.m., with a search warrant affidavit stating that “the 911 caller identified himself as Raymond Boodarian and advised that someone broke into his office.” According to the affidavit, the caller also stated, “Please don't shoot me.”

	Despite the two 911 calls, and subsequent house checks, authorities did not immediately find Kaye and Deluca's bodies. “Officers arrived on scene and conducted a check of the surrounding area and attempted to visually check the residence through the security gate. They attempted entry at two access points but both were locked and secured,” LAPD Communications Director Jennifer Forkish previously said (via the Los Angeles Times). “The home was secured with surrounding walls. The Air Ship visually checked the location and advised there was no visible activity or evidence of break in. After taking additional steps to contact the persons reporting and residents at the location, officers cleared from the scene.”

	











	It wasn't until a neighbor called the police four days later to say they hadn't seen or heard from Kaye or Deluca that police finally entered the couple's home and found them dead in separate rooms. 


	Authorities quickly zeroed in on Boodarian as the suspect and they were able to track his location by pinging his cellphone. He was arrested and eventually charged with two counts of murder, as well as a burglary charge. 


	Boodarian was finally arraigned on Aug. 20, and showed up to court wearing a protective “suicide gown,” according to his public defender. Boodarian neither entered a plea, nor responded to questions asked by the judge. 


	“He does have severe mental health issues,” his lawyer, Nancy Kolocotronis, said. 


	The arraignment was eventually suspended. At the end of the hearing, Judge Martin L. Herscovitz ordered Boodarian back into custody without bail and set a Sept. 3 hearing in mental health court. He said any arraignment on Boodarian's murder charges would have to wait until “he's deemed mentally competent.”

	If convicted as charged, Boodarian faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. 


	“In a matter of moments, this couple was senselessly killed in their own home as they returned from the grocery store,” L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman previously said in a statement. “This tragic shooting has shaken a valley community and the notion that home should be our safe sanctuary.”

	Since his exit from the White House and spectacular fallout with Donald Trump, Elon Musk has been posting a lot less about far-right politics and conspiracy theories. Instead, the world's richest man has seemingly turned at least some of his scattered attention back to his many businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. His newly founded “America Party,” meant to challenge both Democrats and Republicans, remains inactive. All this no doubt comes as a relief to board members at those companies who worried that Washington drama and Musk's exploits as the head of the so-called Department of Government Security put his tech empire at unnecessary risk. 


	But Musk's return to full-time brand promotion has not been without its questionable moments. He is particularly committed to pushing xAI's chatbot Grok as a superior alternative to rivals such as OpenAI‘s ChatGPT, despite the product being perhaps best known for briefly identifying itself as “MechaHitler” while it spouted Nazi views. On Monday, xAI even went so far as suing Apple and OpenAI, with a filing that accused the corporations of an anticompetitive scheme to suppress Grok in the App Store while favoring ChatGPT. (Apple and OpenAI have entered into a partnership that allows the computer and smartphone giant to integrate the bot into its products.) In the meantime, Musk has been left to make the case himself that Grok is a most advanced model available. He is prone to ambiguous, sweeping, impressive-sounding statements about the technology, claiming that the current version, Grok 4, may “discover new technologies” by the end of 2025 (there have been no reports of such) and is “the smartest AI in the world” (the data tells a different story). 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When he isn't hyping the bot in those terms, however, he mostly touts how users can leverage Grok to create moving images of attractive women, dictating elements of their appearance including skin, eye, and hair color, as well as what clothes they wear and what sort of environments they inhabit. In recent weeks, Musk has been especially eager to show off “Ani” on his X account. One of several “companions” that you can interact with through Grok, she is a scantily clad female anime character who can undress and is designed to respond to flirtatious conversation with increasingly intimate responses. Now, Musk also frequently reposts similarly sexualized cartoon characters generated with Grok's text-to-video feature, “Imagine.” It's gotten to the point where many have openly wondered if he fetishizes these virtual women.

	Over the weekend, for example, Musk reposted an animation made by one of his reply guys of an evidently topless woman whose face, neck, and shoulders are bejeweled by blinking stars and swirling galaxies. He shared an animation from another paid blue-check X user who explained he had prompted Grok to show him a “stunning Colombian woman” with a “golden tan” and “flawless smooth complexion” in a revealing tribal-style leather getup, standing next to a large robotic dinosaur. He also marveled at a sort of music video for Simple Minds' “Don't You (Forget About Me)” made with Grok, which featured a series of shots of a dark-haired, anime-like character in different skintight spacesuits (and one bathing suit). “Wow,” Musk wrote. “And this is just Grok Imagine beta v0.1! Not even Imagine version 1.”


	The billionaire's affinity for titillating cartoon characters has not gone unnoticed on X. The comments on that music video included one critic replying: “Don't post AI soft porn for at least one day challenge.” Others made jokes about Musk using Grok as a masturbation aid, expressed their disappointment in what a supposedly innovative genius was spending his time on, and predicted that such content would have a negative effect on society. “This is just more gooner slop,” complained one detractor. (“Gooning” is internet slang that describes exaggerated and excessively long sessions of self-pleasuring.)


	In other recent posts, Musk urged followers to try the sometimes-pornographic companion Ani. Last week, he announced that new skimpy outfits had been added to her wardrobe and commented “Nice” when a user modeled her in one. He evidently crossed a line, though, when he posted an animation of Ani dancing in her underwear; even his right-wing fans were disgusted, telling him it was “time to stop” and that Ani looked like a “13 year old in lingerie.” Musk, likely observing the severe backlash, deleted the offending post. Yet he continued to annoy his supporters by engaging with Ani. When he replied to a video of the character in a short skirt and a see-through top with a “good morning” message and an emoji of a smiling face encircled by hearts, a fed-up X user wrote, “BRO STOP GOONING TO AI ANIME AND TAKE US TO MARS.”

	Musk's infatuation with Ani and similar anime pin-ups has led some fans to seek his attention by catering to his tastes. A Tesla owner for instance, tagged him in a post where a cartoon woman in a bikini holds a sign inquiring about a future update to their car's automated driver assistance system. “Smart, Elon will definitely see this,” theorized a Tesla influencer who shared a different question about the Cybertruck, presented in the same bikini-babe-with-a-sign format. “Let's use this format for all questions to Elon going forward,” they suggested. Musk eventually did acknowledge one of these images with his favorite emoji — the laugh-crying face. He also directly answered a SpaceX enthusiast who last week shared a clip of Ani in lingerie carrying a sign that asked when he expected a technical update to the company's Starship rocket. “Sunday,” Musk replied. 

	











	Will his ongoing emphasis on Grok's erotic capabilities turn it into the leading chatbot of its time, or just endear it to a limited demographic of lonely, like-minded men while alienating much of the public? Maybe that's a question for AI. But in the absence of more impressive output, Musk is more or less stuck trying impress people with digital smut. Don't be surprised if it gets raunchier still from here.

EXCLUSIVE: Gina Matthews has Dorothy in development at Prime Video, we've just learned.


	The series, which Matthews created and will produce under her Little Engine label, is a contemporary, music-infused YA retelling of Wizard of Oz based on L. Frank Baum's books using the Yellow Brick Road as a metaphor for the challenges and choices facing young adults today.


	Non-writing executive producers on the project include Gwen Stefani, Lucky Horseshoe's Blake Shelton and Lee Metzger and Little Engine's Grant Scharbo, as well as Patrick Moran.

	“I've been in love with The Wizard of Oz books since I was a child,” says Matthews. “The story reminds us of the qualities we need to get through hard times, and Dorothy is a symbol of strength who shows us that with a little kindness — and a lot of grit — we can not only achieve great things but also lift up those around us. I'm excited to bring that message to the world, now more than ever.”

	“I'm really excited to work with this creative team,” says Moran. “I'm such a fan of everyone involved and couldn't ask for a more exciting partnership as we reinvent this cherished IP.”


	Adds Scharbo, “We're thrilled to embark on this journey with Amazon and believe Dorothy will enchant a whole new generation of viewers.”


	“We're really excited about all the possibilities this show brings, and I'm so grateful that Gina shared the idea with me and Lee,” said Shelton. “I knew right away it was something Gwen would connect with. Her creativity and perspective are such a natural fit for this project.”

	











	“It's a creative and modern take on a classic, and being part of something that blends music, emotion, and the character of Dorothy is inspiring to me,” said Stefani.


	Three-time Grammy winner and multiplatinum performing artist Stefani, who has also been a long-running coach on NBC's The Voice, is repped by WME, Blended Strategy Group and Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk, LLP. She was an EP on the animated series Kuu Kuu Harajuku.


	Shelton is a nine-time Grammy nominee and platinum-selling country artist who has executive produced the Hallmark holiday movie franchise Time for … to Come Home for Christmas as well as USA's Barmageddon. He has also been a long-running coach on NBC's The Voice from its inception in 2011 through the 23red season in 2023. Shelton is repped by Starstruck Entertainment. Lucky Horseshoe Productions is repped by Verve. 


	Matthews has produced movies like 13 Going on 30 and Isn't It Romantic, and she created the WB series The Mountain as well as Popular.

Who really “owns” a movie? Back in the days of physical media, the answer was clear. If you bought a VHS/DVD/Blu-ray, it was yours! But in the age of streaming, the rules are less clear. Amazon invites you to “buy” movies digitally on its website, but what the megacorp really sells are movie licenses, which can be revoked if Amazon loses the rights to the movie. This insidious little distinction has gotten Amazon into legal trouble before, and has once again, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that a new class action lawsuit has been proposed against the company over the issue. 

Per the outlet, the proposed suit is bolstered by new California law that says a transaction can't be advertised as a “purchase” unless it offers unrestricted ownership of the product. That statute requires sellers to make it pretty clear to buyers that they're getting a limited license. The class action complaint argues that Amazon “does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good.” Wright Noel, a lawyer for consumers looking to sue the company, states in the filing that “[the] warning is buried at the very bottom of the screen, in font that is considerably smaller than the other text on the screen.” 

Amazon has not yet commented on the proposed suit, which was filed in Washington federal court on Friday. However, when faced with a similar suit in 2020, the company countered that “These Terms of Use expressly state that purchasers obtain only a limited license to view video content and that purchased content may become unavailable due to provider license restriction or other reasons.” With this new Cali law in effect, we'll see if the ol' “Terms of Use” excuse flies in 2025.

Apple Music is rolling out a new tool that allows you to import playlists from other streaming services. After beta-testing in Australia and New Zealand, the tool is now available in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico. The tool, announced by Apple and spotted by MacRumors, is accessed through a new menu in Music settings called Transfer Music from Other Music Services. From there, you can sign in to another streamer and select items to import. Apple's Support page has more detailed instructions, as well as an alternative method via your web browser.

Coincidentally, Apple is implementing the tool as Spotify deals with an exodus of indie-rock artists. Hotline TNT are the latest to ditch the service, noting in a statement that the company's values do not align with the band's and that “a cooler world is possible.” They follow Godspeed You! Black Emperor, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof, among others. While Spotify has long generated ill will for its unusually low royalty payouts and assorted other ethical concerns, the latest wave of departures was prompted by growing awareness of CEO Daniel Ek's venture capital fund Prima Materia. That company has heavily invested in the highly contentious defense company Helsing, which specializes in artificial intelligence–driven military technologies.

Bruce Willis‘ wife gave an update on the actor's health two years after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, saying he is in “really great health overall.” 


	Emma Heming Willis sat down to speak with Diane Sawyer about Willis' condition as part of a new special, Emma & Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey, which airs tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. ET and streams tomorrow on Hulu and Disney+. In a preview for the special, Heming Willis said she and the rest of their family have had to learn new ways to communicate with the Willis “It's just his brain that is failing him.” 


	“Bruce is still very mobile. Bruce is in really great health overall, you know,” Heming Willis said. “It's just his brain that is failing him … The language is going, and you know, we've learned to adapt. And we have a way of communicating with him, which is just a different, a different way.”


	In 2022, Willis' family revealed he was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease aphasia, a language disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate. Heming Willis told Sawyer that before his diagnosis, she noticed “he was just a little more quiet” in social situations, when typically he was “talkative and very engaged.”

	











	“When the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,” she said. “He felt a little removed, very cold. Not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate. To go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.”

	











	Nearly a year after his aphasia diagnosis, he received a second diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. According to the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) organization, “The progression of symptoms — in behavior, language, and/or movement — varies by individual, but FTD brings an inevitable decline in functioning.”

	Now, two years after his diagnosis, Heming Willis said that they experience “moments” of Willis' bubblier side of his personality coming through. “I mean, we still get those days. Not days but moments,” she said. “It's his laugh, right? He has such a hearty laugh. And, you know, sometimes you'll see that twinkle in his eye or that spark, and, you know, I just get, like, transported. And it's just hard because, as quickly as those moments appear, then it goes.”


	Heming Willis' book about caregiving for Bruce, The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope, and Yourself on the Caregiving Path, arrives on Sept. 9.

In this week's Legal Beat newsletter, a Purple Rain trademark battle, a last-minute deal for Missy Elliott, felony charges against Lil Nas X and much more.

	Bill Donahue



THE BIG STORY: The Prince estate is facing yet another legal battle – only this time not from his heirs, but from a co-star in his 1984 film Purple Rain.


	After the music legend died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016 without a written will, his affairs spent more than six years in probate court, as heirs, advisors and others battled over how the valuable estate would be managed in the future. Even after that case wrapped up, another battle erupted between allegedly “disgruntled” heirs and a pair of managers.

Lars Brandle 













	Now, the estate is facing a new fight over trademark law from the singer and actress Apollonia, a Prince protegee who rose to fame playing a character of the same name in Purple Rain and has since used the moniker for years in her own career.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In a lawsuit filed last week, Apollonia (Patty Kotero) said Prince himself never had an issue with her using the name, but that his estate is now trying to use legal means to “steal” the name “even though it has no legal right to do so.”


	For its part, the Prince estate said that it never meant to cause her any sorrow. In a post to social media, the estate responded that it had “never instructed her to cease using her adopted professional name” and merely wanted to “preserve Prince's assets and legacy” by cancelling Apollonia's own trademarks over a name that came from a Prince movie.


DEEP DIVE: After YNW Melly's double murder trial was postponed until January 2027 – roughly eight years from when he was first arrested – I dove deep into how we got here. Experts told me it was partly the unique factors of the case, including a mistrial and a long death penalty appeal, but that an eight-year wait for a verdict is less unusual than you might think: “Our system tolerates a great deal of punishment before trial and without trial.”

FELONY CHARGES – Lil Nas X was charged with four felonies over accusations that he attacked police officers and resisted arrest last week during a bizarre incident in which he was filmed wandering naked in Los Angeles. At an arraignment hearing, the “Old Town Road” rapper pleaded not guilty to three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting executive officer over the alleged incident – charges that could carry years in prison.


LAST-MINUTE DEAL – Missy Elliott reached a settlement to avoid a jury trial and end a long legal battle with Terry Williams, a music producer who claimed that he and Elliott collaborated on numerous songs in the 1990s but that she refused to credit him as a co-writer. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed in court docs, but Elliott's lawyer shared key details with Billboard.


SAMPLE SNAFU – Rauw Alejandro was hit with a lawsuit accusing him of sampling multiple tracks by reggaeton legend DJ Playero on his hit 2022 album Saturno without proper licenses. In a statement to Billboard, Alejandro said he “believed these songs were cleared properly by my previous label, but it seems the person who claimed the rights might not have actually controlled them.”


RADIO RATES – ASCAP and BMI both reached settlements with the Radio Music License Committee to resolve long-running lawsuits over the licensing rates paid by thousands of radio stations to songwriters and publishers. The details of BMI's deal, which it called a “historic” win for songwriters, were publicly filed in federal court; the terms of ASCAP's agreement were not revealed.


IDOL KILLINGS – Raymond Boodarian, the man accused of killing longtime American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband last month, appeared in court for his initial hearing on murder and burglary charges. But a Los Angeles judge suspended the prosecution after the accused killer was repeatedly unresponsive in court, instead ordering a mental health review to determine whether he's competent enough to face criminal charges.


DISMISSAL EXPLAINED – A federal judge issued a detailed ruling explaining why he sided with Sean “Diddy” Combs and dismissed a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers. The lengthy ruling said the case – claiming sexual harassment and groping during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show – was clearly filed years after the statutes of limitations had expired.


DIDDY THE DIRECTOR – Elsewhere in Diddy world, federal prosecutors urged a judge to reject the rapper's bid to overturn his criminal prostitution convictions ahead of sentencing, including his argument that “freak-offs” were just “amateur pornography” protected by free speech: “The defendant was anything but a producer of adult films entitled to First Amendment protection — rather, he was a voracious consumer of commercial sex.”


TYLER TRIAL DELAYED – A judge postponed a jury trial in a lawsuit accusing Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting a minor in the 1970s. Lawyers for plaintiff Julia Misley, who claims Tyler “groomed” and “manipulated” her as a teenager decades ago, sought the continuance over “unavoidable delays” in preparing for trial; Tyler's lawyers objected, saying he wanted his “day in court” rather than have the case “continue to drag on.”


MIAMI CLUB BULLIES? – Dance music company Insomniac Events filed a lawsuit against three Miami club operators that it claims are trying to “bully” their way into total control of two of the city's dance venues, including the city's famed Club Space and an upstart club called Factory Town.


YOUNG DOLPH ACQUITTAL – A man accused of organizing the hit that killed rapper Young Dolph in 2021 was found not guilty on first-degree murder and murder conspiracy charges over accusations that he hired two men to fatally shoot the rapper at a bakery in Memphis. One shooter was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison; the other is cooperating with prosecutors of a lenient punishment.


SUPERTRAMP DECISION – A federal appeals court ruled that former Supertramp lead singer Roger Hodgson needs to share royalties from the 1970s rock band's hit catalog with his fellow band members. “Plaintiffs ask that defendants continue to ‘Give A Little Bit,' the judge wrote. “Defendants believe that ‘From Now On,' they are no longer obligated to share royalties.”

Bleecker Street said Tuesday that it has acquired U.S. theatrical rights to Musk, the feature documentary about Elon Musk from Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney.


	The deal teams the distributor with HBO Documentary Films and Universal Pictures Content Group and will see Bleecker Street release the film ahead of its premiere on HBO Max.


	No release dates have been set yet for Musk, on which Gibney, who has tackled high-profile figures in his work like Julian Assange, Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and Jack Abramoff, turns his focus to one of the world's most influential figures in a story that is evolving in real time.

	











	“No biographical portrait, outside of obvious political figures, has centered on an individual so at the crossroads of our society as Elon Musk,” Kent Sanderson, CEO of Bleecker Street, said in a statement. “But there is also no filmmaker that I could possibly imagine bringing that story to audiences with unmatched clarity, audacity, and urgency more than Alex Gibney.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Bleecker execs Tyler DiNapoli and Myles Bender previously worked with Gibney on 2013's Assange doc We Steal Secrets. Gibney's other credits include the Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.


Musk is produced by Gibney, Jessie Deeter, and Erin Edeiken from Jigsaw Productions; Zhang Xin and Joey Marra from Closer Media; Nick Shumaker and Jessica Grimshaw from Anonymous Content; and Dana O'Keefe from Double Agent. Executive producers include New Regency's Yariv Milchan, and Natalie Lehmann; Richard Perello from Jigsaw; William Horberg from Closer Media; David Levine from Anonymous Content; as well as Sanderson and Miranda King for Bleecker Street.

	











	HBO Documentary Films previously pre-bought North American streaming and TV rights. Black Bear is handling international sales and made the overseas deal with UPCG.

Lil Nas X has returned to social media for the first time since he was arrested and charged with four felonies earlier this week. On Monday, the rapper pleaded not guilty after he was accused of charging at Los Angeles police officers while roaming the streets of Studio City in his underwear and a pair of cowboy boots in a disconcerted state over the weekend.


	“Your girl is gonna be okay, y'all,” the artist born Montero Lamar Hill said in an Instagram Story post. “Okay? She's gonna be alright. Shit.” Letting out a tired laugh, he continued: “That was fucking terrifying. That was terrifying. That was a terrifying last four days. But your girl is gonna be alright.”


	Hill was arrested after being found early last Friday morning, around 6 a.m. local time. In videos captured by spectators and shared with TMZ, he spoke incoherently to the person behind the camera. The footage showed him in a visibly disheveled state, and, in one clip, he was seen wearing an orange traffic cone on his head.

	











	Prior to his arrest, Hill shared a series of bizarre posts on Instagram, which sparked concern, though some predicted he could be amping up controversy ahead of a new music era. Last week, he shared unreleased music and mirror selfies, plus artwork and piles of miscellaneous objects in what appeared to be his home. The arrest quelled rumors that he was engaging in a marketing stunt.

	Police initially transported Hill to a nearby hospital for a possible overdose. He spent several hours there before being taken to jail, where he spent the weekend. According to the police, Hill “charged” at officers when they tried to confront him when they arrived on the scene. 

	











	A judge set Hill's bail for $75,000 and ordered him to attend four Narcotics Anonymous meetings a week or attend outpatient treatment. He was charged with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office confirmed to Rolling Stone.

Sony Pictures Classics has taken North American rights to Pedro Almodóvar‘s Bitter Christmas, continuing their long run with the Oscar winner. 


	The movie follows Elsa, an advertising director whose mother dies during a long December holiday. She works non-stop and, without realizing, doesn't give herself time to mourn her mother's absence. After a moment of crisis, Elsa decides to travel to the island of Lanzarote accompanied by her friend Patricia. The story of these characters run parallel to that of a screenwriter and film director, exploring how life and fiction are inseparably linked, sometimes painfully so.

	Sony Pictures Classics released Almodóvar's first English-language feature film last year, The Room Next Door, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival; the short film Strange Way of Life; and Oscar-nominated features Parallel Mothers and Pain and Glory.


Bitter Christmas stars Bárbara Lennie (Petra), Leonardo Sbaraglia (Pain and Glory), Aitana Sánchez-Gijón (Parallel Mothers), Victoria Luengo (The Room Next Door), Patrick Criado (Riot Police), Milena Smit (Parallel Mothers), Quim Gutiérrez (Darkblueamostblack) and Rossy de Palma (Parallel Mothers). Several of these actors have appeared in previous Almodóvar/Sony Pictures Classics collaborations, including Luengo in The Room Next Door; Sánchez-Gijón, Smit and de Palma in Parallel Mothers; Sbaraglia in Pain and Glory and Wild Tales; and Lennie in The Skin I Live In. 


	The deal was negotiated between Sony Pictures Classics and Almodóvar's production company, El Deseo, on behalf of the filmmaker.

Justin Bieber is giving his thirstiest fans exactly what they want.


	As shared in a Monday (Aug. 25) post on Instagram, the pop star recently took a moment in the gym to snap a couple of shirtless selfies, flexing his muscles in the mirror and showing off his tattoo-covered arms and torso. Beyond a white beanie and gold chain around his neck, the only items he wears in the pictures are a pair of gym shorts and Calvin Klein boxers that show at the waistband.


	In his caption, Bieber wrote, “thirstrap fa u hoes.”

	











	The posts come amid an active social media streak for the Biebs, who's been sharing glimpses into his life surrounding the release of his new album, Swag. Featuring the hit “Daisies,” the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Also on Instagram in recent days, Justin has posted praise for his wife, mogul Hailey Bieber — “Love this picture of you baby gurrllll,” he gushed on Monday (Aug. 25) of a photo from her Byrdie shoot — and shared snaps of his son, Jack Blues, who turned 1 earlier in August. (On the little boy's birthday, the Rhode founder wrote on her profile, “1 year of you my beautiful boy … you are joy personified.”)


	But for those who are specifically looking for more shirtless Bieber content, the singer also recently stripped down to his undies for a late-night swim in the music video for “First Place,” which arrived Aug. 13. “FORGIVE MY CHICKEN LEGS,” he joked of the visual when it dropped.


	See Bieber's selfies below.

HBO's untitled Rachel Sennott series now has a release date — and a title. The “Bottoms” and “Shiva Baby” star and co-writer will executive produce and lead the series “I Love LA,” which will air weekly on HBO and stream on HBO Max, kicking off this fall. 

The series will center around a group of friends navigating life and love in the city of angels, like so many before them. Sennott stars as Maia, with Jordan Firstman as Charlie, Josh Hutcherson as Dylan, Odessa A'zion as Tallulah, and True Whitaker as Alani.

“I Love LA” was announced in fall 2024 without a title, with Sennott, Barrie, Rodgers, and Scafaria already attached. Barrie and Rodgers worked with HBO for “Barry,” while “Hustlers” filmmaker Scafaria recently contributed to “Succession.”

The show's premise and studio connection drew immediate comparisons to Lena Dunham's “Girls,” which became a blueprint for millennial ennui during its 2012-2017 run. It could also find connective tissue with Issa Rae's “Insecure,” a more recent entry in the genre of navigating one's twenties on HBO, which found vibrant storytelling opportunities in the Los Angeles setting.

Sennott spoke with IndieWire in 2023 around the release of “Bottoms,” sharing her excitement for telling off-kilter and fiercely comedic stories from the female perspective. She noted an aversion to female characters who viewers can “tell were written by a man. ‘Oh, they love each and they're silly,' that type of thing,” she said. She cited “Scott Pilgrim,” “Friday Night Lights,” “Heathers,” and more as inspirations for the tonal mashup of “Bottoms,” but also as authentic stories which resonate with audiences to this day.

“I Love LA” debuts Sunday, November 2 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on HBO Max. New episodes will debut weekly until the finale on Sunday, December 21. Check out more images from the show below.

Netflix plans a robust Oscar push for its Cannes pick-up “Nouvelle Vague” (in theaters October 31, streaming November 14), Richard Linklater‘s love letter to Jean-Luc Godard's first film, “Breathless.” The 1960 movie, which cinematographer Raoul Coutard shot in single, silent takes on the streets of Paris, was a trailblazer in its use of natural light and disjunctive jump cuts.

Linklater's black-and-white 35mm movie is neither prequel, sequel, nor remake of Godard's film. It's not a documentary. The filmmaker simply recreates with a French cast and crew what it was like to make the film. “There's not a shot in this movie that wouldn't fit in '59 to '62 or '63,” he told IndieWire.

Netflix plans to push the film for Best Picture, Director (Linklater has been nominated once, for “Boyhood”), Actor (Aubry Dullin as Belmondo), Supporting Actor (Guillaume Marbeck as Godard), Supporting Actress (Zoey Deutch as Jean Seberg) and Screenplay (Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson, and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script could be adapted or original). There's plenty of precedent for foreign-language movies gaining enough support for nominations in those categories, from Neon‘s “Parasite,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and “The Worst Person in the World” to Netflix's own “Emilia Pérez,” which scored 13 nominations.

 










But the best chance for “Nouvelle Vague” to win a category is Best International Feature and Netflix fervently hopes that “Nouvelle Vague” will be on France's mid-September shortlist. North American distributors represented on that list make presentations to the 11-person Oscar selection committee as to why its film is the strongest contender. Then, they wait.

France sometimes picks well (Ladj Ly's 2020 “Les Misérables” marks its last nomination); often, it does not (the committee failed to nominate Best Original Screenplay Oscar-winner “Anatomy of a Fall”). The country has not enjoyed a Best International Feature win since “Indochine” in 1993.

Because “Nouvelle Vague” is produced by leading French distributors Laurent Pétin and Michèle Pétin with a French cast and crew, the fact that Texan Linklater directed the film starring American Zoey Deutch is not a dealbreaker. France has previously submitted non-French filmmakers, including Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's French film “Elle,” starring Isabelle Huppert and Italian Filippo Neneghetti's “Two of Us.” Japan submitted German auteur Wim Wenders' “Perfect Days,” which was nominated in 2024.

But “Nouvelle Vague” has one serious competitor. Neon acquired French resident Jafar Panahi's Iranian drama “It Was Just an Accident” two days before it won the 2025 Palme d'Or; its French producers are Philippe Martin and David Thion, whose “Anatomy of a Fall” won the 2024 Palme d'Or (and five Oscar nominations). 

 










Neon is a veteran of the Oscar submission fray, arguing unsuccessfully for “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (no shortlist) and “Titane” (no nomination) but landing a selection for Palme d'Or winner “Parasite,” which won the International Feature category along with Best Picture and Director.

“Nouvelle Vague” is an enjoyable romp that celebrates an icon of French cinema but did not win any Cannes prizes. “It Was Just an Accident” is serious agit-prop that continues to court controversy with its criticism of Iran's corruption. Which way will France go?

Campaigning on behalf of Neon is not only indefatigable CEO Tom Quinn but also new distribution chief and veteran Oscar whisperer Ryan Werner. And Netflix executive Lisa Taback and her awards team would like to grab a victory in this category after last year's “Emilia Pérez” imbroglio.

As for France, its film community is just rooting for an Oscar win after 32 years without.

Green Day are going all out for New Years Rev, the upcoming comedy film from Lee Kirk that follows three best friends who embark on a road trip to open for the band at a New Year's Eve concert, not realizing the opportunity was a prank. The movie is scheduled to premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 12, but Green Day teased that “Toronto is just the beginning.”


New Years Rev stars Mason Thames, Kylr Coffman, and Ryan Foust as the Analog Dogs, the garage rockers who are under the impression that they've landed their dream gig. The band drew inspiration from the years Green Day spent living in a tour van, driving from show to show and sleeping in precarious places just for the thrill of playing music with their best friends. More than a dozen of the veteran band's songs appear in the movie.

A post shared by Green Day (@greenday)


	“Forcing their way to drop off a demo to their beloved idols in hopes of earning some recognition, they instead get an extremely rare opportunity — to open up for Green Day at their New Year's concert,” a synopsis for the film reads. “Or so they think. Unbeknownst to them, the opener gig is actually a prank played on them by one of their brothers. Nevertheless, naively optimistic, the young trio set off on the road from Kansas to California, with wide-eyed dreams of being on stage alongside their heroes.”

	Green Day produced the film alongside Tim Perell, Jolene, Stella Bulochnikov, Robin Rapino, Ryan Kroft, and Anna Keegan. Kirk helmed the screenplay in addition to directing. “It's packed with all of your favorite Green Day songs, loaded with mischief, and lots of familiar faces,” Green Day shared on Instagram, noting cast members McKenna Grace, Fred Armisen, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Bobby Lee, and more. “This film is our love letter to all of our favorite road trip movies, ‘90s nostalgia, and chasing it all no matter how ridiculous it gets.”

	











	In February, producers sent out a casting call for a scene that features a pop-up rock show. ​​​”Punks, emo, hardcore, alternative and rocker young adults, aged 18-30, are needed for the feature film NEW YEARS REV, featuring the band Green Day,” the call read. The opportunity promised to provide “live music, skateboarding, and a rowdy good time.”

The Oscar winner also executive produces the limited series that is based on a 'Cosmopolitan' story.

Jessica Chastain is better known as “the Savant” in her new Apple TV+ series, which released a trailer on Tuesday.


The Savant follows Chastain as an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups in an effort to stop domestic extremists before they act. The gripping first look (below) shows Chastain as mom by day, terrorist-chaser by night. “Snipers, bombings, ambushes… we're on the verge of serious violence,” she says when confiding to a colleague about the man she's hunting, played by Pablo Schreiber. 




	“Do you think if you engage with terrible things, you're daring even worse things to happen?” she asks.

	The limited eight-episode series is also executive produced by Chastain. The series launches with the first two episodes on Friday, Sept. 26, followed by a weekly release.


	The cast also includes Nnamdi Asomugha, Cole Doman, Jordana Spiro, Trinity Lee Shirley, Toussaint Francois Battiste and guest star Schreiber. 


The Savant has been in the works for more than two years. Andrea Stanley, who wrote the Cosmopolitan feature on which the series is based, is a consultant on the series. Her August 2019 piece, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” detailed a woman known as “The Savant,” an investigator whose job is to take down the country's most violent men before they can carry out large-scale attacks.

	











	Hailing from Fifth Season, The Savant is also executive produced by Kelly Carmichael for Chastain's Freckle Films, Alan Poul, showrunner Melissa James Gibson and Matthew Heineman, along with David Levine and Garrett Kemble for Anonymous Content.

"The film continues to grow in scope as the story evolves," say HBO Films and Bleecker Street about the expansive documentary project. (Musk, meanwhile, has decried it as "a hit piece.")


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Oscar-winning documentarian Alex Gibney‘s long-awaited Elon Musk documentary has locked down a deal for a run in U.S. cinemas ahead of its streaming launch on HBO Max.  


	HBO Documentary Films and Universal Pictures have teamed up with indie distributor Bleecker Street to bring the film — which is titled, simply, Musk — to theaters. The partners describe the film as “an incisive look behind the legend of Elon Musk, the world's most heralded ‘inventor-entrepreneur' who has enormous influence on the world in which we all live.”

	Word leaked that Gibney was working on a Musk documentary as far back as March 2023, but the film has yet to receive a release date. HBO and its partners hint that Musk's ongoing prominence in the global news cycle has made it challenging for the documentary team to determine when and how to conclude their biographical saga.


	“The film continues to grow in scope as the story evolves,” the companies said in a joint statement, adding that they “will work to unveil a rich portrait, even as history unfolds in real-time.”


	Back in March 2023, when one of Musk's fans tweeted about the news of the planned doc, Musk posted a response saying, “It's a hit piece.” 


	Gibney then posted a direct reply, saying, “How would you know?” 

	











	Famed for his thorough dissection of hot-button figures and scandals, Gibney made his breakthrough in 2005 with Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and went on to win the best documentary Oscar in 2007 for Taxi to the Dark Side, his documentary about the U.S. military's use of extrajudicial detention and torture in the Middle East. Other standouts include Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (winner of three Emmys), We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks, and Citizen K, about Vladimir Putin and Russian billionaire exile Mikhail Khodorkovsky.


	Says Kent Sanderson, CEO of Bleecker Street: “No biographical portrait, outside of obvious political figures, has centered on an individual so at the crossroads of our society as Elon Musk. But there is also no filmmaker that I could possibly imagine bringing that story to audiences with unmatched clarity, audacity, and urgency more than Alex Gibney.”


	The new theatrical distribution deal was negotiated by Bleecker Street's Miranda King and Avy Eschenasy, with Nick Shumaker of Anonymous Content on behalf of the filmmakers. HBO Documentary Films previously pre-bought North American streaming and TV rights and Black Bear is handling international sales for the film, and did the deal with Universal Pictures Content Group.


Musk is produced by Gibney, Jessie Deeter, and Erin Edeiken from Jigsaw Productions; Zhang Xin and Joey Marra from Closer Media; Nick Shumaker and Jessica Grimshaw from Anonymous Content; and Dana O'Keefe from Double Agent. Executive producers include New Regency's Yariv Milchan, and Natalie Lehmann; Richard Perello from Jigsaw; William Horberg from Closer Media; David Levine from Anonymous Content; as well as Kent Sanderson and Miranda King for Bleecker Street. Bleecker's CEO, Kent Sanderson, and key creative, Bleecker executives Tyler DiNapoli and Myles Bender, previously worked with Gibney on We Steal Secrets, the acclaimed 2013 documentary about Julian Assange released by Focus Features and Universal Pictures International.

The buzz is already out: Searchlight Pictures is really high on Bradley Cooper‘s “Is This Thing On?,” the New York Film Festival closing night title that seems likely to be a prime awards season contender. After just a few assorted first look images, the film‘s first full-length trailer gives a better look at the spirit and tone of the film, Cooper's third directorial outing. 

The movie stars Will Arnett, who also co-wrote the film, as a New York City stand-up comedian having a midlife crisis after a split from his wife, played by Laura Dern. The film is loosely based on the experience of British comedian John Bishop and is framed as a love letter to the Big Apple, and was shot all around the city by Cooper's cinematographer on “A Star Is Born” and “Maestro,” Matthew Libatique, who's returning as DP. As he said on “The Pat McAfee Show,” Cooper will also be making his debut as camera operator on the film, however.

“I'll operate the camera, which I'm very excited about because we did some stuff. We went down to Chinatown and it's been amazing,” Cooper said. He also acknowledged he “joined the union” in order to be able to be camera operator, likely the International Cinematographer's Guild IATSE Local 600 for camera operators.

According to the New York Film Festival's official description: “In a pair of galvanizing, deeply honest performances, Will Arnett and Laura Dern play Alex and Tess Novak, whose marriage has reached an impasse. With amicable sorrow, the couple — parents of two young boys — mutually agree to split up. Yet in director Bradley Cooper's keenly observed comic drama, their separation leads to unpredictable midlife self-reckonings, most dramatically in Alex's wild career pivot to become a confessional stand-up comedian in New York City's West Village, where he finds new direction and camaraderie.

“This seemingly outlandish scenario — in a script by Cooper, Arnett, and Mark Chappell inspired by the true story of British comedian John Bishop — is never played for easy laughs, while Cooper uses his penchant for naturalism to give the actors space to find their complicated centers. In his beautifully lived-in third feature following ‘A Star Is Born' and ‘Maestro' (NYFF61), Cooper confirms his dexterity for representing the complexities of human relationships, constructing a film that is both lacerating and sweet-souled, funny and tender.”

After its NYFF premiere, Searchlight will release the film in select theaters on Friday, December 19. Watch the trailer below.

Chloé Zhao was the toast of the 2020-2021 very long, deep-COVID-era Oscar season with the sweeping dominance of “Nomadland” at every ceremony up through the Oscars. The “Songs My Brother Taught Me” and “The Rider” director — known for her vérité-like, immersive portraits of marginalized groups, told in their own environments — then pivoted to tentpole franchise filmmaker with the release of Marvel's “Eternals.” The film received mixed reviews, and was still up against a depressed COVID box-office rebound anyway, but still carried her signature naturalistic stamp where possible.

 










Enter her next feature film “Hamnet,” a period historical drama starring Jessie Buckley as Agnes Shakespeare and Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare himself. Based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel, the film puts a fictional, what-might-have-been spin on their devastating romance and the grief they faced over the death of their 11-year-old son. Working with cinematographer Łukasz Żal (“The Zone of Interest”) and composer Max Richter (“The Leftovers”), Zhao also has the sort of powerful producers on board that come with a venerated record of their own: Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg.

But after the project was initially brought to Zhao, development continued (even without mentioning “Hamnet” itself) at the 2022 Telluride Film Festival, where both Buckley, for Sarah Polley's “Women Talking,” and Mescal, for “Aftersun,” were roaming the Colorado mountain town. Zhao found actors she wanted to work with, and then took a crack at opening O'Farrell's book. (Vanity Fair has the first scoop on the film's production.)

“Hamnet,” which shot in Wales last year with period favorites Joe Alwyn and Emily Watson also in the cast, is said to be a major tearjerker by audiences who've seen it. Since the Toronto Film Festival has billed the film as a Canadian premiere, and it's not playing Venice, so we can assume it'll be at Telluride this weekend. Buckley meanwhile features in another fall festival premiere: Charlie Kaufman's short “How to Shoot a Ghost” at Venice, her second film with the Oscar winner after “I'm Thinking of Ending Things.”

After its festival run, “Hamnet” opens in select theaters November 27 before debuting nationwide December 12 from Focus Features, timed for awards season. More on the film in IndieWire's fall festival preview here.

	Charlie Ergen's EchoStar saw its stock head skyward after unveiling plans to sell spectrum licenses to AT&T for $23 billion, a move that will shore up its finances and, it hopes, resolve an inquiry by the FCC.


	Shares surged 80% to $54, an all-time high.


	The agency led by Brendar Carr, which needs to approve the deal, is currently pursuing an inquiry around EchoStar's spectrum use.


	The operations of EchoStar's other businesses, including DISH TV, Sling and Hughes, will not be impacted by the transaction, the company said.

	Specifically, the deal calls for a sale of EchoStar's 3.45 GHz and 600 MHz spectrum licenses — a total of 50 MHz of nationwide spectrum —  to the telecom giant. In addition, the two companies amended their network services agreement to create a hybrid mobile network operator relationship.

	“EchoStar and Boost Mobile have met all of the FCC's network buildout milestones. However, this spectrum sale to AT&T and hybrid MNO agreement are critical steps toward resolving the FCC's spectrum utilization concerns,” Ergen said. 


	Ergen's Dish Network acquired Boost Mobile in 2020 as a government-imposed remedy — as Boost parent T-Mobile merged with Sprint — to create a fourth national wireless carrier. 


	EchoStar has struggled financially and has been challenged in growing the service, prompting FCC concerns around the company's build-out obligations. Elon Musk has weighed in, saying the FCC should let his SpaceX use the spectrum if EchoStar wasn't.

	











	The license sale to AT&T will enable rapid deployment of the purchased spectrum to U.S. consumers across the country, as AT&T has the option to lease the spectrum pending the close, EchoStar said.


	“This transaction puts our business on a solid financial path, further facilitating EchoStar's long-term success, and enhancing our ability to innovate and compete as a hybrid network operator. The proceeds of this transaction will be used for, among other things, retiring certain debt obligations and funding EchoStar's continued operations and growth initiatives,” added Hamid Akhavan, CEO and president, EchoStar. “We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities for our remaining spectrum portfolio in partnership with the U.S. government and wireless industry participants.”

The doc, 'Searching For Stars Hollow,' is in celebration of the beloved dramedy's 25th anniversary this October.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Gilmore Girls this October, a new documentary, Searching For Stars Hollow, is in the works with stars Kelly Bishop, Jared Padalecki and Chad Michael Murray, among others.


Searching For Stars Hollow, from Ink On Paper Studios, is set to examine “the beloved show's role in American cultural history,” per a press release, as well as include never-before-seen interviews with castmembers and behind-the-scenes stories from crewmembers, writers and directors.




	In addition to Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Padalecki (Dean Forester) and Murray (Tristin Dugray), the doc will also feature interviews with Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Sally Struthers (Babette Dell), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Rose Abdoo (Gypsy), Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz Danes), Matt Jones (Morgan), Grant Lee Phillips (the town troubadour), director Jamie Babbit, writer and producer Stan Zimmerman, casting directors Jami Rudofsky and Mara Casey, and Kevin T Porter, host of the Gilmore Guys podcast.

Gilmore Girls, which ran for seven seasons, from 2000-07, centered around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), and her teen daughter, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Melissa McCarthy, Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and the late Edward Herrmann also starred in the Amy Sherman-Palladino-created dramedy.

	











	Meghna Balakumar and Kevin Konrad Hanna are directing the documentary, with Adam F. Goldberg executive producing and Jim Demonakos producing.


	“The interviews that we've already conducted with the cast have been a delight,” Balakumar said in a statement. “We've shot more than 100 hours of footage and have already unearthed stories, commentary, critiques, and more. And we're continuing to shoot more interviews in the coming months to present the most complete, full and truly new story of the show's impact and legacy that is only possible at this historical moment.”


	Demonakos added, “Searching For Stars Hollow will reveal how Gilmore Girls came to life, why it continues to resonate across generations, and how its unique blend of humor, heart and pop culture shaped a devoted worldwide fan community with an in-depth look at its creation and the connections it continues to foster. This documentary is for fans of the show but also for anyone with an interest in cultural history and how it affects individual lives.”


	A release date for Searching For Stars Hollow has yet to be announced, but fans can follow the doc's pre-launch page for the Kickstarter here.

The Adelaide-based politician branded Snoop a "slur merchant" and questioned why the AFL would pay millions to acquire international talent "rather than backing Aussie talent".

Snoop Dogg should be sent to the doghouse, and nowhere near the 2025 AFL Grand Final.


	That's the substance of a message from Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who used a Senate address to call for Snoop's removal from Australian rules football's showpiece event, where he has been booked for the pre-game entertainment. 


	The “Drop It Like It's Hot” rapper was confirmed last month as the headline act for the pre-game entertainment at the AFL final, to be staged Sept. 27 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

	Snoop, whose booking follows in the footsteps of Ed Sheeran, Sting, The Killers, Lionel Richie, Tom Jones, Meat Loaf and homegrown rockers Powderfinger, was presented by the AFL as a coup, with CEO Andrew Dillon describing the hip-hop veteran as “a pioneer, a performer, and a true entertainer” who would help deliver “an unforgettable celebration of footy.”

	Hanson-Young, however, isn't hot on the idea.

	The Adelaide-based politician used the platform of her speech — and a post from her Instagram account — to brand Snoop a “slur merchant” and questioned why the Australian Football League would pay millions to acquire international talent “rather than backing Aussie talent”.


	“The AFL has decided, rather than putting on an Australian artist, they're gonna pay $2 million to play at the Grand Final,” remarked Hanson-Young, a vocal supporter of the nation's music community.


	“The AFL is a cultural institution,” she remarked. And cultural institutions should back Australia's musicians and creative arts community, she continued.

	











	Speaking in the Senate, Hanson-Young called out the “irony” of Snoop getting the red carpet treatment, while Adelaide Crows forward Izak Rankine received a four-week suspension for making a homophobic slur on the pitch.


	“The irony is not lost on many of us that while Izak Rankine gets dumped, Snoop Dogg gets $2 million to play his misogynistic, homophobic music on our turf,” Hanson-Young continued. While not focusing on any specific lyrics from Snoop's hundreds of songs, her comments closely follow Snoop's remarks in a podcast, in which he expressed discomfort at explaining a same-sex relationship depicted in an animated movie to his grandson.


	At a time when Australian artists are struggling to be seen and heard, proof of which can be seen on the weekly ARIA Charts, the Senator called out the AFL for missing an opportunity to support locals. “We need investment in Australian and Aussie talent. We need investment in our music industry, and we need to say that if it's an Aussie game, it's an Aussie artist playing,” she declared.


	And to the AFL, “have the guts to rethink this decision.”


	It's not the first time Snoop has caught the ire of foreign decision-makers. In 2006, the rapper was involved in a fracas at London's Heathrow Airport, during which seven police officers received minor injuries. On that occasion, Snoop and five other men were arrested on charges of violent disorder and starting a brawl, and spent the night in jail. The artist was subsequently banned from the country for four years.


	As his U.K. ban was lifted in 2010, Snoop found himself on the outside in the Netherlands, where authorities had him removed from the lineup of a free concert, Parkpop festival, when the mayor and law enforcement officials asked its organizers could secure a performer of more “open and friendly character.” Earlier, in 2001, Snoop raised eyebrows when he presented “Doggystyle,” a feature-length adult video featuring his own music.

	











	AFL CEO Andrew Dillon has defended the decision to book Snoop Dogg, noting the league hadn't scrutinized all his lyrics and reiterated that the entertainment spot at the final would be a family-friendly spectacle.


	“It is also important to remember that we engaged Snoop Dogg in 2025 as the person he is today,” Dillon said. “He has spoken publicly about his past, he has changed, and today he is a grandfather, philanthropist, he helps rehabilitate youth and is a global entertainer who has performed at both the Super Bowl and the Olympic Closing Ceremony.”


	Snoop has an Australian connection. In 2021, he struck an exclusive, five-year touring deal with TEG MJR, the U.K.-based promotion arm of Australian live entertainment, ticketing and tech giant TEG.

Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman gave a rare look into his family life when he celebrated his daughter Jordan Ashley Aikman's birthday. He is also a father to her younger sister, Alexa Marie Aikman.

A post shared by troy (@troyaikman)

On August 24, Aikman shared a beautiful photo on Instagram of himself and Jordan wearing white. He has his arm around her, and they are smiling for the camera. In the caption, he got emotional as he reflected on all the brilliant qualities his daughter has.

“A golden birthday for my golden girl,” he wrote. “From the day you were born, you've embraced every challenge and adventure as an opportunity to grow. You've done it all with independence, courage, and strength. You're smart and beautiful, but it's your kind and caring heart that inspires and uplifts everyone who knows you.“

Aikman ended his message with an emotional comment on what fatherhood means to him. “Being your dad is one of life's greatest blessings. Happy 24th birthday Jordan,” he concluded.

Friends and fans have reacted to the post with sweet messages. “Awww Happy Birthday @jordanaikmann You are such a light inside and out. Stay Golden!” a comment reads. “Happy birthday to your baby girl and God bless your family,” another person shared.

“Looks so much like her Dad. Happy B-Day!” a third comment reads. It is true, there is a definite resemblance between father and daughter.

Jordan also responded, writing, “Aweee thank you Dad – I love you!!!”

A post shared by troy (@troyaikman)

Although Aikman does not always post on social media about his kids, he has reflected on fatherhood in an Instagram post in honor of Father's Day on June 16, 2024. 

He shared two throwback photos, one of himself and his girls, and another of Jordan and Alexa embracing. They are happy photos and give a glimpse into the special bond that this former NFL star shares with his kids. “Happy Father's Day to the daddy's and their little girls (& boys),” he wrote in the caption.

Fans praised Aikman in the comments and complimented him on being a great dad. “Great pic for the perfect father. Loved watching you play, Troy. One of the best to ever do it,” a comment reads. “Turned into beautiful young ladies! Good job @troyaikman,” another fan shared.

Aikman's daughters are close in age, and just four weeks earlier, on July 30, he celebrated Alexa's birthday with an Instagram post. This time, Aikman also posted a photo of himself and his beautiful daughter wearing white. They are posing in the same way, with his arm around her. In the caption, he shared his thoughts.

“Happy 23rd birthday to my baby girl. An amazing young woman — kind, smart, funny, strong and beautiful,” he wrote. “Love being your dad and watching you chase down life with so much heart. Proud is an understatement. I love you Ally.”

The singer/songwriter directly thanked the pop superstar in her announcement.

	Welcome to the Music Industry (Taylor's Version). On Monday (Aug. 25), Rachel Platten announced that she's taking a page out of Taylor Swift‘s book by re-recording some of her biggest hits — including 2015's Billboard Hot 100 smash “Fight Song” — in an effort to reclaim her voice, just like the pop superstar did.


	Sharing her new project's black-and-white cover art with the title Fight Song (Rachel's Version), the New York native revealed in her caption that she will release a collection of new takes on a handful of her older songs on Sept. 26. The LP will also feature some live recordings, plus a “surprise from the vault” — much like Swift's Taylor's Version releases, each of which included previously unreleased “Vault” songs that had been scrapped from their respective albums' original tracklists.

	“As we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Fight Song, I had no idea when I wrote these songs in moments of vulnerability that they would go on to change my life,” Platten wrote in her caption. “For a decade, they've lived out in the world, carrying their own weight. They've been parts of your moments of strength, doubt, and connection.”




	“I've gone back to some of my originals, not to change them, but to reclaim them,” she continued. “This is about more than just new versions of old songs; the new Rachel's Versions are infused with the voice I have now, the wisdom I've gained, and the undeniable pride of owning my own masters. I'm grateful to @TaylorSwift for bringing this conversation to light and empowering artists to take back control over their work, their stories, and their futures.”


	Released in 2015 via Columbia Records, “Fight Song” spent months climbing the charts before peaking at No. 6 on the Hot 100 that August. One person who was definitely a fan of the track just so happened to be Swift, who brought Platten out onstage with her to sing it for thousands of fans at a 1989 World Tour show in Philadelphia more than a decade ago.


	“Fight Song” has since become one of the world's best-known anthems for perseverance in the face of hardship, serving as Hillary Clinton's campaign song the year after it was released. It would find a home in 2016 on Platten's album Wildfire, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200.   


	And while Platten is just starting out on her journey to take back ownership of her life's work, Swift recently reached the culmination of hers. In a move that wrapped up six-plus years of oftentimes tense negotiations between the 14-time Grammy winner, Scooter Braun and Shamrock Capital — during which time she re-recorded four of her first six albums, bringing discussions about artist rights and fair recording contracts into the general public's consciousness — Swift was finally able to purchase the rights to her back catalog earlier this year.


	“To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” Swift wrote in a letter on her website announcing the deal in May. “I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans. Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen.”

	Is Cardi B the drama? Even she isn't sure — including when it comes to her tensions with other female rappers in the music industry.


	While speaking to Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1 in an interview posted Monday (Aug. 25), the Bronx native opened up about why she thinks people are always pulling her into feuds online and in person, a phenomenon that inspired the title of her upcoming sophomore album, Am I the Drama? After years of reflection, Cardi has concluded that she simply has a natural quality that elicits strong reactions from other people. 


	“It's like, ‘Damn, does drama chase me? Or am I the drama?'” she told Lowe. “I just really think I was born with an anointed light. Sometimes the light is great, but it also disturbs people's peace. It draws people to me, and it's not always going to be good. That light might bother people … maybe it's too bright, it's too loud. It's always been like this to me.”

	











	That gravitational relationship between herself and drama has carried over from her high-school days into her professional life, the Grammy winner says. “Even in the industry, there is a lot of different female rappers, but for some reason, it's something about me that these b—hes can't stand,” she explained on Apple Music 1. “They can't f–k with me. Some b—hes, I feel like they're on this class right now, they're sophomores, and I'm a senior. And it's like, you want to f–k with the senior so bad. You think you're here with the senior. You're not even a junior. You need to worry about them other sophomores before you start worrying about the f–king senior.”

	“It's something about [me] that it's like, they can't even focus on them,” Cardi added. “They got to focus on me. And they always got to focus on throwing me shots and throwing me slings … and I'm sick of it. It's like, f–k you, f–k everybody.”


	Though the hip-hop titan didn't name names, it's no secret that she's found herself in the middle of numerous public spats over the years. In addition to her widely publicized conflict with fellow rap queen Nicki Minaj, Cardi has also traded barbs on social media with artists such as JT of City Girls, Akbar V and Bia.


	But while fans will have to wait a few more weeks to hear whether Cardi addresses any of her feuds on Am I the Drama?, which drops Sept. 19, she did recently release a single from the LP titled “Imaginary Playerz.” The track samples Jay-Z's 1997 song “Imaginary Players,” and on Apple Music 1, Cardi spoke about having the mogul approve her use of his work on her album.


	“When it was time to submit it to get approved, I was a little scared,” she revealed. “I was a little shaky. ‘Wait a minute, Jay-Z got to approve it.' I mean, I always knew that he got to approve it, but it was like, how about if he don't approve it? How about if he f–king likes it? And he did like it. And it's so crazy, the text message of him approving it, it was at 4:44 p.m.”

Pierce Brosnan is showing once again that true elegance never fades. At 72, the former James Bond star turned heads at the London premiere of “The Thursday Murder Club”, looking effortlessly sophisticated with his silver hair and timeless charm.

Brosnan's striking appearance once again reminded fans why he remains a Hollywood icon. 

At the premiere, his gentlemanly charm and timeless fashion sense stole the spotlight.

While the film was a highlight, it was Brosnan's family appearance that stole the spotlight. The actor proudly posed with his son Dylan, 28, and his granddaughter Isabella, 26. 

London fans witnessed a rare glimpse of the Brosnan family, radiating elegance together on the red carpet (as shared by enews).

Isabella is the daughter of Brosnan's late daughter Charlotte, who died in 2013 from ovarian cancer. Charlotte was the biological daughter of Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's first wife, whom he married in 1977. Brosnan adopted Charlotte after her biological father's death.

Beyond his career, Brosnan is proud of his large family. He has five children in total, three from his first marriage and two with his wife, journalist Keely Shaye Smith, whom he wed in 2001.

Their sons Dylan and Paris completed the family, and today the actor is also a grandfather of four: Isabella and Lucas, children of Charlotte, and Sean's children Jaxxon and Marley May.

From the red carpet to family milestones, Brosnan continues to shine not only as an actor but as a devoted father and grandfather, proving that elegance truly runs in the family.

The highly anticipated Netflix film, directed by Chris Columbus, is based on Richard Osman's best-selling book. It tells the story of four retirement home residents who solve murder cases for fun until a death hits close to home. Brosnan stars alongside an impressive cast, including Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie.

Speaking at the film's New York premiere earlier this month, Brosnan praised his co-star Mirren. “I love working with Helen… She is captivating in every sense of the word, as a woman and as an actress. Having seen her work from afar for so many years, and then to be in the brilliance of her creativity as an actor is spellbinding,” he said, talking to People magazine.

Other stars of the film, including Tom Ellis and Richard E. Grant, joined director Chris Columbus and author Richard Osman at the press event in Leicester Square. The movie is adapted from Osman's best-selling murder mystery novel of the same name.

True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto and season one star Matthew McConaughey have set a place for their latest attempt at a creative reunion: Netflix. In a new series made by Skydance Sports, Pizzolatto's words will return to McConaughey's mouth in a series known cryptically as “The Brothers Project.” That's not to be confused with McConaughey's other “Brothers Project,” which, as Hollywood Reporter notes, is an Apple TV+ comedy starring True Detective all-stars McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Instead, this “Brothers Project” refers to a presumed sports show in which McConaughey is the brother of Yellowstone star Cole Hauser.

“The Brothers Project,” which desperately needs a real name, is the farthest one of these Pizzolatto X McConaughey reunions has gotten. In 2020, as McConaughey's monologues were driving the Lincoln brand to new heights, he and Pizzolatto were announced as working on a show called Redeemer. About a year later, Pizzolatto negotiated an “early exit” from the show, and like Dora Lange, Redeemer was never heard from again.

Earlier this year, while taking a break from cyberbullying True Detective: Night Country, Pizzolatto and McCounaghey were announced to be working on a Mike Hammer movie, written by the former and starring the latter. Is that still happening? It's hard to say, but “The Brothers Project” has a secret weapon that other PizzoConaughey collaborations lacked: another reunion. Yellowstone favorite Cole Hauser is also attached, making “The Brothers Project” a Dazed And Confused reunion for McConaughey and Hauser. With Hauser in place, we'll probably be seeing “The Brothers Project” before Mike drops the hammer. In the meantime, Pizzolatto's first feature, Easy's Waltz, is expected out later this fall.

A suit challenges Prime Video telling people they can "buy" a movie when they're purchasing a license to watch it for a period of time. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	A little known fact about movie and TV show “purchases” online: What's being bought isn't actually ownership of the title but rather a limited-time license for viewing access. Consider the $4.99 director's cut of Alien on Amazon Prime Video. Cheap, right? But if the tech giant loses the rights to that version, the movie can be replaced with a different cut, like the one for theaters. And if Amazon loses the rights to the film altogether, it'll completely disappear from the viewer's library.


	So should Amazon be able to say a consumer is “buying” that movie? Some people don't think so, and they've turned to court.

	On Friday, a proposed class action was filed in Washington federal court against Amazon over a “bait and switch” in which the company allegedly misleads consumers into believing they've purchased content when they're only getting a license to watch, which can be revoked at any time.


	The issue came to the forefront at the California legislature in 2023 when gamers discovered that their access to The Crew would be cut off once Ubisoft shut down servers for the game. After, the “Stop Killing Games” movement was born to stop publishers from destroying titles consumers had already bought.


	Lisa Reingold, who filed the lawsuit, says she bought Bella and the Bulldogs — Volume 4 on Amazon in May for $20.79 but soon lost access to the title. It's not an uncommon occurrence, similarly affecting consumers across digital stores, like those hosted by Apple and Google. If you bought Downton Abbey through Amazon as the five seasons came out from 2010 to 2015, you'd no longer have them by 2024.

	











	The way in which digital transactions are structured, the lack of transparency around them and the streaming landscape is partly why physical media is kind-of-sort-of cool again. DVDs offer the ability, now and forever, to bypass the complicated web of licenses that leave fans unable to access their favorite titles. 


	The lawsuit accuses Amazon, which didn't respond to a request for comment, of misrepresenting the nature of movie and TV transactions during the purchase process. On its website and platform, the company tells consumers they can “buy” a movie. But hidden in a footnote on the confirmation page is fine print that says, “You receive a license to the video and you agree to our terms,” the complaint says.


	The issue is already before a court. In a 2020 lawsuit alleging unfair competition and false advertising over the practice, Amazon maintained that its use of the word “buy” for digital content isn't deceptive because consumers understand their purchases are subject to licenses. Quoting Webster's Dictionary, it said that the term means “rights to the use or services of payment” rather than perpetual ownership and that its disclosures properly warn people that they may lose access. The court ultimately rebuffed Amazon's bid to dismiss the lawsuit outside of a claim alleging a violation of Washington's unjust enrichment law.


	Recent legislative changes may make the lawsuit even more viable. Earlier this year, a California law went into effect barring the advertisement of a transaction as a “purchase” unless it offers unrestricted ownership of the product. Under the statute, sellers must obtain acknowledgement that buyers are aware they're actually buying a limited license, in this case movies or TV shows, that can be revoked.

	











	Amazon “does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good,” writes Wright Noel, a lawyer for consumers looking to sue the company, in the complaint. “The warning is buried at the very bottom of the screen, in font that is considerably smaller than the other text on the screen


	The lawsuit claims violations of California unfair competition, false advertising and consumer legal remedies laws. It seeks unspecified damages, including disgorgement of profits and punitive damages for allegedly intentionally malicious conduct.

The fellow country stars divorced in 2020 after less than a year of marriage.


													By
												

	Jessica Nicholson



	Since her divorce from fellow country music artist Michael Ray in 2020, Carly Pearce has been outspoken about the split and the fallout from it — most prominently on her 2021 EP 29 and its follow-up album 29: Written in Stone.


	Songs like “What He Didn't Do” and “Diamondback” delved into the emotional tatters of the split. In a new interview on Bunnie Xo's Dumb Blonde podcast, Pearce notes that the things she wrote about on the 29 projects were pulled from real life.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The former couple initially met in 2018 and married in 2019, which Pearce described as all happening too fast. “I thought he was so cute. I'd heard he's the nicest guy in the world,” Pearce recalls. “I invited him to my [Billboard Country Airplay] No. 1 party for ‘Every Little Thing.' Looking back on it, it was a hot and heavy lust. It wasn't love. It was just passionate.”


	She added, “I got married to go the distance. When I married him it was for the right reasons. I think when you travel like this, I thought I was doing the right thing to get married till I was 29. But we didn't have real conversations and we didn't really know about each other. We were kind of living this life that wasn't really reality. I think we didn't really know each other. I knew the night I got married that I shouldn't have. I think the best thing that ever happened to me was COVID, because it allowed me to deal with that in private. I think that I probably would have stayed in it longer if I could have avoided it, and not had to… I was embarrassed when it happened…and was heartbroken.”

	











	Pearce filed for divorce less than a year after their wedding. “It wasn't what I signed up for,” she said, reflecting on the brief marriage. “It just wasn't the marriage that I know I deserved. I knew that very quickly. We were only married for eight months. Plenty happened to where it was very clear to me this was not, this just wasn't a marriage.”


	Asked if there was infidelity within the marriage, Pearce responded that her 2022 Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hit “What He Didn't Do” “wasn't just written out of thin air. … It wasn't good.”


	But Pearce also stressed that she's ultimately thankful for the lessons learned from the marriage. “Thank you, because you taught me how strong I am. You put me through things that have made me better now. And I don't wish him evil. I don't wish anything on him. I'm so glad that I'm not in that anymore,” she said.


	When Bunnie Xo asked about a possible “Jolene” in the situation — referencing the title mistress from  Dolly Parton's 1973 country classic — without naming any names, Pearce simply said, “Let's just say I'm not a fan of her. I'm not a fan of him. I could've done so much more than I did.”


	Pearce also noted how she had hoped for direct answers in the marriage.


	“It's tough to think that… just leave me instead. I shut my mouth for so long, because I felt like I had to. And I'm not here to blow anybody up. I don't care anymore. When you are faced with somebody that was a really dark season for you, and then they go and blow it up on the Internet, like…also, you go, ‘I don't know if he told her we were divorced.' I don't know. All I know is … that was not a fun situation for me. i think what's harder is at the end of it, you want somebody … who is gonna look you in the eye and say, ‘Yeah, I did this.' … But I never got any of that. I had to piece together a lot of things after the fact. But they were facts.”

	











	A few months after the news of the divorce was made public, fans began speculating that Ray was dating Tyler Reese Tritt (daughter of country singer Travis Tritt), after photos surfaced of the two together.


	During the Opry 100 celebration earlier this year, which was televised from the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Pearce and Tritt made headlines when Pearce performed “Jolene” during the television special. When some online commenters noticed that the cameras didn't pan to show Tyler Reese Tritt until after Pearce's performance, Pearce herself commented, saying, “Aw don't you worry, I looked right at her.”


	Last year, Pearce followed up her 29 projects with Hummingbird, featuring the Chris Stapleton collaboration “We Don't Fight Anymore” and “Truck on Fire.” “We Don't Fight Anymore” was nominated for a Grammy Award (Pearce, along with Ashley McBryde, previously won a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for “Never Wanted to Be That Girl”). “We Don't Fight Anymore” was also nominated for musical event of the year at the CMA Awards.


	In 2023, Ray released the single “Spirits and Demons,” featuring Meghan Patrick, and released the EP Dive Bars & Broken Hearts.

It appears the most magical place on earth has gotten even more otherworldly. Recently, visitors at Disney World's Epcot saw more than just a fireworks show. Instead, parkgoers claim to have spotted a UFO hovering over the Disney theme park. However, others argue there is a much simpler explanation.

The NY Post shares details about the visitor who claims to have spotted the UFO over the Disney theme park. Morgan Huelsman, digital director of "The Bobby Bones Show", and her boyfriend were enjoying their time in the park. However as they were waiting for the nightly firework show Huelsman saw a "sudden bright light overhead." Given that they were waiting for a firework show, that may seem unsurprisingly; yet this display of light had nothing to do with Epcot's nightly entertainment. Rather than immediatley jumping to conclusions, Huelsman decided to put on her thinking hat.

She scanned the interent, thinking she may find some breaking news about drones or satellites in the nearby area. Although her intentions were well thought out, her search came up short. Therefore, she had no other choice but to believe that the bright light was non other than a UFO. She decided to share the video online, to gather the public's opnion on the mystery flying object. The video clearly depitcted a small, birght light overing over the Disney theme park. Although it appeared stationary for a short while during the video, eventaully it zoomed around and then blipped away.

Despite Huelsman being convinced she saw a UFO at the Disney theme park, the internet had other potential theories. One viewer shared that a rocket launch had taken place near Cape Canaveral earlier in the week. The NY Post shares that "SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World." Another individual argued that the light looke like a police helicopter more than a UFO.

This is not the first time someone has claimed to see a UFO in the Sunshine State. In fact, it comes only behind California for the most number of reported sightings. Its proximity to NASA launch sites definitley plays a role in this. So far, Disney is yet to comment on this unidentified flying object.

Perhaps Desmond Filby – to use the name he was given at birth – always had a Mr Hyde lurking beneath the Jekyll-like persona he presented to the world.

If so, he hid it well, at least from most of the locals.

Those who remember him before he became Dezi Bird Freeman, the conspiracy theorist and alleged police killer, recall a reserved man who was unfailingly polite when he came into town to pick up his post.

With two children and a charming wife who taught music and worked shifts at the local supermarket, he seemed to fit neatly into small-town Australia: an unremarkable man living an unremarkable life amid the trout streams and mountains of Victoria's high country.

His alter-ego, however, was anything but. Desmond Filby the landscape photographer was the kind of man who helped his children with their prep and doted on his wife. Dezi Freeman the “sovereign citizen”, by contrast, was a paranoid conspiracy theorist who allegedly shot dead two police officers, wounded a third, and then, it is presumed, dragged his family into the bush as hostages.

When Mr Freeman became a crank, and what turned him from a crank into a suspected killer, remain unknown and perhaps always will. Yet, as in so many recent cases in Australia and beyond, the coronavirus pandemic seems to have played a decisive role in tipping him over the edge.

His conspiratorial streak predates Covid. In 2019, he tried to place a magistrate under citizen's arrest during a dispute over public access to a nearby national park, an act that suggested at least a passing flirtation with the “sovereign citizenship” ideology, which casts representatives of the state as enemies of the people.

But it was Covid that transformed him into a full-fledged adherent of a movement whose violent fringes are causing growing concern across the English-speaking world.

“He went from being just a pretty ordinary country bloke, a normal dude you'd see at the local footy club all the time, to quite a strange bloke,” the Sydney Morning Herald quoted a local as saying. “He fell down a bit of a rabbit hole and sort of disappeared and went off radar.”

It began, acquaintances say, with his refusal to wear face coverings in shops and a rejection of lockdowns and vaccinations. It culminated in 2021, when Mr Freeman took a leading role in an attempted private prosecution of Victoria's premier, Daniel Andrews, for treason.

Arrested outside the courthouse — where a magistrate later ruled that Mr Andrews' lockdown policies did not, in fact, amount to treason — Mr Freeman could be heard denouncing the police officers taking him away as “scumbags” and “criminal filth”.

Mr Freeman, who is 56, appears to have developed an abiding hatred of the police, with whom he had had repeated run-ins over a string of parking and driving offences. During a hearing last year to appeal the suspension of his driving licence, he told a court that “even the sight of a cop or a cop car [was] like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier”.

Such outlandish language is common in sovereign citizen circles. Its adherents may not exactly see themselves as above the law, but they certainly believe they are exempt from it.

The movement, a particular phenomenon of developed English-speaking countries rooted in common law, rests on a misinterpretation of jurisprudence: the supposed right of individuals to declare themselves independent or “sovereign” of the state.

It is not new. It first gained traction in the United States in the Seventies and later in Canada under the “Freeman of the Land” movement, a name that may even have inspired Freeman's own.

Adherents, often drawn from far-Right or fundamentalist Christian backgrounds, have long resorted to violence. Terry Nichols, the co-conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people in 1995, was a self-confessed sovereign citizen.

The ideology's violent side has grown in Australia in recent years, however.

In 2022, three self-proclaimed sovereign citizens, Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train, ambushed and killed two police officers and a neighbour at their remote property near Wieambilla in Queensland before being shot dead themselves.

All three subscribed to extremist Christian beliefs that appeared to intensify over Covid, when Nathaniel and Stacey Train lost their jobs at a local school for refusing to be vaccinated.

As in Mr Freeman's case, there was little in Nathaniel Train's background to suggest he might turn killer. He was not just a teacher but the school's headmaster.

Like the Trains, Mr Freeman was expecting a visit from the police, in his case over a sexual abuse investigation for which he had already been questioned. So erratic had his behaviour become that his wife, now missing, confided her fears to a neighbour just days before the attack.

Whether it could have been prevented is a question for another day. What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that the sovereign citizen movement — as inchoate as it is — poses a growing threat to police officers and public servants in Australia and beyond, as Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, acknowledged after the shootings.

“This ideology of not seeing themselves being subject to our laws and our society… is of real concern,” he said. “This threat is very real and we need to be very vigilant about it.”

Despite many attempts at looking, no further signals have been found.

A new study has re-examined the famous "Wow!" signal, finding that it likely has an extraterrestrial origin after all, and may have been even more intense than previously believed.

On August 15, 1977, at the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University, a narrowband radio signal was received. A few days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman reviewed the data and noticed the signal sequence, which lasted for a full 72 seconds. In the margin next to the printout, he simply wrote "Wow!", and thus the puzzling signal had a name that would stick for the next 43 years at least.

The signal has, so far, defied explanation, and that's not for a lack of trying. Researchers argued the case for it being a comet passing through the area Big Ear was listening to, only for that to be completely refuted about two days later by the team that detected the Wow! signal in the first place, as a comet would have produced a diffuse signal given the large area they cover, rather than the abruptly cut-off signal that was received.

The signal has been a source of speculation in the "aliens are out there" community, and not without reason. No other signal like it has been detected before or since. It was in a range of frequencies close to the hydrogen line, which is relatively free from background noise, making it a good range to pick were we to try and communicate with other civilizations ourselves. On top of that, the team themselves believed it to be a good candidate for extraterrestrial life.

    

 "The 'Wow!' signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin," Ohio State University Radio Observatory director John Kraus wrote in a letter to Carl Sagan in 1994, "but little more can be said until it returns for further study."

     

Since then, the signal has been the subject of many studies, but it has never returned. In a new attempt to narrow down what it might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data which had previously been unpublished, producing two not as yet peer-reviewed papers on the topic.

First up, the team found that the signal was very unlikely to have been the result of interference in the telescope itself, or of terrestrial origin. The team found strong statistical evidence that the signal was not the result of radio frequency interference (RFI).

"If this RFI is persistent, it would take approximately six millennia of uninterrupted observations to achieve a signal analogous to the Wow! Signal from random RFI occurrences," the team explains in paper II.

Looking at other possible sources, including satellites, the team found this to be unlikely as well. Most satellites of the time were not in the area of the sky identified by the team, orbiting on different planes. While the team suggested that satellites which have slowly come out of orbit could be a source, or a Soviet satellite occupying this orbit, they believe this is unlikely too. This is because they would spend only a few fractions of a second in front of the telescope, rather than the 72 seconds necessary to replicate the Wow! signal.

"A continuous signal from an orbiting satellite will need to be at an orbit beyond the Moon to reproduce the pattern," they added.

So, what is it? While the team don't yet have an answer, they have made a lot of progress, for instance finding that the signal was much more powerful than had previously been predicted at 250 Janskys, four times larger than had previously been estimated.

“Our results don't solve the mystery of the Wow! Signal,” lead author Professor Abel Méndez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, explained in a statement. “But they give us the clearest picture yet of what it was and where it came from. This new precision allows us to target future observations more effectively than ever before.”

The main clue identified by the team from the "Aricebo Wow" project were two similar signals in 1977 and 1978 (dubbed Wow2 and Wow3) which showed similar characteristics to the original "Wow!" signal, though far less intense. The team believes that the original team studying the Wow! signal were intrigued by these signals as well, looking at their own notes.

"It is clear that the Ohio SETI team were interested in these signals, as evidenced by their circling. We believe that they recognized these signals as compact cold Hi clouds, after corroborating their appearance in multiple scans," the team write in paper II. "We searched for the coordinates of these signals in the HI4PI survey and confirmed their association with compact Hi clouds."

For the team, this suggests that the Wow! signal could have a common origin in these cold clouds of hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM). In paper I from the Aricebo Wow project, they go further and suggest a possible cause of the signal.

"We postulate that the Wow! Signal was a superradiance event that produced a maser-like flare from a small cold Hi cloud," the team writes in their study. 

"We observed from the Arecibo Observatory narrowband signals (∆ν ≤ 10 kHz) similar to the Wow! Signal near the hydrogen line, though significantly weaker. These signals are attributed to small cold Hi cloud regions within the galactic ISM. We propose that the Wow! Signal was caused by the abrupt brightening of the hydrogen line of these clouds triggered by an intense radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater," they add.

Though this is an intriguing possibility – and magnetars are often suspected for producing weird signals – the team cannot rule out other potential causes in the cosmos. The team hopes that the work could help better inform the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

"Our study did not conclude that the Wow! Signal constituted evidence of a signal emanating from an extraterrestrial civilization. However, null results are instrumental in refining future technosignature searches," the team concludes. "NASA and other agencies remain committed to their search for biosignatures within the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets."

The project will continue to search archives of this and other observatories for other unexplained signals and transients, as well as digitizing and archiving data from the Big Ear project. More work will be done on attempting to analyze the Wow! signal, and hopefully explain its cause.

“This study doesn't close the case,” Méndez added. “It reopens it, but now with a much sharper map in hand.”

The studies are posted to preprint server arXiv and have not yet been peer reviewed:

The heiress to one of Canada's wealthiest families is suing her former best friend — who “lost everything” and is now an Uber driver, representing herself in court — after a doomed crypto investment allegedly fueled by a pair of psychics' advice cost them $80 million.

Taylor Thomson, the 66-year-old middle child of the billionaire Thomson family, and Ashley Richardson, a 47-year-old once-affluent California mom, were the best of friends who enjoyed living it up in Los Angeles after first meeting at a 2009 house party in Malibu.

The rosy relationship, however, collapsed in 2022 when their psychic advisers pointed them to invest in a crypto token that crashed within a year.

Thomson accused her friend of making hundreds of thousands of risky trades behind her back and only using her for her wealth, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

Richardson denied the allegations and blamed the billionaire — who she claimed once hit on her — for destroying their friendship and leaving her struggling to make ends meet.

“Because of you I have lost everything, and you decided to sue the person who had nothing left to lose,” Richardson said in one of her last messages to Thomson. “I loved you more than anything.”

In their more than 12 years as close friends, Richardson was one of Thomson's biggest supporters, even going as far as helping the heiress relocate her beloved chickens from Bel Air to Hollywood, according to messages between the two women.

Friends claimed that Thomson, whose family ranks as the third richest clan in the world, had trouble trusting people and could be aggressive when she believed anyone was after her money, the WSJ reported.

She even hired convicted Hollywood private investigator, Anthony Pellicano, to spy on a former nanny whom she suspected of colluding with her daughter's father during a heated custody battle, according to court documents.

“I want you to do whatever you can to get information on Pamela,” Thomson told Pellicano, according to his 2008 wiretapping trial. “Just get it. I'm not going to ask questions.”

Despite Thomson's alleged vindictive nature, Richardson told the WSJ she supported her and would try to protect her from these so-called “Takers,” who were after the heiress's fortune.

Richardson, however, was given that very label following the friends' failed crypto venture in 2021 and again after the latest allegations.

“After spending years living a lavish lifestyle on Ms. Thomson's dime, Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson — which we know because Ms. Richardson has threatened multiple times she will do just that,” a spokesperson for Thomson told The Post in a statement.

Following the pandemic, Richardson found herself engrossed in the words of celebrity psychic Michelle Whitedove, who recommended that her followers invest in the upcoming Persistence crypto coin.

Richardson brought up the token to Thomson, who grew interested and sought advice from her own psychic, Robert Sabella, an astrologer she regularly consulted with, according to the women's messages.

“Taylor trusts her own instincts and would use Robert as a sounding board,” Thomson's spokesman told the WSJ now of their interactions, “but by no means would she make substantial life decisions based on his suggestions.”

After getting the confirmation from Sabella, the two women began investing heavily in Persistence. Richardson put most of her savings into the coin while Thomson poured in more than $40 million.

Richardson claimed that Thomson became overzealous in the spending and reined in the heiress when she suggested spending another $60 million on the token following early success.

Thomson also drafted a letter to her brothers, who own the largest stake in the Thomson fortune, accusing them of restricting her ability to invest the family wealth in the crypto market, the outlet reported.

During their trading spree, Richardson said she spent as much as 20 hours a day researching cryptocurrencies and executing trades for Thomson — at times holding as much as $140 million in her friend's investment, according to the WSJ.

When the 2022 crypto market crash happened, Richardson lost everything, while Thomson felt betrayed and hired lawyers and consultants to get her money back.

Thomson sued both Richardson and Persistence in 2023, seeking at least $25 million for their alleged role in roping her into the investment as a targeted “whale.”

Thomson and Persistence settled for an undisclosed amount of money, while Richardson is fighting her former friend in court.

Bradley Dizik, president of the Guidepost consulting firm's tech practice, told the WSJ that in the first half of 2022, Richardson conducted 450,000 trades with the billionaire's funds, many of which she didn't authorize and were extremely risky.

He alleges that Thomson lost more than $80 million in crypto investments associated with Richardson's involvement.

Richardson denies the allegations, claiming she never made a trade without Thomson's approval and always did her best to “minimize losses.”

She also claims Thomson hired a former FBI agent who works at Guidepost to visit her family.

Richardson said she now makes money as an Uber driver, has applied for food stamps, and is struggling to take care of her dog and the legal work brought on by Persistence's fall and Thomson's lawsuit.

Richardson has since filed a countersuit with the help of ChatGPT for $10 million, alleging that Thomson has defamed her with her accusations.

Thomson's spokesperson denied all the allegations, including one where Richardson claimed that the heiress made a pass at her during a 2019 trip to British Columbia.

One of their final interactions via text saw Richardson, who reportedly fell off the wagon after two years of sobriety, call Thomson a “rich motherf—ing sociopathic b—,” according to the WSJ.

“Send your f—ing goons to take my life. Please, you have destroyed me,” she added.

“The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11,” Andrew Dabb, who served as showrunner for Supernatural‘s final seasons, admitted.

When we spoke with him for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue to find out what the original series finale looked like (before the ending had to be changed due to COVID delays and protocols), we also asked about his thoughts on a revival (here) and what Wayward Sisters could have been (here). We also had to ask about any scrapped storylines from over the years.

“It would've been really nice to see Sam [Jared Padalecki] and Dean [Jensen Ackles] age into more mentorship roles,” Dabb said before sharing, “One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'”

They never went there because, according to the showrunner, “It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.”

If they had done it, it would've been in a finale to set up the following season with, “Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show,” Dabb said. “It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

He also revealed that there had been talks about bringing back the Antichrist (Gattlin Griffith) “in a different way,” but that didn't pan out, nor did his hope to do more internationally. “This is a show about America and Americana. It doesn't really fit the show,” he explained. “We tried it with the British Men of Letters, maybe not our most successful if we're just being honest, but I would've liked to go even further.”

“The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11,” Andrew Dabb, who served as showrunner for Supernatural‘s final seasons, admitted.

When we spoke with him for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue to find out what the original series finale looked like (before the ending had to be changed due to COVID delays and protocols), we also asked about his thoughts on a revival (here) and what Wayward Sisters could have been (here). We also had to ask about any scrapped storylines from over the years.

“It would've been really nice to see Sam [Jared Padalecki] and Dean [Jensen Ackles] age into more mentorship roles,” Dabb said before sharing, “One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'”

They never went there because, according to the showrunner, “It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.”

If they had done it, it would've been in a finale to set up the following season with, “Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show,” Dabb said. “It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

He also revealed that there had been talks about bringing back the Antichrist (Gattlin Griffith) “in a different way,” but that didn't pan out, nor did his hope to do more internationally. “This is a show about America and Americana.

Far from being isolated outsiders, conspiracy theorists enjoy thriving communities that recruit and organise activism.

 

Psychologists have long considered how a tendency towards irrational thinking or particular personality traits might predict peoples' interest in conspiracies. Yet these individual factors do not explain the group processes through which conspiracy theorists are extending their influence and impact.

Over five years, we sought out and got to know people on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists. And the results of our new study show that a sense of community activism is attracting people to these ideas.

Indeed, contrary to the stereotype of isolated keyboard warriors who have gone down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theorists are becoming organised, recruiting supporters, picketing vaccination centres and vandalising telecommunication and traffic infrastructures.

Our research examined the growing interest in conspiracy theories and how associated activism emerges. Immersive research with conspiracy theorists is rare. But revealing our status as researchers actually allowed us to build relationships with people, who shared insights into what motivates their involvement.

In particular, we spoke to people about conspiracy theories concerning 5G technology, COVID-19, 15-minute cities and low-traffic neighbourhoods. We also took part in online discussions and travelled the UK to sit in on public meetings and conferences. Ultimately, our insights revealed how people tend to follow a pathway from initial interest, to community engagement and potentially activism.

Belief in conspiracy theories is often initiated by traumatic life events. Job losses or the death of a loved one can trigger anger and suspicion towards public services, authority figures, and experts. This is especially so if people feel that the tragic or destructive events that affected them could have been averted. And these emotions can motivate a search for answers.

When conspiracy theories claim to explain painful personal circumstances or wider fears over COVID-19, or climate change, people can experience “awakenings”. These are moments of insight during which people come to believe that the causes of their problems lie with secretive groups which control society.

One person we spoke to described conspiracy theories as enabling him to “access the way the world really works… as if a light was switched on in my head and I could see things clearly”.

People rarely experience their awakening in isolation. In online group chats, people discover others with similar problems. In public meetings, beliefs in various theories are boosted by interactions where people discuss their suspicions over who is to blame for particular issues. In the process, these groups feed off their common emotions, building an atmosphere of energy and excitement.

The loss of traditional meeting places such as pubs and high streets, along with high levels of loneliness, may be driving people to look for new forms of connection and meaning.

The people we spoke to expressed surprise at the social connections they had found through these communities. As one participant put it, “there's a lot of support out there for people who are doing their own research… there is always someone wanting to hear more, building on the work of others, giving each other support. There's a real buzz in this community.”

Conspiracy theories don't merely offer alternative explanations for events, they are resources for communities that provide identity, purpose and belonging. These benefits may explain why it is so difficult to talk people out of their beliefs in conspiracy theories.

Indeed, when conspiracy communities generate common interpretations and shared emotions, conspiracy theories can resonate powerfully, making them seem more real than they are.

This effect is compounded by the way which conspiracy theories invite believers to build on ideas by “doing their own research”. The internet serves as a vast database where conspiracy theorists can discover articles, documents and scientific reports to support their claims.

And despite the questionable quality of many such sources, contributing to conspiracy theories can provide a boost to people's self esteem, making them feel like experts and heroic detectives. A key aspect of these communities is how they empower members to contribute.

Yet, beyond generating more theories, conspiracy communities are becoming organised networks for protest and activism. Given that conspiracy theories raise suspicion and anger over peoples' problems, and point the blame at particular targets, we found that believers can feel compelled to take part in protests.

For example, some claim that the urban planning concept of 15-minute cities is part of secretive government scheme to limit citizens' movement. Protesters against these and other efforts to improve urban environments are uniting under slogans such as “stop the tyranny”.

Activism based on conspiracy theories can come with serious risks. Many of those involved lose contact with family and friends. Increasingly, conspiracy activists are being charged with crimes. In 2024, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist was sentenced to prison for five years for encouraging violence against chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty.

Moreover, when conspiracy theorists take action without tested evidence, they may misidentify targets. This can result in harm to innocent people and can undermine the very institutions needed to solve crimes.

To be sure, instances of conspiracy and foul play by powerful figures and organisations do happen. You have to wonder how much energy then, is wasted fighting imaginary enemies while actual wrongdoing is overlooked.

Perhaps the real winners here are the conspiracy entrepreneurs– people who capitalise on conspiracy theories by creating content that heightens peoples' suspicions about problematic events. In the process, these people build attention and fame, while peddling products and services from books, merchandise and coaching, to vitamin pills and gadgets.

There are no fans on Earth quite like Supernatural fans. Their intense love and vigor for the Winchester brothers transcends normal fandoms. For 15 seasons and 327 episodes, fans loyally tuned in week after week until it officially ended in 2020. Five years later, fans still can't get enough. The actors behind the iconic characters—Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and more—still run and faithfully attend conventions, offering personal and interactive experiences with fans, answering endless questions, and posing for countless photos.

Currently, the "SPN Family" is making the rounds across the country on their The Road So Far...The Road Ahead tour, which kicked off in Austin. For those who don't know, the show deals with heavy religious themes, as half the plot swirled around God, the devil, angels, and more. Fittingly, during a panel, Ackles was asked what he would do if he were God for a day, and his answer was truly profound.

"This is my thought," he began. "One God. One God. If that one God is the one God, okay, and I got to be him for a day, or her, I would come down and say, 'Hey, you all are on the same team. Act like it.' Because when you're on the same team, what do you do? You win. You support. You build each other up. You figure it out. You do everything that helps each other. And I feel like that is lost in this world. And I feel like if God could come down and say, 'Hey, listen, everyone here, by the way, you don't know this, but out there, you're screwed. You guys are a team. Act like it.' That's what I would do."

Fans truly resonated with the message and were taken with the heartfelt speech Ackles shared... but that wasn't all they noticed.

While people were here for the heartfelt message, they were a little shocked to see Jensen without his post-series beard that he grew in for his role on The Boys.

"Jensen hasn't aged a damn day underneath that beard," joked one fan.

The reason Ackles' beard is gone is he is currently filming for Vought Rising, which is a live-action TV series that is a 1950s prequel to The Boys on Amazon Prime. Ackles is reprising his role as a young Soldier Boy, hence why the scruffy beard is currently gone. The show is set to explore the origins of the classic "Supes," the beginnings of Compound V, and the rise of the controversial company that serves as a basis for the plot.

The show just began production this August and is slated to come out in late 2026 or early 2027.

The one-bedroom Plank House in Marcus Hook is one of the oldest operating houses in Delaware County, and is said to be the home of the pirate Blackbeard.

“It dates back to the 1700s,” said Joshua Chjaires, founder of Phantom Detectives LLC. “At that time, Marcus Hook was a well-known shipping port. It has a lot of history of paranormal activity. People report seeing the spirit of Blackbeard's wife. They hear footsteps, crying, bangs.”

The paranormal investigative team based in Wilmington, Del. will visit the house and a graveyard out back, revealing their results at the Marcus Hook 17th Annual Pirate Festival on Saturday, Sept. 20, writes Kathleen E. Carey for the Daily Times.

Boothwyn native Melissa Ferrazzano is the medium on the team and has already sensed spirits days before the investigation.

Michael Manerchia ,of the Marcus Hook Preservation Society, won't  go into the house after dark after he and his wife experienced bedroom doors that opened and closed by themselves, in sync.

“You could walk in there in August, and it was 50 degrees. You could see your breath.”

A half a dozen paranormal groups have visited the Plank House, but nobody's lasted a full night, Manerchia said.

Footage shared by country star Dierks Bentley appears to show multiple unknown objects in the sky.

Country music star Dierks Bentley shared some interesting video footage that might get UFO enthusiasts talking.

OutKick fans love UFOs, and they love country music. Two topics that you wouldn't think ever cross into each other.

Why would they? They're completely unrelated. Well, that's the beauty of the internet. You never know when topics are going to collide.

Enter Dierks Bentley going viral on Instagram.

The popular country music singer recently took to Instagram to share a video that appears to show three objects high up in the sky, and he wants help from the public identifying whatever they might be.

Bentley wrote the following on Instagram:

"See this all the time flying east to west in the NW sky. Been meaning to post about it for a few years. They light up, move around for a bit, and then go dark. Appear to be 70,000 feet, but they stay in the exact same spot when you fly across the entire country…so they are in space. Not satellites, not Starlink and not meteors… not saying they are #UFO but they are definitely unidentified flying objects! Ok….came for the post, here for the comments!"

You can watch the now-viral footage below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.

What did the comments section think? Suggestions were all over the place:

Are aliens responsible for UFOs or is there a much more believable explanation? (Credit: Getty Images Creatives)

Now, as a bit of a UFO enthusiast myself, I'm skeptical to believe the video shows something incredibly sinister or from a different planet.

To me, they look like they could be military-grade drones, satellites or something similar. It's important to keep an open mind, but that doesn't mean believing anything that gets thrown out there.

It's certainly an interesting video, but it's way too difficult to determine what's going on with any high level of confidence.

Little green aliens? Doubtful, but again, we can't say for sure.

Billionaire heiress Taylor Thomson has reportedly lost more than $80 million in digital assets after following investment guidance tied to a psychic.

Key Takeaways:

According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report published Monday, Thomson, a member of the family behind media and financial giant Thomson Reuters, poured millions into cryptocurrencies with the assistance of her former best friend, Ashley Richardson.

The two women had allegedly consulted a celebrity psychic and other spiritual advisers before Richardson became heavily involved in managing Thomson's crypto holdings. 

At the height of the 2021 bull market, Richardson was said to oversee more than $140 million in Thomson's digital assets spread across multiple wallets.

But the sharp downturn in crypto markets in mid-2022 devastated the portfolio.

Consulting firm Guidepost Solutions estimated Thomson's losses at over $80 million and claimed Richardson executed more than 450,000 trades without proper authorization, exposing her to high-risk strategies.

Richardson rejected the allegations, arguing she acted under Thomson's direction and only made trades to maintain liquidity in thinly traded tokens.

She emphasized that there was no formal contract between them, only a verbal agreement, and insisted she never profited personally.

“Everything I did was based on her instructions, as part of her effort to minimize losses,” Richardson told the WSJ.

The dispute escalated into a legal battle in 2023. Thomson filed a lawsuit against Richardson and Persistence (XPRT), a proof-of-stake blockchain project launched in 2021.

She had invested $40 million in its native token, which has since collapsed in value.

XPRT peaked at $16.59 on May 15, 2021, according to CoinGecko, but currently trades at about $0.037 — a drop of 99% from its all-time high.

Thomson is seeking $25 million in damages, alleging Richardson and Persistence arranged a secret “finder's fee” for Richardson and misrepresented the investment.

A Thomson spokesperson dismissed Richardson's narrative, saying: “Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson.”

Richardson has countersued for $10 million, claiming defamation after Thomson allegedly told others she had committed fraud.

According to the WSJ, Thomson has since reached a settlement with Persistence, but the case against Richardson remains ongoing.

As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam, losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction.

The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders.

The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle.

Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK's latest security report.

Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.
