                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama talks with then President-elect Donald Trump as Melania Trump reads the funeral program before the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, Jan. 9, 2025. President Donald Trump's social media post featuring a video about election conspiracy theories and a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle has been deleted. The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. After calls for its removal for being racist — including by Republicans — the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down. An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response. “Nobody is prouder of our Nevada Congressional District than me. Every achievement worth doing began with listening to Nevadans and fighting for our values.” Amodei has served as a member of Congress for Nevada's 2nd Congressional District since 2011. Amodei, from Nevada's capital of Carson City, served for years as Nevada's only Republican in Congress in a historically red district. “I came to Congress to solve problems and to make sure our State and Nation have (a) strong voice in the federal policy and oversight processes,” he said Friday in a statement. Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee are sending a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi as they press the Trump administration for answers on how personal information of victims was included in the release of over 3 million government files on Jeffrey Epstein. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information. Nearly all of the 62-second clip, which was among dozens of Truth Social posts from Trump overnight, appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied. Those frames were taken from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker. Shortly after Friday's talks broke, the Treasury and State Department in Washington announced a new round of sanctions on Iran targeting its energy sector. The departments imposed penalties, including freezes on assets in U.S. jurisdictions, on 14 so-called “shadow fleet” of oil tankers that the U.S. says are used to try to evade sanctions as well as 15 trading firms and two business executives. President Donald Trump's social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticized the video as racist. The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. After calls for its removal for being racist -- including by Republicans -- the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down. The post was part of a flurry of social media activity on Trump's Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and a Trump attorney general from his first term finding no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response. In a court filing on Thursday, the Department of Justice asked U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes to pause her decision. Reyes ruled Monday that a lawsuit challenging the termination was likely to prevail on its merits. The Trump administration wants Reyes to issue a decision by Monday. Attorneys for the plaintiffs objected to that timeline in a court filing, arguing there was no emergency that requires the sudden termination of Haiti's Temporary Protected Status. “The President should remove it,” said Scott, a Black Republican who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media. Bondi says Gabbard presence in Fulton County doesn't taint search Bondi said “absolutely not” when asked if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at last week's FBI search of the election office in Georgia tainted the search. The office has been central to right-wing conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss. It came a week after Trump predicted prosecutions over a contest he has baselessly insisted was tainted by widespread fraud. Bondi stressed on Friday that the search was helmed by FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey. Gabbard has said that she present at the search because Trump wanted her there. Trump this week said Gabbard had gone to Georgia “at Pam's insistence,” referencing the attorney general. Attorney General Pam Bondi, center, flanked by FBI Director Kash Patel, left, and Jeanine Pirro, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, appears before reporters at the Justice Department, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington, to announce the capture of a key participant in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday that federal authorities are assisting Arizona officials investigating the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother. Glass, debris and overturned furniture are strewn inside a room in the gutted U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after an attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens., Sept. 12, 2012. Officials said that Zubayr Al-Bakoush was brought to an airfield in Virginia early Friday. “We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said. Corrective: This story has been corrected to show that the suspect arrived at an airfield in Virginia, not Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced. It likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail. Former President Barack Obama talks with then President-elect Donald Trump as Melania Trump reads the funeral program before the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, Jan. 9, 2025. Trump has used his social media account to share a video about election conspiracy theories that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama. It was part of a flurry of social media activity that amplified Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. An Obama spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Nearly all of the 62-second clip appears to be from a conservative video. Iran's top diplomat said that indirect talks with the United States held in Oman on Friday were “a very good start” but negotiators now must speak with their leaders. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the comment in a live interview from Muscat, Oman, on Iranian state television. Araghchi described the talks as taking place over multiple rounds and that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations. Oman has mediated indirect talks between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. Oman issued a public statement acknowledging the talks after Associated Press journalists watched Iranian and American officials separately visit a palace on the outskirts of Muscat to speak to the sultanate's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel's attacks devastated Iran's air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well. Cheered on by a crowd that included Vice President J.D. Vance, his family and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chock and Bates were able to secure their team the maximum 10 points for their Lenny Kravitz-inspired dance while making a big early statement. However, the U.S. economy was already growing before his second term. Inflation figures are skewed by data disruptions, and tariffs have actually increased core goods prices. Trump also claims foreign producers bear most tariff costs, but studies show U.S. consumers and firms are affected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• US-Iran negotiations: The two countries agreed to continue discussions after holding high-stakes indirect talks in Oman today. Iran's foreign minister called them a “good start.” • Funding fight: Senate Majority Leader John Thune said conversations on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will continue this weekend. The White House said Trump is willing to consider some of Democrats' demands for ICE reforms, but others are “non-starters.” • Outrage over video: Trump shared a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, prompting a rare rebuke from the Senate's only Black Republican, Tim Scott, who called it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” It has since been deleted. • Fulton County: Trump defended the involvement of spy chief Tulsi Gabbard in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to comment on whether she sent Gabbard, saying, “She was there, we are inseparable.” A high-ranking federal appeals court judge today railed against the Trump administration's “obsession” with targeting “woke” diversity, equity and inclusion programs, even as he sided with the government in a case challenging President Donald Trump's efforts to end government support of such initiatives. In a unanimous decision authored by 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Albert Diaz, the Richmond-based court said two executive orders that sought to crack down on DEI programs in the federal government were legally sound. He said that while the administration had argued that some DEI programs may be lawful, evidence in the case's record “suggests a more sinister story: important programs terminated by keyword; valuable grants gutted in the dark; worthy efforts to uplift and empower denigrated in social media posts.” The Trump administration's “obsession over so called ‘woke' DEI programs appears to know no bounds,” Diaz wrote in the solo concurrence, which specifically cited Secretary of State Marco Rubio's decision last year to nix a Joe Biden-era typeface policy intended to make official papers from the department more accessible. Rubio, Diaz wrote, “somehow found time to rail against the Calibri typeface previously approved for State Department use by his predecessor. The US and Iran have agreed to hold follow-on discussions after consultations with their capitals following today's indirect talks in Oman, an outcome cautiously viewed as a positive result by both sides, according to source familiar. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff led for the US previously, along with a small team that joined him over time, but Trump's son in law Jared Kushner was in the room this round, and US Central Command Commander Admiral Brad Cooper was part of the delegation. His presence marks the first time a senior US military official joined indirect talks with Iran during Trump's second term. Some context: The Iranians grew frustrated with Witkoff over the course of last year's talks and some people involved believe that having new US players could lead to more productive discussions, the source said. In terms of timing, that also remains unclear right now, the source said. Some people involved in the talks believe that slowing down the pace could allow for more robust negotiations to take place, they said. The White House did not respond when asked for comment. After the talks ended, in a sign that the US wants to keep up economic pressure, it rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels carrying it. A racist video shared on President Donald Trump's Truth Social account has been deleted, with the White House now blaming a staffer for posting it late Thursday. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a senior White House official told CNN. The post, which depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes, remained online for roughly 12 hours before it was removed from Trump's Truth Social feed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially downplayed the video in a statement Friday morning. Swift backlash: Politicians from both parties, including GOP Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler, urged Trump to remove the post. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday that the FBI has arrested a “key participant” behind the 2012 Benghazi terror attack in Benghazi, Libya. US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in the September 11, 2012 attack along with State Department employee Sean Smith and Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods are killed in the attack. “We have never forgotten those heroes, and we have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said. A plane that departed Misrata, Libya, on Thursday landed at the Manassas Regional Airport in Virginia at 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to flight data reviewed by CNN. Bakoush was charged eleven years ago, but the case remained sealed until his arrest Friday, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. That's all I can say,” Bondi said at a news conference. Bondi added she is not worried that Gabbard's presence may have tainted evidence in their investigation. The administration has offered differing explanations for Gabbard's presence. Here's what Deputy AG Todd Blanche told CNN earlier in the week: GOP Sen. Tim Scott criticized President Donald Trump for sharing a racist video that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, writing Friday that Trump “should remove it.” “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X. It was decided that this process would continue but the timing, manner, and date of that will be decided in the future,” Araghchi said. “But I do not want to judge now,” he said. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said both parties will make a decision on the next round of talks after consultations with their respective governments. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the negotiations, described the talks in a post on X as “very serious.” The US military conducted a strike against another alleged drug-trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean yesterday, killing two people, according to US Southern Command. “On Feb. 5, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM Commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOM wrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike. At least 119 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of a campaign, dubbed Operation Southern Spear, that the Trump administration has said is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States in the Omani capital of Muscat have now ended, with a “willingness to continue,” according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. Iranian state-affiliated news agency Tasnim said the two countries have agreed that talks will “continue at another time,” without specifying when. Throughout the day, the Iranian and US delegations “conveyed views, considerations and approaches” through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led the Iranian diplomatic delegation, while President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff represented the US. The Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM) Adm. Brad Cooper was also seen in attendance. President Donald Trump shared a racist video on his social media platform that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, sparking intense condemnation. In a statement to CNN on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the broader response to the video “fake outrage.” CNN has reached out to the Obamas for comment. Later last year, Trump and members of his administration also shared digitally altered images and videos of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero, imagery Jeffries publicly described as racist. Today, President Donald Trump will sign executive orders at 3 p.m. As of now, this is closed to the press. The commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), Admiral Brad Cooper, was seen attending meetings on Iran in Oman. A video posted by the state-run Oman News Agency showed Cooper participating in talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-la, Jared Kushner during their meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. Peskov also described this week's trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US, hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi, as “both constructive and challenging.” “But there is an understanding, and this was also discussed in Abu Dhabi, that both sides will take responsible positions, and both sides recognize the need to begin negotiations on this issue as soon as possible,” Peskov added. US President Donald Trump said yesterday that the US should negotiate a new and improved nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to a treaty extension. “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Ahead of high-stakes talks with the US on Friday, Iran's foreign minister said his country “enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year.” “We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X hours before the talks. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric—they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement,” Araghchi wrote. Araghchi also met his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Oman's capital Muscat ahead of the talks with the US delegation, Iranian media reported. Araghchi told Albusaidi that Tehran is “utilizing diplomacy to secure Iran's national interests” while being “fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and national security” against “adventurism,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will “continue through the weekend.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for not presenting a clear rebuttal to the Democratic demands on funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Thune has also expressed frustration about not being able to get the Democratic side to sit down and negotiate, and many Republicans have said many of the Democratic demands are nonstarters. High-stakes talks between the US and Iran are underway in the Omani capital of Muscat, Iranian news agencies reported early on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the Iranian diplomatic delegation, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff are representing the US. Araghchi presented to his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi a “preliminary plan” to “manage the current situation” between Iran and the US and advance negotiations, Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. The White House previously offered limited expectations for negotiations, saying President Donald Trump preferred to resolve tensions diplomatically and that he would receive a briefing from his delegates to the discussions afterward. Trump hopes the large US military buildup he's ordered in the Middle East will act as leverage as he seeks concessions from Iran on its nuclear and missile programs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama talks with then President-elect Donald Trump as Melania Trump reads the funeral program before the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, Jan. 9, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticized the video as racist. The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. After calls for its removal for being racist -- including by Republicans -- the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down. The post was part of a flurry of social media activity on Trump's Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and a Trump attorney general from his first term finding no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response. Nearly all of the 62-second clip, which was among dozens of Truth Social posts from Trump overnight, appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied. At the 60-second mark is a quick scene of two primates, with the Obamas' smiling faces imposed on them. Those frames were taken from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker. It shows Trump as “King of the Jungle” and depicts a range of Democratic leaders as animals, including Joe Biden, who is white, as a jungle primate eating a banana. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.” By noon, the post had been taken down with responsibility placed on a Trump subordinate. Trump did not comment on the video in the post, which comes in the first week of Black History Month and days after a presidential proclamation that cited “the contributions of black Americans to our national greatness and their enduring commitment to the American principles of liberty, justice, and equality.” While it was still up, Trump's post drew condemnation from across the political and ideological spectrum. The U.S. Senate's lone Black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, called on Trump to take down the post. “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media. Another Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is white but represents the state with the largest percentage of Black residents. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement, “Donald Trump's video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable.” Johnson asserted that Trump is trying anything to distract from economic conditions and attention on the Jeffrey Epstein case files. “You know who isn't in the Epstein files? “You know who actually improved the economy as president? There is a long history in the U.S. of powerful white figures associating Black people with animals, including apes, in demonstrably false and racist ways. The practice dates back to 18th century cultural racism and pseudo-scientific theories in which white people drew connections between Africans and monkeys to justify the enslavement of Black people in Europe and North America, and later to dehumanize freed Black people as an uncivilized threat to white people. President Dwight Eisenhower, discussing the desegregation of public schools in the 1950s, once argued that white parents were concerned about their daughters being in classrooms with “big Black bucks.” Obama, as a candidate and president, was featured as a monkey or other primate on T-shirts and other merchandise. In his 2024 campaign, Trump said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country,” language similar to what Adolf Hitler said to dehumanize Jews in Nazi Germany. During his first White House term, Trump referred to a swath of developing nations that are majority Black as “shithole countries.” He initially denied using the slur but admitted in December 2025 that he did say it. Trump, in interviews that helped endear him to many conservative voters, repeatedly demanded that Obama produce birth records and prove he was a “natural-born citizen” as required to become president. Trump finally acknowledged during his 2016 campaign, after having won the Republican nomination, that Obama was born in Hawaii. But he immediately said, falsely, that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton started those birtherism attacks on Obama.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran's nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey. Oman mediated indirect talks Friday between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. Both Araghchi and the Omanis described the talks themselves as focused on merely trying to find a way to hold future negotiations — seemingly returning to the start of discussions about the Iranian nuclear program that unfolded over months a year ago, before Israel launched its 12-day war on Iran in June. The U.S. side, represented by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, had no immediate comment on the talks. In an unusual development, U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, also attended the meeting — something that did not happen in previous rounds and likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail. In a court filing on Thursday, the Department of Justice asked U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes to pause her decision. Reyes ruled Monday that a lawsuit challenging the termination was likely to prevail on its merits. The Trump administration wants Reyes to issue a decision by Monday. Attorneys for the plaintiffs objected to that timeline in a court filing, arguing there was no emergency that requires the sudden termination of Haiti's Temporary Protected Status. “The President should remove it,” said Scott, a Black Republican who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media. Bondi says Gabbard presence in Fulton County doesn't taint search Bondi said “absolutely not” when asked if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at last week's FBI search of the election office in Georgia tainted the search. The office has been central to right-wing conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss. Bondi stressed on Friday that the search was helmed by FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey. Gabbard has said that she present at the search because Trump wanted her there. Trump this week said Gabbard had gone to Georgia “at Pam's insistence,” referencing the attorney general. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday federal authorities are assisting Arizona officials investigating the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother. Glass, debris and overturned furniture are strewn inside a room in the gutted U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after an attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens., Sept. 12, 2012. Officials said that Zubayr Al-Bakoush was brought to an airfield in Virginia early Friday. “We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said. Corrective: This story has been corrected to show that the suspect arrived at an airfield in Virginia, not Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced. It likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail. Former President Barack Obama talks with then President-elect Donald Trump as Melania Trump reads the funeral program before the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, Jan. 9, 2025. Trump has used his social media account to share a video about election conspiracy theories that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama. It was part of a flurry of social media activity that amplified Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. An Obama spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Nearly all of the 62-second clip appears to be from a conservative video. Iran's top diplomat said that indirect talks with the United States held in Oman on Friday were “a very good start” but negotiators now must speak with their leaders. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the comment in a live interview from Muscat, Oman, on Iranian state television. Araghchi described the talks as taking place over multiple rounds and that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations. Oman has mediated indirect talks between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests. Oman issued a public statement acknowledging the talks after Associated Press journalists watched Iranian and American officials separately visit a palace on the outskirts of Muscat to speak to the sultanate's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel's attacks devastated Iran's air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well. Cheered on by a crowd that included Vice President J.D. Vance, his family and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chock and Bates were able to secure their team the maximum 10 points for their Lenny Kravitz-inspired dance while making a big early statement. However, the U.S. economy was already growing before his second term. Inflation figures are skewed by data disruptions, and tariffs have actually increased core goods prices. Trump also claims foreign producers bear most tariff costs, but studies show U.S. consumers and firms are affected.</p>

FILE -Council of Europe Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland speaks at the Russian International Affairs Council in Moscow on March 23, 2012. OSLO, Norway (AP) — Norway's crown princess apologized on Friday for the situation she has put the royal family in as she faces scrutiny over her contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, part of a broader apology for all those she has “disappointed.” Crown Princess Mette-Marit's communications and contacts with Epstein have put her in the spotlight over the past week, adding to the embarrassment to the royals just as her son went on trial in Oslo for multiple offenses, including charges of rape. The Epstein files contained several hundred mentions of the crown princess, who said in 2019 that she regretted having had contact with Epstein, Norwegian media reported. The documents, which include email exchanges, showed that Mette-Marit borrowed an Epstein-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in 2013. Broadcaster NRK reported that the stay was arranged through a mutual friend, which was later confirmed by the royal household. The royal palace said Friday that Mette-Marit wants to talk about what happened and explain herself in more detail, but is unable to at present. It added that she is in a very difficult situation and “hopes for understanding that she needs time to gather her thoughts.” The release of documents included an email from Mette-Marit to Epstein in November 2012 asking: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my I5-year-old son's wallpaper?” He replied, “Let them decide,” and advised that the mother should, “Stay out of it.” Mette-Marit, 52, said in a statement issued shortly after the files were released that she “must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein's background more thoroughly, and for not realizing sooner what kind of person he was.” She added: “I showed poor judgment and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all. The Norwegian Economic Crime Investigation Service, a mixed unit of police and prosecutors, said Thursday that it would look into whether gifts, travel or loans were received by former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland in connection with his positions. Emails indicate that he made plans to visit Epstein's island with his family in 2014, when he was chairman of the Nobel committee, with an Epstein assistant organizing the flights. Norwegian authorities are also looking to lift Jagland's immunity, which he enjoys because of his past as a diplomat. His legal representative told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that Jagland is cooperating with the investigation. The World Economic Forum also announced on Thursday that it was opening an internal review into its CEO Børge Brende to determine his relationship with Epstein, after the files indicated the two had dined together several times and exchanged messages. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually abused underage girls at his homes in the U.S.</p>

The search for Nancy Guthrie intensifies as private investigator TJ Ward, who worked on the Natalie Holloway case, weighs in on the missed ransom deadline and looming Monday threat. A neighbor of missing Nancy Guthrie said he saw a suspicious white van on their street in the days before NBC host Savannah Guthrie's mother was taken from her home. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Tucson home at around 9:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. While officials didn't initially elaborate on the circumstances of her disappearance, Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday that "we do, in fact, have a crime." A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that there were "blood drops" leading from the entryway outside down the house's pathway towards the driveway. "Sheriff [Chris] Nanos has stated that he believes that a crime has been committed," a spokesperson for Pima County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital. "At this point, investigators believe she was taken from the home against her will and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction." He couldn't recall exactly when he saw the van, but said it was recent. It was a white van, full-sized, with no printing on the sides. It was parked on the street," he said. "Normally people that are coming to work on your home will have a company vehicle or, if they're independent, something written on it."

Gregory Meeks repeatedly demanded a yes-or-no answer from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, escalating the exchange into a tense confrontation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was grilled by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill in back-to-back hearings this week that repeatedly erupted into shouting. The confrontations reflected broader Democratic frustrations over President Donald Trump's trade agenda and renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve, sharpening concerns about inflation, borrowing costs and the administration's economic direction. Against that backdrop, cost-of-living pressures dominated the hearings, with Democratic lawmakers demanding clearer answers as Bessent defended the administration's policies. Here are the top contentious moments from Bessent's hearings. On Wednesday, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was among the first to clash with Bessent over Trump's economic agenda, with the irate congresswoman asking at one point if someone could "shut him up." Waters, the panel's ranking member, pressed Bessent on the potential inflationary effects of Trump's tariffs on U.S. consumers, repeatedly calling for a yes-or-no answer. Waters: So I ask you, Secretary Bessent, will you be the voice of reason in this administration and urge President Trump to stop waging a war on American consumers, harming housing affordability, and putting the economy at risk? Waters: Will you be the voice of reason? Will you be the voice of reason? Bessent: A study from Wharton University has shown — Chair, will you let him know when I ask to reclaim my time — Rep. French Hill, R-Arkansas, House Financial Services Committee chairman: The time does belong to the gentlewoman from California. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat from California, asked Rep. French Hill to silence Treasury Secretary Bessent. Bessent: What about the housing stock for working Americans? And can you maintain some level of dignity? Waters: No, my time has not expired. Waters: The gentleman took up my time. I think you should recognize that, Mr. Rep. Gregory Meeks, Democrat from New York, yells at Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to answer his question during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 4, 2026. Following the contentious exchange with Waters, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) asked Bessent to commit to pausing and fully scrutinizing any Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) licensing tied to World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto firm. He cited concerns about conflicts of interest and foreign influence that he said should be reviewed and shared with Congress. Bessent cited the OCC's independence and declined to give a direct yes-or-no answer. Meeks : All I need to know is will you halt it and do a complete investigation and scrutiny of this licensing application? The OCC is an independent entity and I would note congressman — Meeks: All you have to say is yes or no. Meeks: I take that as a no. Meeks: I take that as a no. You do not want to answer that question. Meeks: I take that as a no. There were several flare-ups between Democrat lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his testimony on Capitol Hill. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Meeks: I'm asking you to do your responsibility as Secretary of the Treasury. Meeks: He went past your time, Mr. Chairman. Meeks: And it was a yes or no. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., sparred with Bessent during a contentious Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday, pressing him on President Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS over the alleged leak of his tax records. When Bessent said any payout would come from the U.S. Treasury, Gallego pushed back, arguing the cost would ultimately be borne by U.S. taxpayers. Bessent tried to interject, but Gallego continued, "I'm controlling the time here. In the same hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pressed Bessent to explain a joke Trump made about Federal Reserve nominee Kevin Warsh. Warren, the panel's ranking member, asked Bessent about comments Trump made over the weekend, when he joked — or appeared to joke — about suing Warsh if he failed to lower the national interest rate. Mr. Secretary, can you commit right here and now that Trump's Fed nominee, Kevin Warsh, will not be sued, will not be investigated by the Department of Justice, if he doesn't cut interest rates exactly the way Donald Trump wants? Warren: And he won't be criminally investigated? A side-by-side photo of U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent: The president also made a joke about you — one I won't repeat. Warren: That was supposed to be a softball. If this was a joke, why not just say so? Bessent: It was a joke, and he made a joke about you, too, Senator Warren. Last week, Trump nominated Warsh to lead the world's most powerful central bank. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would assume one of the most powerful positions in U.S. economic policymaking, with direct influence over interest rate decisions and the central bank's battle against inflation.

'Bar Rescue' host and executive producer Jon Taffer joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss new dietary guidance on alcohol, the rise of mocktails and how Ozempic is shrinking portion sizes across restaurants. Young adults born between 1997 and 2012 are embracing becoming regulars at local spots like it's 1995 — echoing the vibes of "Friends" and "Cheers" as they seek real-world connection, better deals and laid-back atmospheres, Business Insider recently reported. Industry insiders tell Fox News Digital they're seeing the trend play out across their own businesses. "We're definitely seeing a shift back toward those reliable neighborhood spots where the focus is more on meaningful catch-ups than chasing the latest trend," New York-based beverage expert Gareth Howells told Fox News Digital. Dive bars are gaining popularity among Gen Z for their welcoming feel and lack of reservations. Restaurant owners agree that reliable neighborhood spots are increasingly appealing to younger customers. "Gen Z consumers are very intentional about where they go and why," said Hakki Akdeniz, a New York–based restaurateur whose businesses include Champion Pizza and Mira Mediterranean & Hookah Lounge. "They care more about whether a place is welcoming, social and worthwhile than about glitz and glam," Akdeniz told Fox News Digital. "They want to feel like their time and money actually matter." Dive bars also offer younger customers, who are drinking less overall, a place to socialize without the pressure of heavy alcohol consumption, according to Vic Christopher, president and co-founder of Clark House Hospitality in Troy, New York. "There seems to be less interest in complicated cocktails and long-winded explanations for wine varietals and more of an emphasis on value," he said. Cheaper drinks, wing nights and other specials are also drawing in younger crowds who might just be making minimum wage, said Alex Schwartz, marketing director at PDQ POS, a sales software provider used across the country. "I am seeing a lot more dive and neighborhood bars invest in live entertainment and themed nights, something that went away for a few years after the pandemic," he added. "Gen Z customers are more interested in seeing local performers and attending recurring events where they can build friendships and relationships with people in their area." Live music and themed events are helping dive bars draw in Gen Z customers. A $7 beer is repeatable — an $18 cocktail is not, agreed Ben Tannenbaum, New York-based vice president of partnerships at nightlife company LineLeap. He said dive bars are also better suited to today's fragmented schedules and rising costs. Just over half of Americans consider themselves a regular at a local restaurant or bar, according to OpenTable, meaning they visit three or four times a month and staff may know their name or order. Gen Z is increasingly following older generations in filling these spaces. Tech and payment companies are reportedly racing to monetize the desire for neighborhood connection, formalizing what once happened naturally through loyalty programs, according to the National Restaurant Association. "We're focusing on rewarding loyalty, motivating people to be loyal to places that they love," Ben Leventhal, co-founder of Resy and founder of Blackbird, an app focused on loyalty rewards for restaurants, told Business Insider. For Akdeniz, however, technology can't replace old-fashioned hospitality. Rising drink prices are pushing Gen Z toward neighborhood dive bars instead of high-end cocktail spots, experts say. "Loyalty programs can help, but they should never replace the human element of hospitality," he said. "The best loyalty is built on relationships — being remembered, cared for and feeling like you belong." The trend may also be better for mental health and connection. Dive bars can offer a lower-pressure space for in-person connection. Dive bars are often lower-pressure and less judgmental, said John Puls, a licensed psychotherapist at Full Life Comprehensive Care in Boca Raton, Florida, and an adjunct professor at Florida Atlantic University. "The traditional nightlife of clubs does not yield itself to in-person connections as much," Puls told Fox News Digital. It provides an opportunity to put down your phones and experience genuine connections." Deirdre Bardolf is a lifestyle writer with Fox News Digital.

Imagine being a telegraph operator in September 1859. You're sitting at your station, using cutting-edge technology to tap out messages hundreds and thousands of miles away. You later find out that some of your fellow operators could still send messages even after disconnecting their batteries — not knowing that the telegraph wires were being energized by massive currents induced in the wires by the most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history. That storm, triggered by a colossal solar flare observed by British astronomer Richard Carrington, unleashed a coronal mass ejection (CME) that slammed into Earth's magnetic field. A telegraph operator in 1859 could only wonder at today's technology — technology that is far more vulnerable to the sun than was the case then. In the preceding 24 hours, this unstable region hurled 23 M-class and four X-class flares earthward. The explosion ejected dense plasma that could be Earth-directed. If it arrives with sufficient force, it will compress Earth's magnetosphere and induce powerful geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) — in other words, electrify the Earth's surface. GICs, in turn, can impart a current to the high-voltage transmission lines that form the backbone of our electric grid. Modern society is infinitely more dependent on electricity than in the telegraph era. It would risk melting or destroying hundreds of massive high-voltage transformers, triggering widespread blackouts that could last months or years. Yet despite clear warnings, America's grid remains dangerously vulnerable. In my 2023 report for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texas Defense, I detailed how both natural geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks pose existential risks to the grid. A severe event could damage or destroy effectively irreplaceable extra-high-voltage (EHV) transformers, leading to prolonged outages across the state and beyond. But there is good news: Proven, cost-effective hardware solutions exist today. Neutral Blocking Devices equipped with capacitors, installed in the grounded neutral of high-voltage transformers, can prevent catastrophic damage. These devices block the quasi-direct current (quasi-DC) GICs induced by solar storms or the E3 component of an EMP blast, while allowing normal 60 Hz AC power to flow unimpeded. These devices buffer harmful ground currents, preventing overheating, destructive harmonics, voltage collapse and eventual meltdown. As a bonus, these devices also mitigate lower-level GICs that currently shave years off transformer life and cost industry billions annually in reactive power losses. Costs for these devices have fallen dramatically as technology has matured. Yet utilities and transmission companies remain reluctant, wary of passing even modest costs to ratepayers. Regulators, meanwhile, have dragged their feet, relying on standards derived from studies that dramatically underestimate the threat. Many of these vulnerability assessments trace back to European research conducted more than 30 years ago, during an unusually calm solar period. Those models assumed lower GIC intensities and failed to account for today's more interconnected, higher-voltage grid — or the far more active sun we're experiencing now in Cycle 25. Compounding the problem is the fact that most large power transformers are no longer made in America. The majority come from China, South Korea, and Germany, with typical delivery lead times stretching to four years or more under normal conditions. If dozens or hundreds are destroyed in a severe solar storm, replacement could take a decade or longer — time we wouldn't have in a prolonged blackout. With sunspot AR4366 still crackling and more explosions likely in the coming days, the warning couldn't be clearer. Congress and state legislatures must act swiftly to mandate or incentivize installation of neutral blocking devices. Utilities must prioritize grid resilience over short-term rate concerns. And regulators must update standards to reflect real-world risks, not Pollyannaish assumptions from a sleepy sun. The Carrington Event literally shocked telegraph operators. A repeat could shock an entire civilization into the pre-industrial age. We have the technology to prevent it. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: Football is America's sport. Puerto Rico is an American territory. CNN explores the obsession with Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance in a new CNN FlashDoc “Bad Bunny and the Halftime Show: Rhythms of Resistance.” Stream the special now on the CNN app. The hour will premiere Saturday, February 7 at 10pm ET on CNN. History tells us that those who take the biggest stage in US sports have not shied away from using it as an opportunity to make a statement. In some ways, Bad Bunny, this year's Super Bowl halftime show performer, has already made his, taking the Grammys stage last Sunday and echoing a rallying cry heard at anti-ICE protests across the nation. The question now: What else will Bad Bunny have to say and will he say it during the halftime show? “I think that regardless of what he does or doesn't do, his presence there is deeply political,” Puerto Rico historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo told CNN, noting that Bad Bunny's show will undoubtedly put the "complex and uncomfortable realities of United States history" in relation to his homeland of Puerto Rico before a huge audience. Throughout history, artists appearing on the Super Bowl stage – whether that be to sing the National Anthem or headline the Halftime Show – have time and again used their platform to make a statement about what's going on off the field. Here are a few examples:</p>

At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Super Bowl performer's ties to a nascent independence movement are roiling Puerto Rican politics. The 31-year-old superstar, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is also developing a reputation for his outspoken politics. He's refused to tour in the United States since President Donald Trump took office again, for fear of exposing Latino fans to ICE raids. '” Bad Bunny said while accepting his Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album. Earlier, Trump claimed not to know who the Puerto Rican artist even is, calling his halftime selection “absolutely ridiculous.” While Trump has been obsessed in his second term with expanding the US into new territories like Greenland, or even Canada, his neglect of Puerto Rico is ironically one factor in reviving a long-dormant independence movement there. And Bad Bunny is considered one of the most high-profile cultural figures who will help determine just how far it can go. While casual listeners may have first learned about the artist's activism when he called out ICE onstage last week, Bad Bunny's outspokenness is nothing new. And he's been especially engaged with the archipelago's unique politics. As Bad Bunny reminded Grammy viewers (and apparently some confused NFL players) in a jokey bit with host Trevor Noah on Sunday, Puerto Rico is “part of America” — a phrase he said with air quotes. The archipelago adopted its own constitution in 1952, officially becoming a self-governing US territory with an elected governor. Since then, Puerto Rico's two historic major parties have divided themselves in part based on the question of its status. The New Progressive Party (PNP) is historically pro-statehood, which would give Puerto Ricans voting representation in Congress and in presidential elections as well as more control over their affairs. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) typically favors remaining as a commonwealth, which supporters argue will allow Puerto Rico to better maintain its unique culture along with US citizenship and certain economic benefits, like an exemption from most federal income tax. So it was no surprise that they were at odds. The singer sponsored anti-PNP billboards with messages like, “Quien vota PNP no ama a Puerto Rico” — “someone who votes for PNP doesn't love Puerto Rico.” But he also went further by publicly rejecting both major parties, who he said were jointly responsible for Puerto Rico's struggles — and instead directed fans to vote for Dalmau at the candidate's closing rally. Independentistas are still fueled by momentum from their second-place election results, dissatisfaction with the federal government's lack of investment over the past decade, and, yes, Bad Bunny's album about Boricua culture and history. The rapper's breakout success and political voice have cleared a space to spread their message further — even as he steers clear of explicitly calling for independence himself. But the surge of interest in independence, while still a clear minority position, is partly seen as a story of younger voters' disillusionment with the government. His journey as a former grocery store bagger and university dropout to one of the world's biggest artists is directly tied to those struggles, Meléndez-Badillo, the Wisconsin professor, said. His 2019 protest track “Afilando Los Cuchillos,” with legendary Calle 13 members Residente and iLe catalogued a generational frustration with corruption, and became an anthem at mass protests against then-Gov. Ricky Rosselló — a pro-statehood official who resigned after a trove of Telegram messages leaked that were filled with inflammatory, sexist, and homophobic statements. His anthem “El Apagón” notes the pride Boricuas have amid constant blackouts, while insisting they “don't want to leave here / let them go, let them go.” Even the romantic ballad “Bokete” uses the endless, oft-unaddressed potholes found across the island's roads as metaphors for an ex-lover who should be avoided at all costs. Questions of gaining sovereignty have also become more acute as Washington takes a bigger role in its finances. In 2016, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to help the archipelago tackle over $70 billion in debt. The fiscal oversight board — whose members are appointed by the US president, with no say from Puerto Ricans — quickly implemented austerity measures that critics say impacted access to social services like retirement funds and education. Residents receive food assistance and health care through capped federal block-grant systems, which are different from the flexible funding pools awarded to the continental United States by Congress that expand to meet increased needs. Residents also face barriers to shipping through the Jones Act, which raises prices and forces dependency on US trade by requiring Puerto Rico to use American-built and -operated vessels for shipping between the two shores. One lasting image among Boricuas: Trump tossing paper towels into a crowd during a delayed visit to San Juan as millions remained without power or adequate cellular signals. Two years later, he berated Puerto Ricans for having “squandered or wasted away” their federal funding, even as locals noted much of the promised aid had not yet been disbursed. “This all goes hand-in-hand with the natural events of Hurricane Maria, earthquake swarms,” Meléndez-Badillo said. “We're depending on something that is, in and of itself, the disease. It's like when a smoker is smoking all his life, and doesn't know how to stop. It's like, well, I think you should probably stop smoking.” Independence advocates acknowledge that the process would not happen overnight. Their solution is simple on the surface: Supporters want to guide Puerto Rico on a series of steps in conjunction with the US, starting with a consensus vote, a lengthy transition, and terms negotiation process with Congress, all leading to eventual sovereignty over affairs. Boricuas could lose birthright citizenship, potentially lowering their ability to travel freely with a powerful passport, an especially major concern given their close connections to large mainland communities in cities like Orlando and New York. Residents would have to finance their own retirement programs, which are currently handled by Medicare and Social Security, even as residents are exempt from income taxes. Self-sufficiency on an archipelago with a failing power grid, remote rural areas, and an agricultural industry decimated by María is still hard for many Boricuas to envision, even if they're not happy with the current level of federal support. Some have suggested a “free association” model of independence, which would give Puerto Rico sovereignty in international relations while maintaining some federal aid and still allowing the US military access. Some former Pacific Island territories have successfully split from the US through Compacts of Free Association in recent memory — the Marshall Islands and Micronesia in 1986, and Palau in 1994 — but they have a fraction of Puerto Rico's population size and economic capacity, and are much further geographically from the mainland. So far, independence has not been especially popular when put to voters. Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández, who belongs to the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in October that Puerto Ricans' relationship with the US was similar to that of Quebecois in Canada or Catalonians in Spain — they're protective of their distinct culture and don't want to see it subsumed into the US by becoming a state. Independence supporters argue the relationship is more like a colonial chain around Puerto Rico's neck. “Sometimes there's some slack in that chain, and it's a bit loose, and it seems like Puerto Rico is not suffering too badly, or maybe has some leeway to make its own decisions,” said Alberto Medina, who leads the pro-independence Boricuas Unidos en la Diáspora's board of directors in the US. “But at any time, the US can give that chain a very powerful yank and remind Puerto Rico who's really in charge. For his part, Bad Bunny's stance on statehood seems clear — he does not want it. In an emotional hymn off DTMF, the artist mourns “Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii” — “what happened to Hawaii,” which became a state in 1959. “Bad Bunny has done such a beautiful job of making Puerto Rico be seen.” As millions dissected the references and symbols in DTMF, more were exposed to the idea of sovereignty as a political option than before, even if such a thing remains unlikely in the current political environment — which independentistas claim as a win. “He gives an interview tomorrow, and it's front-page news,” Medina said. “And if he says, ‘I don't want Puerto Rico to be a state' in those interviews, people who wouldn't necessarily hear that message suddenly hear it because it's Bad Bunny, so there's 1,000 media outlets writing about it. Kiara Zamot, a 21-year-old university student whose parents are also part of the Puerto Rican diaspora, told me she often felt removed from her identity in a community of mostly white peers in Columbus, Ohio. But inspired by the 2024 governor's race, she became increasingly active in the independence movement — changing her career path to public policy to advocate for the cause on a wider scale — and convinced family members in Ohio and Puerto Rico to join in. “Coming from the middle of nowhere, when people start recognizing when I say, ‘Oh, I'm from Puerto Rico,' and it's no longer, like, ‘What is it?' … I find that to be really nice,” she said. Zamot is hosting a Super Bowl watch party on Sunday for Latino and non-Latino friends alike. “They killed people here for waving the flag,” he sings on that track. The short answer is that this Supreme Court loves gerrymandering more than it hates Democrats. This DOJ is no longer capable of doing its job. A federal court says deportation protections for Haitian immigrants will remain in place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. When Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted Americans to join the fight against the axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in 1940, without actually entering the war, he called on Americans to pivot their economy to equip democracies around the world. “We must be the great arsenal of democracy,” Roosevelt said in a famous fireside chat, calling for a complete reordering of the US economy at breakneck pace. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.” Eighty-six years later, the United States is, again, not technically at war, but Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth is echoing the arsenal idea with a key a shift in word choice. In the past few weeks Hegseth talked rockets alongside Jeff Bezos at a Blue Origin facility. He talked about artificial intelligence alongside Elon Musk at a SpaceX facility in Texas. But unlike Roosevelt's call to build up arms, the Trump administration's America First mindset is more focused on material gain for the US than on defending democracy in other countries. After the US military snatched former Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, for instance, the administration has been working with the remnants of his regime to access the county's oil rather than support opposition leaders thought to have gotten more votes in recent elections. President Donald Trump has also conditioned his support for Ukraine's democracy on access to Ukraine's mineral wealth in exchange for supporting the country's military against aggression from Russia. The Pentagon's budget has hovered around $1 trillion annually in recent years, but Trump, far from cutting government spending as he promised on his way into office, now wants to supercharge defense spending to $1.5 trillion next year. Enemies gather, threats grow, you feel it, I feel it,” Hegseth said, drawing on the history of Word War II and the Cold War during a speech last November at Naval War College, laying out the arsenal plan. Although it's important to note that he hasn not yet mentioned Roosevelt in an “arsenal of freedom” speech. Today's threat is also at least partly due to Trump's brash diplomatic style, which alienates longtime allies in Europe and North America and acts erratically towards adversaries like China. In part to facilitate that kind of new, out-of-the-box idea, Hegseth is promising to remake defense contracting, harness innovation, and cut red tape. Hegseth calls it a “commercial-first” mindset for the Pentagon's acquisitions. Trump's dome plan, in which contractors see lucrative opportunity, could ultimately cost multiple trillions of dollars without being 100% effective, according to an assessment by Todd Harrison at the American Enterprise Institute. “I think it is a combination of an honest, no-sacred-cows effort to fix a long-broken system and performative politics,” Harrison told me. The fact that military contracting and procurement need fixing is indisputable. Elon Musk, whose companies rely so heavily on defense contracting, promised not to spare the Pentagon in his Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting efforts last year. But that seems like a bygone era of Trump 2.0 now that the president is calling for a 66% increase in defense spending. Trying to fix a system is laudable, Peter Warren Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at New America told me. “There's obviously a lot of energy and excitement around this effort, but now comes the double hard part,” he said. The system by which tax dollars for defense contracts is awarded – as difficult as it is to maneuver and slow as it is to work – evolved from an effort to cut down on graft and abuse. Hegseth has now held events with one billionaire who funded a documentary about the president's wife and another who was part of his administration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MADRID — European potentates have gone to war with Elon Musk and his X platform, sensing that the liberation of political speech could spell electoral doom for them. Leading that fight is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is seeking to muzzle X for the criticism of his proposed amnesty of illegal immigrants. Sanchez announced last week the legalization of some 500,000 illegal immigrants, though at least one Spanish commentator told me that it was actually closer to a million. His slavish state television immediately cast the measure as “moderate.” Irene Montero, the party's top political strategist and a former minister of equality for Sanchez, told a rally in Zaragoza that the amnesty was intended to win votes. “I am asking migrants and racialized people to please not leave us alone with so many fascists! Sanchez announced his intention to legalize these illegal immigrations to mollify Podemos, which has long demanded amnesty as the price for its support. Then came the kicker, as Montero, swept up in her own fervor, shouted, “Yes, hopefully we'll have replacement theory. I want the replacement of fascists and racist people.” Ian Miles Cheong posted, “It's not even a secret anymore. This is electoral engineering.” Musk saw that and reposted with one word: “Wow!” Virality ensued. But one can't enact a successful replacement if everyone notices. The prime minister used an address he had scheduled this week at the Dubai World Government Summit to unload on X and Musk. “Just last week, the owner of X, a migrant himself, used his personal account to amplify this information about the sovereign decision by my government, the regularization of 500,000 migrants that live, work and contribute to the success of our country,” Sanchez said, as if amplifying news, i.e., reporting it, should be a crime. After listing many supposed crimes by X and other social media platforms, Sanchez said, “Some may say that if we don't like social media platforms, we can simply leave them. That no one is forced to use X or TikTok. Sanchez then listed exactly what steps his government will present to Parliament; few had anything to do with sparing minors the harms of online activity. “Next week, my government will implement the following actions,” he said. The first was one of the most draconian: hold platform executives legally accountable and open to criminal liability for failing to remove illegal or hateful content. Second was the turning of “algorithmic manipulation, and amplification of illegal content, into a new criminal offense.” So X, Facebook, etc., will cease to be private entities. Third, the Spanish government will pretend to “track, quantify, and expose how digital platforms feed division and amplify hate.” In other words, you have to give information exactly how Sanchez's minions on Spanish media would. Add your own critical take, however, and you are criminally liable. The fourth was the only one that really addressed minors: Spain will ban access to social media for those under 16 years old. Spain, he added, will defend Spaniards “from the digital Wild West.” In other words, if these proposals become law, Spain will cease to be truly free. In reality, it is not just leftist forces that want Musk out of Europe. Sometimes it seems like the same group that was burning down convents, raping nuns, and assassinating political opponents right before the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War has been brought forward by a time machine. There are no longer anti-clerical mobs going around Spanish cities and towns, torch in hand, but they talk the same way.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But there's a decent chance that there are at least a few parrots in your neighborhood, too: About one in 20 US households owns at least one pet bird. There's the popular parakeet, a small parrot native to Australia and other regions south of the equator; there are the cockatiels, who appear to have perpetual bed-head, with a tuft of feathers springing from their forehead; and a diverse cast of other parrot species: macaws, lovebirds, amazons, conures, African Greys, cockatoos, and many more. Some 13 million birds are kept as pets in the United States, making them the fourth most popular type of pet and a sizable share of the broader exotic pet market, which also includes fish, lizards, snakes, chinchillas, and frogs. Cats and dogs may get most of the attention, but these smaller, more wild animals account for around 40 percent of the US pet population. Add to that the fact that owners often aren't well equipped to provide the enrichment and individualized care these animals need, and keeping them as pets becomes much more ethically thorny than it otherwise might appear. The harms of bird ownership stand out the most, if only for the stark reason that in captivity, pet birds can't do what millions of years of evolution has propelled them to do: fly. And given their advanced cognitive capacities, captivity is likely particularly stressful for them — and exacerbated when kept alone, considering that many are highly social. Liz Cabrera Holtz of the animal advocacy nonprofit World Animal Protection put it bluntly: ”These are wild animals whose physical and psychological needs are not even close to being met.” A new investigation suggests that this might be common when they come from “bird mills” — high-volume, large-scale operations that breed birds for the retail pet market. Last year, a prolific animal cruelty investigator who goes by the pseudonym Pete Paxton, due to the clandestine nature of his work, toured and covertly filmed several US bird mills and shared his investigation exclusively with Vox. He has seen animals beaten, starved, hanged, and shocked. “I did not expect it to be as bad as it was,” Paxton told me about his new investigation, which is one of the first such exposés of the industry that supplies pet birds to millions of American homes. Paxton's investigation began last spring in South Texas, just 20 miles north of the Mexico border. He was there to visit a bird breeding operation called Fancy Parrots, which has more than 3,000 parrots of various species on site, including African Greys, macaws, and cockatoos, locked in rusting cages across 17 barns. The barns each had a roof but no sides, which meant they could get some fresh air and sunlight, but it also meant they were vulnerable to weather extremes not found in their native habitats. Some of the birds had plucked some of their feathers out, which Alix Wilson, an exotic pet veterinarian, told me is abnormal. The reasons for feather-plucking are often behavioral in nature, Wilson said, due to boredom, stress, or sexual frustration from the inability to mate, though it can also be brought on by disease or poor diet, according to UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. The eggs of larger parrots are typically taken away and placed in artificial incubators, which can trigger the females to lay more eggs. After the chicks hatch, they're reared either by humans or adult parrots. About two decades ago, Wilson briefly worked at a parrot mill. “I quickly became aware of the issues of just confining these animals and just basically breeding [them] for profit,” Wilson told me. Those issues included fighting, which resulted in wounds and missing eyes and toes; resource-guarding (some birds keeping other birds away from food); parent-chick separation, either immediately after birth or post-weaning; and cramming birds into crates for long-distance transportation to pet stores. Bird breeders are legally required to provide enrichment for their birds, such as perches, swings, mirrors, and other objects the birds can manipulate to express natural behaviors. Fancy Parrots declined an interview request for this story. During the tour, Paxton was told that Fancy Parrots supplies to a “Petco distributor.” Petco declined an interview request for this story, though a spokesperson said over email that “Fancy Parrots is not nor has ever been a Petco vendor.” But it is also possible Petco does sell birds from Fancy Parrots, which underscores a major issue in tracking exotic pets in the United States. Breeders typically don't market their juvenile birds directly to large retailers like Petco. Instead, the animals first get purchased by intermediary operations called brokers. (Petco did not respond to follow-up questions about whether it might indirectly source birds, via a broker, from Fancy Parrots.) Months after visiting Fancy Parrots, Paxton headed to Central Oklahoma, where he toured a massive parakeet breeding operation about 70 miles east of downtown Oklahoma City owned by a family named the Pletts. The parakeet mill, he said, reminded him of egg-producing operations, where chickens are crammed into stacked cages — “factory farm-like,” Paxton said. These ones are killed, the man explains, by suffocating them in bags. “There are always some dead,” the man is heard saying. Paxton visited another parakeet breeder in Oklahoma, some 60 miles farther east, run by relatives of the Pletts. In one barn, the birds allegedly had no perches or enrichment of any kind, which are required by the Animal Welfare Act. Paxton also found several dead, featherless chicks decomposing atop cages. “Both facilities were filthy, with every surface I could see being dusty, dirty, and in some cases piled with manure and old feed,” Paxton said. As terrible as the conditions were, they may well be typical of how most soon-to-be pet birds are reared in the US, rather than exceptions. “These bird mills I filmed are not outliers,” Paxton said in his investigation video. “All of the places that I went to are USDA-licensed, government regulated. Essentially, these places are operating legally and [largely] in compliance, so when it comes to bird mills…that's as good as a place can get.” (Disclosure: In 2024, my partner worked on a short-term consulting project for the latter group.) Beyond captive breeding, some birds that wind up in US homes have been taken directly from the wild, according to a new analysis by the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity using federal government data. From 2016 to 2024, the US imported more than 37,000 birds on average each year, with 5 percent of them — 1,865 birds — plucked from the wild. It's a small share, but the true number could well be much higher, as it's not uncommon in the exotic pet trade for importers to launder wild-caught animals through captive-bred operations and mislabel them. Paxton's investigation reveals a paradox in the exotic pet trade. Surveys show that people buy parrots in large part because they're “fun to watch” and have at home, given their exotic looks, intelligence, sociability, and some species' capability for human-like speech. But parrot owners are also highly motivated, surveys show, to buy a bird for companionship, love, and affection. And yet, they're bought from businesses that frequently treat them with just the opposite. The most pressing and obvious one is captivity, as it puts the animals in an unnatural environment and prevents them from engaging in basic natural behaviors. Some birds may be kept in bigger cages — and many are provided with a fair amount of time outside their cage, or even free reign of a room or entire home — but they're still captive all the same, and deprived of meaningful flight. “If you confine a bird, they're just very messy — they poop a lot, and when they eat, they make a mess, and so it doesn't take much for the birds to end up in a really filthy environment,” Wilson said, not unlike what Paxton saw at the bird mills. Another is the sedentary lifestyle imposed by captivity, which — especially when combined with diets high in fatty nuts and seeds — can lead to obesity, Wilson said. Feather plucking and other self-destructive behaviors are common among pet birds, too, with estimates of it afflicting some 10 to 17.5 percent of these animals, suggesting general distress. Parrots' high intelligence could worsen the harms of captivity. A 2021 study found that the larger a captive bird's brain, the more likely they were to develop behaviors that indicate stress, such as abnormal and repetitive pacing and cage bar biting. Other issues include lack of enrichment and access to veterinary care, and bird owners' lack of knowledge about what their pet needs. Even the most devoted bird owners, Wilson said — the ones who are with their birds around the clock, who don't go on vacation, and who even cook for them — will fall short: “There's no way anyone could reasonably provide good welfare to those animals in captivity.” And many bird owners, she said, aren't prepared for these animals' long lifespans: Some popular parrot species can live up to 50 years or longer. Long-lived pet species — parrots, but also some turtles and snakes — often end up shuffled around to different homes or to underfunded animal sanctuaries when their owner dies, divorces, moves, or can no longer deal with the difficulty of keeping them as pets. Few understand this better than Karen Windsor, the executive director of Foster Parrots and the New England Exotic Wildlife Sanctuary, a Rhode Island-based animal sanctuary. Windsor told me that a lot of people fall for these birds after seeing videos of parrots who seem to talk so conversantly with their owners. And the industry is “still pumping out new birds,” Tennant said. If it's impossible to meet birds' complex needs in captivity, then there's only one logical conclusion: We should stop breeding them. But breaking the pet bird habit might be easier said than done. Keeping parrots as pets was largely a niche hobby in the United States and Europe up until the 1970s, when interest began to surge. So how can we start to shift away from bird ownership? We could start by making their purchase a little harder. Hundreds of US jurisdictions — mostly cities and counties but also some states — have banned pet stores from selling cats, dogs, and sometimes rabbits, instead only allowing adoption, though none of these laws have yet included birds. World Animal Protection, the animal advocacy nonprofit involved in Paxton's investigation, is advocating for that to change, and if successful, it could make a meaningful impact; nationally, more than half of all pet birds are currently purchased from pet stores. For decades, bird breeding operations were exempt from the Animal Welfare Act, which means they weren't inspected by the USDA for potential welfare violations. For the millions of American households that already have a pet bird, they can give their animals as good of a life as possible. For those still seeking to get a pet bird, they should adopt instead of shop. “If you want to buy a bird as a pet, the first thing I would say is, ‘I love that you love animals, that's fantastic,'” he says in his investigation video. “But since you love animals, do something that's going to help them…you could volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary, or at a bird rescue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian general serving as deputy head of Russian military intelligence was shot and seriously wounded in Moscow on Friday, officials said – the latest in a series of attacks on top military figures. The committee has opened a criminal case into what it called the attempted murder of a high-ranking defense ministry official. Alekseyev has been transferred to a city hospital, the Investigative Committee statement said. The Russian general was one of several GRU officials sanctioned by the United States in 2016 for wide-ranging malicious cyber activity directed at undermining US democratic processes. He was also sanctioned by the European Union in January 2019 following a nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, which the British government said was carried out by GRU agents to poison a former Russian spy. A Ukrainian intelligence report on Alexseyev claims he has been responsible for “the organization of the preparation of initial data for launching missile and air strikes on Ukrainian territory,” including on civilian targets, as well as being responsible for the illegal referenda in the occupied Ukrainian territories. Ukraine has also accused him of war crimes in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a Friday press briefing that the intelligence services were investigating the attack and would report any findings to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added: “We wish the general survival and recovery.” “It is clear that such military leaders and highly qualified specialists are at risk during a war,” Peskov said when asked about the security of military officials' residences. A neighbor of Alekseyev told Reuters that she heard several shots around 6:30 a.m. local time Friday. The woman, who only gave her first name as Alexandra, said she “woke up because of shots” and rushed outside the residential building alongside other neighbors. Another resident had already called police, who arrived by 7 a.m., she said. Friday's shooting in Moscow comes one day after Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met for trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates, where the Russian delegation was led by their military intelligence chief Kostyukov. Ukraine's negotiation team also said the talks were “truly constructive” in a comment to news agency RBC-Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said they'd “agreed that the next meeting will be held in the near future.” But beyond a prisoner swap that took place on Thursday, which saw 314 POWs exchanged, no major breakthroughs were announced by either side. Despite the diplomatic engagement, Russia's attacks on Ukraine have continued this week. At least three Ukrainian people were killed and 15 people injured in Russian attacks within the last day, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday. Russia launched two ballistic missiles, five cruise missiles and hundreds of drones overnight into Friday, hitting the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Kharkiv. ‘We have to keep people warm': The Ukrainian energy workers risking their lives as Russia targets critical facilities In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian attack on Friday heavily damaged an animal shelter, according to the city council, which released video showing several animals injured or killed. In the capital Kyiv, where temperatures are below freezing on Friday, 1,100 high-rise residential buildings remain without power, according to local authorities. In the two districts of Kyiv that have been hit hard by attacks on energy infrastructure, about half the schools are operating without heat. “The Kremlin is doubling down on war crimes, deliberately striking homes and civilian infrastructure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday, as she announced the EU is tabling its 20th package of sanctions against Russia. “This is not the conduct of a state seeking peace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top federal prosecutor in Minnesota is urging an appeals court to move quickly over a key immigration enforcement dispute, saying his office is buckling under a flood of lawsuits against the Trump administration's mass deportation push in the Twin Cities. U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said his short-staffed office has been forced to abandon “pressing and important priorities” to manage hundreds of emergency habeas petitions filed by immigrants arrested and detained during Operation Metro Surge. Rosen, a Trump appointee confirmed by the Senate in October, said his office's civil litigation team in his office is “down 50%” following a wave of resignations and departures at the start of Operation Metro Surge. Remaining attorneys, he said, are appearing daily for emergency hearings, often on nights, weekends, and holidays. “The Court is setting deadlines within hours, including weekends and holidays. Lawyers are continuously working overtime,” Rosen wrote, adding that swift appellate intervention is “desperately needed.” DOJ attorneys said the “crushing burden” of immigration litigation has forced U.S. attorney offices across the circuit to divert resources from “other critical priorities, including criminal matters.” Immigration advocacy groups have so far been able to make the Trump administration appear as if it is losing the legal battle over its mandatory detention policies by following rinse-and-repeat patterns in district courts. In Minnesota, groups such as the American Immigration Council or the American Immigration Lawyers Association file a habeas petition to a federal judge, who more often than not grants temporary release to the detained immigration enforcement target. The Trump administration's legal justification for indefinite detentions pending final orders of removal hinges directly on the Immigration and Nationality Act's § 236(c), which permits arrests and detainment pending a final deportation order. With the passage of the INA, Congress tasked immigration courts with handling removal proceedings, thereby stripping district courts of jurisdiction over immigration matters. More than 300 district judges in Minnesota and elsewhere have so far rejected the government's mandatory detention policies, ordering detainees released or granted bond hearings. However, resolutions to this debate may be on the horizon. And according to Rosen, relief cannot come soon enough. In his Jan. 30 court filing, he asked the 8th Circuit to reach an “immediate resolution” upon its review of the briefs, or, if not, to promptly schedule an oral argument hearing. “Absent expedited review, the resources of this Office will continue to be drained as hundreds more habeas petitions are filed,” Rosen said, warning that “other important responsibilities and other priorities will be compromised.”</p>
