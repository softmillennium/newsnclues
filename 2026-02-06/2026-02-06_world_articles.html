                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some fear that accepting grants from a little-known federal agency would open institutions up to scrutiny and control. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. This story was originally published by ProPublica.ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. A library in rural Alaska needed help providing free Wi-Fi and getting kids to read. A children's museum in Washington wanted to expand its Little Science Lab. They received funding from a little-known federal agency before the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to dismantle it last year. The Institute of Museum and Library Services is now accepting applications for its 2026 grant cycle. Former agency leaders from both political parties, as well as those of library, historical and museum associations, expressed concern that funded projects could encourage a more constrained or distorted view of American history. Some also feared that by accepting grants, institutions would open themselves up to scrutiny and control, like the administration's wide-ranging audit of Smithsonian exhibits “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.” An agency spokesperson told ProPublica it is not unusual for the institute to publish directors' letters with grant applications, and that this one informs readers “about this Administration's thematic emphases in the semi-quincentennial year.” He did not comment on criticisms that those letters insert political themes into a historically nonpartisan program. “Under President Trump's leadership, IMLS is working to revitalize our cultural institutions, urging less traditional applicants to consider working with us, and to promote civic pride and a deep sense of belonging among all Americans,” he said, adding that any institution that “meets programmatic requirements and goals” outlined in the funding opportunity “will receive all due consideration and undergo peer review.” Its long-running grant programs promote community engagement and public access to information, while bolstering institutions' ability to care for collections and prepare for disasters. One grant, named after former first lady Laura Bush, helps recruit and train library professionals. Last March, Trump attempted to eliminate the agency through an executive order and fired director Cyndee Landrum, a career library professional. To head the agency, the administration appointed Deputy Secretary of Labor Keith E. Sonderling, who does not appear to have prior professional experience in museums or libraries. (An institute spokesperson didn't comment on concerns ProPublica passed along about this.) In a press release announcing his appointment as acting director, Sonderling said, “We will revitalize IMLS and restore focus on patriotism, ensuring we preserve our country's core values, promote American exceptionalism and cultivate love of country in future generations.” The grants were reinstated under court order in December, and the agency is now accepting applications for 13 grants whose awards range from $5,000 to $1 million. ProPublica spoke with directors who ran the agency under every previous presidential administration dating back to Barack Obama's. Though each era brought different priorities, they said, those changes were implemented with input from the field — not by encouraging applicants to align their work with a president's worldview. Crosby Kemper III, a lifelong conservative Republican appointed by Trump to lead the agency in 2019, stayed on into President Joe Biden's term. While he was not a fan of the former president's emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion and feels that the library and museum fields needed a course correction from their natural lean to the left, he believes that what is coming out of the current Trump administration is not helpful. “All these Trump executive orders — and I mean all of them — are just extensions of his own animus towards anybody who disagrees with him and his outsized ego,” said Kemper, who called the orders “nonsense” and the grant guidelines “horrific.” “It's clear the administration wants a whitewashed story, if you'll pardon the pun there. The institute spokesperson did not comment on either of those questions. Sarah Weicksel, the American Historical Association's executive director, said institutions are even worried about how they would be perceived if they took the funds. Questions also remain about whether enough staff is left to process the applications properly. The agency did not answer a question about its current staffing, but in its most recent Congressional Budget Justification document, it requested support for 13 full-time employees. Typically, each grant application is reviewed by volunteer library and museum experts. “I couldn't find it anywhere in the documentation,” she said. Patty Gerstenblith, distinguished research professor of Law at DePaul University, agreed, saying that the administration's actions raise serious First Amendment concerns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• US-Iran negotiations: Indirect nuclear talks between American and Iranian officials in Oman today were a “good start” and will continue at another time, according to Iran's foreign minister. • Funding fight: Senate Majority Leader John Thune said conversations on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will continue this weekend. The White House said Trump is willing to consider some of Democrats' demands for ICE reforms, but others are “non-starters.” • Fulton County: Trump defended the involvement of spy chief Tulsi Gabbard in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office. • Outrage over video: Trump shared a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, prompting a rare rebuke from the Senate's only Black Republican, Tim Scott, who called it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” It has since been deleted. The US and Iran have agreed to hold follow-on discussions after consultations with their capitals following today's indirect talks in Oman, an outcome cautiously viewed as a positive result by both sides, according to source familiar. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff led for the US previously, along with a small team that joined him over time, but Trump's son in law Jared Kushner was in the room this round, and US Central Command Commander Admiral Brad Cooper was part of the delegation. His presence marks the first time a senior US military official joined indirect talks with Iran during Trump's second term. Some context: The Iranians grew frustrated with Witkoff over the course of last year's talks and some people involved believe that having new US players could lead to more productive discussions, the source said. In terms of timing, that also remains unclear right now, the source said. Some people involved in the talks believe that slowing down the pace could allow for more robust negotiations to take place, they said. The White House did not respond when asked for comment. After the talks ended, in a sign that the US wants to keep up economic pressure, it rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels carrying it. A racist video shared on President Donald Trump's Truth Social account has been deleted, with the White House now blaming a staffer for posting it late Thursday. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a senior White House official told CNN. The post, which depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes, remained online for roughly 12 hours before it was removed from Trump's Truth Social feed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially downplayed the video in a statement Friday morning. Swift backlash: Politicians from both parties, including GOP Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler, urged Trump to remove the post. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday that the FBI has arrested a “key participant” behind the 2012 Benghazi terror attack in Benghazi, Libya. US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in the September 11, 2012 attack along with State Department employee Sean Smith and Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods are killed in the attack. “We have never forgotten those heroes, and we have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said. A plane that departed Misrata, Libya, on Thursday landed at the Manassas Regional Airport in Virginia at 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to flight data reviewed by CNN. Bakoush was charged eleven years ago, but the case remained sealed until his arrest Friday, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. That's all I can say,” Bondi said at a news conference. Bondi added she is not worried that Gabbard's presence may have tainted evidence in their investigation. The administration has offered differing explanations for Gabbard's presence. Here's what Deputy AG Todd Blanche told CNN earlier in the week: GOP Sen. Tim Scott criticized President Donald Trump for sharing a racist video that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, writing Friday that Trump “should remove it.” “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X. It was decided that this process would continue but the timing, manner, and date of that will be decided in the future,” Araghchi said. “But I do not want to judge now,” he said. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said both parties will make a decision on the next round of talks after consultations with their respective governments. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the negotiations, described the talks in a post on X as “very serious.” The US military conducted a strike against another alleged drug-trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean yesterday, killing two people, according to US Southern Command. “On Feb. 5, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM Commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOM wrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike. At least 119 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of a campaign, dubbed Operation Southern Spear, that the Trump administration has said is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States in the Omani capital of Muscat have now ended, with a “willingness to continue,” according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. Iranian state-affiliated news agency Tasnim said the two countries have agreed that talks will “continue at another time,” without specifying when. Throughout the day, the Iranian and US delegations “conveyed views, considerations and approaches” through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led the Iranian diplomatic delegation, while President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff represented the US. The Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM) Adm. Brad Cooper was also seen in attendance. President Donald Trump shared a racist video on his social media platform that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, sparking intense condemnation. In a statement to CNN on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the broader response to the video “fake outrage.” CNN has reached out to the Obamas for comment. Later last year, Trump and members of his administration also shared digitally altered images and videos of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero, imagery Jeffries publicly described as racist. Today, President Donald Trump will sign executive orders at 3 p.m. As of now, this is closed to the press. The commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), Admiral Brad Cooper, was seen attending meetings on Iran in Oman. A video posted by the state-run Oman News Agency showed Cooper participating in talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-la, Jared Kushner during their meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. Peskov also described this week's trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US, hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi, as “both constructive and challenging.” “But there is an understanding, and this was also discussed in Abu Dhabi, that both sides will take responsible positions, and both sides recognize the need to begin negotiations on this issue as soon as possible,” Peskov added. US President Donald Trump said yesterday that the US should negotiate a new and improved nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to a treaty extension. “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Ahead of high-stakes talks with the US on Friday, Iran's foreign minister said his country “enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year.” “We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X hours before the talks. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric—they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement,” Araghchi wrote. Araghchi also met his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Oman's capital Muscat ahead of the talks with the US delegation, Iranian media reported. Araghchi told Albusaidi that Tehran is “utilizing diplomacy to secure Iran's national interests” while being “fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and national security” against “adventurism,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will “continue through the weekend.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for not presenting a clear rebuttal to the Democratic demands on funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Thune has also expressed frustration about not being able to get the Democratic side to sit down and negotiate, and many Republicans have said many of the Democratic demands are nonstarters. High-stakes talks between the US and Iran are underway in the Omani capital of Muscat, Iranian news agencies reported early on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the Iranian diplomatic delegation, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff are representing the US. Araghchi presented to his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi a “preliminary plan” to “manage the current situation” between Iran and the US and advance negotiations, Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. The White House previously offered limited expectations for negotiations, saying President Donald Trump preferred to resolve tensions diplomatically and that he would receive a briefing from his delegates to the discussions afterward. Trump hopes the large US military buildup he's ordered in the Middle East will act as leverage as he seeks concessions from Iran on its nuclear and missile programs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The messages between Casey Wasserman – who, along with chairing LA28, is also a prominent entertainment and sports agent – and Maxwell were included in the millions of documents released by DOJ last week related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. In another email, dated April 1, 2003, Wasserman, who was married at the time, says to Maxwell: “Where are you, I miss you,” before asking to book a massage. Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Messages for Wasserman left through his talent management company and a crisis public relations firm that represents him were not immediately returned on Thursday. In a statement to other news outlets, Wasserman apologized for his communications with Maxwell while adding he “never had” a personal or business relationship with Epstein. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. While some aspects of Wasserman's association with Epstein were already known, the emails show a deeper and far more intimate relationship with Maxwell than had previously been revealed. Wasserman's communications with Maxwell took place years before she was convicted of a crime. Several local officials in Los Angeles have called for Wasserman to step away, describing the stakes of the Olympics as too great to be put at risk. “Los Angeles cannot trust our financial future to someone connected with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,” City Controller Kenneth Mejia said in a post on X, calling for Wasserman to “take accountability and resign.” Los Angeles City Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, who also called for Wasserman to step aside, said in an interview with Spectrum News that she was “incredibly disappointed” to learn of Wasserman and Maxwell's close relationship, adding it “really undermines the legacy of what these Games are supposed to represent.” Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, also calling for Wasserman to resign, said her opposition to his leadership in LA28 was “not about shaming him for his past indiscretions.” “I worry Casey Wasserman's continued leadership almost guarantees that our Los Angeles Olympic Games will be tied in subsequent press coverage to his association with a notorious sex trafficker.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that it is “critical to be 100% focused on making our city shine and ensuring the 2028 Games are the best in Los Angeles' history,” but did not go as far as asking for Wasserman's resignation. Several members of the LA28 board, which includes nearly three dozen prominent names in business, entertainment, sports and politics, also did not respond to requests from CNN asking if they maintain confidence in Wasserman's ability to lead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The high court now requires its employees to sign nondisclosure agreements that threaten legal action for leaks. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Chief Justice John Roberts told the court's employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement pledging to keep the court's internal workings secret. The new agreement now reportedly threatens legal action against any employee who reveals confidential information. By contrast, a watered-down ethics rule adopted two years ago says that Supreme Court and other federal judges are not required to publicly disclose their meals or overnight visits at residences owned by private persons or corporations. “Instead of promoting trust and opting for greater transparency in the ethics of individual justices, the Supreme Court has chosen more secrecy,” Ellen Yaroshefsky, Professor of Legal Ethics at Hofstra Law School, told Truthout, responding to the new nondisclosure agreement policy. “Instead of promoting trust and opting for greater transparency in the ethics of individual justices, the Supreme Court has chosen more secrecy.” This new nondisclosure agreement requirement follows leaks of internal court documents, including Politico's May 2022 publication of Samuel Alito's explosive draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade, and revelations about ethical lapses of the court's members, notably Clarence Thomas. The new nondisclosure agreements come at a time when public trust in the Supreme Court is at a near record low. A June 2024 Associated Press poll found that 70 percent of Americans think the members of the court are more influenced by ideology than impartiality. This means just what it says — these decisions take place in the shadows, away from public scrutiny, without full briefing and oral argument, and with little or no explanation. Cameras are still prohibited in the Supreme Court's courtroom. In 1996, then Supreme Court associate justice David Souter told a House appropriations subcommittee, “The day you see a camera come into our courtroom it's going to roll over my dead body.” Allowing cameras in the Supreme Court “would lessen to a certain extent some of the mystique and moral authority” of the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist told a 1992 judges conference. Cameras are still prohibited in the Supreme Court's courtroom. But as David Dow and I argued in our book, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television and the Pursuit of Justice, Supreme Court arguments should be televised. They don't need television exposure to keep their jobs. Federal judges likely ask themselves, “Why take chances with an impartial electronic witness that can beam your every slip-up, every excess, to thousands or millions of taxpaying spectators, all in the name of giving them greater access to their own court system?” So what are the Supremes hiding behind their new-and-improved nondisclosure agreements? “If the public were aware of how much of the deliberations affecting millions of people are made by 27-year-olds [clerks] after happy hour, they'd be shocked,” Nikolas Bowie, a Harvard law professor who clerked for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, told the Times. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In wake of Donald Trump's call for Republicans to ‘take over' voting, senator Ruben Gallego urges citizens to take a stand and give the ‘ultimate response' The Democratic senator Ruben Gallego has proposed that, should Donald Trump try to sabotage the midterm elections, Americans should respond with a general strike that would “grind the country to a halt”. Earlier this week the US president called for Republicans to “take over” and “nationalise” voting in at least 15 unspecified locations, repeating his false claims that elections are plagued by widespread fraud. On Thursday, Gallego, a senator for Arizona and an Iraq war veteran, warned that Trump could seek to interfere with the November midterms that will determine control of Congress – and urged citizens to fight fire with fire. “We have to prepare for the outmost scenario, the worst scenario, which is they try to either capture the ballot box as ballots are being counted, they try to stop the count, they try to surround polling places, whatever it is,” he told the Court of History podcast with political historians Sidney Blumenthal and Sean Wilentz. If you drive a train, do not show up. Gallego, who defeated Trump loyalist Kari Lake in 2024, has gained a reputation as a blunt speaker who sometimes uses profane language to take the fight to Republicans. “If we have to destroy the stock market to save democracy, we need to accept that and, more importantly, the richest and the most powerful people in the world and in this country need to understand that that is a real possibility. Trump's push to expand federal control over elections comes as his administration has stepped up pressure on many Democratic-led states to turn over voter data, with the justice department suing nearly two dozen states over their voter rolls. His remarks were echoed by Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential rightwing commentator, who repeated false claims that people living in the US illegally are voting in big numbers and said on his War Room podcast on Tuesday: “You're damn right we're gonna have ICE surround the polls come November.” Federal law prohibits the president from deploying military troops at any location holding a general or special election, and several states criminalise carrying firearms at or near polling places. Immigration enforcement could cause both US citizens and legal residents to stay at home out of fear of detention or racial profiling. Asked about Bannon's comments on Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “I can't guarantee that an ICE agent won't be around a polling location in November – but what I can tell you is I haven't heard the president discuss any formal plans to put ICE outside of polling locations.” He told the Court of History: “We need to show that this is not acceptable. You cannot go to the levels that we used to invade other countries for, basically, for doing such autocratic shit. “They won't even stand right now the fact that you have ICE agents roaming in our neighbourhoods without warrants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Santa Clara, California, where nearly half of residents were born outside the US, fear builds as game approaches While Homeland Security Investigations teams that are focused on preventing human trafficking and the sale of counterfeit goods have long worked the event, immigration operations would be unusual. People were afraid of being targeted simply for having brown skin, she said: “They're afraid to send their kids to school. There's fear that maybe they should leave during the Super Bowl if the city is going to be inundated with ICE agents.” “We are confident of that,” said Cathy Lanier, the league's chief security officer. Gavin Newsom, California's governor, said on Thursday that his office had been “assured there will be no immigration enforcement tied to the game”. “DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin. Officials in Santa Clara county were already anticipating a demanding year ahead as the area prepared to host some six World Cup games this summer and the Super Bowl. The threat of an ICE presence added new challenges. As the Trump administration has implemented its mass deportation agenda and staged aggressive operations in which agents have killed two US citizens, alarm has spread across the US. Although northern California has had low ICE arrest rates, communities there have been readying themselves. Santa Clara county has a rapid response network that tracks ICE activity and provides verified information to residents. Lee said at a recent board of supervisors meeting that ICE agents don't have “absolute immunity”, and that local law enforcement would arrest anyone who “comes into our county masked, spreading terror, breaking laws or threatening our residents”. The county is focused on ensuring it will be a safe event, and enforcement activities would bring chaos. ICE activities in Minnesota created havoc, Lee said, with “incompetent chaos [and] trigger-happy gunmen”. And certainly does not make our community safer,” he added. On Monday, the US representative Ro Khanna, whose district includes Santa Clara, and some 21 other members of Congress sent a letter to Noem demanding that the DHS not deploy immigration enforcement personnel. “This should be a moment of celebration, unity and economic opportunity, not a flashpoint for fear, polarization and violence,” they wrote. If there were an ICE presence, she said, local law enforcement would not cooperate with the federal agents, as state law mandates. “I'm trying to calm the waters here to let them know that we have their back in Santa Clara,” she said. “In the event [ICE] did come, we're going to uphold the law no matter what, but they're not going to get any assistance from us.” After this game, it's going to reappear again no matter what.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice-President JD Vance addressed a conference called by the United States to encourage the world to co-operate with it in breaking China's dominance in critical minerals. 2 in an administration that has spent the last year slapping allies with tariffs, insults and demands for territory – told a room of officials from 54 countries that he hoped they could come together “to form a trading bloc among allies and partners,” because “our alliances and our friendships can really help one another.” He continued in this vein for some time, closing with “let me just reiterate: We here, I think all of us, are friends.” The audience of diplomats must have struggled to not burst out in laughter. On Thursday, also in Washington, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked whether the Trump administration wants free trade with allies and friends. “If Canada, for example, came to the United States and said, ‘We're going to zero tariffs on the United States,” asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. Opinion: In Carney's world, Canada is more powerful than Trump thinks There are Canadians who still believe that everything the Trump administration has said, threatened or done against us is, at root, our fault. I see it in my mail and on social media. It is minority opinion, though depressingly widespread among Conservative voters. Yes, Canada had negotiated barriers in some relatively small sectors such as dairy products, while the Americans bent the rules to levy tariffs in discrete sectors including softwood lumber. But for more than 35 years, Canada-U.S. trade was almost entirely free. The Trump administration convening a conference to try to foster an industrial alliance against China is particularly ironic – given that the Trump administration has spent the last year aggressively degrading and dismantling all such alliances. Because Canada, following the lead of our U.S. ally, put 100-per-cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The Biden administration understood that the North American auto industry was under threat from Chinese industrial strategy, and responded with a North American industrial strategy – a strategy of partnering with allies like Canada. They've bullied automakers to shift production to the U.S. from Canada, and there have been repeated public statements from President Donald Trump and his minions that the integrated North American auto industry should be an America-only industry. Canada's industrial base, once a partner, is now prey. In 12 reckless months, it has torpedoed free trade; forced erstwhile partners against China to cut (solo) deals with China, as Canada had to do to lower canola tariffs; threatened to occupy NATO allies; and erected trade barriers aimed at ensuring the U.S. buy less from Canada. What remains of our free trade with the U.S. is a tattered USMCA, shot through with holes and cracks down to the foundation. The same day as a Janus-tongued Mr. Vance spoke in Washington, former prime minister Stephen Harper gave a speech in Ottawa. He told them to get over their illusions about the situation next door. Mr. Harper has described himself as the most pro-American prime minister in Canadian history. But on Wednesday, he said that the main challenge facing our country is “a hostile United States.” He continued, “There are many, particularly in the business community who believe that things will go back to the way they were in due course, with secure and predictable access to the U.S. market and a United States that upholds a global order. “I do not believe that is a safe assumption.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2026 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseev has been shot multiple times in Moscow by an unknown assailant, the Kremlin said on Feb 6. "There was an attempt on the life of Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeeev in Moscow. He was taken to hospital, and a criminal case has been opened," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov told reporters. Moscow's accusations come as Russian forces continue both offensive operations across the front line, and their long-range strike campaign against energy infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, despite an alleged promise from Russian president Vladimir Putin to U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to pause such strikes. He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2016 for organizing "malicious cyber activities" during the U.S. presidential election of that year which saw Donald Trump win his first term in office. Alekseev has also been accused by the U.K. and EU of orchestrating the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018 that targeted Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. They survived, but a British civilian who later found the poison was killed. "Even if Alekseev survives this time, he will not sleep peacefully. And one day the matter will be brought to an end," Prokopenko added. Alekseev was also instrumental in quelling the short-lived Wagner rebellion in 2023, being one of those sent to negotiate with Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has not been officially linked to the shooting and is yet to comment, though Kyiv has previously targeted Russian officials involved in Moscow's full-scale invasion. Most recently, Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff's operational training department, was killed in a car bombing in Moscow on Dec. 22. Sarvarov was taken to the hospital but later died from his injuries. Chris York is news operations editor at the Kyiv Independent.

The changes will target units that are responsible for intercepting Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. "Today, I was watching Ukrainian (prisoners of war) who returned home from Russia, and these are the people who deserve the Peace Prize," Moldovan President Maia Sandu said. No damage was recorded, the Polish military police reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Matthew Tkachuk (left) and Brandon Hagel (right) dropped their gloves in the opening seconds of play at last year's 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, the game took on a deeper, more personal meaning for Canadians.Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images When Mark Carney spoke in Davos last month about the need for Canada and other nations to stand up for themselves, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been waging a global tariff war and making 51st-state threats, the Prime Minister said it was time for Canada to assert its sovereignty. He then went off script, adding an impromptu line that wasn't part of his planned speech. At the Milan Cortina Winter Games, where sports and politics are about to collide against a backdrop of Canada-U.S. vitriol, hockey is set to emerge as the front line of a new proxy war. Gone are the days when Canadian Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents made friendly wagers on Olympic hockey – as Stephen Harper and Barack Obama did in 2010 and 2014, resulting in several cases of American beer being shipped to Ottawa. Relations are far frostier these days, and even the players know this tournament just feels different than any other Olympics in recent memory. “We didn't come to the game thinking about politics. It just kind of panned out that the tournament happened at that time,” said Brandon Hagel of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who played for Canada at that tournament and will do so again in Milan. Seth Jarvis (24) is a late addition to Team Canada, filling in for an injured Brayden Point. The two played for Canada in last year's 4 Nations tournament.Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press Hagel, who doesn't consider himself a fighter, was in the middle of it all, readily accepting a challenge from American Matthew Tkachuk two seconds after the puck was dropped. The fight has enshrined him as a national hero of sorts. “You can't ever understate what politics did to that tournament,” Cooper said. The ice at Milan's hockey arena is ready to go – but just barely A showdown between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union at the 1969 world championships, just months after Soviet tanks rolled into Prague, is considered some of the dirtiest and most heated hockey ever played. Then there was 1972 and Canada's clash with the Soviets. In the stands, former Soviet legend and retired NHL star Igor Larionov, who was there doing colour commentary for Russian TV, felt nostalgic. “What's happening in the world right now – two countries trying to push each other with disagreements and politics – I've been around, I lived on this stage myself in ‘84 and ‘88 … that's war,” Larionov told me at the time. “I'm sure they got a phone call from upper management to play hard,” he quipped, noting that the Kremlin had probably tuned in to watch that night. Canada's best medal chances at the Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to our experts I mean, Canada is so proud of their hockey and it's something that we take very seriously,” Tampa forward Brayden Point said in an interview this fall. “So to get the win, I think that was bigger than just our team winning. Point is injured and won't get the chance to play in Milan. On Thursday, Team Canada announced he would be replaced by Seth Jarvis of the Carolina Hurricanes, who was also on the 4 Nations roster. American Auston Mathews is less eager to talk politics. The Toronto Maple Leafs captain, who is expected to lead the U.S. in Milan, said a few weeks ago he wasn't concerned about such things. “I don't really pay attention to that stuff much. “When we go to the Olympics my focus will be on Team USA.” As head coach of Canada, Cooper is curious whether the games in Milan will reach the level of raucousness that the 4 Nations games did, given that they were played in Montreal and Boston, with an arena full of Canadian and American fans. “Whether that's going to be recreated in Italy, when you're multiple time zones away in a different continent, it's hard to sit here and say. It is the granddaddy of them all,” Cooper said in an interview. It's just going to be a different vibe.” Cooper has seen the impact that can have. “I think those kids put the jersey on for the first time, it meant something way beyond hockey,” Cooper said.

A California man faces criminal charges after federal investigators say he sent texts demanding bitcoin payment for the return of “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, who disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last Sunday.

The texts were sent to Guthrie's daughter and son-in-law on Feb. 4, after the family published an emotional video pleading for kidnappers to contact them about their mother in response to a ransom letter sent to a news station two days earlier, according to the FBI.

The FBI has not linked the texts to the Feb. 2 ransom demands.</p>
