                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a flood of criticism hit Donald Trump over a vile online video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, the post has suddenly been deleted. Contacted by Deadline, an administration official said Friday, “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. Nine days into Black History Month, the posting from Trump's Truth Social account was made around midnight ET. The witching hour is a pretty standard time for Trump to jump online, precedent has shown. It should be pointed out there are no apes in The Lion King. On Friday morning, even Trump loyalists began to speak out against the attack on the former POTUS and FLOTUS, with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) calling it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” Scott, who at one time was considered VP material and is running to be governor of South Carolina, was joined in his condemnation by New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler today. “The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,” Lawler tweeted. Among other Democrats, the response was quick and blunt. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. Do they actually think we're going to believe their lies? This is a distraction from the other distractions. “ The most racist thing I have seen coming out of this White House “ , thanks Scott for acknowledging not just this racist post, but that others have come from this administration/Trump. Yet you have stood by him even though he has a decades long history of discrimination against blacks and insulting them. The group chat was like we can go half racist but we can't go full racist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Shark Tank” favorite Barbara Corcoran opened up about being fired from the hit show before filming even started. The real estate maven revealed that she was let go and replaced by another female investor before filming for season one even began. Corcoran sat down with Tamron Hall for the Thursday, February 5, episode of her talk show to discuss the current season of “Shark Tank,” when she dished on being unceremoniously fired. I know you signed the contract already and I know you thought you were coming out next week, but we hired another woman to take your place. The beloved investor refused to take no for an answer, however. I said, ‘Time to stand back up for myself,'” she recalled. “I wrote an email telling him that I considered his rejection a lucky charm. Everything good happened to me after rejection in my life. I'd like to be out there on the plane next Tuesday and compete for the seat. “The better part of the history was me leaving for lunch and seeing my competitor, her Gold Star taken off her trailer. I was like, ‘Good for her,'” Corcoran added. After earning her spot in the Tank, the New Jersey native has gone on to appear in every season of the hit series since it's August 2009 premiere. “I thought it would last maybe two years,” she told Hall on Thursday. I didn't know if people would have the appetite to watch it, but I forgot that people would buy into those entrepreneur dreams.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate has acquired worldwide distribution rights ahead of the European Film Market to the upcoming psychological horror film A Head Full of Ghosts, which has David Harbour (Stranger Things), Rebecca Hall (The Beauty), and Esmé Creed-Miles (The Sandman) in final negotiations to star. Filming is being lined up for March on the film from Team Downey, The Allegiance Theater and Fifth Season. Fifteen years later, her sister Merry faces her family's haunting past with a journalist, uncovering the very nature of the evil that destroyed them.” Based on the 2015 novel by Paul Tremblay, the film will be written and directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, the duo behind the German-language cult horror Goodnight Mommy, which was Austria's 2014 Oscar entry for Best Foreign Language Film. Lionsgate will be selling international rights to the movie at next week's European Film Market in Berlin. The studio will also handle domestic distribution, which is always a positive for international buyers considering pre-buys. Adam Fogelson, chair, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said: “We're thrilled to partner with Team Downey, The Allegiance Theater, and David Gambino, and our friends at Fifth Season, who collectively bring exceptional prestige and creative confidence to the project. It's no surprise that Stephen King called this book his favorite novel of the past decade and said that it ‘scared the living hell' out of him – which says it all.” Team Downey is represented by WME and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A California property that used to be owned by the late “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek is selling for a little under $7 million. First hitting the market last June for $8.88 million, that amount was later adjusted to $7.88 million before finding its current price. Co-listing agent Mike Goldfarb of Coldwell Banker Realty, told Mansion Global, “It's like adult summer camp.” Sunset also notes that “the 11-bedroom, 13-bedroom sprawling ranch estate [was] built in 1900. History buffs will also appreciate relics such as the original Highway 58 bridge and a blacksmith shop.” “A truly unique legacy estate, 535 Calf Canyon Hwy blends family retreat with working ranch, vineyard, and winery,” listing agent Lindsey Harn, owner of Lindsey Harn group, told Sunset. “Surrounded by the mountains, lakes, wildlife, and open space, the property feels timeless, yet connected—offering room for 30-plus guests and generations to come.” Sunset notes that Trebek then went on to buy out other partners. Trebek's former property can be found in Creston, which is around 30 minutes from San Luis Obispo in the Central Coast area. “Over the last 10, 20 years, the Central Coast has really carved out its own niche as being a premier destination for wine enthusiasts,” Goldfarb told Mansion Global.

That same month, Kardashian cried over co-parenting with West during an episode of the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast. “I just can't really engage,” she said in last year's episode. Kardashian and West have also butted heads over her love life since splitting, with the Grammy winner infamously taunting his ex-wife's first boyfriend post-divorce, Pete Davidson, in 2022. The Hulu personality reflected on the experience on “Call Her Daddy” in October 2025, saying, “That made me feel really sad. Kardashian has since been linked to Odell Beckham Jr. and Tom Brady, most recently making headlines for her and Hamilton's romance.</p>

Reviews are technically under embargo until next week for Emerald Fennell's splashy, bodice-ripping adaptation of Emily Brontë's “Wuthering Heights.” But flamboyantly adulating first reactions all over X might suggest they are only under embargo if your feelings aren't positive. IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcasts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio have both seen the movie, as have many of the press corps coast to coast. Led by global stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the lusty, coming-unrepressed Catherine and Heathcliff, the “Saltburn” and “Promising Young Woman” filmmaker's eye-popping latest will make scads of money for Warner Bros. The film should expect to continue a winning streak that launched last year with “Sinners” and potentially be in the crafts awards conversation.

It's been called “intoxicating, transcendent, tantalizing, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic,” “scorching hot,” an exquisite spectacle,” and “a breathtaking work of visual art.” (Variety rounds up the reactions nicely here.) You're unlikely to see a lot of negative feedback on social media right now — unless you look at some of the international response since this lushly designed film had a premiere in Paris earlier this week. This is not your high school syllabus version of “Wuthering Heights,” to be sure. Whether that's for better or worse, well, we will dive into that more next week when the movie opens February 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the premise of Taylor Swift‘s eagerly awaited video for her The Life of a Showgirl single “Opalite,” which debuted on Apple Music and Spotify on Friday morning (Feb. 6). The retro-themed clip features Swift as a miss lonely hearts who spends her days pining for love in her bachelorette pad with her only companion coming in the form of a pet rock. Normani Stars in 'Sports Illustrated' Swimsuit Issue With Brittany Mahomes & More NFL WAGs, Says Beyoncé Is Her Dream Collab: 'She Is Her Standard' Four Years After CNCO, Erick Brian & Christopher Vélez Reunite on 'Bajo Cero' The clip opens with a grainy, VHS-like throwback late night infomercial ad for the magical Opalite spray, which promises to turn your relationship “crappiness to happiness” with just one spritz. Between making fold-up “cootie catcher” fortune telling games and friendship bracelets by herself, smearing glitter on herself and her stone, which she takes along to karaoke and a bar, Swift seems content with her inanimate companion. After seeing actress Greta Lee (The Morning Show) on MTV strumming a guitar, Swift orders drinks for her and her pet rock. Next, we see Swift doing a Jane Fonda workout on a step along with Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen & Slim), with her rock taking the place of weights. “You couldn't understand it/ Why you felt alone,” she sings as we see actor Domhnall Gleeson (The Paper) living an equally lonely life, laying in bed with a sleep mask on his forehead as he looks longingly at his companion, a tiny cactus tucked in next to him. He also takes his pal everywhere, even as his face and hands are increasingly swathed in bandages due to the plant's spikes. Desperate for relief, both he and Swift order some Opalite, which they spray on their significant nothers, at which point a goo-covered Swift magically appears in Gleeson's living room. The awkward couple begin their unlikely romance, with singer Lewis Capaldi making a cameo as a mall photographer who shoots them in increasingly bizarre poses. Other cameos include British talk show host Graham Norton as the owner of an Opalite shop and actor Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) as an Opalite pitchman. The retro fun reaches its peak with a glittery dance routine featuring Swift and Gleeson doing adorable couples choreo at a dance competition where the elderly judges — as well as Swift dancer favorite Kameron “Kam” Saunders — seem unimpressed with their routine. The clip, written and directed by Swift, ends with a call-back to a Norton Show appearance in October featuring the new video's cast, during which Gleeson expressed his desire to one day be in a Swift music video, which begs the question of whether his comment was a bit, or a long con Easter egg Swift had planned all along? In an Instagram explainer Swift revealed, “When we were all talking during the broadcast, Domhnall [Gleeson] made a light hearted joke about wanting to be in one of my music videos. And so a week later he received an email script I'd written for the ‘Opalite' video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton Show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn't mandatory. This time, however, Swifties will have to wait two days to see “Opalite” on YouTube, as it debuted today on Spotify and Apple Music only. The decision to delay the YouTube premiere follows YouTube's December announcement that it was withdrawing its streaming data from all of Billboard‘s charts. YouTube's withdrawal came on the heels of Billboard‘s Dec. 16 announcement of a change to chart methodology that will continue to weigh subscription streams more favorably than ad-supported streams, in a bid to better reflect changing consumer behaviors and the increased revenue derived from streaming in the industry. The change means that paid/subscription streams will be weighted against ad-supported streams at a 1:2.5 ratio, narrowed from the previous 1:3 ratio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Directed by Swift herself, the '90s-themed video—which is exclusive to Apple Music and Spotify until February 8—finds Swift in a dead-end relationship with a literal rock, only to be saved by a spritz of a spray potion called “Opalite” and the arrival of charmer Domnhall Gleeson. The two of them embark on a romantic adventure that occasions cameos from Cillian Murphy, Greta Lee, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Lewis Capaldi—all of whom, a coda reveals, were Swift's fellow guests when she appeared on the UK late-night TV show of Graham Norton (who also appears in the video). I was a guest on one of my favorite shows, @TheGrahamNortonShowOfficial. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's a UK late night show where Graham Norton (the insanely charismatic and lovable host) invites a random group of actors, entertainers, musicians, etc to be on his show and we all sit there and chat like it's a dinner party. Cillian Murphy, Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee, @JodieSmith, and @LewisCapaldi. All people whose work I've admired from afar. When we were all talking during the broadcast, Domhnall made a light hearted joke about wanting to be in one of my music videos. And so a week later he received an email script I'd written for the Opalite video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn't mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90's with us and help with this video. A YouTube upload will follow on Sunday, according to a countdown posted yesterday on Swift's website (where Swift is selling an “Opalite” vinyl single for 48 hours). Swift's decision to withhold the video from YouTube follows the platform's recent decision to pull its stream counts from the Billboard charts, in protest of how Billboard weights ad-supported streams. Pitchfork has emailed YouTube for comment on this quirk of the “Opalite” rollout. The first Life of a Showgirl video, for “The Fate of Ophelia,” was also written and directed by Swift herself and released, with the album, last October. Shortly afterwards, the album beat Adele's first-week sales record and Swift was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

She plays a lonesome cat lady, who is hilariously dating a rock, but falls for “the revolutionary fix for your problems” that is Opalite. In an infomercial, the product promises that it “magically transforms your problems into your paradise using our state of the art chemical potion. It seems Swift called up everyone she appeared on The Graham Norton Show back in October (including Norton himself, who stars as a Nope-alite salesman) to make an appearance. Domnhall Gleeson plays her formerly sad love interest, Lewis Capaldi is a mall photographer, while Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith make small appearances in television ads. In an appearance on Capital FM in October, Swift affirmed the track continued to be his favorite off the album. ‘Melania' Attains Biggest Critic-Audience Disparity in Rotten Tomatoes History Trump Posts Wildly Racist Video of the Obamas Stephen Colbert Says ‘Melania' Numbers Impressive ‘Until You Realize It's Less Than 10 Percent of Budget' 'STFU': Mark Ruffalo Slams Kevin O'Leary After He Attacks Billie Eilish's Anti-ICE Speech The move coincides with YouTube's decision to withdraw its data from Billboard charts following changes to the charts' methodology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local producers have cautiously welcomed the new government guidelines, which will require streamers and channels to invest at least 8 percent of their net local turnover in locally-made content. German commercial broadcasters and international streamers are, unsurprisingly, attacking new government plans, unveiled this week, to force them to invest more in local productions. Ahead of the Berlin film festival, which kicks off Feb. 12, Germany‘s Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer unveiled the broad outlines of a plan that would require global streamers and domestic TV stations to invest at least 8 percent of their annual net turnover in European film and TV production. 'Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest' Director on Her Feature Debut About Life Between Cultures and "Non-Judgment" (Exclusive Berlin Trailer) Together, it's hope the proposals will help boost a struggling local industry. German is Europe's biggest television market and, behind France and the U.K., the continent's third-largest film market, but has been hit hard by the combination of rising production costs and declining local investment from streamers, who have broadly shifted from big-budget prestige projects like Netflix's Dark or Amazon Prime's The Gryphon, to cheaper reality TV formats and smaller scale dramas. “The German film industry has been waiting a long time for this signal,” said Michelle Müntefering, CEO and representative for the executive board at German production body Produktionallianz, in a statement. “Good stories need not only creativity but also reliable framework conditions so that ideas can become tangible productions.” Germany's historic backlot Studio Babelsberg also welcomed “the long-awaited agreement,” saying it sent a “strong signal” for Germany as an attractive production location.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joey Isaks is reading the menu of options for bets on the Super Bowl halftime show, trying to decide if there's anything he's interested in putting some money down on. Isaks is a professional gambler, and he's made some fairly big scores on the Super Bowl halftime show over the years. “The last one I made a lot of money on was probably the SoFi one … ‘What color shoes will Snoop Dogg wear? '” Isaks' win was in the low five figures. This year an enterprising gambler can find places to bet on all sorts of propositions for Bad Bunny's halftime performance. While regulated American sportsbooks like FanDuel or DraftKings are generally restricted by state laws to only taking bets on “authorized sporting events or closely related outcomes,” American prediction markets (which fall under federal commodity and futures regulations) and offshore sportsbooks (which aren't located in the U.S.) will take bets on just about anything you can imagine. In addition to the aforementioned offerings, there are bets on what color Bad Bunny's hair will be, what kind of hat he will wear, and who might make an appearance onstage with him. The possibility of him wearing a dress,” says Adam Burns, sportsbook manager at BetOnline.ag. “Tití Me Preguntó” is the odds-on favorite at 1-2, but there are some long shots on the board like “I Like It” at 18-1. At the Panama-based offshore sportsbook BetOnline.ag, you can bet on Green Day's first song and whether or not Billie Joe Armstrong will call Donald Trump “fat.” “We've got a prop on how many times the camera will cut to a confused-looking older guy in the crowd,” says Robert Cooper, odds manager at SportsBetting.ag. Fans were expecting a blowout, so Jay Kornegay, manager of the sportsbook at the Imperial Palace casino in Las Vegas at that time, gathered his staff and came up with more than 150 bets on the game to keep fans engaged in what was otherwise going to be a one-sided affair. It worked, and every year since, the menu at sportsbooks across Nevada continued to expand. Halftime shows for many years were also fairly boring affairs. In 1992, the halftime show was considered such a bore that the fledgling Fox network aired a special episode of the sketch comedy show In Living Color to coincide with halftime, complete with an onscreen timer to let viewers know how much time they had left before they needed to change the channel and catch the second-half kickoff. They've never again had to worry about viewers tuning away. “The year after the Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson fiasco, we posted a prop asking if there would be another ‘wardrobe malfunction,'” says Jacob Crossman, director of trading at BetDSI.eu. In 2006, you could bet on what the Rolling Stones' first song would be (it was “Start Me Up”), and in 2007, you could bet on whether Prince would split his pants onstage (he didn't). “The first time I can recall a Super Bowl halftime show prop bet was at Super Bowl XLIV in 2010,” Mason says. “The Who was the performing artist, and there was a prop on how many ‘guitar windmills' Pete Townshend would execute.” “I think one of the most famous, or infamous, was in 2013 when we offered odds on whether or not Beyoncé would show cleavage,” Burns says. While sportsbooks (and professional sports bettors) will determine the odds for a typical on-field Super Bowl bet using statistical modeling tools like linear regression and Monte Carlo simulations, when it comes to halftime show bets, there's just not really data to work with. “There's not a lot that goes into it. It's all speculation … more art than science,” Crossman says. “A mix of frantic Googling, watching three TikTok predictions, and what we overheard at the water cooler. “People go through previous set lists,” he says. “So if he opens that tour every time with X song, then you maybe think he's going to open it again.” But Isaks doesn't put much stock in those methods. “I mean, that sounds like a waste of time.” The only real reason to bet on these bets, according to Isaks, is if you already know the winner ahead of time. The sportsbooks have a simple way to protect themselves against this type of insider trading: They don't take very much money on these bets. “We only allow customers to make relatively small wagers on these props. You can't come in and bet $10,000 on Bad Bunny's first song. There are many people who know what he's going to sing first, so we have to protect ourselves against that insider knowledge,” Burns says. (The maximum bet on any of BetOnline's halftime show props is $25.) Sometimes, though, that inside information might still not be good enough to win a bet. In 2024, when Usher performed, he opened his show with a few lines from the song “Caught Up” but blended it into the song “My Way.” Some sportsbooks paid “Caught Up” bettors, some paid “My Way” bettors, and at least one sportsbook, BetOnline, paid both. “Even though Apple releases the set list after the show, they still didn't grade it by that,” he says. ‘Melania' Attains Biggest Critic-Audience Disparity in Rotten Tomatoes History Trump Posts Wildly Racist Video of the Obamas Stephen Colbert Says ‘Melania' Numbers Impressive ‘Until You Realize It's Less Than 10 Percent of Budget' 'STFU': Mark Ruffalo Slams Kevin O'Leary After He Attacks Billie Eilish's Anti-ICE Speech In years past, trafficking in this inside information was highly lucrative because a number of sportsbooks would take sizable bets. Today, almost nobody will take more than $10 or $25. Now I don't even know if you can make $1,000 on it,” Isaks says. Robert Cooper at Sportsbetting.ag isn't too concerned with getting beat by inside information, limits or not. He says, “Our average bettor is a dude whose girlfriend introduced him to Bad Bunny and all the corresponding conspiracies last week, so we're not too concerned about inside information beating us.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest – the title of her feature directorial debut describes how Viv Li, a self-described Chinese artist wannabe, has been feeling ever since she got stuck in Berlin after the COVID pandemic and ventured into the German capital's alternative culture scene.“A Chinese misfit ricochets between Berlin's alternative frenzy and Beijing's family order, transforming cultural whiplash into an offbeat search for identity and a playful quest for belonging,” reads a logline for the genre-bending movie that world premieres in the Berlin International Film Festival‘s Panorama Dokumente section on Feb. 13. 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Star Gavin Casalegno to Lead Rom-Com 'Sunflower Child' (Exclusive) U.K. Production Spend Hits $9B in 2025, Film Investment Sets Record Thanks to 'Wuthering Heights,' Beatles Movies and 'Avengers: Doomsday' But her family in China just can't stop wondering why she is such an oddball. “Drifting between new environments and traditional expectations, Li is constantly adapting to shifting opinions about herself, the world, and, of course, China, only to feel more lost than ever,” highlights a synopsis of the film. In Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest, we follow Li as she searches for herself, her identity, and a sense of belonging and acceptance in a globalized world. The result is a deep dive into the question: how do you deal with your own culture after you have learnt another? Li's journey is a kaleidoscope of, at times surreal, encounters. “As I slowly put on the ‘hat' of a Berliner, I realized that all these years of learning to be the other, of being accepted, has weighed heavily on my mind, quietly mirroring the reality of my upbringing and where I am coming from,” Li, who has made the shorts I Don't Feel at Home Anywhere Anymore, Accross the Waters, and You Jian Chui Yan (A Soil A Culture A River A People), says in a director's statement. “But when I was finally home in Beijing, it became difficult to take off all the ‘hats' and to see my own face again.” The editor is Christoph Bargfrede, with sound design courtesy of Marcel Walvisch. Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest is produced by Corso Films in co-production with 100% Film and ZDF – Das Kleine Fernsehspiel. The producers are Daniela Dietrich, Erik Winker, Martin Roelly, and Ümit Uludağ. The co-producers are Olivia Sophie Van Leeuwen, and Ruby Deelen, Mediawan Rights is handling world sales. So, without further ado, check out an exclusive trailer for Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest. Li talked to THR via Zoom from China about the path to her feature debut, why Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest will speak to people around the world, and what's next for her. Can you share a little bit about why you decided to go on a search for identity via this film? And then, at one point, I realized, “Oh, holy shit, something is changing in me” after being abroad for so long. I was trying to adjust to all these things, and all these things stayed with me and were engraved in my memories. That's why, with the film, I wanted to portray the effect of memory and how these effects on us are constantly shifting. How do you feel about your search now? I got a lot more into Buddhism recently. Nobody can really know who they are, because we're always changing. We are so scared of death, but one day, if you really accept that you're going to die, then that fear will go away. And if you accept that there is no stable, static way of your being, you can feel quite comfortable with moving around. There is a scene in the film where you guys are discussing how you learned how to be friends from watching Friends. Can you explain this and what it means?Yeah, when I was young, I was learning English, and one of my aunties gave me these pirated DVDs of all Friends episodes. I actually have Friends episode scripts printed there. I found it really interesting because you always see people like Phoebe saying, “Okay, can I talk to you a second over here?” And their behavior towards each other was so different from how I grew up, and I found that was the first really interesting, very intimate experience of how other people live. That was how I learned English and how I learned the first steps of being in a Western society. There is also a scene in your film that felt so timely. It's a discussion about how the world is doomed, but we are all arguing and fighting with each other… That scene was not always in the cut. Then my editor and I looked at the whole film, and we realized [this scene] does something to the film. Ultimately, the film is about non- judgment and non-definition. How easy or difficult is it to be in front of the camera and share various emotions with audiences? But there is something I learned from my short film [I Don't Feel at Home Anywhere Anymore] that served as the beginning of the project. When I stepped in front of the camera rather than staying behind it – you already hold power as a director, you relax people. They will feel, “Okay, Viv is with me in front of the camera. How much are the scenes we see in Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest real, or how much are they scripted or set up? I just feel that the original moment has its own power or vibe. The power of documentary is that you can really fall back on those moments and let those moments guide you. That's what I was trying to do with my film. I feel that sometimes, with the world becoming so colorful and so many things going on, we tend to want more definition so we can feel safe within a box and stuff like that. Yes, this time, I am writing a fiction script. So I do want to take a break from being alone. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exactly how long Ser Dunk (Peter Claffey) sits in that cell isn't clear. It's long enough for the torchlight dancing off the damp stones of House Ashford's dungeons to play tricks with ser's eyes. It's a moment of strange, cosmic beauty rarely found in the televised A Song of Ice And Fire and a brief, calming reprieve for our hero from the stresses of the night and morning to come. There's no shooting star in this sky (though one does appear for poor Dunk later on, courtesy of Youssef Kerkour's Steely Pate), but the fleeting serenity it provides is gift enough. In an episode rife with symbolism and meaning, that vivid night sky represents Ser Dunk's inner clarity and why he meets the chaos of Westeros with such an open heart. That's what makes the final moments in this week's episode so heartbreaking, at least before Prince Baelor Targaryen (Bertie Carvel) rides unheralded to save Dunk from defeat. Brought before the people of the Reach to rally two more knights to his cause—another predicament courtesy of Prince Aerion (Finn Bennett), who invokes a trial of seven after Dunk put a fist through his royal visage—the silence that meets him is stunning. With that stink, a question hangs in the air: What hope does a good man have against the powerful, cruel, and indifferent? Take comfort in knowing Dunk's kindness is what has gotten him this far, despite last week's dramatic detour. That's the moment when Aerion, offended by Tanselle Too-Tall's (Tanzyn Crawford) slaying of a mummer's dragon, snapped her finger in two. Dunk, driven by righteous indignation, put him on the ground—no less than what's expected from a chivalrous knight. They vow to protect the innocent, he later reminds Prince Baelor, and even if he may have never said the words, he assessed an ugly situation with open eyes, saw an innocent threatened, and, with a just heart, took action. Predictably, the regret he feels as he stews under lock and key isn't for defending Tanselle but for not seeing the real mummers' show performed right in front of him by his newly entrusted squire, Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). “It's just a bit of bad luck we found each other, isn't it?” Dunk says to Egg, who enters the dungeon in the colors of his house and with tears in his eyes. More than that, he's a little boy who wanted nothing more than to squire for his brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), who instead shaved the boy's head and drank the tourney away in hiding. Would he have squired for a donkey under the circumstances? But he wound up with Ser Duncan to their mutual benefit. While Egg's motivations are understandable and even forgivable, Prince Baelor points out—firmly but fairly—that little Aegon should never have brought Dunk to Tanselle's rescue; that was no kindness. “One need not intend harm to do it,” he says. Baelor, like Egg, knows which members of their house are trouble, but family remains family, for good or ill. “The septons say we must love our brothers,” Baelor says, understanding both Egg's anger and the mechanisms that keep House Targaryen in power. As Dunk later discovers, Targaryens use their adopted religion not just to assimilate into the realm they conquered, but to their advantage when it benefits them, as Aerion soon proves. Equally telling is how deftly Baelor navigates his family's latest tantrum, stating the case made against Dunk while seeing right through it. Aerion casts Tanselle's puppet show as high treason (innocent though it may have been, it was “far from wise, even in peacetime,” he says), and Daeron, found by his father Maekar (Sam Spruell), accuses Dunk of kidnapping Aegon as a robber knight. Whether Baelon believes any of it isn't up for debate—he doesn't, as Dunk eventually learns to his relief—but it hardly matters. Still, this exchange reflects how tenuous Targaryen rule has become. Yet love is hard to come by when dragons torment the smallfolk. And now for Dunk's latest pickle: finding six knights willing to face Aerion's in a trial of seven. Ancient tradition holds, by Baelor's telling, that if seven champions fight against seven in tribute to their gods, the guilty will be punished. (Note how Carvel looks at Bennett as he delivers the final line, direct but not without careful affection; also check his muted amusement as Aerion wriggles justification for his cowardice in front of Maekar.) Aerion finds his recruits easily—his lord father, drunken brother, and three Kingsguard are easy gets, as is the pliable Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley)—while Dunk learns how cheaply justice can be sold when Steffon trades his brief oath for a promised lordship. Yet where ambition attracts opportunists, justice gathers the worthy: Egg rallies Ser Lyonel Baratheon (Daneil Ings), the humbled Ser Hardyng (Ross Anderson), mad Ser Rhysling (William Houston), and Ser Beesbury (Danny Collins) by dawn's light, with Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas) offering his sword as a fresh knight as well. Only one knight remains—and if Baelor “Breakspear” makes Dunk wait, it's not due to reluctance but the weight of donning armor against one's own blood, even when the cause is so plainly just. This takes us back to something Dunk says to Raymun before hope rides onto the tourney grounds at Ashford. “Maybe the gods figure this is what I deserve…for not knowing my place.” Everyone in Westeros has a role to play, big or small, and Dunk is no different. But why does it weigh so heavily on him? It's a striking image, Dunk pondering who he is and what he must become to honor the memory of Ser Arlan. (For the deceased ser's part, that memory offers a good-natured shrug.) What use is a knight if he doesn't defend the innocent? For starters, he should be someone who is true to himself, who doesn't hide what he really is. Yet just before dawn, Steely Pate gives Dunk his shield—with Tanselle's parting gift of a shooting star over a mighty elm and all the hope it carries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Note: This article contains descriptions of alleged sexual misconduct. Bethany Cosentino has shared an open letter calling on Casey Wasserman—the founder and CEO of her agency, Wasserman—to step down after his name and old emails appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files. In 2021, a New York court convicted Maxwell of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually traffic minor girls; she is currently serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. Wasserman Music has represented Cosentino and her band Best Coast since 2021. In her statement, Cosentino demanded Wasserman change its name, and said she has requested to remove both her and Best Coast's names from the agency's website. Cosentino described her statement as a “refusal to continue lining the pockets of people so closely tied to shady business and toxic, deeply harmful people.” She added: “Artists are not interchangeable assets. Many of us, myself included, are survivors. We deserve systems that let us work without asking us to compromise our values in exchange for opportunity.” In his own statement to the press, shared on February 1, Wasserman said: “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light. I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Per Variety, Wasserman's communication with Maxwell included an email where Maxwell offers to give Wasserman a massage, and another where Wasserman writes to her: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” The files indicate that Wasserman and Maxwell remained in contact after a September 2002 flight to Africa, which former president Bill Clinton reportedly organized to conduct HIV research. A 2003 Vanity Fair report noted that Epstein, Maxwell, Wasserman, billionaire Ron Burkle, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker were among those on board. Wasserman Group oversees hundreds of high-profile musicians and sports players; artists currently on the roster include Kendrick Lamar, Coldplay, Skrillex, Chappell Roan, Animal Collective, Wet Leg, the Knife, and Geese. During a press conference on February 4, International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry said she had “nothing to add” to Wasserman's statement on the files, per the Los Angeles Times. In 2024, Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas left Wasserman Music for WME shortly after a Daily Mail report alleged Wasserman had engaged in inappropriate relationships with multiple female subordinates. It has come to my attention that the founder and CEO of my agency, Casey Wasserman, had a documented romantic relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell between the years of 2001 and 2003, and multiple documented connections and communications with Jeffrey Epstein confirmed by emails now part of public record. Staying quiet isn't something I can do in good conscience - especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Casey's response, that these emails are “deeply regretted,” is not enough. Regret without accountability is just damage control - an attempt to move on while the rest of us are expected to sit with the discomfort of our careers being publicly tied to him. Artists are tired of swallowing scandals like this. We are tired of learning, over and over, that men who control access, resources, money, and so-called safety in our industry are given endless grace. We are tired of being asked to treat proximity to something horrific as an unfortunate situation we should simply move past - especially when the person involved still holds all the power. And we are tired of watching harm minimized or brushed off as "a long time ago," while the impact of that harm is still very real, especially for women and survivors of sexual assault. It is a refusal to continue lining the pockets of people so closely tied to shady business and toxic, deeply harmful people. I do not want my name on the website of a man who was ever a personal friend of an accomplice to a literal pedophile, or associated with Jeffrey Epstein himself. I have worked with my agent, Sam Hunt, for over 15 years who has done incredible work in representing me. The position Casey Wasserman has put his agents in is inexcusable. Many of us, myself included, are survivors. We deserve systems that let us work without asking us to compromise our values in exchange for opportunity. Because people in power can't keep skating by. And because the artists keeping the lights on at Wasserman deserve support, not to be ignored while men in power are protected. It is important for us as artists to remember: these people work for us, not the other way around.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To say that Rob Rausch has snake-charmed his way through this season of The Traitors is an understatement. The Love Island alum has amassed a cabal of groupies both inside the castle (we see you, Dorinda Medley) and out (per The Cut, TikTok at large) with his shirtless overall wearing and disarmingly quiet nature. It's been impressive to see just how long that spell would hold over this season's cast, with Rausch's heartthrob status and low-key charm thus far successfully masking his sinister schemes and ruthless gameplay. So it's equally entertaining to watch that viper meet his venomous match in fellow Traitor Candiace Dillard Bassett, who's fanged and ready to take him down in the wake of his betrayal against Lisa Rinna last episode. “A careful assassin serves her revenge cold,” Candiace hotly kicks off this week's ep. “So right now I'm putting my platter in a good ol' deep freezer and when the time is right, I will pull it out and serve it.” With Rinna banished, there's a space to fill in the turret. Rob and Candiace can either murder a Faithful as usual, as host Alan Cumming tells them, or recruit one to join them in their cloaked duplicity. The bulk of the house is indeed throwing Candiace's name around, especially with that glaringly retaliative vote against Rob during last week's roundtable. It certainly doesn't help her that Rausch himself—who still has that deadly dagger advantage, giving him not one but two votes in an upcoming roundtable—is fanning the speculation by claiming Colton dropped her name before he was banished. Candiace is far from happy, then, when Rob is chosen as one of three players to get a potential shield in this week's mission, which requires the rest of the house to reenact paintings and have the trio of seekers (Rausch, Kristen Kish, and Mark Ballas) match them in a dusty old gallery via walkie-talkie. “Everybody wants to drink Rob's bathwater because he's such a Faithful,” Candiace grumbles, but it ends up being a quick-thinking Kish who realizes the shield is hidden inside one of the painting's canvas backings. “You are a snake…if I get banished tonight, your name is coming up,” the Housewife promises. It's not a surprise, then, that their heated rivalry fires up the roundtable. (“Colton was being used as Rob's beard!” Candiace shoots back, which, coupled with Johnny Weir gamely choking out Eric Nam during the mission earlier, will no doubt make a specific subset of the internet go feral.) Candiace, unsurprisingly, votes for Rob, and vice versa, but the coffin nail against the Housewife is actually hammered in by Johnny, who begrudgingly decides to run with the evidence presented and go against his Potomac pal. Yes, we officially have a back-to-back Traitor banishment, with Candiace revealing her treacherous identity to cast cheers. She's left hopeful that the rest of the castle will take her exit as a reason to look more closely at Rob's gameplay: “If they don't? Said snake slithers his way up to the turret that evening solo, but Alan tasks him with recruiting a Faithful into his duplicity. “I can't deal with this,” the crooner cries. This is what happens when you're nice!” It'll be interesting to see if Nam can slink and slide along Rausch or if he, too, will get gobbled up by Rob's game.</p>

Hollywood unions tend to enter the public consciousness only when something goes wrong. Maybe strikes shut down production on your favorite film or TV show. These calamitous moments of industry friction aren't so much disruptions to the movie and TV pipelines as they are rare glimpses into how the entertainment business actually works. As an indie film artist, understanding entertainment unions and their function matters — even if you never plan on joining one. Because, for all its self-aggrandizing mythology, the modern studio system is just a labor force, and like any workplace, when its employees cease doing their jobs, that's when the product stops coming. Related Stories ‘Wuthering Heights' First Reactions: Will Emerald Fennell Deliver, or Is This Just Film Twitter on Overdrive? For impassioned viewers trying to make sense of why movies take so long to fund and to mak, or for fanatical TV experts wondering why seasons keep getting shorter (even on streaming), the transparency provided by unions frequently offers a clearer explanation than the average C-suite press release. Comprised of internally elected union representatives, and nonprofit employees, for the most part, labor leadership broadly shapes how on-set film and TV production work is structured in “mainstream” Hollywood. Learning from patterns of abuse and past mistakes has only grown more essential as modern technology redraws the economics of film, television, and digital content in real time. Revenue models have shifted faster than even A-lister contracts can accommodate, and data privacy remains contested in a fast-evolving landscape that's increasingly fearful of — and reliant on — A.I. Positions once rooted in Los Angeles are now scattered across continents, but in that churn, several Hollywood unions still function as connective tissue between departments and generations of workers. A union film or TV show operates under a collective bargaining agreement negotiated between its producers and an official Hollywood labor union, while non-union productions do not. In practice, that distinction shapes nearly every aspect of an artist's professional experience working on a project — from who can actually be hired, to how long people work, and even who's at fault in an emergency. Union productions must follow established legal minimums for pay, overtime, meal breaks, safety standards, and contributions to professional benefits. These rules exist to prevent a race to the bottom between studios, which was an exploitative pattern that long defined Hollywood as an industry where sixteen-hour workdays were common and job security did not exist. Union contracts also provide grievance procedures, meaning entertainment workers have recourse if the conditions of their employment are violated. To be clear, non-union projects are not inherently exploitative, but they frequently rely on individual creative's skill for negotiation and a sense of communal goodwill — rather than enforceable legal standards. This can allow for flexibility on ultra-low budget or auteur passion projects, but it also places the burden of protection on the workers themselves. With studios taking more risks to stay relevant, the key distinction here isn't creative freedom but scale and sustainability. Note that union agreements can include low-budget tiers designed to accommodate indie efforts, while maintaining their cast and crew's basic protections. For directors, understanding when a project crosses into union territory can prevent costly mistakes and help you plan ahead. There is no single pathway into a Hollywood union, but most follow the same basic principle: You don't join first, but instead qualify for admittance through your body of work. Then, only after a required number of workdays or credits do you become eligible to join your respective union. (Note: Writers and directors generally join once hired on a signatory production, at which point membership becomes mandatory.) That said, initiation fees and annual dues can be significant, which is why many workers delay joining until it becomes professionally necessary. Joining a union too early can restrict access to non-union work as well — but joining too late can also mean missing benefits that keep you in the game longterm. SAG-AFTRA (aka the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) represents performers across film, television, streaming, radio, voice acting, stunts, and other on-camera media. Its membership spans A-list movie stars, background actors, social media influencers, and recording artists. Think anyone whose embodied physical labor is reproduced or broadcast for profit. SAG was founded in 1933 during the Golden Age of Hollywood, when studio contracts often bound actors to strict schedules with limited financial leverage. From stunt regulations to AI protections around digital replicas, the SAG-AFTRA union negotiates minimum rates, residuals, health and pension plans, and safety standards among other issues. Without SAG-AFTRA contracts, productions can struggle to find talent and relevance. SAG-AFTRA's tiered agreements are often the first point of union contact for indie filmmakers. They offer lower-budget pathways that still provide protections for actors, while encouraging directors and producers to engage seriously with the ways performance labor is being devalued and threatened. Founded in 1933, the WGA emerged alongside the Hollywood studio system itself, as writers pushed back against employers who treated their creativity as disposable raw material. The WGA negotiates minimum compensation, residuals, credit determination, and creative rights when it comes to written work. Its jurisdiction over credits is especially powerful, arbitrating decisions that can shape careers, reputations, and earnings. The guild also administers health and pension plans that help make writing a viable long-term profession. Unlike some creative guilds, the DGA encompasses both artistic leadership and key logistical professionals — reflecting how directing bridges both skills of craft and management. The union is known for its relative stability (it rarely strikes), but its contracts are often bellwethers for broader negotiations ramping up… or going south. The DGA has historically influenced other entertainment unions' bargaining strategies, and for indie directors, reaching DGA status can mark a serious transition into higher-budget or studio-backed work. Of course, directors' authority is still contested as production timelines compress in a stressed economy — and creative decision-making become even more data-driven in the era of streaming. IATSE encompasses cinematographers, editors, costume designers, makeup artists, grips, electricians, set builders, and dozens of other filmmaking crafts — all organized into local union representations specialized to those departments. Today, IATSE negotiates wages, hours, safety standards, and career benefits, often fighting against the punishing schedules and burnout that doesn't always register with more public-facing employees at the top. In 2021, the IATSE contract standoff brought unprecedented attention to working conditions below the line and revealed how unsustainable demands had become normalized across Hollywood sets. The group continues to shape budgets, crew expectations, and timelines — drawing out why entertainment labor issues that aren't visible to viewers can sometimes be the most urgent and dire. Though smaller in public profile, its impact on the daily world of Hollywood is immense. Founded as part of the broader Teamsters union, Local 399 became indispensable as productions expanded across Los Angeles and into the broader U.S. Its members move cast, crew, and filmmaking equipment, while their union representatives negotiate pay, hours, turnaround times, and safety regulations. Founded in 1952, during a period of employee unrest at Disney, TAG emerged to protect creative workers who were too often dismissed as technicians or low-level laborers. Over time, the guild became a crucial advocate for animation as a distinct artistic discipline — negotiating wages, benefits, and work classifications (which became particularly vital as animation expanded across streaming and gaming). TAG members have been at the forefront of debates around labor outsourcing, as well as AI-assisted productions workflows, and the erosion of personal IP ownership. For indie artists, there's a growing overlap between animation and live-action production that's worth watching closely. The American Federation of Musicians represents instrumental musicians — who work not only in recording sessions but also on film and television scores, live performances, and digital media. AFM was founded in 1896, fighting early battles over recorded music as it swiftly surpassed live performance labor. That concern echoes loudly in today's union debates as the group negotiates session fees, reuse payments, and residuals tied to infinitely re-playable musical performances. Union scoring can elevate professionalism, but its music requires indie projects to budget. Read more on the official American Federation of Musicians website.
