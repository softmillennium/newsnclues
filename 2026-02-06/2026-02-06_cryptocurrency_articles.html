                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase customers are experiencing pain in new ways as Bitcoin and Ethereum tumble, with losses piling up for thousands of users through the exchange's crypto-backed lending product. Over the past week, Coinbase users have lost $170 million worth of collateral through liquidations on DeFi platform Morpho, according to a Dune dashboard. As Bitcoin and Ethereum notched double-digit declines, some 2,000 users lost $90.7 million on Thursday alone. As users' loans have approached the point of liquidation, some have added more collateral or paid down debts in the form of Circle's USDC stablecoin. Over the past week, around 3,300 users have sat idle as their Bitcoin and Ethereum was whisked away for good. Since its debut last January, the product has originated $1.8 billion in loans. As a risk management tool, all loans on Morpho are over-collateralized by default. The exchange is exploring additional ways for users to protect their loans, they added, acknowledging that crypto-backed loans come with their own set of risks that users should understand. The spokesperson said that Coinbase doesn't earn any fees from users' liquidations. But the company still makes money on the product as a technology provider by receiving a cut of performance fees that are earned by risk managers. In October, when Bitcoin traded near an all-time high above $126,000, Max Branzburg, head of consumer products at Coinbase, told Decrypt that the exchange was “empowering people to help grow their wealth in ways that they couldn't otherwise.” He said he had observed people tapping Coinbase's product to make important moves without needing to sell their Bitcoin, like purchasing a car or renovating a home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP and Solana could soar higher once the crypto market warms up again. Many altcoins, defined as any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin (BTC +7.11%), fizzled out over the past year as high Treasury yields, unclear monetary policies, and other messy macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. However, investors who can stomach some near-term volatility might find a few good buying opportunities before the crypto market warms up again. Let's see why these two smaller tokens could still be worth nibbling on in this choppy market. Its creators minted the entire supply of 100 billion tokens before launch, and it's primarily used as a "bridge currency" to accelerate transactions across Ripple's network. In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple for selling its own XRP holdings to raise capital and argued that XRP was an unlicensed security. But last year, that lawsuit finally concluded with a lighter-than-expected fine for Ripple and a ruling that XRP wasn't a security when it was sold to retail investors. Ripple also expanded by applying for a U.S. banking license and launching its own stablecoin. That expansion could support the increased usage of XRP as a bridge currency. XRP can't be valued by its scarcity in the same way as Bitcoin, and its blockchain doesn't natively support the development of decentralized apps like Ethereum. That expansion -- along with the growing usage of Ripple as a faster, cheaper, and more flexible alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers -- could drive XRP's price higher. Solana was built on the same energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism as Ethereum. That tweak enables Solana to process Layer 1 (L1) transactions at much higher speeds than Ethereum and other PoS blockchains. Solana suffered a significant setback when FTX collapsed in 2022. The crypto exchange held nearly $1.2 billion in Solana tokens and liquidated them to cover its debt. That liquidation, along with rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023, erased all of its massive gains from 2021. Yet Solana continues to attract thousands of developers. The SEC also approved Solana's first spot price ETFs in late 2025. Unlike Ethereum's first batch of spot price ETFs, which didn't include staking (to earn interest-like yields on locked-up tokens), most of Solana's new ETFs launched with staking. Those new ETFs could make Solana a more attractive investment for institutional investors. Its L1 blockchain often struggles with network congestion, outages, and security issues. Its main developer languages (Rust and C) have steeper learning curves than Ethereum's Solidity, and other PoS blockchains are catching up to Solana with faster Layer 2 (L2) solutions that bundle transactions and process them off-chain. But if Solana overcomes those challenges, its price could stabilize and soar higher as it continues to pull more developers away from Ethereum and other PoS blockchains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week's crypto bloodbath hasn't just worried bitcoin owners. It's also sparked fresh anxieties about the future of digital assets. Though the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has been recouping some lost ground so far Friday—it was recently trading around $71,000—the week's losses are still tracking in the double-digits. Other crypto assets have also seen pronounced declines. Altcoins including ether and solana have seen losses of around 25%; Hyperliquid's native token, up about 11%, was a lonely bright spot. Digital asset treasury companies took a beating: Strategy (MSTR), Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) have all seen double-digit pullbacks over the past five trading days. The emergence of artificial intelligence appears to be killing software stocks, and bitcoin, suggesting new technologies are making cryptocurrencies look outdated. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD) and Circle (CRCL) have also also seen double-digitl pullbacks this week, though they, too, were rebouding. Gemini (GEMI), the Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange said it planned to shutter operations overseas and cut 200 people from its workforce as part of a broad restructuring. CoinMarketCap's Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which is calculated using factors including price momentum, volatility, and user engagement levels, remains at "extreme fear" levels. That has given rise to a fresh set of anxieties around digital assets. Bitcoin has been broadly correlated with, or moving alongside, major asset classes including the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, but it has been holding hands with software stocks lately, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky said on CNBC Friday morning. The $60,000 low was a "pretty good level to trade against," he said. Bitcoin ETFs saw roughly $1.25 billion in net outflows in the past three days, with some $434 million of that coming yesterday, according to Farside Investors. But more than 90% of the assets under management between those funds is "hanging tough," Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in a social media most Friday morning, indicating that they mostly haven't sold. But others think more important numbers are those associated with big crypto ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The average bitcoin purchase price for those funds is at $90,000, according to Jim Bianco of Bianco Research, meaning ETF holders are "underwater" with some $15 billion in unrealized losses. "Bitcoin has been more correlated with software in recent months, says BTG's Jonathan Krinsky."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, and seven Chinese regulatory agencies published a joint statement on Friday banning the unapproved issuance of Renminbi-pegged stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at New York University (NYU) Law School and former Managing Director of CIC, China's sovereign wealth fund, told Cointelegraph that the ban extends to the onshore and offshore versions of China's Renminbi, also called the yuan. “The Beijing crypto ban rule applies across all RMB-related markets, whether CNH or CNY,” he said. The announcement follows the Chinese government approving commercial banks to share interest with clients holding the country's digital yuan, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) managed by state authorities. Related: China's interest-bearing digital yuan piles pressure on US stablecoin rules Chinese government briefly considered yuan-pegged stables, but focused on CBDC instead In August 2025, reports began circulating that China's government was considering allowing private companies to issue yuan-pegged stablecoins, a major reversal of long-standing policy. However, the Chinese government restricted stablecoin and digital asset issuance in September of that same year, instructing stablecoin issuers to pause or halt their stablecoin trials until further notice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto markets are adding to overnight gains in U.S. morning trade on Friday, with bitcoin BTC$65,998.81 climbing above $68,000, up nearly 17% since hitting $60,000 late yesterday. Bitcoin is now higher by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Crypto-related stocks are seeing major upside moves Friday after plunging in the previous session. Strategy (MSTR) — which reported a $14.2 billion fourth-quarter loss late Thursdy — is higher by 14%, though at $122, still lower by 22% year-to-date. Those looking for bottom signals are pointing to last night's Strategy earnings call in which Michael Saylor pledged a commitment to leading a Bitcoin security program that will address the quantum threat. Some in crypto have argued that bitcoin's security model faces a serious threat from quantum computing — a threat so imminent that many investors are either selling or refusing to allocate to bitcoin at all. "Saylor's announcement tells me prices have finally gotten the Bitcoin community to acknowledge and address quantum risk," wrote Quinn Thompson. Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, noted that bitcoin is now back at price levels last seen 14 months ago with key momentum indicator RSI flashing deeply oversold conditions. "It would be odd if we did not see at least some short term reversion here," he said. Updated (14:55 UTC): Adds price of bitocin rising past $70,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Capital is exiting crypto at near crypto-winter levels, bitcoin has fallen below $70K wiping out bull-market gains and more speculative digital assets have seen massive drawdowns. As crypto falls, stablecoins are gaining adoption in payments, payroll, and treasury use cases driven by utility, not speculation. The cryptocurrency market's familiar boom-and-bust cycle has entered another pronounced downswing. Crypto treasury firm Strategy is down 81% from its all-time-high, while meme coins such as Trump Coin and Melania Coin are down 95% and 99% from their own respective upper limit valuations. Against this chilly backdrop, one might expect broader blockchain sentiment to be down. Instead, the inverse is happening, with the value proposition of stablecoins and other institutional blockchain instruments in fact rising inside traditional financial workflows. Stablecoins are being pulled into traditional financial contexts where their appeal has little to do with speculation and everything to do with speed, programmability and access. From the European Union's digital euro push to Tether's U.S. updates, stablecoin corporate payroll wallets for global workforces, Y-Combinator's stablecoin seed funding move, U.S. regulatory gridlock and white label issuance, this was a week that showed how the chips are starting to fall for the blockchain finance landscape and why it more and more looks like real-world utility over web3 speculation. See also: How Banking-Grade Crypto Is Replacing Bitcoin's Cowboy Finance In that sense, they are starting to resemble narrow banking instruments rather than crypto assets. As covered here Tuesday (Feb. 3), startup incubator Y Combinator (YC) announced that its latest class of startups can now choose to receive their seed funding of $500,000 from YC in stablecoins. Meanwhile, news broke Monday (Feb. 2) that payments infrastructure company NymCard can now settle card transactions with Visa using USDC stablecoins in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. And this most recent earnings season offered a look into how the world's biggest payment networks are already moving from concept to execution with their stablecoin products. Visa, for example, reported an annualized global stablecoin settlement run rate of $4.6 billion and said it now enables stablecoin card issuance in more than 50 countries; while Mastercard stressed that stablecoins are beginning to function as just another form of currency that benefits from being routed through a trusted global network. Elsewhere, on Jan. 28, the payroll and payments platform Papaya Global partnered with digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks to power its global payroll offerings with stablecoin payouts. These use cases matter because they anchor stablecoins in recurring, non-speculative demand. Of course, as the Thursday (Feb. 5) partnership between stablecoin issuer Circle and prediction market Polymarket shows, speculation hasn't entirely left the landscape, just taken up a different form. The PYMNTS Intelligence and Citi report “Chain Reaction: Regulatory Clarity as the Catalyst for Blockchain Adoption” found that blockchain's next leap will be shaped by regulation; that evolving guidance is beginning to create the foundations for safe, scalable blockchain adoption; and that implementation challenges continue to complicate progress. The debate has reached such a crescendo that Citi analysts have noted the growing chance that the CLARITY Act's passage could be delayed beyond 2026, although there is also a chance it may still pass this year. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

They will explore the trust paradox and its implications for data leade... have announced a strategic partnership to establish the UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor, a cross-border initiative aimed at strengthening technology collaboration and accelerating innovation between India and the United Arab Emirates. The Corridor is designed to link India's deep pool of technology talent and digital innovation capabilities with the UAE's advanced regulatory environment, global market access, and investment infrastructure. By enabling structured cooperation across Web3, artificial intelligence, digital assets, cybersecurity, and other deep technologies, the initiative seeks to translate bilateral ties into sustained enterprise adoption, startup growth, and digital trade. Danosch Zahedi, CEO of TheBlock., described the initiative as a new model for international technology partnerships. “The UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor aims to be a catalyst for redefining how two innovation-driven nations collaborate. Together, we are creating a cross-border innovation engine that will accelerate enterprise adoption, empower startups, and unlock new economic value for both countries.” The Corridor will serve a broad set of stakeholders, including governments, enterprises, startups, investors, and academic institutions. The economic impact is expected to be meaningful for both countries. The UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor will be rolled out in phases, starting with joint working groups, ecosystem partnerships, and pilot programs, followed by cross-border accelerators, investment platforms, and interoperable technology standards. Over time, the partners expect it to emerge as a globally recognised model for cross-border digital economy collaboration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This time last year, the ICO published a letter to the UK government setting out five new initiatives to support innovation and sustain economic growth (which we discuss in our blog). The ICO has now published its follow-up letter, providing an update on progress since. With the main data protection changes from the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUA Act) having come into force yesterday and arguably heralding a new pro-growth era for UK data protection, we outline below the key takeaways from this latest ICO letter. The ICO is now actively working on a statutory code of practice on AI and automated decision-making (ADM), whereas it was merely in contemplation last year. Exact timings are still unclear, although the ICO explains it has “worked closely with government on scope and timelines for the required secondary legislation to enable the rules to become a statutory code of practice”. The ICO had promised to launch a consultation on these updates by the end of 2025, but this has now slipped until ‘Winter 2025/2026'. Given the pace of AI development, particularly around agentic AI (see the ICO's report and this blog), refreshed guidance should provide organisations with the certainty they need to innovate, and hopefully will now follow soon. The ICO will deliver the expanded data essentials training and assurance platform it promised in 2025 by Spring 2026, to help SMEs use personal data with confidence. The need to support SMEs navigate compliance burdens without unnecessary risk aversion has also been recognised at EU level, with the European Data Protection Board publishing its Helsinki statement in July 2025. In 2025, the ICO suggested implementing an experimentation regime within their regulatory sandbox. This is a positive development but one which still seems to require a number of steps, including the publication of reports on the potential economic impact and levels of demand for the service, a citizens' jury looking into the public's views and expectations, an alignment with the government's AI Growth Lab proposals and, crucially, legislative change to allow for real-world testing of emerging technologies. In July 2025, the ICO launched a consultation on its enforcement approach to online advertising, to inform which low-risk advertising activities wouldn't be prioritised for enforcement (where carried out without user consent). Making it quicker and easier to transfer data internationally The ICO published its updated guidance on international transfers last month and as we discuss in our blog, the guidance is more detailed than previously and, overall, presents a pragmatic approach which businesses will find helpful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has entered an aggressive deleveraging phase, breaking decisively lower after weeks of distribution near the upper boundary of its medium-term range. A key macro driver behind this move appears to be the recent escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which has pushed broader risk assets into de-risking mode and amplified existing technical fragilities in the ETH market. The combination of macro uncertainty, elevated leverage, and vulnerable chart structure has produced a sharp unwind rather than a controlled pullback. Daily RSI has also fallen into deeply oversold territory in the low 20s, indicating stretched short-term conditions. However, as long as the market remains capped below the broken moving averages and former support around $2,200, the broader structure continues to point toward a bear-market rally at best rather than a confirmed reversal. The market is now trying to stabilize around the $1,850–$1,900 range, and a mild bullish divergence is emerging on the 4-hour RSI, where momentum has begun to print higher lows despite marginally lower price lows. This configuration often signals that forced selling pressure is easing and that a short-term relief bounce or sideways consolidation may follow. Immediate resistance now sits in the $2,100–$2,200 area, with a stronger supply zone at $2,800. On the derivatives side, open interest across Ethereum futures has collapsed from elevated levels above 30 billion USD to nearly a third that size, tracking the price decline and signaling a large-scale liquidation cascade rather than an orderly reduction in positioning. This sharp contraction in open interest indicates that a significant portion of leveraged longs has been forced out of the market, with margin calls and auto-deleveraging accelerating the downside once key support levels failed. While such events are painful in the short term, they also tend to cleanse excess leverage from the system, leaving a lighter positioning backdrop where spot flows and fresh capital, rather than crowded derivatives exposure, can play a larger role in setting the next directional move.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past few years, stablecoins have witnessed significant adoption, with their market capitalisation reaching approximately USD 300 billion as of December 2025. Some jurisdictions have also begun moving towards formal legal recognition of these instruments. The GENIUS Act introduces multiple safeguards for stablecoins issued by non-government entities. These include clarity on the nature of such instruments as payment stablecoins rather than securities or commodities, consumer protection measures such as a requirement to maintain 1:1 reserves in cash or deposits, and bankruptcy protections that exclude reserve assets from the issuer's bankruptcy estate while granting priority to stablecoin holders. Many banks, financial institutions and fintech companies in the United States are already gearing up for the issuance and trading of payment stablecoins, which may significantly influence global payment flows. In contrast, the RBI has had its reservations on such legitimisation of issuance, trading and use of stablecoins in India. Fundamentally, stablecoins are crypto assets issued by private entities and denominated in currencies such as the USD or the Euro, which aim to maintain a stable value by being pegged to specific assets or baskets of assets. To back their liabilities, many large private stablecoin issuers typically invest in and hold short-term government securities, such as United States treasury bills. This structure can create a liquidity mismatch, given the on-demand redemption feature of stablecoins and the tenure of short-term government debt instruments. In stressed market conditions, this mismatch may amplify liquidity pressures and trigger redemption runs. In a robust financial system, one rupee issued by a commercial bank must be interchangeable with one rupee issued by the central bank. Privately issued stablecoins, offered by various entities with varying degrees of transparency and creditworthiness, threaten this principle. As tradable instruments, stablecoins have also exhibited deviations from their pegged assets or currencies during periods of market stress, potentially leading to a fragmentation of the payment system and encouraging disintermediation from regulated financial institutions. As the use of stablecoins scales, it may also constrain the RBI's ability to monitor and manage foreign currency inflows and outflows. In addition, regulatory arbitrage with respect to crypto assets in India has enabled several fintech companies to develop on-ramping and off-ramping models for cross-border currency flows. These models allow stablecoins to circumvent the tightly controlled cross-border funds movements, complicating macroeconomic management and posing risks to foreign exchange reserves. Stablecoins demonstrate the potential for faster settlement, improved efficiency and reduced reliance on centralised intermediaries. While private issuance of stablecoins raises complex questions, the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) offers an alternative pathway for leveraging blockchain technology within a regulated and sovereign framework. A carefully designed CBDC may allow India to harness the benefits of digital payments while preserving monetary control and systemic safeguards. The path forward may lie not in immediate legitimisation, but in calibrated engagement, regulatory clarity, and alignment with broader macroeconomic objectives.</p>

SMX Extends Its Capital Runway Into 2028, ELOC Agreement Increase... DMG Blockchain Solutions (OTCQB: DMGGF) received a $1.5 million energy efficiency incentive for deploying hydro direct liquid cooled (DLC) server technology at its Christina Lake data center, based on an independent energy‑savings study. The company said it sold some mined bitcoin to fund operations and is delaying the Boardman, Oregon acquisition while due diligence issues are resolved. DMG named Steven Eliscu corporate secretary, adding to his COO role, and reiterated plans to convert Christina Lake into an AI data center. VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  06, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“DMG”), a leading vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, announces it has been awarded a $1.5 million energy efficiency incentive related to the deployment of hydro direct liquid cooled (DLC) server technology at its Christina Lake data center facility. This incentive was based on an energy efficiency study performed by an independent third party, which calculated a target energy savings for a given computational capacity using air-cooled technology and the resulting energy savings by converting to DLC. DMG's CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented, “We were pleased when the final results of the energy efficiency study exceeded our initial calculations for savings. We are honored to have been recognized for our operational expertise in utilizing the latest chip cooling technology. In addition to announcing this incentive, DMG remains actively focused on activities to convert its Christina Lake facility into a world-class AI data center.” DMG's hashrate averaged 1.69 EH/s in January, down from 1.77 EH/s in the prior month, as it adjusted its equipment operation to focus on profitability over hashrate generation. During due diligence, DMG encountered issues that have delayed the closing of the transaction to purchase a building on an 18-acre property in Boardman, Oregon. There is no guarantee that the Company will complete this acquisition. DMG announces that it has appointed Steven Eliscu as Corporate Secretary, which adds to his current role as Chief Operating Officer, and he succeeds Catherine Cox, who has resigned from the role. DMG is a sustainable, vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company that develops, manages, and operates comprehensive platform solutions to monetize the blockchain ecosystem. The company's operations are driven by two strategic pillars: Core and Core+, both unified by DMG's commitment to vertical integration and environmentally responsible practices. DMG's subsidiary Systemic Trust Corporation is focused on custody of digital assets. Follow @dmgblockchain on Twitter and subscribe to DMG's YouTube channel.
