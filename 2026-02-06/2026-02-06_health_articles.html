                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Programs that match caregivers with patient navigators yield better outcomes than Alzheimer's drug – but combining the two may be best. A Medicare-covered program that offers support and medical advice for caregivers of patients with dementia may bring more benefit than a costly Alzheimer's medication, new research finds. UC San Francisco researchers compared outcomes for patients in collaborative care programs with those taking lecanemab, one of two approved drugs that have been shown to slow progression of Alzheimer's in some patients. Paid navigators coordinate with clinical teams and connect caregivers to community resources. Collaborative care improved quality of life, reduced costs, alleviated caregiver burden, and extended the time that patients remained in the community before entering a nursing facility, as compared to lecanemab. The researchers created a simulated cohort of 1,000 patients using data from previous studies. Replacing usual care with collaborative care gave patients an extra 0.26 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a measure that reflects living longer in better health. When lecanemab was added to collaborative care, patients gained another 0.16 QALYs. Collaborative care can serve a broader population than medication, said first author Kelly J. Atkins, DPsych, formerly of the UCSF Fein Memory and Aging Center. Lecanemab is only indicated for patients with mild Alzheimer's and MCI, but collaborative programs can be used for more advanced disease, as well as for the 20% to 40% of patients with other types of dementia. The drug may also be out of reach for rural residents living far from specialty clinics, and for low-income patients struggling to manage out-of-pocket costs." The latter saved $48,000 per patient, partially due to fewer hospital visits. But we can'tjust focus on the drugs, we need to rethink our system of care," said Professor Katherine L. Possin, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Fein Memory and Aging Center. "Clinics that integrate collaborative care with the drugs may be best positioned to meet the needs of patients in this new treatment era."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new type of brain implant may have implications for both brain research and future treatments of neurological diseases such as epilepsy. Researchers from DTU, the University of Copenhagen, University College London, and other institutions have developed a long, needle-thin brain electrode with channels—a so-called microfluidic Axialtrode (mAxialtrode), named for its ability to distribute functional interfaces along the length of the implant, enabling both neural signal recording and precisely targeted medication delivery across different brain regions. It can help researchers better understand how signals move across brain layers, for example in epilepsy, memory, or decision-making. Postdoc Kunyang Sui, who led the development of the mAxialtrode concept together with Associate Professor Christos Markos, emphasizes that it has made it possible to combine several functions in a single implant which makes brain research less invasive and more precise. Most current brain implants are based on hard materials such as silicon, which can irritate the brain and trigger inflammatory reactions in the tissue. The new implant differs in that it is made of soft, plastic-like optical fibers and has a specially angled tip that makes it smaller and reduces the damage caused when it is placed in the brain." He emphasizes that extensive testing, further development, and approvals are still needed before the technology can be used in clinical practice. Today, brain researchers often use conventional flat-end optical fibers. These are thin glass or plastic fibers that can conduct light deep into the brain, for example for so-called optogenetics, where nerve cells are activated with light. This means that researchers can only stimulate or measure activity in one layer of the brain at a time, even though many important brain functions involve interaction between several layers and deeper areas. The needle-thin mAxialtrode is manufactured using a process in which a large polymer rod is heated and drawn out into a very thin fiber—the process can be compared to making sugar thread, only much more precisely. In the middle runs a core that conducts light. Around it are eight microscopic channels that can carry fluid and also accommodate very thin metal wires for electrical measurements. The difference in stiffness is important because hard implants often trigger inflammatory reactions in the brain over time. Here, the brain electrode was implanted in the brain and connected to light sources, measuring equipment, and small pumps for fluid supply. The experiments showed that the researchers could stimulate nerve cells with blue and red light, measure electrical activity simultaneously from both superficial and deeper brain layers, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and inject different substances at different depths, up to almost three millimeters apart. All examinations and stimulations could be performed with a single, lightweight fiber that the animals could carry without any obvious signs of discomfort. The in vivo experiments and neurophysiological validation were carried out in close collaboration with Associate Professor Rune W. Berg from the University of Copenhagen and Associate Professor Rob C. Wykes from University College London, who contributed expertise in neural circuit analysis and epilepsy-relevant models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Griffith University researchers are on the cusp of a new vaccine to prevent chikungunya, a global health threat which attacks human joint tissue. Professor Bernd Rehm, from Griffith's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, said his team wanted to test whether they could engineer E.coli to assemble biopolymer particles which displayed chikungunya antigens and performed as a vaccine. Professor Bernd Rehm, Griffith's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics It triggered a reaction in the body whereby immune cells very efficiently took up the biopolymer particles and engaged the immune system to mount an anti-virus response. Symptoms included fever, chills, a feeling of intense illness, severe joint and muscle pain, headache, rash and joint swelling. Professor Rehm said once the infection took hold, chikungunya would specifically target joint tissues, muscle fibres and connective tissue. "Once this occurs, we start to see direct tissue damage, intense inflammation, and immune-mediated attacks resembling autoimmune responses," he said. "Up to 60 per cent of patients experience long-lasting joint pain, which may persist for months or years, and can resemble rheumatoid arthritis." The next stage would entail a clinical trial whereby patients would test the vaccine's safety before moving on to efficacy trials. The paper 'Adjuvant-free biopolymer particles mimicking the Chikungunya virus surface induce protective immunity' has been published in Biomaterials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The meeting, Feb. 4 - 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premier meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health. Mike Sharma, M.D., M.Sc., principal investigator of the study, the Michael G. Degroote Chair in Stroke Prevention, professor of medicine at McMaster University and senior scientist at the Population Health Research Institute, a joint institute of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Dual antiplatelet therapy (treatment with two anti-clotting or blood-thinning medications) is recommended only in very specific patients, including those with early-arriving minor stroke and high-risk transient ischemic attack or severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis. Antiplatelets, most commonly aspirin, prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together and forming clots that lead to stroke. Dual antiplatelet therapy, which includes a second medication (such as clopidogrel or dipyridamole), is given in addition to aspirin, however, it is not recommended for long-term use. "Previous efforts to improve outcomes by adding other anticlotting or blood thinning medications have not succeeded due to the increased risk of bleeding, lack of benefit or both." Asundexian is a novel investigational medication that inhibits a clotting protein called Factor XI (FXIa), which is involved in producing large blood clots that can block blood vessels. Other anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, inhibit a different clotting protein (Factor Xa) to reduce the risk of stroke. However, unlike these medications, asundexian does not increase the risk of bleeding. People born with a genetic deficiency of Factor XI are known to have a lower risk of ischemic stroke and rarely have spontaneous bleeding. This research, the OCEANIC-STROKE (Oral faCtor Eleven A iNhibitor asundexian as novel antithrombotiC) study, is a Phase III international trial that included more than 12,300 stroke survivors. It is investigating whether adding daily asundexian to antiplatelet therapy could reduce the risk of a new stroke caused by a blood clot without increasing the risk of bleeding or other adverse events. Participants recently had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke that was not caused by a heart condition such as an irregular heart rhythm. Some participants had experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which involves symptoms that go away within minutes to hours and do not cause lasting damage to the brain. Participants were randomly selected to receive either standard antiplatelet therapy plus a daily dose of asundexian or standard antiplatelet therapy plus a placebo. Neither patients nor researchers were aware of which treatment they received during the trial. This benefit applies to all types of strokes, not just those caused by plaque build-up in large arteries. If approved by the FDA, asundexian could be widely used for patients who have had a non-cardioembolic stroke or a TIA," he said. The study is limited by having relatively few participants with severe strokes, despite broad inclusion criteria that could have included them. In a substudy of OCEANIC-STROKE, brain imaging and standardized MRI images were collected for participants. Analysis of that data is not yet complete; however, the results should provide further information on the impact of asundexian on both clotting and bleeding. Asundexian is an investigational medication that has not been approved in any country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accurate hearing thresholds can only be obtained in a suitably quiet environment. Subjects can misinterpret test stimuli when there is uncontrolled environmental noise, leading to invalid results or false responses. It is possible to mitigate these interferences by controlling ambient noise within certain limits; however, this potentially makes the difference between a pass and a referral. Background noise can potentially interfere with test tones, artificially elevating hearing thresholds. Monitoring noise levels can help maintain a controlled testing environment, enhancing the reliability of hearing assessments. ISO (International Organization for Standardization), ANSI (American National Standards Institute), OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and other organizations set specific noise level requirements for audiometric testing environments. Monitoring your ambient noise during testing ensures you stay within these limits. Should ambient noise be found to exceed acceptable levels, it will be possible to make adjustments by either testing in a sound booth, relocating the test to a noise-isolated area, using noise-reducing headphones, or rescheduling it for a quieter time. Noise levels can fluctuate due to conversations, machinery, or outdoor sounds in non-clinical settings like workplace screenings. Continuous noise monitoring is key to ensuring test accuracy in these settings. A sound level meter or sound room microphone is suitable for the monitoring of ambient noise, measuring frequency content in octave or third-octave bands. It is important to note, however, that a degree of ‘measurement uncertainty' may stem from sources such as equipment or the environment (ambient noise and distractions), or from the subject, method, or tester. However, maximum permissible ambient sound pressure levels should be maintained in line with (SPL) - BS EN ISO 8253-1, with a number of factors requiring consideration. This phenomenon is typically referred to as the ‘upward spread of masking'. Maximum permissible ambient SPLs are based on average earphone attenuation, with supra-aural earphones providing the least attenuation and, therefore, necessitating the use of a quieter test environment. It is also important to note that some listeners will receive less than average attenuation. It is possible to avoid exceeding noise limits by following a number of simple steps. It is possible to monitor the test environment by adding a Sound Room Microphone (SRM) to the test process. This affords testers complete confidence in the quality of their audiometry results. The modelONE PC-based audiometer is also available, comprising noise-attenuating headphones and including a built-in SRM. It is important to note that using an SRM does not remove the need to employ an IEC 61672 Class 2 microphone in line with guidance provided in the HSE L108 'Controlling Noise at Work' 2005 publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drawing on 52 studies, this review challenges assumptions about athletic advantage between cis- and transgender athletes, while highlighting major evidence gaps in elite and sport-specific performance. Study: Body composition and physical fitness in transgender versus cisgender individuals: a systematic review with meta-analysis. Transgender women are individuals assigned male at birth who identify and live as women, while cisgender women are those assigned female at birth whose gender identity aligns with that assignment. For years, the question of transgender women competing in female sports has sparked intense debate. This has led to proposals that transgender athletes should only compete if they don't create significant competitive imbalances. Research has challenged some concerns that transgender women would dominate women's sports, largely because testosterone suppression therapy reduces certain physiological characteristics associated with male puberty. In fact, transgender women remain underrepresented in elite athletics, although the authors note that underrepresentation alone cannot be used to draw conclusions about competitive advantage. The IOC established a framework prioritizing fairness, inclusion, and non-discrimination, rejecting blanket bans and advocating for sport-specific eligibility criteria. Critics argue this relies on insufficient research and impractical assessments, potentially compromising protections for cisgender female athletes. Some researchers contend the IOC's ‘no presumption of advantage' principle overlooks studies suggesting transgender women may retain muscle mass, strength, and other physical characteristics after testosterone suppression. However, systematic reviews comparing transgender women who underwent gender-affirming hormone therapy and cisgender women have reported mixed and inconsistent findings, highlighting ongoing scientific uncertainty. The current systematic review with meta-analysis examines existing research on body composition and physical fitness in transgender women compared to cisgender women, with secondary comparisons across other gender groups. It also examined how hormone therapy duration affects outcomes, compared responses between transgender men and women, and explored the impact of puberty suppression. All relevant articles were obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus. Inclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing body composition or physical fitness pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy or versus cisgender controls. All participants were between 14 and 41 years of age. The selected studies used different methods to assess physical activity, including METs (metabolic equivalents), questionnaires, measures of exercise frequency and duration, and simple activity classifications. Only 7 studies adjusted for confounders, most commonly body composition, age, hormone levels, and nutrient intake. A significant variation in hormone therapy types and dosages was noted. Transgender women primarily received estradiol, in the form of oral tablets, patches, or gel, often combined with antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. Transgender men primarily received testosterone undecanoate or enanthate via injection, with some using gels. Dosing varied by administration route, age, and clinical context. Twelve studies included participants who had undergone gender-affirming surgery, and six reported the use of puberty suppression. Compared to cisgender women, transgender women showed no statistically significant differences in relative fat mass, relative lean mass, upper-body strength, lower-body strength, or aerobic capacity. However, the authors emphasized that the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low certainty, with substantial heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals in several analyses, limiting the precision of these estimates. Aerobic capacity, measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂ max), was also not significantly different between groups. The authors stress that a lack of statistical significance does not imply identical performance, rather, it indicates that consistent differences were not detected in the available data. After 1–3 years of hormone therapy, transgender women experienced increased fat mass and decreased lean mass and upper-body strength. The authors noted that, despite persistent differences in lean mass, these changes were not consistently associated with differences in functional performance, suggesting that lean mass alone may not directly translate into strength advantages. The authors cautioned that lean mass and performance outcomes were often derived from different studies, preventing direct correlations between muscle mass and athletic performance. They also emphasized that the available data largely reflect non-athlete or recreationally active populations, rather than elite competitors. Transgender men showed body composition and strength metrics that were intermediate between cisgender women and cisgender men for some outcomes, even after an average of four years of hormone therapy. However, the authors reported that transgender men continued to differ significantly from cisgender men in several measures, including relative lean mass and upper-body strength. This systematic review and meta-analysis found that while transgender women tend to have higher lean mass than cisgender women, they show no consistent or statistically significant differences in commonly measured physical fitness outcomes, such as strength and aerobic capacity, after 1–3 years of hormone therapy. The authors emphasize that these findings do not demonstrate equivalence in athletic performance and do not directly address sport-specific competition outcomes. Most studies were small, lacked statistical adjustment for key confounders, and rarely assessed physical activity or training status. Elite athletes and sport-specific performance measures were largely absent from the literature. The authors conclude that future research should include larger, well-controlled, longitudinal studies that follow transgender athletes over time, account for training history and competition level, and assess sport-specific performance outcomes. Such evidence is needed to inform nuanced, sport-specific eligibility policies rather than broad generalizations about advantage or disadvantage. Mendes S.S, et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How influencers, clinics, and online masculinity culture are turning “low T” into a crisis, and creating a profitable medical marketplace for men seeking to measure up. Study: Selling masculinity – A qualitative analysis of gender representations in social media content about “low T”. Social media often emphasizes masculinity as the essence of being male. Low testosterone levels are represented as a sign of diminished masculinity. These narratives are increasingly linked to the monetization of testosterone testing and treatment. A recent study in the journal Social Science & Medicine explores the depiction of masculinity in social media posts relating to low testosterone (often referred to as “low T”). This, in turn, is linked to male attributes of strength, sexual virility, and vitality. Traditional attitudes towards gender treat men as being biologically designed for strength, dominance, and sexual prowess. Building on this narrow and historically entrenched perspective, testosterone testing and treatment are often presented as being essential to real manhood. The manosphere is the network of online communities that echoes, amplifies, and reinforces rigid ideas of masculinity while promoting similarly backward-looking attitudes towards femininity. These communities are frequently described in the academic literature as perpetuating regressive gender-related social constructs of male hegemony. Manosphere-related posts commonly relay misinformation about men's health and fitness. Thus, social media posts promoting testosterone have been associated with testosterone therapy sales of over 400 million USD in the United States. The risks of such practices include the potential for overdiagnosis of low testosterone in healthy men and the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) without sufficient clinical indication. TRT has been associated in prior research with multiple harms, including cardiovascular issues, male infertility, acute renal injury, pulmonary embolism, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. The investigators conducted a qualitative study of posts on Instagram and TikTok, drawing on performativity theory, a social theory that explores the formation of identity through repeated actions and narratives. Their sample consisted of 200 posts, including 100 from each platform. From this broader sample, the authors conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of a subset of 46 posts that explicitly addressed masculinity or sexual performance. Financial interests were present in 72% of the accounts, such as owning a wellness brand that sold testosterone tests or therapies, or being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. About one in three individual accounts was ostensibly owned by a medical doctor. The authors also note that the sample was limited to English-language posts and may reflect an Anglo-centric social media environment, and they explicitly discuss their own positionality and interpretive role as researchers. Low testosterone is represented as a medical issue that endangers masculinity and sexual virility. Social media content often frames this as a crisis of being less than masculine by idealizing stereotypical traits as mandatory. This framing helps legitimize medical treatment, including testosterone testing and therapy, as an urgent intervention to attain what is presented as “normal.” Low testosterone rebranding occurs, shifting from being an issue mostly associated with older men to being framed as a potential problem in active younger men. This group is typified as being muscular, energetic, confident, and easily aroused. Variations from this ideal are attributed to low T. According to the authors, such tactics expand the potential audience and may increase demand for testing and treatment. Clichéd ideas of masculinity become the grounds for subtly demanding self-optimization by linking them to high testosterone. A significant medical intervention, namely testing for and taking testosterone, is reframed as a lifestyle practice that promotes so-called normal aging. Social media content frequently presents a binary construct that portrays real manhood as the opposite of femininity in biochemical and material terms. This framing can result in shaming of men who do not fit the ideal of “real men,” or who are open about vulnerability or mental health needs. Social media posts included in this analysis draw on the insecurities men often feel about relationships and sexual performance. The language of these posts reflects that of empowerment and advocacy, but is frequently repurposed, according to the authors, to market testosterone-related products. These posts often promote biomedical solutions, namely engagement with health technologies and scientific-sounding interventions. They claim that such approaches empower men to take control of their health, and the authors acknowledge that some men may experience these messages as motivating or affirming. Biomedicalization also involves viewing medicine as a marketable product by commodifying insecurity, in this case, raising and amplifying fears about masculinity to sell testosterone-related services. Thus, low testosterone is framed as a plausible medical explanation for a wide range of mental, physical, and relational challenges, even when such links are not supported by clinical evidence. The authors describe how social media platforms demonstrate the interaction of language-based claims and material objects, including testosterone, diagnostic tests, and digital platforms, to reinforce masculine insecurity and narrow gender norms. These posts also divert attention away from underlying or coexisting health conditions. As a result, they may shape how men think about their bodies, mental health, and the types of medical help they seek. Testosterone-related social media posts typically draw on manosphere-adjacent thinking to promote the idea that “real men” have high testosterone levels. This framing encourages testosterone testing as a screening tool for low T, despite the absence of evidence supporting population-level screening benefits. Social media platforms bring together influencers, clinics, and health-related companies in ways that contribute to the transformation of masculinity into a marketable commodity. These online discussions frame “real manhood” using regressive and stereotyped ideals that shape how men perceive themselves and how they interact with healthcare systems. Social media discourse also medicalizes normal aging in men, contributing to the expansion of a lucrative market for testosterone-related products. The authors emphasize that their analysis does not criticize men who choose to use testosterone therapies, but rather examines the broader social, cultural, and commercial forces shaping these choices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antonia Seligowski, PhD, of the Neurocardiac Effects of Stress & Trauma Laboratory within the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, is the senior author of a paper published in JAMA Network Open, "Hormonal contraceptive use, stress disorders, and cardiovascular and thrombotic risk in women." Q: What challenges or unmet needs make this study important? Stress is a major risk factor for CVD, and stress‑related psychiatric disorders like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more common in women. One such factor is hormonal contraception, used by about 9.1 million women in the United States. Past research on these contraceptives-which work by introducing different amounts of hormones and suppressing natural estradiol and progesterone levels-has focused almost entirely on young, relatively healthy women. As a result, very little is known about how hormonal contraceptives affect women with stress‑related psychiatric disorders. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the combined effects of hormonal contraceptives and stress‑related disorders on cardiovascular or thrombosis risk. Our study, led by Jordan Thomas, PhD, of the University of Kansas, explored whether hormonal contraceptive use is linked to cardiovascular and thrombotic risk in women with and without stress‑related disorders. Specifically, we wanted to know if women with a history of depression, anxiety or PTSD who use hormonal contraceptives have a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or deep‑vein thrombosis than those without this mental health history. Q: What methods or approach did you use? We analyzed healthcare records from 31,824 women who consented to be part of the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Specifically, we looked for medical codes indicating diagnoses of stress‑related disorders, MACE and deep‑vein thrombosis, as well as prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives. However, this protective association was not seen in women with PTSD. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that cardiovascular risk may vary among women who use hormonal contraceptives-especially differing for those with PTSD. If future studies confirm these results, clinicians may need to consider stress‑related psychiatric disorders when discussing hormonal contraceptive options with patients. Q: Tell us about any follow-up studies you have planned to validate or build on these findings. We hope to conduct a clinical study that collects new data on how specific hormonal contraceptive formulas relate to CVD risk factors in women, including blood pressure, vascular endothelial function and blood‑based clotting markers. We also plan to test whether these effects differ for women with and without stress‑related psychiatric disorders. Participants would return yearly for follow‑up visits to track clinical outcomes such as thrombotic events.

Developed using SyngenSys' proprietary informatics and computational design platform, the Liver.SET library comprises a range of compact, patentable synthetic promoters for liver-targeted gene expression for in vivo gene therapies. Liver.SET overcomes key challenges in cell and gene therapy development by enabling tissue-specific, precise transgene expression with minimal off-target activity in muscle tissue. The promoters exhibit low levels of activity in HEK293, avoiding viral vector manufacturing issues linked to therapeutic gene expression during packaging, while the modular architecture of the promoters further supports rapid customization alongside compact sequence lengths yielding enhanced compatibility with AAV payloads. The demonstrated specificity of SynGenSys' promoters provides a foundation for the development of promoter libraries designed to target and de-target tissues including muscle, retina and CNS. The launch of Liver.SET™ represents another significant milestone for SynGenSys, demonstrating that our platform can deliver synthetic promoter solutions for real gene therapy development needs. We see this as a key enabler for in vivo gene therapies, and a reliable, validated starting point for deeper collaboration with developers seeking to design novel therapeutics with enhanced precision and safety.” Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team from the Department of Psychiatry at Tohoku University, led by Dr. Zhiqian Yu and Professor Hiroaki Tomita, has uncovered compelling evidence that maternal perinatal depression - psychological distress occurring during pregnancy or postpartum - elevates the risk of autistic-related traits in toddlers, with a particularly strong impact on girls. Their findings are derived from a large-scale Japanese cohort of over 23,000 mother-child pairs (the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study) and supported by mouse experiments. These findings provide important insights into how maternal mental health influences early neurodevelopment, which could help create guidelines to protect the wellbeing of both mother and child. Higher maternal scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) or the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were significantly associated with increased autistic-related traits in toddlers, as measured by the Tokyo Autistic Behavior Scale (TABS). Notably, although autism is generally more common in boys, the risk associated with maternal perinatal depression was especially pronounced in girls. Additionally, girls showed lower birth weights and a stronger association between autistic traits and impaired mother-infant bonding (the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale; MIBS). Stressed mothers displayed depressive-like behaviors and reduced maternal care, while their female offspring exhibited typical autism-like behavioral patterns, including increased self-grooming and impaired recognition of social novelty. Molecular analyses further revealed reduced expression of oxytocin (nicknamed the "love hormone") in prefrontal cortical microglia of stressed mothers and decreased oxytocin receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex of their female offspring. These findings suggest a sex-specific neurobiological pathway through which prenatal stress may disrupt social development. Because oxytocin signaling is essential for maternal bonding and social behavior, disturbances in this system may help explain why daughters appear particularly vulnerable to maternal stress. This study highlights the societal importance of supporting maternal mental health beginning in pregnancy. The findings underscore that maternal well-being is a critical foundation for children's long-term developmental health and provide a scientific basis for sex-sensitive early intervention strategies. This study was not based on clinical diagnoses of maternal depression or autism spectrum disorder in children. While the findings do not indicate that maternal perinatal depression directly causes autism spectrum disorder, they underscore the importance of supporting maternal mental health during the perinatal period, particularly in light of potential sex-specific effects on children's emotional and developmental outcomes. The findings were published in Molecular Psychiatry, a Nature Portfolio journal, on February 4, 2026.
