                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veteran Bible teacher and author Victoria Harr announces the release of her new book, Awakening Your Spiritual Senses, a faith centered work that invites readers to move beyond surface level belief and into a deeper experiential relationship with God through the Holy Spirit. In Awakening Your Spiritual Senses, Harr explores the idea that just as God created humans with five natural senses of hearing, seeing, touching, tasting, and smelling, He has also given believers spiritual senses. These spiritual senses often remain unnoticed until God activates them. Each chapter introduces a spiritual sense and includes teaching followed by impartation and activation exercises that encourage direct interaction with God. The goal is not only understanding, but transformation and deeper intimacy with Him. She has served in a wide range of ministry and outreach roles including Shiloh Youth Revival Centers Inc., World Wide Pictures, the Salvation Army, and BLAST, an after school program serving low income families. Based in San Diego, California, Harr remains active in her home church where she creates and teaches curriculum with a strong emphasis on spiritual gifts and spiritual senses. Awakening Your Spiritual Senses adds to Harrs collection of published works, which include Spiritual Gifts, A Grandmother's Legacy to Her Grandchildren, A Grandmother's Life as Told to Her Grandchild, and Single Mom What Now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri revealed that he has requested and been granted access to secure locations, such as Area 51, which have decades-old ties to UFOs and secret government projects. Speaking on the ALN Podcast, Burlison added that the request to President Trump and his staff included visiting US military bases and facilities where evidence suggests unidentified craft, materials, bodies, or archives allegedly exist. Burlison is a member of the congressional oversight committee involved in the ongoing investigation into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. Although the US government and the Pentagon have officially denied that there has been any physical evidence of UFOs or alien life ever recovered, Congress has heard from multiple whistleblowers claiming secret programs have covered up the truth. Now, as Trump insiders have allegedly leaked that the White House is planning to reveal what America knows about extraterrestrials by July, the UAP committee may soon have the physical proof of non-human intelligence in their hands. The extent to which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that "we're backing his request. Area 51 (Pictured) has been tied to UFO encounters and advanced military aircraft since the 1950s US Congressman Eric Burlison (Pictured) has claimed that he has received approval from the White House to visit classified US facilities allegedly tied to evidence of alien life Over the years, multiple US military sites have been linked to non-human craft, including facilities, anonymous sources have said, that were housing crashed spaceships and experimental aircraft constructed using reverse-engineered alien technology. These include Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas, and the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), home to Area 51. 'There is reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved, that they've built an entire building around it,' Burlison said during the January 30 podcast. The congressman noted that this facility outside the US was classified so he was unable to reveal its exact location, but it was on his list of places he had requested to visit as part of the committee's investigation. Burlison said during the interview that he started as a UFO skeptic but was convinced these phenomena were real after listening to whistleblower David Grusch's public interview shortly after entering Congress in early 2023. President Trump (Pictured) expressed skepticism that reports of UFOs were real during a June 2024 interview but has allegedly granted access to secret bases tied to such claims The November 2025 documentary 'The Age of Disclosure' alleged that there's been an 80-year cover-up on UFOs and alien technology 'We created government, and it's not the right of any government to withhold from you and I the truth about reality,' Burlison declared. 'No government has the right to withhold from you and I that we might be alone or not alone in the universe. Burlison has previously claimed to have 'a lead' on new UFO whistleblowers. However, he said during the new interview that it's been difficult to convince potential witnesses to risk losing their government clearances in retaliation, comparing these individuals to 'guinea pigs' in terms of how the Pentagon would respond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN FRANCISCO — Consider this Seahawks season an exercise in exorcisms. All ghosts—Sam Darnold's reference to seeing them in 2019, Russell Wilson's Super Bowl XLIX interception, lingering organizational tension from then to now, to cite just three examples—have been busted or can be, in two days, at Super Bowl LX. This is where Keith Linder enters the conversation. He rented a house in Bothell, Wa., which is located northeast of downtown. He chose from the offerings on Craigslist. At that point, neither Linder, nor his girlfriend, Tina, knew anything about paranormal activity. “No,” Linder tells Sports Illustrated in a phone interview last week. They started hearing this sound, like a baby was coughing, incessantly, day and night. Maybe, they thought, those noises were coming from their neighbors. They searched every inch of their rental home. Then their car keys started to mysteriously vanish. While they watched television on the couch, a potted plant levitated off the ground, spun in a circle and dropped back in place. Then what Linder describes as a “demonic drawing” suddenly appeared on one wall. This forced Linder to consider a notion he had never considered previously. Was this house—safe neighborhood, five bedrooms, 2-1/2 baths, constructed only six years earlier—actually … haunted? “But I didn't want to run,” Linder says. He chose, at that moment, to do what many Seahawks players and coaches have done over the past 11 years. He chose to live with his ghosts. There wasn't an 800 number to call. There was no “I'm haunted” support group. This club, Linder says, is a tiny one. Those stories sound farfetched to them, even. Linder is a Seahawks fan and a football fan, and after I reached out to him, he did some research in relation to Seattle's ghosts. He found several instances of Darnold using that phrase, seeing ghosts, that dated back to high school. He figured Darnold wasn't even aware of that apparent subconscious theme. He also saw Darnold living with the ghosts he saw, in theoretical senses, on football fields. “I was trying to rationalize [my experience],” Linder says. He couldn't make sense of it. Two: Hunt—for the cause of this activity, for any noise, in any corner of the house; and, soon, for answers, to rid the space of paranormal happenings or reduce them or anything that might end the madness he experienced daily. Linder didn't know that the greater-Seattle area marked something of a haven for paranormal activity, at least for those who believe in that kind of thing. Several companies run “ghost” tours that ferry tourists around downtown. There's also an underground city, a series of interconnected tunnels, built after a major, crippling fire in 1889. There have been reports of ghost sightings or paranormal activity since then. The paranormal activity inside that Bothell Hell House picked up, anyway. Flying scissors and airborne kitchen knives, some of which lodged into walls after slicing through them. More violence, the screams closer to existential. Pages torn from Bibles and scattered all over. Plates falling to the ground and breaking. Lights all turning off at the same time. Even when they hosted, guests believed they had been touched or grabbed or had their hair pulled by unseen forces. He hired an exorcist to bless the space and rid it of any evil spirits. Then they reached out to Ghost Adventures, a popular reality show on the Travel Channel. That film crew investigated what's now known as the Bothell Hell House for most of a day, using machines to search for electromagnetic pulses which, for paranormal believers, often identify the presence of ghosts. Linder became increasingly, deeply and darkly depressed. Everyone in that world knew Don Phillips, a United Kingdom–based paranormal investigator. He flew to Seattle immediately, with a crew, and lived in the house for roughly a month. He caught—again, there's no way to prove this in an objectively verifiable sense—more than 400 recordings of … ghosts. Of that tally, 28 recordings were direct responses to the investigator's questions. Phillips told Linder he made eye contact with the spirits who, yes, haunted his home. Another poltergeist led all the others—an elderly woman, believe it or not. She was a mess—hair pointing in every direction, torn clothes, confused, angry, fearful. Soon, they uncovered another piece of critical info. This is where the ghosts—again, can't prove it!—came from. He doesn't regret the alternative reality, worst-case: him, living in a mental institution, his room padded and his food slipped under the door. This is his advice to those Seahawks who have or are exorcising ghosts: They have two options. But it works far better, he says, to reason with them, understand them and work toward resolutions. In many, significant ways, that is the story of this Seahawks season. Linder now works downtown, where Lumen Field looms outside the window of his office. Now, he says, about half of him believes in the paranormal. I ask to visit the Bothell Hell House. Linder says the current residents do not want visitors, which is understandable, given the wide berth of humanity that shows up at that door. He says not to park too close, which could anger or awaken the spirits that remain inside. He says one person who called him said their car broke down on that block. Others got flat tires, blown-out engines or experienced paranormal activity themselves. But he said that ghosts that haunt houses like the one he rented are always there. They might be dormant more often than not. Just like the symbols of stick figures that showed up on Linder's walls, drawn but upside down, Linder could flip “way” and get close to Maye, as in Drake, the Patriots quarterback—the ghost ahead. “It's their duty to test you,” Linder says. That's why they're in this Super Bowl.” Because of Exorcism Season. Mike Vrabel's playing days: “The thing that amazed me is we would have a period for special teams. Mike was on a lot of [special teams units]. But for the ones he wasn't on, he and Rodney Harrison wanted to be on the ‘look teams' for those, for [units] that they weren't going to be involved in. In OTAs or at minicamps, [the defense] would run line stunts. And Mike would always grab one of the offensive linemen, so the defensive tackle could come around them, and we couldn't get our tackle off of Mike. So he's grabbing the heck out of our tackle, and he's looking right at me and just smiling like a Halloween pumpkin, knowing it's gonna drive me crazy. Bill Belichick assistants or former players and their collective struggles as head coaches: “With Mike right now, it's original. And it's not anyone else he ever played for. He's not the reincarnation of Belichick at all.” Vrabel's softer side: “My first exposure to Mike in his playing career was when we went to West Virginia during training camp and worked against the Houston Texans. And I would look over, across the field, look at him, and he was over there, and they would play this game with a big ball, almost like Four Square. And the next thing I'd see was Mike, out there, with his players. He would take this kind of chest protector, strap it to his body and a rusher or a blocker. One point of clarification on this game that I hadn't heard, despite years and years of reporting on Wilson's interception, before. The Seahawks head coach that game, Pete Carroll, has been criticized ever since that attempt left Wilson's right hand for not taking accountability in the aftermath, whether immediate or long-term. But according to three people who were in the Seahawks locker room that night before it opened to the media, Carroll said the following: “If you're going to point fingers at anyone, point them at me. Yet he has borne the brunt of the torrent of criticism that resulted from that INT. His former players, though, see that moment in the locker room as in contrast with every other action or statement that came from Carroll in the aftermath. Two related nuggets I haven't seen before. One comes from one of those sources, who voiced what many in the organization felt: That the Seahawks defense should have taken more accountability for that defeat. They gave up a 10-point lead with 10 minutes left, after all. He called out the defense in one team meeting. Told them they hadn't played perfectly that night, either. When Cooper Kupp tore through his final training session in Southern California last spring, before he would head to Seattle and join his Rams' division rival Seahawks, the depth of his impact on Los Angeles and the Rams' Super Bowl team from the 2021 was fully revealed. Quarterback Matthew Stafford dropped by, as did wideout Puka Nacua, as did retired franchise cornerstone Andrew Whitworth. “That just shows you what kind of impact he has had on all these people, man,” says Ryan Sorensen, the trainer who led that session and has worked with Kupp since the 2020 season. He was going to use all that energy and just completely, utterly dominate.” Even if Seattle wins this Super Bowl, Sorensen and other members of Kupp's tight inner circle don't believe, not for a second, that he will retire. Before Canaan Smith-Njigba became a professional baseball player and Jaxon Smith-Njigba became a professional football player, they grew up in Rockwall, Texas. Their father, Maada, loved to “knock out all the sports in one day,” Canaan says. That meant football, basketball, baseball, development for all three and forays into other athletic endeavors. It also led to what Canaan describes as no less than his brother's destiny, to do what Jaxon has done this season. “As a toddler, he was able to run, catch, throw early on,” Canaan says. Best I can tell: He'll play Sunday but not at full health. Interviews force long bus rides from one place to the other. If anyone needs an expert on 101-S between those locations … “My dad—that'd be the dream guy to block.” That's from Grey Zabel, the Seahawks left guard. He's close with his father, Mark, who played outside linebacker at the Division II college level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has reportedly approved a request that could open up some of America's most secretive UFO-linked facilities, in a move that will raise hopes among those in search of long-sought-after answers to the existence of alien life. Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison, a member of the congressional oversight committee investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), said he has been granted permission to visit the nation's most secretive UFO-related facilities. In addition to Area 51, multiple US military sites have long been associated with claims of non-human craft, including Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and AUTEC in the Bahamas. Speaking on the ALN Podcast, Burlison explained that his request to President Trump and his team included visits to facilities where evidence of unusual craft, materials, bodies, or archived records is believed to exist. “The extent at which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that ‘we're backing his request. Burlison told the podcast, highlighting official support for his mission. Burlison also mentioned an object housed outside the US so large a building had been constructed around it, though he could not reveal the site due to classification. In previous statements, Burlison has claimed President Trump was "fully briefed" on the existence of aliens, recovered UFOs dating back to the 1940s, and alleged alien-human hybrids currently living on Earth, reports the Daily Mail. Now, with alleged leaks suggesting the White House may reveal what it knows about extraterrestrials by July, the UAP committee could soon be in possession of tangible proof of non-human intelligence. Initially a skeptic, Burlison said he became convinced of the reality of UFOs after hearing whistleblower David Grusch's public testimony in early 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only they don't seem to be working very well. If anything, they only make the wearer easier to spot. Clips of Russian soldiers wearing white thermal ponchos that, at first glance, make them look like giant penguins have been doing the rounds on social media, inspiring all sorts of hilarious comments. The bulky camouflage comes complete with beak-like hoods designed to complete the giant penguin look, even though penguins are not native to Ukraine. The bizarre camouflage is reportedly very cheap, but that is the one positive thing that can be said about it. Even though it might help make wearers harder to detect by the naked eye in snow-covered environments, modern military rarely relies on simple human vision. Drones equipped with thermal cameras and motion detectors patrol disputed battlefront lines, making it very hard for camouflaged soldiers to sneak through. Ukrainian intelligence claims at least two Russian giant penguins were neutralized by drones as they were trying to traverse open fields wearing the goofy costumes. Nighttime might have given them an advantage, but in broad daylight, they stood out like a sore thumb, even against the snowy backdrop. The giant penguin camouflage suits have been getting a lot of attention in the media, but experts say that they are just another attempt by the Russian military to field-test new equipment without prolonged testing or refinement, at the cost of conscript lives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The internet erupted this week after a physicist with past NASA ties claimed astronauts may have witnessed strange objects in space, including snake-like shapes seen by a shuttle pilot. The controversy has revived decades-old mission transcripts, astronaut interviews and conspiracy theories that suggest NASA downplayed unusual sightings to avoid public panic. So what is actually behind the viral claims, and do they truly prove a cover up? During the discussion, he alleged that some astronauts had witnessed unexplained objects in orbit and claimed certain reports were ignored by official investigations. He also questioned why astronaut experiences were not heavily discussed in past NASA commissions. According to the physicist, several individuals with aerospace backgrounds privately shared stories of unusual encounters. While he admitted that many accounts came from personal conversations rather than official reports, supporters quickly framed his remarks as proof of a long-running suppression effort. One of the most viral claims involved shuttle pilot Story Musgrave, who reportedly described seeing snake-like shapes moving through space. Online commentators interpreted this as evidence of unknown life forms or advanced technology. However, experts note that visual illusions in space are common due to lighting effects, floating debris and reflections from spacecraft surfaces. The physicist also referenced conversations with Apollo era astronauts who allegedly observed flashing lights or unidentified objects. Yet no official NASA confirmation links these incidents to extraterrestrial activity, and alternative explanations such as equipment reflections remain possible. Another key part of the viral narrative involves Gemini era mission transcripts, which conspiracy theorists say describe a UFO passing near astronauts and interfering with instruments. Online forums quickly amplified the idea that NASA deliberately omitted certain details from public reports. Equipment malfunctions were also common during early spaceflight, making it difficult to separate technical issues from alleged encounters. No publicly verified document confirms deliberate UFO interference with astronaut systems. They emphasise that anecdotal stories, personal memories and second hand accounts cannot replace peer reviewed research or physical evidence. They add that astronauts often witness unusual visual effects in space, which can appear mysterious without proper context. While the stories remain intriguing, there is currently no confirmed evidence that NASA suppressed proof of alien encounters or hidden space creatures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This means the Trump administration is ready for a tell-all about aliens at a time when the Epstein Files have angered people. This pertains to all such places that are rumoured to be hiding bodies of aliens, and where alleged sightings of unidentified spacecraft have been made. He told the ALN Podcast that he has been permitted to visit these places, which could be hiding archives and other material linked to these "extra-terrestrial" visitors. Several people have told Congress at hearings that the government has known about alien visits for decades and has covered up everything about them. They say there are alien spacecraft and even dead bodies of these space visitors at particular places in the US. The congressional oversight committee has been investigating these claims linked to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). There have been reports in the past weeks that the White House is preparing to release information on everything linked to aliens on Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bank account named for an ancient god in Israel. The mystery of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's alleged visit to China. But the Justice Department's newly released batch of Epstein files on Friday, which contained over 3 million pages of documents, has taken things to a new intensity. “If you think Epstein was just some rich pedo, you're missing the big picture,” wrote the X/Twitter account Clandestine, which has more than 734,000 followers. Those include revelations that various Jewish nonprofits had courted Epstein for donations even after his conviction, evidence of Epstein's financial ties with several Orthodox yeshivas, and new details about his well-known relationship with former prime minister Ehud Barak. In another email dated August 2010 to Jewish entertainment publicist Peggy Siegal, discussing a party guest list, Epstein wrote, “No, goyim in abundance- jpmorgan execs brilliant wasps.” Some of the largest conspiracist personalities seized on the new document dump, claiming that it confirmed their longstanding beliefs about secret Jewish control. “Remember the end of last year when I was called antisemitic for telling you this is the literal, religious worldview of many people in power?,” Candace Owens, right-wing commentator turned conspiracist, wrote in a post on X responding to a photo of an email where Epstein used the term. “Type in ‘goy' or ‘goyim' in the Epstein files and be sure to tag a Christian who needs to wake up and leave the Zionist cause.” “The Epstein files create an opportunity for us to discuss this, to hear the way they speak about us behind closed doors exactly how Sigmund Freud spoke, it's racist,” said Owens during the stream, which had reached 2 million views on YouTube Thursday. On Sunday, Owens posted on X, “Yes, we are ruled by satanic pedophiles who work for Israel,” adding “This is the synagogue of Satan we are up against.” It isn't just leading antisemitic personalities but rank-and-file social media users who have sought to paint the data dump as an indictment of Jewish power. “Normies: ‘let's not jump to any antisemitic conclusions, we don't know why Epstein did these terrible things.' Epstein: ‘I love trafficking children, manipulating markets, and don't believe goyim are human. Also this is all because I am Jewish,'” wrote an Eastern Orthodox Christianity influencer on X. And right now, the second part is getting almost no attention.” “Turning his private emails into proof of a Jewish conspiracy is pure antisemitism. Rothschild said he believed the files were “reinforcing stuff that these people already are pushing out.” “If you are predisposed to believe Candace Owens' theory that Israel is behind everything bad that's ever happened, you're going to find it in the Epstein files, even if it's not there, because there's so many mentions and there's so much intrigue swirling around about it, because it's just all this raw material you can kind of use it to make whatever you want,” said Rothschild. New conspiracy theories also stemmed from an email exchange where Epstein requested money be wired to a bank account that some concluded was titled “Baal,” the name of an ancient Canaanite god. “Baal is a demonic being that was worshipped in ancient israel by some hebrews before they converted to Judaism. Child sacrifice is a ritual of Baal worshippers, usually through burning, like lsraeI did to Gaza. Archaeological discoveries have found thousands of urns with cremated infant and small children remains. Now we have evidence of Epstein's circle kiIIing and even eating children.” (Similar files say “bank name” where this one says “baal,” suggesting an error.) Others across the ideological spectrum extended longstanding theories about Epstein's ties to Israel. (In July, Carlson received pushback from former prime minister Naftali Bennett after he said Epstein worked for Mossad.) He could set up a meeting with almost any world leader. Left-wing Twitch streamer Hasan Piker also repeated the claim that Epstein was working for Israel in a post on X Sunday. “Benjamin netenyahu [sic] is in the files and former pm ehud barak has such an extensive relationship w esptein [sic] they might as well call it the israel files what the fuck are you talking about,” wrote Piker in another post on X, responding to influencer Eyal Yakoby's claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not named in the files. “Going by sort of the raw number of mentions in an email database is not helpful, because there's no context for it,” said Rothschild. It just means that you have this number and people run with it, because people are taking these things and turning them into proof for whatever conspiracy they already believe in.” On X, another conspiracy theory took hold after users claimed that an email sent from China to Epstein in April 2009 coincided with a trip by Netanyahu that same month. “Benjamin Netanyahu was in China and it seems likely that he was the man sending Jeffrey Epstein torture videos,” wrote Jake Shields, a far-right influencer and former MMA champion, in a post on X. Some conspiracy theorists online rejected the idea that Epstein might have been a Russian asset, instead suggesting it is a distraction being offered to take the heat off Israel. “Jeffrey Epstein- ‘I work for the Rothschilds, Israel, and world Jewry.' In a podcast episode Monday, Jewish conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, who has previously criticized conservative rivals for linking Epstein with Mossad, said there was not evidence in the files that Epstein was blackmailing people “on behalf of a foreign power or a cadre of powerful people who are attempting to shape global policy.” “Antisemitism is huge in these circles, it always has been,” he said. “Whether it's just outright attacks on Jews, or the sort of more crouched globalists, European bankers, you know, antisemitism is a huge part of that world.” But he emphasized that not all claims about Epstein amount conspiracy theories — which is why the drumbeat of antisemitism can continue unabated. I mean, it's not like the Elders of Zion sitting around in a dark room, you know, deciding on the fates of nations, but it's pretty clear that Epstein was at the center of a gigantic conspiracy,” said Rothschild. “Certainly there's always going to be a danger that it falls disproportionately on the Jewish community.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BUTTE -Here on the campus of Montana Tech, you can study science, mathematics, engineering, biology, even nursing, but here in the Chemistry Biology Building in this classroom, you can learn about UFOs. “Fiber optics technology may have come from reverse engineering these craft,” Montana Tech Professor Michael Masters told his class Thursday morning. WATCH: Montana Tech joins a select group of universities offering academic courses on UFO phenomena The Butte university is one of only a handful of colleges around the country with a class on unidentified flying objects. “One of my students was very honest and said that she saw the posters and thought it was a joke and registered to see if it was actually a joke," Masters said. Masters earned his doctorate in anthropology from Ohio State University and has written several books about UFOs. Students in this new class are challenged to research and examine the topic through credible sources. Student Nate O'Neil added, “We couldn't have had this class 10 years ago; we would have all been called crazy for just taking it, probably.“ Masters said Montana Tech has been very supportive of his class and believes this subject is not just for the fringe and should be a topic of serious study. “We have whistleblowers, we have intelligence insiders coming out and saying there is a legacy program, there are craft, there are bodies, they are reverse engineering these craft, and when people are saying that under oath in front of the United States Congress, we need to pay attention to that and we need to take it seriously,” Masters said.</p>
