            Delegations from the United States and Iran concluded indirect talks in the Gulf Arab state of Oman Friday. It was the first round of negotiations between the two sides since the US and Israel struck the Islamic Republic last summer.
    


            Iranian media said the summit ended with a “willingness to continue,” without specifying a date.
    


            The negotiations took place amid an American military buildup in the Middle East, and after US President Donald Trump threatened to strike Iran if it used lethal force against protesters or refuses to sign a nuclear deal.
    


            Ahead of the talks, Iran's foreign minister said his country “enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year.”
    


            “We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.
    


            Still, sharp language has persisted on both sides, with Trump saying on Thursday that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “should be very worried” as both sides prepared for negotiations.
    


            Here's what we know about the talks.
    


            Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff took part in the talks, along with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The talks were indirect – mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who earlier on Friday met with each of the parties separately.
    


            In photos released by the state-run Oman News Agency, the commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), Admiral Brad Cooper, was also seen attending the meetings.
    


            Negotiations are meant to ⁠adopt a format similar to previous rounds, Iranian media said. Before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June, Tehran and Washington had gone through five rounds of negotiations, where Omani mediators shuttled between US and Iranian delegations.
    


            Those talks effectively came to an end after Israel struck Iranian nuclear and military sites in mid-June, after which the US struck three Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            Araghchi presented to his Omani counterpart a “preliminary plan” to “manage the current situation” between Iran and the US, Iranian media reported, in a bid to advance negotiations.
    


            Albusaidi then conveyed the plan to the US delegation led by Witkoff, and the American response will be delivered to the Iranian side during the talks, Iranian media added.
    


            The scope of the talks was unclear. Before the talks, Iranian officials insisted they only wanted to discuss issues related to the nuclear program, and that other matters such as Iran's ballistic missile program, proxies across the region and domestic unrest were off-limits.
    


            The US had demanded a broader set of discussions that includes ballistic missiles, Tehran's armed proxies that remain a danger to US and Israeli interests in the region, and Iran's recent brutal crackdown on protests.
    


            On the nuclear issue, a key point of contention remains Iran's demand to enrich uranium – a nuclear fuel that can be used to make a bomb if purified to high levels – which the US and its allies reject. Iran has offered to place checks on its nuclear program to ensure that it isn't weaponized, demanding the lifting of sanctions in return.
    


            The US moved military assets, including the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, closer to the Middle East, raising concerns that prospects of war were growing.
    


            Trump said last month that the US had “an armada” moving toward Iran “just in case,” adding that while he would rather not “see anything happen,” his administration is watching Iran “very closely.”
    


            The talks gave rise to hopes that a full-blown war may be averted.
    


            Wary of a conflict that may spill into the rest of the Middle East, regional countries have been attempting to de-escalate and deter Trump from launching an attack on Iran, knowing that a new war will only plunge the region into crisis.
    


            “Overshadowing this is a very serious threat of military attack (on Iran) and war,” Negar Mortazavi,” an Iranian-American journalist and political analyst, told CNN's Eleni Giokos
    


            .Iran has made it clear that any US attack will not be met with the same “restraint” it showed last summer, after Israel and the US struck the country.
    


            Iran has a number of tools at its disposal should war break out with the US or Israel. It is believed to have thousands of missiles and drones that could target US troops and assets in the Middle East.
    


            Tehran has repeatedly warned that it would retaliate against US allies in the region if attacked. When US bombers struck Iranian nuclear facilities in the summer, Iran launched an unprecedented missile strike in Qatar, targeting al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military installation in the Middle East.
    


            Iran could also mobilize a vast network of proxies across the region, potentially hitting Israel and US bases, and disrupting shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which more than a fifth of the world's oil and a large share of liquefied natural gas flow. This could send shockwaves through the world.
    


            Despite the talks, “the threat of war is very serious,” Mortazavi said.

            Police have arrested a Maryland man for attempted murder after he allegedly went to Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought's home, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Colin Demarco was arrested on January 16 in connection to an August 10, 2025, incident in Virginia. He is being held without bond, according to a press release from the Arlington County Police Department.
    


            While the press release does not identify Vought as the victim, three sources told CNN the OMB director was the target.
    


            “We are grateful for the work of law enforcement in keeping Director Vought and his family safe,” a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget told CNN.
    


            The Arlington County public defender's office, which is representing Demarco, declined to comment.
    


            Demarco is facing four charges, according to the release: Attempted murder, criminal solicitation to commit murder, carrying a concealed weapon and wearing a mask in public to conceal identity.
    


            On August 10, a witness observed Demarco “on the victim's porch,” wearing rubber gloves and a surgical mask with a backpack, according to police. Demarco “appeared to be concealing a firearm under his shirt.”
    


            The suspect then asked the witness about the victim and left the scene, after which the witness contacted police. Demarco was seen in home surveillance footage which led to his identification, police said.
    


            Digital records obtained during the investigation showed that Demarco had directions to the victim's house, had details on where his relative's firearms were located and had tips on how to not get caught, police said. Demarco also allegedly “posted online about the victim” and solicited others online “to murder the victim.”
    


            CBS was the first to report that the man was facing charges after showing up at Vought's home.
    


            The charges come as other Trump administration officials have faced threats in recent months.
    


            Early last month, a man was arrested and accused of breaking windows at Vice President JD Vance's Ohio home.
    


            In December, the Justice Department charged a man for allegedly sending a threatening text message to presidential envoy and Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell.

Live Updates


            • US-Iran negotiations: Indirect nuclear talks between American and Iranian officials in Oman today were a “good start” and will continue at another time, according to Iran's foreign minister.
    


• Funding fight: Senate Majority Leader John Thune said conversations on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will continue this weekend. The White House said Trump is willing to consider some of Democrats' demands for ICE reforms, but others are “non-starters.”
    


• Fulton County: Trump defended the involvement of spy chief Tulsi Gabbard in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to comment on whether she sent Gabbard, saying, “She was there, we are inseparable.”
    


            • Outrage over video: Trump shared a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, prompting a rare rebuke from the Senate's only Black Republican, Tim Scott, who called it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” It has since been deleted.
    


            The US and Iran have agreed to hold follow-on discussions after consultations with their capitals following today's indirect talks in Oman, an outcome cautiously viewed as a positive result by both sides, according to source familiar.
    


            The US delegation differed from the previous rounds of US-Iran talks, which took place before the US strike on Iranian nuclear sites last year. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff led for the US previously, along with a small team that joined him over time, but Trump's son in law Jared Kushner was in the room this round, and US Central Command Commander Admiral Brad Cooper was part of the delegation.
    


            Kushner had long been expected to join the discussions but Cooper's inclusion in the delegation was not expected far in advance, the source said. His presence marks the first time a senior US military official joined indirect talks with Iran during Trump's second term.
    


Some context: The Iranians grew frustrated with Witkoff over the course of last year's talks and some people involved believe that having new US players could lead to more productive discussions, the source said. Still, the talks' trajectory is yet to be determined, the source warned.
    


            The location for the next round of talks is not yet set in stone but is likely to be Oman, the source said.
    


            In terms of timing, that also remains unclear right now, the source said. Some people involved in the talks believe that slowing down the pace could allow for more robust negotiations to take place, they said.
    


            The White House did not respond when asked for comment.
    


            After the talks ended, in a sign that the US wants to keep up economic pressure, it rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels carrying it.
    


            A racist video shared on President Donald Trump's Truth Social account has been deleted, with the White House now blaming a staffer for posting it late Thursday.
    


            “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a senior White House official told CNN.
    


            The post, which depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes, remained online for roughly 12 hours before it was removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially downplayed the video in a statement Friday morning.
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” she said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”
    


Swift backlash: Politicians from both parties, including GOP Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler, urged Trump to remove the post. A source familiar with the matter said GOP lawmakers had called Trump to discuss it with him.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday that the FBI has arrested a “key participant” behind the 2012 Benghazi terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.
    


            US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in the September 11, 2012 attack along with State Department employee Sean Smith and Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods are killed in the attack.
    


            “We have never forgotten those heroes, and we have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said.
    


            The man accused landed in the United States early this morning, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday morning. A plane that departed Misrata, Libya, on Thursday landed at the Manassas Regional Airport in Virginia at 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to flight data reviewed by CNN.
    


            The man, Zubayar Al-Bakoush, will face charges including murder, attempted murder, terrorism, and arson, Bondi said.
    


            Bakoush was charged eleven years ago, but the case remained sealed until his arrest Friday, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. Her office will be leading the prosecution.

            Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to say whether she directed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to go to the FBI search at an election center in Fulton County, Georgia.
    


                    “She was there, we are inseparable. That's all I can say,” Bondi said at a news conference. 
                





            Bondi added she is not worried that Gabbard's presence may have tainted evidence in their investigation.
    


            She later noted FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey was “taking the lead” on the matter.
    


            The administration has offered differing explanations for Gabbard's presence.
    


            Here's what Deputy AG Todd Blanche told CNN earlier in the week:
    


            GOP Sen. Tim Scott criticized President Donald Trump for sharing a racist video that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, writing Friday that Trump “should remove it.”
    


                    “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X. “The President should remove it.”
                





            The rare rebuke from Scott, who is the only Black Republican in the Senate and was once a vice presidential contender, came hours after Trump shared the video on Truth Social. The video promotes the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen and superimposes the Obamas' faces onto the bodies of apes.
    


            Scott also chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leading the effort to hold onto the GOP's Senate majority in the upcoming midterm elections.
    


            The White House dismissed blowback over the video earlier Friday, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it “fake outrage.”
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” she said.
    


            Indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States were a “positive and good start,” and the two sides agreed to continue the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told local news outlets after talks concluded in the Omani capital of Muscat.
    


            “There was a consensus on the continuation of the talks themselves. It was decided that this process would continue but the timing, manner, and date of that will be decided in the future,” Araghchi said.
    


            Speaking to Iran's state news agency IRNA, Araghchi reiterated that the talks focused “solely” on the nuclear issue and “we did not discuss any other topics with the Americans.”
    


            Araghchi added that Iran remains distrustful of the US, but if the negotiations continue with the “same view” from Washington, then a “framework” for future talks could be reached.
    


                    “But I do not want to judge now,” he said.
                





            Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said both parties will make a decision on the next round of talks after consultations with their respective governments.
    


            Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the negotiations, described the talks in a post on X as “very serious.”
    


                    “It was useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress,” he wrote. “We aim to reconvene in due course, with the results to be considered carefully in Tehran and Washington.”
                





            The US military conducted a strike against another alleged drug-trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean yesterday, killing two people, according to US Southern Command.
    


            “On Feb. 5, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM Commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOM wrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike.
    


            At least 119 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of a campaign, dubbed Operation Southern Spear, that the Trump administration has said is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking.
    


            Indirect talks between Iran and the United States in the Omani capital of Muscat have now ended, with a “willingness to continue,” according to Iranian state news agency IRNA.
    


            Iranian state-affiliated news agency Tasnim said the two countries have agreed that talks will “continue at another time,” without specifying when.
    


            Throughout the day, the Iranian and US delegations “conveyed views, considerations and approaches” through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
    


            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led the Iranian diplomatic delegation, while President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff represented the US. The Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM) Adm. Brad Cooper was also seen in attendance.
    


            President Donald Trump shared a racist video on his social media platform that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, sparking intense condemnation.
    


            The Obamas briefly and suddenly appear near the end of the short video, which promotes false claims that voting machines helped steal the 2020 election, with their faces superimposed onto the bodies of apes. As the images appear, for about one second, the start of the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background.
    


            The post, which recalls the racist trope of comparing Black people with monkeys, prompted swift backlash. In a statement to CNN on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the broader response to the video “fake outrage.”
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” Leavitt said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Obamas for comment.
    


            The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the video in a post on X, writing: “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”
    


            The incident is the latest example of Trump drawing criticism for sharing racist content on his social media platform.
    


            Last year, the president posted an apparent AI video depicting Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office. Later last year, Trump and members of his administration also shared digitally altered images and videos of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero, imagery Jeffries publicly described as racist.
    


            Today, President Donald Trump will sign executive orders at 3 p.m. ET. As of now, this is closed to the press.
    


            Later in the evening, the president will depart Washington, DC, en route to Palm Beach, Florida.
    


On Saturday: The president will meet with the president of Honduras at 3:30 p.m. ET, which is also closed to press.
    


On Sunday: At 6:30 p.m. ET, Trump is scheduled to attend a Super Bowl watch party, closed to press. The president is expected to return to the White House on Sunday night.
    


            The commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), Admiral Brad Cooper, was seen attending meetings on Iran in Oman.
    


            A video posted by the state-run Oman News Agency showed Cooper participating in talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-la, Jared Kushner during their meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
    


            Albusaidi is mediating between the United States and Iran in the indirect negotiations.
    


            Russia and the United States “recognize the need to begin negotiations” on the issue of the lapsed nuclear monitoring treaty, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a news briefing today.
    


            Peskov also described this week's trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US, hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi, as “both constructive and challenging.”
    


            Asked if Russia was negotiating a short-term extension to the New START treaty with the US, Peskov said: “The provisions can be formally extended; informal extensions in this area are unlikely.”
    


                    “But there is an understanding, and this was also discussed in Abu Dhabi, that both sides will take responsible positions, and both sides recognize the need to begin negotiations on this issue as soon as possible,” Peskov added.
                





            The landmark New START treaty, which capped the nuclear arsenals of both the US and Russia, expired on Thursday, renewing fears about a nuclear arms race between the two biggest nuclear superpowers.
    


            US President Donald Trump said yesterday that the US should negotiate a new and improved nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to a treaty extension.
    


                    “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            Ahead of high-stakes talks with the US on Friday, Iran's foreign minister said his country “enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year.”
    


            “We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X hours before the talks.
    


            The talks are the first official meeting between the two sides since the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites last year and come amid heightened tensions.
    


                    “Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric—they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement,” Araghchi wrote.
                





            Araghchi also met his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Oman's capital Muscat ahead of the talks with the US delegation, Iranian media reported.
    


                    Araghchi told Albusaidi that Tehran is “utilizing diplomacy to secure Iran's national interests” while being “fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and national security” against “adventurism,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will “continue through the weekend.”
    


            He said he prefers a full-year funding extension as a backup but CNN has reported that Democrats are opposed to a short-term deal so far. As of now, the two parties appear to be at an impasse on the issue.
    


Remember: The funding deadline is February 13.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for not presenting a clear rebuttal to the Democratic demands on funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Thune has also expressed frustration about not being able to get the Democratic side to sit down and negotiate, and many Republicans have said many of the Democratic demands are nonstarters.
    


            High-stakes talks between the US and Iran are underway in the Omani capital of Muscat, Iranian news agencies reported early on Friday.
    


            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the Iranian diplomatic delegation, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff are representing the US.
    


            Araghchi presented to his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi a “preliminary plan” to “manage the current situation” between Iran and the US and advance negotiations, Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. Albusaidi then conveyed the plan to the US delegation led by special envoy Steve Witkoff, and a US response will be delivered to the Iranian side during the talks, IRNA added.
    


            The White House previously offered limited expectations for negotiations, saying President Donald Trump preferred to resolve tensions diplomatically and that he would receive a briefing from his delegates to the discussions afterward.
    


            Trump hopes the large US military buildup he's ordered in the Middle East will act as leverage as he seeks concessions from Iran on its nuclear and missile programs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","NATO member blasts bloc chief's ‘pro-war' remarks in Kiev","https://www.rt.com/news/632097-hungary-blasts-rutte-ukraine/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 12:26:00 GMT","

Hungarian officials have accused NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte of overstepping his authority and making “pro-war” statements that put the bloc on course for a military clash with Russia.

Rutte visited Kiev this week in a show of support, saying member states would maintain military aid to Ukraine, possibly including troop deployments on Ukrainian soil. Moscow has repeatedly called such a scenario unacceptable.

“We call on the NATO secretary-general not to make pro-war statements,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Thursday, adding that NATO leaders have long agreed not to provoke direct conflict with Russia. Rutte's comments contradict that policy, he asserted.

Rutte suggested troops deployments could be approved by Moscow as part of a US-backed peace deal. Budapest fears pro-Kiev nations – including France, Germany, and the UK – would push to send troops despite Russian objections. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reiterated his concerns Friday, calling the potential move a threat to his country.

“If the Western plan is implemented, then the war will come closer to Hungary, we will be much more directly affected by this,” he said. “Then not only the economic effect, but also the physical destructive effect could reach Hungary.”

Orban's government has opposed Brussels' Ukraine policy, arguing that bankrolling Kiev and imposing sanctions on Russia have damaged the EU's economy while pursuing an unwinnable cause.

That stance and Budapest's resistance to the Ukrainian bid to join the EU has strained relations with Kiev. Ukrainian forces have targeted Hungarian oil supplies from Russia, and Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly verbally attacked Orban. At last month's World Economic Forum, Zelensky said the Hungarian leader should be “smacked” for purportedly “liv[ing] off European money while trying to sell out European interest.”

Budapest says Zelensky is interfering in Hungarian politics ahead of April's parliamentary election, and that Kiev is hoping for a more compliant government to take power.

In wake of Donald Trump's call for Republicans to ‘take over' voting, senator Ruben Gallego urges citizens to take a stand and give the ‘ultimate response'

The Democratic senator Ruben Gallego has proposed that, should Donald Trump try to sabotage the midterm elections, Americans should respond with a general strike that would “grind the country to a halt”.

Earlier this week the US president called for Republicans to “take over” and “nationalise” voting in at least 15 unspecified locations, repeating his false claims that elections are plagued by widespread fraud.

On Thursday, Gallego, a senator for Arizona and an Iraq war veteran, warned that Trump could seek to interfere with the November midterms that will determine control of Congress – and urged citizens to fight fire with fire.

“We have to prepare for the outmost scenario, the worst scenario, which is they try to either capture the ballot box as ballots are being counted, they try to stop the count, they try to surround polling places, whatever it is,” he told the Court of History podcast with political historians Sidney Blumenthal and Sean Wilentz.

“We need to make sure that we have an ultimate response to that which, I believe, has to be a true national strike in the sense that, if they do this, if they try to overthrow our democracy, if you are allied with democracy, do not go to work. If you're a pilot, do not show up. If you drive a train, do not show up. If you're a teacher, do not show up. We grind the country to a halt.”

Gallego, who defeated Trump loyalist Kari Lake in 2024, has gained a reputation as a blunt speaker who sometimes uses profane language to take the fight to Republicans. He continued: “We're not going to keep going to work and boosting the world's greatest economy in exchange for us to give up on democracy.

“If we have to destroy the stock market to save democracy, we need to accept that and, more importantly, the richest and the most powerful people in the world and in this country need to understand that that is a real possibility. There is no economic stability without democratic stability. If you take away our democratic stability, we will take away the economic stability.”

Trump's push to expand federal control over elections comes as his administration has stepped up pressure on many Democratic-led states to turn over voter data, with the justice department suing nearly two dozen states over their voter rolls. Last week the FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County for records related to the 2020 election.

On Monday, Trump floated the idea of nationalising elections in a podcast interview with the former FBI deputy director Dan Bongino and, a day later, told reporters: “The state is an agent for the federal government in elections. I don't know why the federal government doesn't do them anyway.”

His remarks were echoed by Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and influential rightwing commentator, who repeated false claims that people living in the US illegally are voting in big numbers and said on his War Room podcast on Tuesday: “You're damn right we're gonna have ICE surround the polls come November.”

Federal law prohibits the president from deploying military troops at any location holding a general or special election, and several states criminalise carrying firearms at or near polling places. Immigration enforcement could cause both US citizens and legal residents to stay at home out of fear of detention or racial profiling.

Asked about Bannon's comments on Thursday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “I can't guarantee that an ICE agent won't be around a polling location in November – but what I can tell you is I haven't heard the president discuss any formal plans to put ICE outside of polling locations.”

Democrats, long criticised for failing to rise to the challenge of Trump's threat to democracy, have condemned the president's latest remarks. But none went as far as Gallego, tipped as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.

He told the Court of History: “We need to show that this is not acceptable. You cannot go to the levels that we used to invade other countries for, basically, for doing such autocratic shit. Like, they can't. It's not gonna stand. The American public won't stand for it.

“They won't even stand right now the fact that you have ICE agents roaming in our neighbourhoods without warrants. Now, imagine what's going to happen to the American public when you have a bunch of ICE agents trying to go to different ballot boxes and trying to stop the count. The reaction is going to be very, very strong.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Back to Russia, we are getting a line from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, blaming Ukraine for the attempted assassination of a top Russian general in Moscow.

In comments reported by Reuters, he said that it showed that “Zelenskyy seeks to derail peace process” after talks in Abu Dhabi earlier this week.

This Kremlin narrative – presented without any evidence – is not particularly surprising, as Pjotr Sauer explained earlier (10:19).

… and on that note, it's a wrap for today!

A top Russian military official who plays a major role in the country's intelligence services has been taken to hospital after being shot in Moscow (9:36, 9:45).

Without offering any evidence, Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attack, suggesting the attack was intended to disrupt the peace negotiations over ending the Russian invasion of the country (10:19, 12:20).

Alekseyev's shooting will be seen as the latest failure of Russia's security services to protect key military personnel deep inside Russia (10:39).

Separately, the European Commission has put forward new sanctions against Russia amid its continuing aggression on Ukraine, urging member states to swiftly adopt the measures before the fourth anniversary of the full-scale war later this month (15:11).

The move comes amid new warnings from Norway that Russia could step up its spying activities and sabotage attempts in a bid to undermine Oslo's support for Ukraine (14:16).

In other news,

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Milan on Friday to oppose the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and the closure of schools and streets in the city ahead of the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina Winter Games (11:48).

The games officially begin tonight with an opening ceremony at the iconic San Siro stadium in Milan.

US vice-president JD Vance and US secretary of state Marco Rubio are among the highest level international guests attending the games, and they met with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, earlier today (15:43).

Finally,

Heavy rains and strong winds continued to batter parts of Spain and Portugal on Friday, causing at least one death, forcing the evacuation of more than 7,000 people and prompting calls to postpone the second-round of Portugal's presidential election (13:14).

TikTok could be forced into changes to make the app less addictive to users after the EU indicated the platform had breached the bloc's digital safety rules (12:45).

Norway's economic crime police unit, Økokrim, said it has opened an investigation into former prime minister and chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee, Thorbjørn Jagland after the latest release of the so-called Epstein files (11:27).

Russian affairs reporter

Let's go back to Moscow for the latest on the attempted assassination of Lt Gen Vladimir Alekseyev, a top Russian military official who plays a major role in the country's intelligence services.

Alekseyev's condition remains unclear.

Oleg Tsaryov, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian figure close to Alekseyev, said the general had undergone surgery and remained in a coma.

Ukraine has not officially commented on the shooting of the GRU general Alekseyev.

However, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, wrote on X that if Alekseyev survived the attack he would “never sleep peacefully again”.

“No war criminal who has killed and tortured Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, destroyed Ukrainian cities, abducted Ukrainian children, or committed other crimes against the Ukrainian people will ever feel safe,” Prokopenko added.

Prokopenko said Alekseyev had acted as the senior Russian representative during negotiations over captured Ukrainian soldiers during the siege of Mariupol in May 2022, and accused him of bearing responsibility for the systematic torture of captured Azov fighters.

US vice-president JD Vance and US secretary of state Marco Rubio have met with the Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, just hours before the opening ceremony of Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan.

In a pretty funny exchange, after delivering a media statement in Italian, Meloni turned to Vance and said that “I know you didn't know what I was talking about,” with the US VP joking that he “has actually learned Italian since the last time” they met.

Meloni then summarised her opening statement, saying she said “nothing particular” and just repeated some of the usual pleasantries.

She then said that the last time met during the inaugural mass of Pope Leo in Rome, and now they meet at the Olympics, and so Vance gets to experience the values important to Italy and the west.

Vance praised the hosts, saying the city of Milan looks beautiful and that he and his wife had been looking forward to attending the games “pretty much since I became the vice-president.”

They didn't take any questions, which presumably would touch upon some of the controversies surrounding the US security presence at the games (11:48).

The European Commission has put forward new sanctions against Russia amid its continuing aggression on Ukraine.

Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said “while Ukraine continues to defend itself with extraordinary courage on the battlefield, the Kremlin is doubling down on war crimes, deliberately striking homes and civilian infrastructure.”

“Energy facilities and heating systems have all been targeted, leaving entire communities without power in freezing temperatures. This is not the conduct of a state seeking peace. It is the behaviour of a nation waging a war of attrition against a civilian innocent population.”

In a statement, von der Leyen warned “Russia will only come to the table with genuine intent if it is pressured to do so,” as “this is the only language Russia understands.”

The proposed sanctions will cover energy, financial services and trade, the EU said.

The measures will include “a full maritime services ban for Russian crude oil” to “slash further Russia's energy revenues and make it more difficult to find buyers for its oil.”

43 more vessels will also be listed as part of the shadow fleet, reaching 640 in total.

Additional sanctions will also target Russia's banking system, listing 20 more regional banks and taking measures against cryptocurrencies and related companies.

The EU will also “tighten export restrictions to Russia with new bans on goods and services – from rubber to tractors and cybersecurity services, worth over €360m,” and new import bans on metals, chemicals and critical minerals.

The bloc will also “activate for the first time the anti-circumvention tool, by prohibiting the export of any computer numerical control machines and radios to jurisdictions where there is a high risk that these products are re-exported to Russia.”

New measures will also include “stronger legal safeguards for EU companies to protect them from violations of their IP rights or from unfair expropriation in Russia due to abusive court rulings in connection with sanctions.”

Von der Leyen urged EU member states to “swiftly endorse these new sanctions” to “send a powerful signal ahead of the grim fourth anniversary of this [full-scale] war” on 24 February.

Speaking of the High North, France and Canada are opening their consulates in Nuuk, Greenland as a sign of support for the territory amid continuing interest in controlling the semi-autonomous Danish territory from the current US administration.

France is the first EU country to open a consulate in Greenland, in line with last year's political declaration made by the country's president Emmanuel Macron on his visit to Greenland.

The new consul general, Jean-Noël Poirier, has formally started his service today, and been tasked with “working to deepen existing cultural, scientific and economic cooperation projects with Greenland, while strengthening political ties with the authorities there,” the French foreign ministry said.

“I am not afraid of the cold, the 20-hour nights. I was in Libya last year and we had some close calls. We were hit by mortar shells, but here I won't need a bulletproof vest or a helmet like in Tripoli so there's no problem,” Poirier told reporters, quoted by Reuters.

Separately, Canada's foreign minister, Anita Anand, was travelling to Nuuk to inaugurate the Canadian consulate, which officials say also could help boost cooperation on issues such as the climate crisis and Inuit rights. She was joined by Canada's Indigenous governor general, Mary Simon.

Elsewhere, Norwegian security services said they expect Russia to step up its spying on Norway this year, with a focus on the Arctic, and warned that Moscow may commit acts of sabotage aimed at undermining Oslo's support for Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Norway, an ally of Ukraine and Europe's top supplier of pipeline gas, has been increasingly concerned that Russian intelligence agencies could target its energy infrastructure, either physically or via cyber-attacks.

“We expect Russian intelligence services to increase their activity in Norway in 2026, with a continued focus on military targets and allied exercises, Norway's support for Ukraine, and operations in the High North and the Arctic region,” Norwegian security services (PST) said in an annual threat assessment report published on Friday.

Norway has expelled Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover and shut most of its ports to Russian vessels, limiting Moscow's room to manoeuvre. But Russian agencies are expected to adapt, the security services said.

The full report is available here.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as an increase in hybrid threats from Russia, which it denies, since it launched its war in Ukraine.

In the meantime, the Russian business daily Kommersant has a bit more on the attempted assassination of the top Russian general we covered earlier.

The paper said the attacker, posing as a delivery person, shot general Vladimir Alekseyev twice in the stairway of his apartment building, wounding him in the foot and the arm, AP reported.

Alekseyev tried to wrest away the gun and was shot again in the chest before the attacker fled, the report said.

in Madrid

Heavy rains and strong winds continued to batter parts of Spain and Portugal on Friday, causing at least one death, forcing the evacuation of more than 7,000 people and prompting calls to postpone the second-round of Portugal's presidential election.

Storm Leonardo, which has lashed the Iberian peninsula this week, has led the Portuguese government to extend the current state of calamity in 69 municipalities until the middle of February.

The storm has killed one man in Portugal, leaving a young girl missing in the southern Spanish region of Andalucía. It is the latest in a series of deadly storms to have hit Portugal and Spain in recent weeks, killing several people.

The damage and uncertainty brought by the storm has given rise to calls to postpone Sunday's second round of the presidential election in Portugal. 

André Ventura, the leader of the far-right Chega party, said the vote should be delayed by a week as the poll was “a matter of equality among all Portuguese”.

But the national electoral authority said the vote would go ahead as scheduled.

“A state of emergency, weather alerts or overall unfavourable situations are not in themselves a sufficient reason to postpone voting in a town or region,” it said.

Authorities in Andalucía, where more than 7,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, evacuated residential areas near the Guadalquivir River in Córdoba overnight because the dramatic rise in water levels.

About 1,500 residents have been ordered to leave their homes in Grazalema, a mountain village popular with hikers, as water seeped through the walls of houses and cascaded along steep cobbled streets.

Andalucía's regional president, Juan Manuel Moreno, told Cadena Ser radio that aquifers in the Grazalema mountains were full and could provoke landslides owing to pent-up pressure. “This could cause large holes or ditches. If this happens under a house or street, the result could be dramatic,” Moreno said.

He added geologists were assessing the situation in Grazalema to determine when residents would be able to return to their homes.

Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, was due to visit the hardest-hit areas of Andalucía later on Friday.

Scientists say human-driven climate breakdown is increasing the length, intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as the floods and heatwaves that have struck both countries in recent years.

Elsewhere, TikTok could be forced into changes to make the app less addictive to users after the EU indicated the platform had breached the bloc's digital safety rules.

The EU's executive arm said in a preliminary ruling that the popular app had infringed the Digital Services Act (DSA) due to its “addictive design”.

The European Commission said TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, had not adequately assessed how its design could harm the physical and mental wellbeing of users including children and vulnerable adults.

By constantly “rewarding” users with new content, the Chinese-owned platform fuelled constant scrolling and shifted the brains of users into “autopilot mode”, the commission added, which could lead to compulsive behaviour and reduce users' self-control.

The preliminary ruling accused TikTok of ignoring indicators of compulsive use, such as the amount of time children spend on the app at night.

The commission said it was considering forcing changes to the app's design, including alterations to its powerful algorithm that pushes content to users.

Indirect talks end with agreement to maintain diplomatic path and possible continuation in coming days, officials say

Indirect talks between Iran and the US on the future of Iran's nuclear programme ended on Friday with a broad agreement to maintain a diplomatic path, possibly with further talks in the coming days, according to statements from Iran and the Omani hosts.

The relieved Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the eight hours of meetings as a “good start” conducted in a good atmosphere. He added that the continuance of talks depended on consultations in Washington and Tehran, but said Iran had underlined that any dialogue required refraining from threats.

The talks were the first to be held between Iran and the US since Washington and Israel launched devastating military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites and political leadership last June.

The US president, Donald Trump, has in recent weeks assembled a large fleet in the region built around the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group, after telling Iranian protesters in January that “help is on the way” during large-scale anti-government demonstrations.

Iran, which has experienced intense internal unrest in which thousands of protesters have been killed in a bloody crackdown, had insisted that the talks be confined to guarantees about the civilian purpose of its nuclear programme, and not extend to human rights, its missiles, or support for proxy groups in the region including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. “Our talks are solely nuclear and we do not discuss any other issues with the Americans,” Araghchi said.

The indirect talks in Muscat were mediated by Oman's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, in separate talks between the two sides. The US team was led by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The US Centcom commander, Adm Brad Cooper, was also present, underlining how Trump has made US military leverage a central part of his diplomatic armoury.

Al-Busaidi said in a statement: “These consultations focused on creating suitable conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations emphasising the importance of these talks and parties' determination to succeed in achieving lasting security and stability.”

Trust between Iran and the US has been minimal since the US backed the launch of Israeli military strikes on Iran only days before the two sides were due to meet for a sixth round of talks last June.

“After eight turbulent months during which we went through a war, resuming a process of dialogue is not simple,” Araghchi said. “The deep mistrust that has developed on top of previous mistrust is a serious challenge. First we must overcome the prevailing atmosphere of distrust … If this trend continues, I think we can reach a good framework for an agreement”.

Washington wanted to expand the talks to cover Iran's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups in the region and “treatment of their own people” – as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Wednesday. But, after days of speculation, Iranian negotiators were satisfied that only the nuclear dispute would be discussed, at least initially.

Iran is seeking assurances that the US is not using the talks as a smokescreen to impose regime change.

Before the talks, Tehran said the US had to drop its request for the negotiations to be held in Turkey in the presence of foreign ministers from Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

Iran says its right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil – a right it was granted in the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by Barack Obama – is not negotiable. The best source of compromise is that Iran agrees to suspend plans to enrich uranium for a fixed number of years, and a regional consortium is formed that enriches uranium, taking the region closer to an integrated civil nuclear programme.

Iran is also seeking sanctions relief in return for a new inspections regime at its nuclear sites. The value of the rial against the dollar has halved since the Israeli attacks in June, and Iran's plummeting standard of living, made worse by runaway food inflation close to more than 100%, was the spark for the demonstrations that broke out in late December.

The talks were meanwhile being held against the backdrop of repeated warnings by Trump that he will strike Iran militarily from the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier group if no progress is made. The US has been building up its naval presence in the region after the Iranian government crackdown on protests, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Tehran has said it will not hesitate to attack Israel or US military bases in the region if it is attacked. Washington last month held back from attacking Iran partly because Israel and the US military did not feel they were fully prepared to withstand the likely Iranian reprisals.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jeremiah Kithinji had never touched a computer before he finished high school. A decade later, he is teaching robotics, and even took a team of rural Kenyans to the World Robotics Olympiad in Singapore.

In a classroom in Laikipia County — a sparsely populated grasslands region of northern Kenya known for its rhinos and cheetahs — pupils are busy snapping together wheels, motors and sensors to assemble a robot.

Guiding them is Kithinji, 27, who runs a string of robotics clubs in the area that have taken some of his pupils far beyond the rural landscapes outside.

In November, he took a team of three to Singapore for the Olympiad, where he also served as the competition's first Kenyan judge. They presented a simulated space mission with a robot that could launch a model satellite and collect space debris.

Singapore was an eye-opening experience for Kithinji, who was educated in a modest rural school without access to computers.

“I felt this country is so advanced. Interacting with the people showed me how much they care about their nation, and it made me think about how I can instil the same mindset in my students,” he said.

Kenya has pushed science and engineering in its latest curriculum, but lacks the resources for robotics training.

The clubs in Laikipia, which reach about 200 pupils, are funded by Science in a Suitcase, which helped train Kithinji and funded the trip to Singapore.

They have inspired Natalia Wangari, 14.

“In the future, when I become a neurosurgeon, I won't have to perform every surgery myself. I can build a robot that acts as a doctor. I'll just need to code it, and it will do the surgery itself,” she said.

Kithinji said he hoped robotics could provide solutions to some of Kenya's specific challenges.

He previously coached a team at the African Olympiad in South Africa in 2024, where they designed agricultural robots that can operate farming tools and irrigate fields, and sees particular benefits for rural hospitals — assisting in surgeries and delivering medication.

He dreams of more support and collaborators to expand his robotics program across the country.

For now, his pupils are focused on winning a place at the next Olympiad, in Puerto Rico, and they are brainstorming ideas for this year's theme: Robots meet culture.

Whatever happens, Kithinji said he is happy they are taking control of modern technology.

“The skills these kids are developing — critical thinking, problem-solving and technical skills... are the future skills our country needs,” he said. “I want our kids to create the technology, not just consume it.”


VAGUE: 
                                        The criteria of the amnesty remain unclear, but it would cover political violence from 1999 to today, and those convicted of murder or drug trafficking would not qualify                                        Venezuelan Acting President Delcy Rodriguez on Friday announced an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of prisoners, including opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists detained for political reasons.
The measure had long been sought by the US-backed opposition. 
It is the latest concession Rodriguez has made since taking the reins of the country on Jan. 3 after the brazen seizure of then-Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.
Rodriguez told a gathering of justices, magistrates, ministers, military brass and other government leaders that the ruling party-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly would take up the bill with urgency.
Rodriguez also announced the shutdown                                    



                                                                                Civil society leaders and members of a left-wing coalition yesterday filed impeachment complaints against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, restarting a process sidelined by the Supreme Court last year.
Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
The filings come on the same day that a committee in the House of Representatives was to begin hearings into impeachment complaints against Marcos, accused of corruption tied to a spiraling scandal over bogus flood control projects.
Under the constitution, an impeachment by the

Japan would switch the world's largest nuclear power plant back on next week, after a glitch with an alarm forced the suspension of its first restart since the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant disaster.

Takeyuki Inagaki, the head of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant run by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), yesterday said that they planned to start up the reactor on Monday.

The announcement came after TEPCO restarted the reactor on Jan. 21, but shut it off the following day after an alarm from the monitoring system sounded.

Due to an error in its configuration, the alarm had picked up slight changes to the electrical current in one cable even though these were still within a range considered safe, Inagaki said.

The firm has now changed the alarm's settings as the reactor is safe to operate, he added.

The commercial operation would commence on or after March 18, after another comprehensive inspection, he said.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world's biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven would restart.

The facility had been offline since Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.

Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.

Public opinion in the area around the plant is divided: About 60 percent of residents oppose the restart, while 37 percent support it, a survey conducted by Niigata Prefecture in September last year showed.

Last month, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority, saying that the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and was struck by a strong quake in 2007.


VAGUE: 
                                        The criteria of the amnesty remain unclear, but it would cover political violence from 1999 to today, and those convicted of murder or drug trafficking would not qualify                                        Venezuelan Acting President Delcy Rodriguez on Friday announced an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of prisoners, including opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists detained for political reasons.
The measure had long been sought by the US-backed opposition. 
It is the latest concession Rodriguez has made since taking the reins of the country on Jan. 3 after the brazen seizure of then-Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.
Rodriguez told a gathering of justices, magistrates, ministers, military brass and other government leaders that the ruling party-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly would take up the bill with urgency.
Rodriguez also announced the shutdown

Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
The filings come on the same day that a committee in the House of Representatives was to begin hearings into impeachment complaints against Marcos, accused of corruption tied to a spiraling scandal over bogus flood control projects.

Team Taiwan has announced its 30-man roster for the upcoming World Baseball Classic (WBC), which includes two Taiwanese-American players set to suit up for the first time.

The roster, unveiled yesterday and captained by 2024 WBC Premier Most Valuable Player Chen Chieh-hsien, consists of 16 pitchers, three catchers and 11 position players, including four outfielders.

Among them are five-year MLB outfielder Stuart Fairchild and infielder Jonathon Long, who play for the Triple-A affiliates of the Cleveland Guardians and the Chicago Cubs respectively.

Both players were born to Taiwanese mothers and would be making their international debuts for Taiwan.

Pitchers to watch include Lin Yu-min of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Lin Wei-en of the Athletics, both of whom have been invited to their teams' MLB spring training camps.

Also on the roster are two fireballers playing in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball — Gu Lin Ruei-yang and Hsu Jo-hsi, the best local pitchers in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League in 2024 and last year respectively.

However, only three of the 16 selected pitchers are left-handers.

Other notable players include Yu Chang, who was named Pool A Most Valuable Player in the 2023 WBC, and Cheng Tsung-che, the only Taiwanese batter to have played in the MLB last year.


HEATED RIVALRY: 
                                        The pair had met 14 times previously, with Sabalenka winning eight of the encounters and entering the final as the favorite to take the title                                        Elena Rybakina took revenge over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to win a nail-biting Australian Open final yesterday and clinch her second Grand Slam title.
The big-serving Kazakh fifth seed held her nerve to pull through 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne in 2 hours, 18 minutes.
It was payback after the Belarusian Sabalenka won the 2023 final between two of the hardest hitters in women's tennis.
The ice-cool Rybakina, 26, who was born in Moscow, adds her Melbourne triumph to her Wimbledon win in 2022.
It was more disappointment in a major final for Sabalenka, who won the US Open                                    


GUNNING FOR A WIN:

Mikel Arteta's side had put themselves in pole position in the first leg and Havertz came off the bench to finish the 4-2 aggregate victory in the closing moments at the Emirates Stadium.
It was a cathartic triumph for the Gunners, who had lost their previous four semi-finals in last year's UEFA Champions League and League Cup, the 2022 League Cup and the 2021 UEFA Europa League.

Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic had not played since suffering a bone bruise in the left knee he hyperextended in a game against Miami on Dec. 29 last year.
The Serbian big man did not miss a beat. He led all scorers, connecting on eight of 11 shots from the field, and also handed out five assists with three steals while playing just 24 minutes, 32 seconds as the

When Mark Carney spoke in Davos last month about the need for Canada and other nations to stand up for themselves, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been waging a global tariff war and making 51st-state threats, the Prime Minister said it was time for Canada to assert its sovereignty. 

He then went off script, adding an impromptu line that wasn't part of his planned speech. In calling for Canada to defend its North, Carney said the country needs more “boots on the ice.”

At the Milan Cortina Winter Games, where sports and politics are about to collide against a backdrop of Canada-U.S. vitriol, hockey is set to emerge as the front line of a new proxy war.

Welcome to boots on the ice, Olympic-style.

Gone are the days when Canadian Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents made friendly wagers on Olympic hockey – as Stephen Harper and Barack Obama did in 2010 and 2014, resulting in several cases of American beer being shipped to Ottawa.

Cathal Kelly: Welcome to the Olympics, where Canada is swaggering and the U.S. may not notice

Relations are far frostier these days, and even the players know this tournament just feels different than any other Olympics in recent memory.

When Canada played the U.S. at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February, during the height of Trump's 51st state musings, the games were steeped in political overtones far beyond anything the two countries had experienced before.

“We didn't come to the game thinking about politics. It just kind of panned out that the tournament happened at that time,” said Brandon Hagel of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who played for Canada at that tournament and will do so again in Milan.

“Of course we knew what was going on in the world at the time, it was all over social media, so you'd be lying if you said you didn't.”

In a moment that will go down in Canadian hockey lore, the two teams fought three times in the opening nine seconds of their first meeting. Hagel, who doesn't consider himself a fighter, was in the middle of it all, readily accepting a challenge from American Matthew Tkachuk two seconds after the puck was dropped.

The fight has enshrined him as a national hero of sorts. When Hagel went home to Edmonton this summer, it was all people wanted to talk about.

“I told Hags, if you pay for a drink in Canada in the next 10 years, I'll be really disappointed,” said Team Canada coach Jon Cooper, also Hagel's coach in Tampa.

The tension, and the impact current affairs had on those games, was also not lost on the coach.

“You can't ever understate what politics did to that tournament,” Cooper said.

The ice at Milan's hockey arena is ready to go – but just barely

“My news conference against Sweden was all hockey. My pressers by the final [versus the U.S.] were, like, three-quarters politics.”

The Olympics has stricter rules against fighting. Still, world events have a way of finding their way into international hockey.

A showdown between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union at the 1969 world championships, just months after Soviet tanks rolled into Prague, is considered some of the dirtiest and most heated hockey ever played. The Czechs won.

Then there was 1972 and Canada's clash with the Soviets. And the American ‘Miracle on Ice' in 1980. Those were as much about ideology as they were about goals and assists.

Today, Trump is the flashpoint. And not just for Canada. 

At the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, the Russian team (which wasn't allowed to play as Team Russia after the country was penalized for doping infractions in 2014) came to Korea wanting to show up the U.S.

At the time, Trump and Russia were sparring over sanctions and the expulsion of diplomats from Washington, among other things – and the game between the two countries was unusually physical for Olympic hockey, with multiple scrums and penalties. In the stands, former Soviet legend and retired NHL star Igor Larionov, who was there doing colour commentary for Russian TV, felt nostalgic. He knew exactly what he was seeing.

“What's happening in the world right now – two countries trying to push each other with disagreements and politics – I've been around, I lived on this stage myself in ‘84 and ‘88 … that's war,” Larionov told me at the time.

“We're talking about sports. But next to sports goes politics,” he said. “You're going to war. That's how it works.”

Russia won 4-0. Some called it hockey; Larionov called it “foreign affairs.”

“I'm sure they got a phone call from upper management to play hard,” he quipped, noting that the Kremlin had probably tuned in to watch that night.

Canada's best medal chances at the Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to our experts

At last year's 4 Nations Face-Off, where Canada lost 3-1 to the Americans in the seeding round in Montreal, then defeated the U.S. 3-2 in overtime to win the tournament in Boston, the Canadian players could sense the moment.

“We were definitely playing for Canada. I mean, Canada is so proud of their hockey and it's something that we take very seriously,” Tampa forward Brayden Point said in an interview this fall.

“So to get the win, I think that was bigger than just our team winning. It was a win for Canada.”

Point is injured and won't get the chance to play in Milan. On Thursday, Team Canada announced he would be replaced by Seth Jarvis of the Carolina Hurricanes, who was also on the 4 Nations roster.

American Auston Mathews is less eager to talk politics. The Toronto Maple Leafs captain, who is expected to lead the U.S. in Milan, said a few weeks ago he wasn't concerned about such things.

“I don't really pay attention to that stuff much. I think you're kind of aware of it, and there's only so much that you can control,” Matthews said. “When we go to the Olympics my focus will be on Team USA.” 

As head coach of Canada, Cooper is curious whether the games in Milan will reach the level of raucousness that the 4 Nations games did, given that they were played in Montreal and Boston, with an arena full of Canadian and American fans.

“Whether that's going to be recreated in Italy, when you're multiple time zones away in a different continent, it's hard to sit here and say. But it's the Olympics. It is the granddaddy of them all,” Cooper said in an interview.

“But it's going be hard to replicate the fact that all the fans in the building are all Canadian and American. In Italy, all countries will be in the building. It's just going to be a different vibe.”

NHL players are returning to the Olympics for the first time in 12 years. Before the 4 Nations tournament, many of them had never had the chance to play best-on-best international hockey. Cooper has seen the impact that can have.

“I think those kids put the jersey on for the first time, it meant something way beyond hockey,” Cooper said.

The only certainty in the months to come is that the past year of erratic threats and vandalism from the Trump administration will continue, writes Tony Keller.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

On Wednesday in Washington, D.C., U.S. Vice-President JD Vance addressed a conference called by the United States to encourage the world to co-operate with it in breaking China's dominance in critical minerals. 

Mr. Vance – the No. 2 in an administration that has spent the last year slapping allies with tariffs, insults and demands for territory – told a room of officials from 54 countries that he hoped they could come together “to form a trading bloc among allies and partners,” because “our alliances and our friendships can really help one another.” 

He continued in this vein for some time, closing with “let me just reiterate: We here, I think all of us, are friends.”

The audience of diplomats must have struggled to not burst out in laughter.

On Thursday, also in Washington, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked whether the Trump administration wants free trade with allies and friends.

“If Canada, for example, came to the United States and said, ‘We're going to zero tariffs on the United States,” asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. “Would [the U.S.] go to zero tariffs?”

“Absolutely not,” replied Mr. Bessent. 

Opinion: In Carney's world, Canada is more powerful than Trump thinks

There are Canadians who still believe that everything the Trump administration has said, threatened or done against us is, at root, our fault. If you're reading me online, you can meet this opinion in the comments section. I see it in my mail and on social media. It is minority opinion, though depressingly widespread among Conservative voters. 

Before the second Trump administration, nearly everything moving across the world's longest border did so tariff-free. Yes, Canada had negotiated barriers in some relatively small sectors such as dairy products, while the Americans bent the rules to levy tariffs in discrete sectors including softwood lumber. But for more than 35 years, Canada-U.S. trade was almost entirely free.

Who changed that? Not Canada. Who is threatening to further undermine it? Not Canada. Who keeps saying that the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement could be done away with, and perhaps replaced with nothing? Not us. 

The Trump administration convening a conference to try to foster an industrial alliance against China is particularly ironic – given that the Trump administration has spent the last year aggressively degrading and dismantling all such alliances.

Why did China slap tariffs on Canadian canola? Because Canada, following the lead of our U.S. ally, put 100-per-cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The Biden administration understood that the North American auto industry was under threat from Chinese industrial strategy, and responded with a North American industrial strategy – a strategy of partnering with allies like Canada.

The Trump administration ripped that up. They've bullied automakers to shift production to the U.S. from Canada, and there have been repeated public statements from President Donald Trump and his minions that the integrated North American auto industry should be an America-only industry.

Canada's industrial base, once a partner, is now prey. And not only in autos.

Andrew Coyne: Separatism isn't treason. Helping Trump take over Canada? That's another matter

Mr. Vance may have mouthed aspirational words about “a trading bloc among allies and partners,” but the Trump administration has spent the last year aggressively pursuing the opposite. 

In 12 reckless months, it has torpedoed free trade; forced erstwhile partners against China to cut (solo) deals with China, as Canada had to do to lower canola tariffs; threatened to occupy NATO allies; and erected trade barriers aimed at ensuring the U.S. buy less from Canada.

What remains of our free trade with the U.S. is a tattered USMCA, shot through with holes and cracks down to the foundation. 

The only certainty in the months to come is that the past year of erratic threats and vandalism will continue.

The same day as a Janus-tongued Mr. Vance spoke in Washington, former prime minister Stephen Harper gave a speech in Ottawa. It was the 20th anniversary of the formation of his Conservative government. His audience were mostly Conservatives.

He told them to get over their illusions about the situation next door.

Mr. Harper has described himself as the most pro-American prime minister in Canadian history. But on Wednesday, he said that the main challenge facing our country is “a hostile United States.”

Or to quote him in full: “A hostile United States that has openly questioned Canadian sovereignty, that has openly broken the trade commitments that we have made to each other and that regularly issues further threats against us.”

He continued, “There are many, particularly in the business community who believe that things will go back to the way they were in due course, with secure and predictable access to the U.S. market and a United States that upholds a global order. 

“I do not believe that is a safe assumption.”

I wish Mr. Harper was wrong. He isn't.

Russian Lieutenant-General Vladimir Alexeyev in June, 2023.Russian Defence Ministry/via REUTERS

A top Russian military intelligence official was shot in his Moscow apartment building and rushed to hospital on Friday, investigators said, the latest in a series of assassination attempts Russia has blamed on Ukraine.

An unidentified gunman fired several shots at Lieutenant-General Vladimir Alexeyev, deputy head of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence arm, before fleeing the scene, the investigators said. Alexeyev's position meant he would have been closely involved in prosecuting Russia's war in Ukraine.

Alexeyev, 64, whose work has been recognized by President Vladimir Putin with a Hero of Russia award, was reported to be in a serious condition in hospital.

Born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, Alexeyev was placed under U.S. sanctions over Russian cyber interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The European Union imposed sanctions on him over the poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in 2018.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine of being behind the assassination attempt, which he said – without citing evidence – was designed to sabotage peace talks.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.

The shooting follows a series of attacks targeting senior Russian military personnel.

Since the start of the war in 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence has claimed responsibility for assassinating several senior Russian officers, some of whom have appeared on a public list of Ukraine's enemies.

The Kommersant daily, citing law enforcement sources, said Alexeyev's attacker had been waiting when he left his apartment to go to work and that Alexeyev had sustained gunshot wounds to an arm, a leg and his chest during a struggle.

The Kremlin said it hoped Alexeyev, who was born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, would survive and recover. Putin has been briefed on the shooting and Russia's intelligence services are investigating, it said.

“It is clear that military commanders and high-level specialists are at risk during wartime,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

“But it is not the Kremlin that should be deciding how to ensure their safety. This is a matter for the special services.”

Some pro-Kremlin Russian journalists, war bloggers and members of the public asked why such important figures were not better protected.

“How can this happen? Or is it only in films that we see that such people should have security guards? This is not the first time this has happened,” a woman called Ludmila wrote beneath a state media article on the shooting.

A neighbour of Alexeyev, who gave her name as Alessandra, said CCTV in the apartment building had been working well after unconfirmed reports that the gunman had gained access by posing as a food delivery courier.

Alexeyev's boss, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.

Ukraine, Russia agree to prisoner swap on second day of U.S.-brokered peace talks

The latest round of talks concluded on Thursday. The Kremlin said they were constructive and that talks would continue.

Some pro-Kremlin commentators suggested, without evidence, that the assassination attempt against Alexeyev was a Ukrainian move to derail the talks and questioned why such negotiations should continue.

Since December, 2024, three other officials of the same rank as Alexeyev have been killed in or near Moscow. The head of the General Staff's army training directorate was killed by a bomb placed under his car on December 22 last year.

Alexeyev was responsible for relations between the Defence Ministry and the Wagner mercenary group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, which fought in some of the fiercest battles in the early stages of the war in Ukraine.

Prigozhin was critical of the defence establishment and staged a mutiny in June, 2023, when Alexeyev was among officials sent to negotiate with him. The mutiny fizzled out and Prigozhin died in a plane crash two months later.

Leonardo, the seventh storm to hit the Iberian Peninsula this year, has dumped months' worth of rain in a few hours on parts of Spain and Portugal. Thousands have been evacuated, and road and rail lines have been cut.

Parts of southern Spain and Portugal were facing severe disruption on Thursday due to torrential rainfall, floods and landslides brought by Storm Leonardo.

Leonardo is the seventh storm to hit the Iberian Peninsula this year. Last week, five people died, hundreds were injured and tens of thousands were left without electricity in Portugal.

Rising global temperatures due to human-driven climate change mean floods and other extreme weather events in Europe are becoming more frequent, more intense and longer, scientists say.

Spain's eastern Valencia region saw the worst flashfloods in the country's recent history in October 2024, when 237 people were killed.

In Spain's Malaga province, a woman was missing after she was swept away by the Turvilla River while she was trying to save her dog, the local fire chief said.

""We found the dog, but not her,"" Manuel Marmolejo told Spanish television.

Some areas of the southern Spanish region of Andalusia saw more than 40 centimeters (15 inches) of rain on Wednesday — the equivalent of several months' worth of rainfall.

The rains, floods and landslides have forced nearly 4,000 people to evacuate their homes and paralyzed dozens of roads and railway lines.

The regional Andalusia president, Juan Manuel Moreno, said the same amount of rain fell on the mountain village of Grazalema in 16 hours as ​the Madrid region would see in a year.

Two nearby reservoirs, which are at risk of bursting because of the torrential rains, were set to be drained, Moreno said.

Spain's national weather agency AEMET has lifted the highest alert for the south of the country.

But it warned that ""Marta"", the next front in the so-called ""storm train"" this year, is expected to hit the peninsula in the coming days. 

In neighboring Portugal, a man of around 70 died in the rural Alentejo region on Wednesday after his car was swept away on a road near a dam, local authorities said.

In the neighboring region of Santarem, authorities on Thursday issued the highest flood alert for the Tagus River.

People living near the river have been evacuated, authorities said.

Mario Silverstre, the country's civil protection chief, warned that the flood threat along the Tagus was the most serious in three decades.

In Alcacer do Sal, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of the capital Lisbon, the Sado River burst its banks on Wednesday, flooding the town center. The water level was as high as two meters (seven feet) in some parts of the town.

Portugal's national weather agency IPMA said January was the country's second-wettest since 2000.

In the north and center of the country, train services have been suspended, while in the capital, parks and tunnels have been shut and river transport connections have been suspended.

Like Spain, more heavy rains are forecast to hit Portugal in the coming days.

Leonardo has also caused death and destruction further south, in Morocco, where at least three people have died and 140,000 people have been evacuated.

The diplomatic row comes after Sejm speaker Czarzasty said Donald Trump didn't ""deserve"" the Nobel Peace Prize. Poland is one of the US' closest allies in Europe and lies on NATO's eastern flank.

The United States' ambassador to Poland, Tom Rose, said he was cutting all contact with Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the country's lower house of parliament, known as the Sejm.

Rose accused Czarzasty of making ""outrageous and unprovoked insults directed against [US President Donald Trump].""

Warsaw is one of the US' closest allies in Europe and has one of the highest military budgets as a percentage of GDP within the US-led NATO military alliance.

Poland, which borders both Russia and Ukraine, is also one of Kyiv's strongest supporters within the EU and its government has been skeptical of Trump's efforts to negotiate a peace deal with Moscow.

The US envoy's announcement comes after Czarzasty, who is a member of the center-left New Left party, said he would not support a bid to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday.

""I won't support the application for a Nobel prize for Trump because he does not deserve it,"" Czarzasty said.

""[Trump] represents power politics and, by the use of force, pursues transactional politics,” he argued.

The speaker criticized the US-led establishment of a new Board of Peace body tasked with overseeing the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, calling instead for countries to strengthen pre-existing organizations such as the European Union, the NATO military alliance, the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Czarzasty also took aim at Trump's stated desire for the United States to take over the autonomous Danish territory of Greenland as well as comments downplaying the European contribution to the 2001-2021 US-led invasion of Afghanistan.

On Thursday, Czarzasty said that the US ambassador's decision would not make him change his position.

""I regret the ambassador's declaration, but I will not change my position on these fundamental issues for [Poland],"" the speaker was cited as saying by Polish media.

Czarzasty's New Left is part of Poland's broad governing coalition under Prime Minister Donald Tusk of the center-right Civic Coalition (KO) party.

Tusk criticized Rose's comments in a post on the platform X.

""Allies should respect, not lecture, each other. At least this is how we, here in Poland, understand partnership,"" Tusk said in a post addressed to the US envoy.

The row sparked criticism from US politicians, with Republican lawmaker Don Bacon declaring: ""Time for a new Ambassador.""

Meanwhile, KO lawmaker Zbigniew Konwinski accused Rose of threatening the Polish government.

""Ambassador Rose smoothly switched from an attack on the speaker of the Sejm to threats against the government,"" he said on X, adding that he found this to be an ""astonishing"" form of diplomacy.

Poland is a European Union member state and the disparate parties in its current coalition government have typically called for closer ties with Brussels.

Meanwhile, Polish President Karol Nawrocki — whose June 2025 election bid was endorsed by Trump — is closely aligned with the opposition nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that has called for a looser EU.

Poland's president can veto legislation and serves as the commander-in-chief of the army, while other executive powers are in the hands of the prime minister and the Cabinet.

Trump told Nawrocki during an Oval Office meeting in September that the US did not intend to withdraw troops from Poland, saying: ""We'll put more there if you want.""

Residents have shared stories of abusive actions and drunk driving by off-duty ICE agents at the hotels.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

A committee within the Minneapolis City Council has delayed the renewal of liquor licenses for two hotels in the city's downtown area, citing concerns that agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are staying at the hotel during the Trump administration's ongoing “Operation Metro Surge” immigration raids.

The “Committee of the Whole” (a committee that includes every member of the city council) met on Tuesday with the goal of discussing liquor license renewals for dozens of businesses throughout Minneapolis. More than 100 licenses were renewed, but renewals for the two hotels in question — Hilton Minneapolis-Mill District and The Depot Minneapolis — were stalled until the next meeting later this month, on February 17. 

The vote was 8-5 in favor of delaying the renewals.

The delay does not halt liquor operations at those locations for the time being, but it does allow for more discussion on whether their licenses should be revoked. Council members in favor of the delay said their decision was based on comments they received from constituents, who have expressed concerns about ICE agents' activities in and around the hotels, including nuisance complaints and drunk driving by off-duty agents. 

“I think it's really important that we get to have some further discussions amongst each other, and I also think it's important that the public has an opportunity to share the stories that are coming out of hotels that have ICE agents within them,” council member Aurin Chowdhury said at the meeting.

Council member Aisha Chughtai agreed, stating:

What we're seeing happen in real time in hotels that have these types of contracts with the federal government is at night, when agents come back from their being out and about, beating people up, separating families and abducting people for fun all day, they drink heavily at the bar and have weapons on them.

Chughtai cited an incident where “a drunk agent who's not on duty has pulled a weapon on a resident of our city.”

“That is danger, that is a real danger to public safety in our community and so necessitates us having further conversations to try to figure out how we can ensure greater public safety for the residents that we serve,” Chughtai added. 

The hotels have been the sites of demonstrations by residents who are fed up with the nearly 3,000 DHS agents who have been sent to the Twin Cities by the Trump administration to terrorize, abduct, and deport people.

Despite council members stating a desire to discuss the issue further, revoking liquor licenses from the hotels would be a challenge, one attorney for the city said, as the hotels appear to be complying with all licensing laws, and the council would need more substantive facts to take their licenses away.

Still, the council could take actions that would result in licenses being revoked, including changing some rules on who can get licensed. Changing licensure rules isn't out of the ordinary, Council President Elliott Payne said, adding that the committee should have a “fact-based conversation” on the matter. 

While some council members expressed concerns about a potential lawsuit, as well as a need to be fair about the process, others expressed dismay at demonstrators, with one member derogatorily describing them as “agitators.” That characterization prompted a sharp rebuttal from Council Vice President Jamal Osman, who is a Somali immigrant.

“Our president called us garbage and sent troops here to terrorize us. Agitators are our heroes,” Osman said.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The high court now requires its employees to sign nondisclosure agreements that threaten legal action for leaks.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Two weeks after the November 2024 election of Donald Trump, the Supreme Court instituted a new policy to hide its actions from public scrutiny, according to a recent report in The New York Times. Chief Justice John Roberts told the court's employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement pledging to keep the court's internal workings secret.

Although employees of the court have long been compelled to remain silent about what happens behind the scenes, the new nondisclosure agreement requirement is stiffer than prior agreements employees had signed. The new agreement now reportedly threatens legal action against any employee who reveals confidential information.

By contrast, a watered-down ethics rule adopted two years ago says that Supreme Court and other federal judges are not required to publicly disclose their meals or overnight visits at residences owned by private persons or corporations.

“Instead of promoting trust and opting for greater transparency in the ethics of individual justices, the Supreme Court has chosen more secrecy,” Ellen Yaroshefsky, Professor of Legal Ethics at Hofstra Law School, told Truthout, responding to the new nondisclosure agreement policy. “Quite disturbing. In effect: ‘We don't care; we don't have to.'”

“Instead of promoting trust and opting for greater transparency in the ethics of individual justices, the Supreme Court has chosen more secrecy.”

This new nondisclosure agreement requirement follows leaks of internal court documents, including Politico's May 2022 publication of Samuel Alito's explosive draft opinion overruling Roe v. Wade, and revelations about ethical lapses of the court's members, notably Clarence Thomas.

In September 2024, the Times published an exposé of how Roberts urged the members of the court to grant Trump extensive immunity from prosecution. The article quoted confidential memos. Roberts instituted nondisclosure agreements soon thereafter.

The new nondisclosure agreements come at a time when public trust in the Supreme Court is at a near record low. Since September 2020, the public approval rating of the court has remained at about 40 percent. A June 2024 Associated Press poll found that 70 percent of Americans think the members of the court are more influenced by ideology than impartiality.

Moreover, during the first year of Trump's second term, the court issued an unprecedented number of rulings on its “shadow docket,” most of them in Trump's favor. This means just what it says — these decisions take place in the shadows, away from public scrutiny, without full briefing and oral argument, and with little or no explanation. They include Trump's dismantling of the Department of Education, his ban on transgender people from military service, and his firing of tens of thousands of workers.

During the first year of Trump's second term, the court issued an unprecedented number of rulings on its “shadow docket,” most of them in Trump's favor.

Cameras are still prohibited in the Supreme Court's courtroom. Only 80 members of the public can watch as the highest court in the land considers issues affecting every aspect of our lives. From Bush v. Gore — which handed the presidential election to George W. Bush, who went on to usurp unprecedented power — to Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overruled the constitutional right to an abortion, a limited number of spectators were allowed in the courtroom during oral arguments.

In 1996, then Supreme Court associate justice David Souter told a House appropriations subcommittee, “The day you see a camera come into our courtroom it's going to roll over my dead body.” Allowing cameras in the Supreme Court “would lessen to a certain extent some of the mystique and moral authority” of the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist told a 1992 judges conference. Antonin Scalia thought that legal issues were too complicated for the public to understand, telling an audience in 1990 that “the law is a specialized field, comprehensible only to the expert.”

Cameras are still prohibited in the Supreme Court's courtroom. Only 80 members of the public can watch as the highest court in the land considers issues affecting every aspect of our lives.

But as David Dow and I argued in our book, Cameras in the Courtroom: Television and the Pursuit of Justice, Supreme Court arguments should be televised. “Every [federal] judge and every justice is appointed to the bench for life, immunized from public pressures. They don't need television exposure to keep their jobs. They can enjoy power with near-anonymity,” we wrote. Federal judges likely ask themselves, “Why take chances with an impartial electronic witness that can beam your every slip-up, every excess, to thousands or millions of taxpaying spectators, all in the name of giving them greater access to their own court system?”

So what are the Supremes hiding behind their new-and-improved nondisclosure agreements? “If the public were aware of how much of the deliberations affecting millions of people are made by 27-year-olds [clerks] after happy hour, they'd be shocked,” Nikolas Bowie, a Harvard law professor who clerked for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, told the Times.

As the anti-immigrant Reform UK Party has risen in the polls, the Labour Party has co-opted some of its toxic policies.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

In recent months, as the anti-immigrant Reform U.K. Party surged to the top of the polls, the U.K.'s Labour government has sought to make it harder for immigrants to get “indefinite leave to remain”  — essentially a British version of the U.S. green card — as well as restrict access to benefits for immigrants.

Currently, immigrants can seek “indefinite leave to remain” after five years in the country. Now, the Labour government's plan is to double that wait time to 10 years. It has also proposed making refugees wait 20 years for citizenship; seizing the assets of asylum seekers; and curbing family reunification.

The Labour Party's strategy, pushed by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, is to take the wind out of the Reform U.K. Party's sails by co-opting some of its more toxic policies around immigration, even if the impact is to drive away needed workers, in health care and other industries, who can more easily get residency rights in other countries in Europe and beyond.

There is scant evidence that this anti-immigration strategy is actually working to Labour's political advantage. True, polls show that Reform U.K. seems to have peaked in mid-2025, and that in recent months its support has begun to ebb — as outsider parties normally do in the U.K. system. Yet, it still is polling significantly ahead of Labour. And, come the general election, it will almost certainly receive a massive propaganda assist from the Trump administration in the U.S., which makes no secret of its loathing of European social democratic governments and which has explicitly allied with Reform U.K. in its aspirations to deport immigrants from the U.K. in much the same way that Donald Trump is currently removing them wholesale from the United States.

In fact, if the general election were held tomorrow, the Reform U.K. Party could conceivably end up with the most members of parliament, putting it in pole-position to form a coalition government. Meanwhile, the Labour Party, which came to power a couple years ago with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in British history, faces something approaching an electoral wipeout. Modeling suggests the party could lose more than 80 percent of its seats.

If the general election were held tomorrow, the Reform U.K. Party could conceivably end up with the most members of parliament.

Astoundingly, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval rating is, in some polls, at only 15 percent, making him far more unpopular than any other party leader in the U.K., including the notoriously polarizing Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage. (You know you're in trouble when your polling numbers make Joe Biden, after his June 2024 debate debacle, look like a paragon of popularity.)

Many voters in the U.K. are going to get a test run on May 7, when they will be electing local council members as well as members of the devolved Welsh and Scottish parliaments (polling suggests the Labour Party could fall to third place in Wales). Voters' decisions this May could be a bellwether for the general election that is set to take place in three months. Despite elections for more than 600 council positions being delayed due to a reorganization of local government in many parts of England, more than 4,200 council members will be elected that day, including in London and many of the other large metropolitan areas in the southeast of the country, as well as in parts of the industrial Midlands and the north of England. In cities such as Newcastle, in the north, the city council of which is currently controlled by Labour but the population of which remains skeptical of Europe and hostile to large-scale immigration, voters are likely to express their discontent with the Labour Party by turning toward Reform U.K. Elsewhere, Liberal Democrats and Greens could pick up disillusioned Labour voters, as could Jeremy Corbyn's new “Your Party,” which is wooing left-wing Labour stalwarts turned off by Starmer's leadership.

Immigration will likely play an outsized roll in the local elections. Since the COVID pandemic, the number of asylum applications in the U.K. has grown rapidly, reaching 100,000 per year from a previous average of less than 40,000. About half of these applicants enter the country “irregularly,” oftentimes taking small boats across the English Channel. The government has put thousands of these asylum seekers up in hotels as their cases are processed — and hard-right political groups have, in recent years, held protests, many of them violent, outside of these shelters.

At the same time as asylum claims have increased, overall migration rates into the U.K. have actually been falling in recent years…. Among Reform U.K. Party voters, 80 percent erroneously believe that immigration is on the rise.

But at the same time as asylum claims have increased, overall migration rates into the U.K. have actually been falling in recent years. That is a reality that a majority of U.K. voters, absorbing huge amounts of misinformation via social media and other rumor mills, are unaware of. Fully two-thirds of U.K. voters tell pollsters they believe that immigration rates are increasing. Among Reform U.K. Party voters, 80 percent erroneously believe that immigration is on the rise. Because of this, the governing Labour Party has decided its best bet to remain in power is to mimic at least some of Reform U.K.'s policy positions. It's a similar tack-to-the-right on immigration that the Biden administration attempted in its last year in office; it didn't play out so well for Biden and there's precious little evidence the strategy is working for Starmer.

As in the United States, the increase in asylum applications has fueled a more general surge of anti-immigrant sentiment, the beneficiaries of which are hard-right political movements, from Trump's MAGA movement to the anti-immigrant Reform U.K. Party. Last September, the hard-right provocateur Tommy Robinson helped organize a massive anti-immigrant demonstration, titled “Unite the Kingdom,” in the center of London. More than 100,000 people attended.

“Tackling immigration” is now seen as the most important issue facing the country, with 23 percent of voters telling pollsters that that should be the government's number one priority, far ahead of the 16 percent who say that cost of living should be the government's main focus. By contrast, only 5 percent list the National Health Service and 3 percent opt for tackling climate change.

Starmer's efforts to control the narrative through embracing ever-tougher anti-immigrant measures clearly haven't worked. They have, instead, simply added fuel to the fire and further empowered Farage's Reform U.K. Party. It is a peculiar combination of opportunism and political ineptness, and one that will likely hand the Labour Party a drubbing in the local elections this May. Should that happen, it will become a near-certainty that Starmer will face a challenge to his leadership from within his own party before the year is out.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 Regional Rivalry Will Raise Tensions Far Beyond the Gulf

 Jonathan Panikoff

A rift between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is now plain for the world to see. Tensions were rising last year as the two Gulf monarchies clashed over Yemen, but the underlying animosity spilled out into the open in January, as Saudi media outlets accused the UAE of “investing in chaos” across North Africa and the Horn of Africa and acting as Israel's stooge in the wider region. The UAE, for its part, has refrained from such public comments, but the latest discord is just the tip of the iceberg.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are locked in a broader strategic contest, jockeying over economic, political, and security matters. What was once a friendly competition has devolved into rivalry. The root of their crisis lies in Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's grand plan for its future. If the kingdom is to reach the goals set by its de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS), it must challenge the UAE's dominance in finance, tourism, and commerce. Neither government has publicly acknowledged this tension, but they are certainly aware of it; such a displacement is, after all, what the UAE accomplished several decades ago when it supplanted Bahrain as the Gulf's foremost commercial actor.

The Gulf rift probably won't escalate into a direct war between Saudi Arabia and the UAE or even lesser military actions, such as a blockade. But Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are in an economic conflict at home and in several proxy military battles abroad. Their quarreling will shape the region for the next decade, including how they approach security engagements with Western powers, how they court private-sector investments, and how they choose to engage in several ongoing and brewing regional conflicts.

In 2015, when MBS became deputy crown prince and began pulling the levers of the Saudi government, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were closely aligned on the Middle East's biggest problems. On a personal level, MBS and Emirati President Mohammed bin Zayed (known as MBZ) got along. The UAE lent support to Saudi Arabia's military campaign against the Houthis—an Iranian-backed terrorist organization—in Yemen. The two countries championed U.S. President Donald Trump's “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. In 2017, they embargoed Qatar together to pressure Doha to distance itself from Iran; to shut down Al Jazeera, a news outlet; and to end its support of the Muslim Brotherhood, a century-old, region-wide movement that promotes a form of political Islam that some Gulf governments find threatening. The brotherhood, for example, supports democracy. (Last month, the United States designated the group a terrorist organization.)

But within a few years, this shared agenda began to show signs of strain. The two countries abandoned their blockade of Qatar, even though Doha's support for the Muslim Brotherhood and its relationship with Iran had not meaningfully changed. And the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign failed to persuade Tehran to moderate its behavior.

In light of these failures, and starting around 2021, Saudi Arabia began diverging from the UAE. It started warming relations with Iran, Qatar, and Turkey. By 2023, it had agreed to a formal rapprochement with Tehran. Senior Saudi officials even started claiming that the UAE had cajoled Saudi Arabia into the blockade of Qatar years earlier.

Saudi Arabia's shift stemmed from a reassessment of how best to achieve its domestic agenda. MBS originally embraced an adversarial foreign policy that focused on going after countries connected to political Islam. But he eventually realized such an approach was not advancing his paramount objective—achieving Vision 2030, which would see the kingdom wean itself off oil and become a hub for finance, business, and travel. To realize the plan, the kingdom needs billions of dollars in foreign investment, which in turn requires predictability and calm.



Saudi Arabia, therefore, is forging warmer ties with its former antagonists not because its view of those countries has changed, but because it now believes accommodating them is a better strategy. Conflict in the Middle East or along the Red Sea risks disrupting trade corridors or spooking foreign investors. In contrast, the UAE remains tethered to the same set of priorities that have driven its foreign policy for much of the last decade. It wants to maintain its regional and global power, which is undergirded by its domestic economic, commercial, and investment prowess, and to prevent the spread of political Islam.

Today, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are at odds over Israel, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. In most of these arenas, Saudi Arabia prioritizes stability—as long as there is no specific threat to the kingdom—whereas the UAE generally wants to prevent Islamists from gaining ground. In Sudan, home to the world's worst humanitarian crisis, Riyadh has backed the Sudanese Armed Forces (which the UAE suspects of having Islamist ties), and the UAE has sent money and arms to the rival Rapid Support Forces, although it denies doing so.

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has agreed to invest billions in Syria's reconstruction because it sees its new leader (a former jihadist) as the country's best shot at stability. But the UAE has offered little money because it is skeptical of the new president's ability to consolidate power and his willingness to abandon his Islamist roots. And when it comes to Israel, the UAE has quietly increased its commercial and security ties, whereas Saudi Arabia refuses to normalize relations without a pathway to a Palestinian state.

These regional tensions came to a head in late 2025 in Yemen. After years of working together to fight the Houthis there, factions backed by Riyadh and Abu Dhabi descended into infighting. In December, a Yemeni separatist group supported by Abu Dhabi seized territory in Yemen held by Saudi-backed groups. Riyadh retaliated by bombing an Emirati arms shipment, prompting the UAE to withdraw its troops from the country entirely.

It is in the interest of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE to publicly downplay their differences to reassure foreign investors that the Gulf is a safe place to put their money. But Emirati-Saudi tensions will probably get worse. The two countries are increasingly competing for investment in the same sectors. Given how much foreign capital Saudi Arabia needs to fulfill Vision 2030, its success is likely to come at the cost of Emirati dominance in finance, technology, tourism, and logistics. Regional and global markets probably can't support both countries at scale simultaneously.

Emirati leaders are determined not to let the UAE go the way of Bahrain. In 1932, Bahrain became the first country in the region to discover oil. But because of its small reserves, it diversified its economy. By the 1970s, it was the region's hot spot for finance, tourism, logistics, and aluminum smelting. But in the early 1990s, Dubai, and later Abu Dhabi, set up financial centers with fewer regulatory constraints and more capital. By the first decade of the twenty-first century, megaprojects including the Palm Jumeirah, a manmade island intended for luxury residences and tourism, and the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, cemented the UAE as a destination for expatriates. The government then spent the 2010s translating its economic power into global influence. In 1971, the year the UAE was formed, its GDP was $940 million and Bahrain's was $422 million. By 1990, the UAE's GDP was $308 billion and Bahrain's was $27 billion.

Today, Saudi Arabia is adopting this strategy. But whereas the UAE took decades to surpass its neighbor in key industries, Saudi Arabia is trying to do so in far less time and is leveraging every advantage is has. The Saudi market is the largest in the region. To outcompete the UAE, Riyadh is using nontariff barriers to squeeze Emirati firms out of its domestic market. The kingdom, for instance, requires foreign trucks to have a special permit to transport crops and livestock within its borders. In 2021, it began applying higher tariffs to goods produced in so-called free zones, which permit foreigners full ownership of companies and exempt them from import and export taxes. The UAE is the biggest exporter in the Gulf and hosts more than 40 such zones. In 2024, Saudi Arabia began awarding government contracts to only those companies with regional headquarters in the kingdom, causing many multinationals to move their offices from the UAE to Saudi Arabia.



Saudi Arabia also has far greater industry and manufacturing capacity than does the UAE, and it is investing heavily in domestic mining because of its reserves of phosphates, gold, bauxite, and rare-earth elements. By land mass, it is 27 times bigger than the UAE. It is even leveraging its size, capital, and energy resources to build vast production complexes that support the biggest dairy industry in the Middle East. It also benefits from religious tourism and the influence that comes from its stewardship of Islam's two holiest mosques, in Mecca and in Medina. Riyadh believes that, because of this role, it is the singular leader of the Arab and Muslim world.

Saudi Arabia's larger population, however, is a double-edged sword. It means the country has much more room to grow in terms of domestic consumption but also has far more people to support. Saudi Arabia has 35 million people, roughly 20 million of whom are Saudi, whereas the UAE has 11 million people, but a much larger share are foreigners: just over one million are Emiratis. Its small size allows it to pivot much quicker than its neighbor, especially in fast-moving industries such as artificial intelligence and biotech.

The UAE has long been attractive to foreign investment and talent. It already has an established edge in financial services, aviation, health care, and tourism. It also has looser social restraints. Unmarried couples, for example, are allowed to cohabitate. And its ability to handle trade and logistics is unparalleled in the region: in 2023, for example, the UAE handled double the number of shipping containers and received twice the amount of foreign direct investment as did Saudi Arabia. With such a diversified economy, only about 25 percent of the UAE's GDP comes from oil, making it less sensitive to changes in oil prices compared with Saudi Arabia, where almost 50 percent of GDP is dependent on oil.

The problem for Saudi Arabia is that, as it seeks to diversify its economy, the UAE is not giving an inch. Abu Dhabi is spending billions to compete in the same sectors that Vision 2030 calls for Saudi Arabia to dominate by the end of the decade, such as AI, renewable energy, and global logistics.

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi could still diffuse tensions by cooperating in specific industries, such as by creating joint technology hubs and data centers. The two countries could also, either bilaterally or through mediators such as Bahrain or Oman, try to agree on the outcome they would like to see in various conflict zones, and work backward together to achieve their desired end result.

But it seems increasingly likely that tensions will escalate. Given this reality, the United States and Europe should be careful not to take a side in the Gulf rivalry. The geography of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE affords them outsize influence over oil markets and critical trade routes; it is important to keep both happy. If Washington or European capitals show a preference for one side, they will lose influence and investment opportunities with the other. Worse still, they could undermine regional stability. If one Gulf power feels its status is slipping, it might lean toward China, potentially giving it preferential treatment in shipping, investment, and military basing rights.

The past four American presidents have pledged to do less in the Middle East, only to remain active. Trump would be wise to keep a strong U.S. presence in the region. Together with European leaders, he should hedge between the two Gulf countries. He should also note that mending their division could require a more personal touch. Some observers say that in the early days of MBS's tenure as crown prince, he was a protégé of MBZ's. Although that is likely an exaggeration, the two men were on good terms. Today, each leader sees the other as insufficiently respectful, and their jealousies feed into the broader rivalry. A rapprochement between these two men could go a long way toward stabilizing the region.

 The Perils of German Power

 Liana Fix

  March/April 2026 

“I give you my solemn warning that under the present trend, the next world war is inevitable,” declared the French military leader Ferdinand Foch. It was 1921, and Foch, the commander in chief of the Allied armies during World War I, was raising alarms in a speech from New York City. His concern was simple. After defeating Germany, the Allied powers had forced it to disarm with the Treaty of Versailles. But just a couple of years later, they had stopped enforcing the terms of their victory. Berlin, Foch warned, thus could and would rebuild its military. “If the Allies continue their present indifference . . . Germany will surely rise in arms again.”

Foch's comments proved prescient. By the late 1930s, Germany had indeed rebuilt its military. It seized Austria, then Czechoslovakia, and then Poland, sparking World War II. When it was again defeated, the Allies were more attentive in their management of the country. They occupied and divided it, disbanded its armed forces, and largely abolished its defense industry. When the United States and the Soviet Union allowed West Germany and East Germany, respectively, to reestablish their militaries, it was only under strict oversight. When they allowed the halves to merge, Germany had to limit the size of its armed forces. Even so, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed reunification, fearing it would produce a dangerously powerful country. A bigger Germany, she warned in 1989, “would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security.”

Today, Foch's and Thatcher's fears seem to belong to ancient history. As Europe has navigated one crisis after another in recent decades—most important, Russia's aggression against Ukraine—the continent's officials have worried not that Berlin might become too strong but that it is far too weak. “I fear German power less than German inaction,” declared Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, in 2011, during Europe's financial crisis. It was a remarkable statement coming from a Polish official, given that Warsaw has traditionally been one of the governments most worried about German power. He is hardly alone: Germany's military must “spend more and produce more,” declared NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in 2024.

Now, these leaders are getting what they wanted. After many delays, Germany's Zeitenwende—its 2022 promise to become one of Europe's defense leaders—is finally becoming a reality. In 2025, Germany spent more on defense than any other European country in absolute terms. Its military budget today ranks fourth in the world, just after Russia's. Annual military spending is expected to reach $189 billion in 2029, more than triple what it was in 2022. Germany is even considering a return to mandatory conscription if its military, the Bundeswehr, cannot attract enough voluntary recruits. Should the country stay the course, it will again be a great military power before 2030.

People in Europe have largely been happy to see Berlin rebuild its military to defend against Russia. But they should be careful what they wish for. Today's Germany has pledged to use its outsize armed power to help all of Europe. But left unchecked, German military dominance might eventually foster divisions within the continent. France remains uneasy about the fact that its neighbor is becoming a major military power—as are many people in Poland, despite Sikorski's sentiments. As Berlin ascends, suspicion and mistrust could grow. In the worst-case scenario, competition might return. France, Poland, and other states could attempt to counterbalance Germany, which would divert attention away from Russia and leave Europe divided and vulnerable. France, in particular, may seek to reassert itself as the continent's leading military power and “grande nation.” This could prompt outright rivalry with Berlin and place Europe at odds with itself.

Such nightmarish outcomes are especially likely if Germany ends up being governed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is rising in the polls. The intensely nationalistic party has long been critical of the European Union and NATO, and some of its members have made revanchist claims about the territory of neighboring countries. An AfD-controlled Germany might use its power to bully or coerce other countries, leading to tensions and conflict.

Berlin does need to build up its military. The continent is in danger, and no other European government has the fiscal capacity that Germany can bring to bear. But Berlin must recognize the risks that accompany its strengths and restrain German power by embedding its defensive might in more deeply integrated European military structures. Germany's European neighbors, for their part, should make clear what kind of defense integration they would like to see. Otherwise, German rearmament could very well yield a Europe that is more divided, mistrustful, and weaker—exactly the opposite of what Berlin now hopes to achieve.

For many, it is hard to understand why Germany's rearmament could lead to competition and instability in Europe. All Europeans are familiar, of course, with the country's militaristic history. But in the decades after World War II, Germany integrated both its economy and its defense apparatus deeply into Europe. West Germany's first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, firmly rejected the idea of turning his country into an independent military power and advocated integrating the West German armed forces either into a European army or into NATO. After the end of the Cold War, Germany adopted an approach of military restraint and identified itself as a “civilian power”—one that was trustworthy and nonthreatening, even as reunification made it far stronger. As Helmut Kohl, the first leader of reunified Germany, declared in 1989, “Only peace may come from German soil.” The economic and political integration later brought about by the EU created a pan-European identity and fostered a perception that European countries, Germany among them, had shared strategic interests and could thus never return to competition.

And yet, as some realist scholars have argued, rivalry among Europe's countries never really disappeared, and certainly not through the EU alone. It was merely subdued, and largely by NATO and American hegemony. The EU was, and is, primarily an economic organization. Security and defense in Europe were mostly in the hands of NATO and the U.S. military. It was an overbearing U.S. presence, in other words, that ameliorated the European security dilemma that Germany's size and position have traditionally posed—not just the political and economic integration fostered by the EU.

Now that the United States seems to be reducing the attention and resources it has historically committed to Europe, that competition could return. It might start in small and harmless ways. Other European countries are already uneasy about Germany's military buildup and defense spending. Berlin, for example, is planning to spend the lion's share of its defense budget on German defense companies, exploiting an exception to EU competition rules that allows member countries to skip notification and clearance procedures for the public funding of national defense industries when such spending is a matter of essential security interests. This will undermine collaboration and make it difficult for true European defense industrial champions to emerge. It does not help that Germany wants procurement to remain firmly in the hands of national governments and rejects a greater coordinating role for the European Commission. What the continent's defense industry needs is Europeanization and a single market for weaponry, but Berlin's policies are not pushing the sector in this direction.



France, Italy, Sweden, and others have taken advantage of the same EU loophole to build up their defense sectors, and they have military industries big enough to moderate German dominance. But no European country can match Berlin's spending. Germany recently loosened its debt brake to allow for almost unlimited defense expenditures, an option that most European countries—which have larger deficits—don't have. The best solution to this conundrum would be for the European Commission to engage in large-scale joint borrowing for defense. A precedent for doing this already exists: the eurobonds the commission issued during the COVID-19 crisis. Berlin, however, has refused to allow such a sweeping defense initiative. Instead, it has endorsed only conditional borrowing programs such as EU SAFE, which offers up to $175 billion in cheap loans for collaborative defense projects. These programs (and future ones like them) simply cannot meet the consistent financial demand for capital-intensive defense-industrial endeavors. They are also small compared with Germany's plan to spend more than $750 billion on defense over the next four years.

German policymakers say they do not want to foot the bill for exuberant domestic spending by what they see as fiscally less responsible governments in the EU, especially not when their country's growth is stagnating. But this argument is self-righteous: Berlin's past balanced budgets and economic growth were powered for many years by exports to China and cheap Russian energy, without concern for the political risks of financing Beijing's assertiveness and Moscow's aggression. Germany's position is also shortsighted. It is in Berlin's interest to let other parts of Europe spend liberally on defense without having to cut social welfare. Such cuts, after all, lead to populist backlash, which will undercut unity on Ukraine and defensive efforts against Russia—the very reason more spending is required.

Berlin argues that it is pursuing partnerships with other European governments to ensure that Germany's defense spending benefits the entire neighborhood. In its view, even if domestic firms gain the most from German spending, the cake is big enough for everyone to get a piece. Berlin also sees the stationing of German troops in the Baltic States—and possibly more countries in the future—as enough of a reassurance that it has Europe's best interests in mind and is not just focused on its own rearmament. But offering the continent's other states a piece of the cake is unlikely to stifle their uneasiness about German dominance, particularly against the backdrop of the United States' retreat and uncertainty about NATO. For all the enthusiasm Europeans feel for Germany's defense buildup right now, many are beginning to ask questions about how Berlin plans to embed its military and industrial dominance in Europe. They want to see Germany pulling its weight, not throwing it around.

German policymakers are brushing aside such concerns. They argue that Germany's neighbors cannot have both a weak Berlin and a strong one that can defend Europe. Their attitude to European unease seems to be that because the continent asked for the buildup, it does not get to complain about it.

But this argument will not assuage concerns about German dominance. Paris does not like the idea of Germany being Europe's military powerhouse because it believes that's France's role. It will closely watch for any signs that Germany might aspire to get nuclear weapons—the only remaining domain of French superiority. Some Polish officials fear that a militarily powerful Germany might one day feel free to restore amicable relations with Russia. Poles, and not only those who support the populist Law and Justice party, have also voiced concerns that a dominant Germany will marginalize the role of smaller EU states and could use its power to coerce them.

Analysts who want to understand why Europeans fear German hegemony do not need to look back a century; a decade would suffice. During Europe's 2010s fiscal crisis, several EU countries were drowning in debt and in need of bailouts from the EU. That meant, in practice, getting approval for bailouts from Germany, the biggest and wealthiest eurozone economy. But rather than showing solidarity and using its enormous wealth to generously help these states, Berlin was concerned about fiscal responsibility and imposed harsh austerity measures as part of bailout packages, resulting in double-digit unemployment and protracted misery for debtor countries. The German government was particularly tough on Greece, forcing deep cuts to its social welfare programs and other government services. The country's unemployment rate reached nearly 30 percent in 2013, and by the middle of the decade, its GDP contracted by a quarter. Greeks, in turn, grew to detest Berlin. One famous Greek poster depicted Germany's then chancellor, Angela Merkel, dressed in a Nazi uniform.



If Germany does not take steps to mitigate mistrust and discomfort, competition really could return to Europe. To counterbalance Berlin's military might, Poland, for example, might look to ally itself more closely with the Baltic and Nordic countries and the United Kingdom in the Joint Expeditionary Force. It might also look to join the Nordic-Baltic Eight, a regional cooperation framework among Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. Either way, the result could be the fragmentation of common European defense efforts. Paris, for its part, might be tempted to reassert itself by significantly increasing its defense spending as a way of catching up with, and containing, Germany, despite France's domestic fiscal troubles. Paris might also seek closer cooperation with London to counterbalance Berlin.

If Europe is divided and destabilized by internal competition, both the EU and NATO might be paralyzed. Russia could sense an opening to test NATO's Article 5 commitment to collective defense, in addition to plowing ahead in Ukraine. China could exploit the continent economically, threatening its industrial strength. Europe would struggle to defend itself, particularly in Washington's absence. And if the United States becomes a hostile power, as its talk of annexing Greenland suggests, it will have an easier time manipulating the continent. A divided Europe, in other words, would become a pawn in the game of the great powers.

A militarily dominant Germany could prove particularly dangerous if its centrist domestic leadership starts to lose power—as it just well might. The country is not due to hold national elections for three more years, but the extremist AfD now polls in first place at the national level. It subscribes to a far-right, illiberal, and Euroskeptic ideology. It is Russia-friendly, opposed to supporting Ukraine, and wants to reverse Germany's post-1945 economic and military integration into the EU and NATO, at least in their current form. It sees military power as a tool of national aggrandizement that should be used exclusively to benefit Berlin. It hopes to develop a German defense industry that's entirely autonomous from those of Berlin's traditional allies. If it wins federal power, the AfD will use the German military exactly as Thatcher feared: to project power against Germany's neighbors. In the same way that Washington has made once inconceivable claims on Canada and Greenland, an AfD-led Germany might eventually make claims on French or Polish territory.

Germany's centrist parties are aware of how frightening the AfD is to neighboring countries. They have, accordingly, worked to quarantine it, with the center-right and center-left forming grand coalitions to keep it away from federal authority. But blocking the AfD is becoming harder each year. The party received the second largest number of votes in Germany's 2025 elections. It will likely be emboldened by the 2026 state elections: polls show the party within reach of a majority in Mecklenburg–West Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt. If it wins a plurality of seats in Germany's next national election, the firewall might collapse.



The return of revisionism and revanchism under the AfD would take place gradually, then suddenly. As a first step, Germany's center-right party, the Christian Democratic Union, which for now remains firmly opposed to the AfD, might allow the far-right party to indirectly prop it up as the leader of a conservative minority government. The AfD would then use its newfound prominence to mainstream its ideology. It would also try to take the government hostage, threatening to bring it down if it doesn't pass far-right policies. AfD representatives would push for an end to support for Ukraine, but they could also stoke tensions with Germany's neighbors by making irredentist claims about lands once controlled by Berlin, such as some of the former eastern territories of the German Reich that have been part of Poland (and Russia) since 1945. A conservative minority government would insist that it would collaborate with the AfD only on specific issues and that Germany's main principles in foreign and defense policy would remain unchanged. But the AfD's newfound power would almost certainly cause a huge loss of trust and greater tensions with other European countries.

In an even more dangerous scenario, the AfD might become an official partner in a coalition government—or even the coalition's leader. It would then push to formally disentangle Germany from Western structures or to weaken them from within. It would, for instance, try to reshape the EU into an illiberal “Europe of Nations” without the euro as a common currency, reversing Germany's integration into the continent. Doing so would weaken the economic ties that have promoted peace for 80 years in Europe, reintroduce countless economic problems, and prompt all kinds of intra-European political fights. The AfD would also likely withdraw from the remaining NATO efforts against Russia, opt for appeasing the Kremlin, and push to withdraw the German brigade from Lithuania. It might also try to have Berlin leave NATO altogether, although if NATO is led by an illiberal United States, it could want to stay. It might blow up cooperation and reconciliation with France and the United Kingdom, including by suspending the newly concluded Treaty of Aachen and the Kensington Treaty, which elevated French-German and British-German security cooperation to new levels. Germany would emerge as a go-it-alone, nationalist, militaristic hegemon in Europe.

In response, France, Poland, and the United Kingdom would almost certainly establish counterbalancing coalitions designed to contain Germany, even if they were also governed by right-wing parties. Other European states might do the same. An AfD-led Germany, meanwhile, would seek out its own alliances—for example, with a Germany-friendly Austria or Hungary. The continent's ability to defend itself against external threats would effectively dissipate. Europeans would be at each other's throats again, exactly what the United States has long sought to prevent.

There is a way for Berlin to expand its military power without sending Europe back to an era of competition and rivalry—perhaps even if Germany is eventually governed by the AfD. The solution is for the country to accept what the historian Timothy Garton Ash, writing in these pages three decades ago, called “golden handcuffs”: restrictions on its sovereignty through greater integration with its European neighbors.

Past German leaders have made this tradeoff. Adenauer integrated West Germany's new Bundeswehr into NATO. To reunify with East Germany, Kohl traded the deutsche mark for the euro, surrendering Berlin's monetary sovereignty. Today's leaders should follow those examples. They can start by accepting large-scale joint European debt for defense and thus allow countries with less fiscal wiggle room than Germany to spend generously on defense without further indebting themselves and risking—as might happen with France—further credit downgrades. Compared with most European countries, the EU's aggregate borrowing costs are low, and as the largest economy in the eurozone, Germany can afford to serve as the guarantor of last resort. Doing so would embed German military and industrial power more thoroughly in Europe by making Berlin take on financial responsibility for the continent's armament. (It might also foster more joint decision-making, since EU states could work together on selecting the defense projects and priorities financed by these eurobonds.)

Germany should also push for the stronger integration of Europe's national defense industries, including by seeking more collaboration on its own projects rather than spending largely on domestic firms. Likewise, Germany should embrace true European defense companies akin to Airbus, which was created as a European aviation consortium to provide an alternative to American manufacturers. All these measures would not only avert fears of a dominant Germany by ensuring that Berlin's defense base relied on others. It would also provide greater scale and effectiveness in Europe's overall military buildup.



Finally, and most ambitiously, Germany and its European allies should think about deeper military integration. Because the United States has been pulling back, Europe will need to find military formats and structures outside NATO with which to defend itself. And although a European army remains unlikely for the foreseeable future, the continent's countries will have to create larger multinational military formations to deter Russia. (There are already small examples of such attempts, including a French-German brigade and some EU battlegroups, although they have yet to be deployed.) In addition, the continent should establish European command structures that tightly integrate the Bundeswehr with other armed forces and offer an alternative to NATO structures at times of transatlantic tensions. Deeper European military integration would constrain German power by subjecting Germany to collective decision-making. It would even hedge against an AfD-led government by making it virtually impossible to extricate the Bundeswehr from joint initiatives without taking drastic and unpopular measures, such as leaving the EU or other cooperative European institutions. The “coalition of the willing” that various European officials have proposed deploying to Ukraine after a peace settlement could serve as a trial run.

The risk of fracturing the continent ought to give Washington pause about pulling back—and especially about supporting the AfD. If Europe returns to great-power competition, Washington might ultimately have to commit more resources to the continent than it has over the last several decades in order to prevent Europe from descending into conflict. This is precisely the outcome that the White House wants to avoid.

But an unstable and fragmented Europe is by no means guaranteed, even in an era of reduced American involvement. European countries have learned to integrate and cooperate over the last eight decades in ways that past observers would have dismissed as fantasies. In fact, thanks to Russia's invasion, continental concord is higher now than at any point in history. Europe has plenty of ways to avoid a security dilemma centered on a dominant Germany. The brutal pressure from Washington could even further unite the continent and forge a stronger European identity. Such a positive outcome will require restraint, far-sightedness, and luck. But the continent's leaders must work hard to achieve it. The stakes are too high—and the alternative unspeakable.

Editor's note: Football is America's sport. Puerto Rico is an American territory. CNN explores the obsession with Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance in a new CNN FlashDoc “Bad Bunny and the Halftime Show: Rhythms of Resistance.” Stream the special now on the CNN app. The hour will premiere Saturday, February 7 at 10pm ET on CNN. 

History tells us that those who take the biggest stage in US sports have not shied away from using it as an opportunity to make a statement. 

 In some ways, Bad Bunny, this year's Super Bowl halftime show performer, has already made his, taking the Grammys stage last Sunday and echoing a rallying cry heard at anti-ICE protests across the nation. The question now: What else will Bad Bunny have to say and will he say it during the halftime show? 

 “I think that regardless of what he does or doesn't do, his presence there is deeply political,” Puerto Rico historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo told CNN, noting that Bad Bunny's show will undoubtedly put the ""complex and uncomfortable realities of United States history"" in relation to his homeland of Puerto Rico before a huge audience. 

Throughout history, artists appearing on the Super Bowl stage – whether that be to sing the National Anthem or headline the Halftime Show – have time and again used their platform to make a statement about what's going on off the field. 

Here are a few examples:

            When Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted Americans to join the fight against the axis of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in 1940, without actually entering the war, he called on Americans to pivot their economy to equip democracies around the world.
    


            “We must be the great arsenal of democracy,” Roosevelt said in a famous fireside chat, calling for a complete reordering of the US economy at breakneck pace. “For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.”
    


            Eighty-six years later, the United States is, again, not technically at war, but Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth is echoing the arsenal idea with a key a shift in word choice. The arsenal Hegseth is pitching in a series of speeches at defense contractors around the country is for “freedom” rather than “democracy.” He wants to reform the “defense-industrial base” and enable the Pentagon to buy weapons much faster.
    


            In the past few weeks Hegseth talked rockets alongside Jeff Bezos at a Blue Origin facility. He talked about artificial intelligence alongside Elon Musk at a SpaceX facility in Texas. He's talked about space in Los Angeles and Navy ships in Norfolk, Virignia.
    


            But unlike Roosevelt's call to build up arms, the Trump administration's America First mindset is more focused on material gain for the US than on defending democracy in other countries.
    


            After the US military snatched former Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, for instance, the administration has been working with the remnants of his regime to access the county's oil rather than support opposition leaders thought to have gotten more votes in recent elections.
    


            President Donald Trump has also conditioned his support for Ukraine's democracy on access to Ukraine's mineral wealth in exchange for supporting the country's military against aggression from Russia.
    


            At the same time, The Trump administration wants to pull out the national credit card and spend a lot more money on warfighting capability.
    


            The Pentagon's budget has hovered around $1 trillion annually in recent years, but Trump, far from cutting government spending as he promised on his way into office, now wants to supercharge defense spending to $1.5 trillion next year.
    


            “This is a 1939 moment or hopefully a 1981 moment. A moment of mounting urgency. Enemies gather, threats grow, you feel it, I feel it,” Hegseth said, drawing on the history of Word War II and the Cold War during a speech last November at Naval War College, laying out the arsenal plan. Although it's important to note that he hasn not yet mentioned Roosevelt in an “arsenal of freedom” speech.
    


            But unlike the Axis and Soviet threats in those eras, the threat today is less well defined. Today's threat is also at least partly due to Trump's brash diplomatic style, which alienates longtime allies in Europe and North America and acts erratically towards adversaries like China.
    


            Witness the nonchalance with Trump brushed off the expiration Thursday of the New START treaty, by which the US and Russia agreed for decades to limit their nuclear arsenals.
    


            The most expensive example of Trump's grand plans to defend the US is his call for a multi-layered missile defense system – he calls it the “Golden Dome” – to protect the entire US in the same way tiny Israel employs its Iron Dome system.
    


            In part to facilitate that kind of new, out-of-the-box idea, Hegseth is promising to remake defense contracting, harness innovation, and cut red tape. Hegseth calls it a “commercial-first” mindset for the Pentagon's acquisitions.
    


            “The Department of War is, of course, big time supportive of profits,” Hegseth said at the Naval War College. “We are capitalists after all.”
    


            Trump's dome plan, in which contractors see lucrative opportunity, could ultimately cost multiple trillions of dollars without being 100% effective, according to an assessment by Todd Harrison at the American Enterprise Institute.
    


            “I think it is a combination of an honest, no-sacred-cows effort to fix a long-broken system and performative politics,” Harrison told me.
    


            The fact that military contracting and procurement need fixing is indisputable. Elon Musk, whose companies rely so heavily on defense contracting, promised not to spare the Pentagon in his Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting efforts last year. But that seems like a bygone era of Trump 2.0 now that the president is calling for a 66% increase in defense spending.
    


            Trying to fix a system is laudable, Peter Warren Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at New America told me.
    


            “There's obviously a lot of energy and excitement around this effort, but now comes the double hard part,” he said.
    


            What could be most difficult is creating a system that is fair and transparent
    


            The system by which tax dollars for defense contracts is awarded – as difficult as it is to maneuver and slow as it is to work – evolved from an effort to cut down on graft and abuse.
    


            Hegseth has now held events with one billionaire who funded a documentary about the president's wife and another who was part of his administration. Now both men are among the contractors interested in the arsenal of taxpayer dollars.

            A Russian general serving as deputy head of Russian military intelligence was shot and seriously wounded in Moscow on Friday, officials said – the latest in a series of attacks on top military figures.
    


            An unknown attacker fired several shots at Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev in a residential building on Volokolamskoye Highway in Moscow and fled the scene, a Russian Investigative Committee spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            The Russian Investigative Committee said its officers are at the scene and investigators are searching for the shooter. The committee has opened a criminal case into what it called the attempted murder of a high-ranking defense ministry official.
    


            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the Ukrainian government of being behind the attempted murder of Alekseyev, without citing evidence.
    


            Ukrainian authorities have not commented on the shooting.
    


            Alekseyev has been transferred to a city hospital, the Investigative Committee statement said. He is in intensive care and in a serious condition following the shooting, according to Russian state media.
    


            Alekseyev, 64, is the first deputy head of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate, the GRU. The Russian general was one of several GRU officials sanctioned by the United States in 2016 for wide-ranging malicious cyber activity directed at undermining US democratic processes.
    


            He was also sanctioned by the European Union in January 2019 following a nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England, which the British government said was carried out by GRU agents to poison a former Russian spy. The EU sanctions describe Alekseyev as “responsible for the possession, transport and use in Salisbury… of the toxic nerve agent ‘Novichok' by officers from the GRU,” along with sanctioned Russian military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
    


            Alexseyev has had significant involvement in the war in Ukraine, serving as one of Russia's negotiators in the secret talks with a member of the Ukrainian parliament to end Russia's 2022 siege of the strategic city of Mariupol, Ukraine.
    


            A Ukrainian intelligence report on Alexseyev claims he has been responsible for “the organization of the preparation of initial data for launching missile and air strikes on Ukrainian territory,” including on civilian targets, as well as being responsible for the illegal referenda in the occupied Ukrainian territories. Ukraine has also accused him of war crimes in Syria.
    


            In 2023, Alekseyev was sent by the Russian military to negotiate with Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private mercenary group, during the Wagner group's mutiny. At the time, he called Prigozhin's actions a coup as well as “a stab in the back of the country and the president.”
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a Friday press briefing that the intelligence services were investigating the attack and would report any findings to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added: “We wish the general survival and recovery.”
    


            “It is clear that such military leaders and highly qualified specialists are at risk during a war,” Peskov said when asked about the security of military officials' residences. “That's a matter for the intelligence services.”
    


            A neighbor of Alekseyev told Reuters that she heard several shots around 6:30 a.m. local time Friday. The woman, who only gave her first name as Alexandra, said she “woke up because of shots” and rushed outside the residential building alongside other neighbors. Another resident had already called police, who arrived by 7 a.m., she said.
    


            Several prominent Russians have been killed by explosive devices or shot dead in Moscow in attacks blamed on the Ukrainian security services since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            Friday's shooting in Moscow comes one day after Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met for trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates, where the Russian delegation was led by their military intelligence chief Kostyukov.
    


            The Kremlin on Friday described the trilateral talks as “both constructive and challenging.”
    


            Ukraine's negotiation team also said the talks were “truly constructive” in a comment to news agency RBC-Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said they'd “agreed that the next meeting will be held in the near future.”
    


            But beyond a prisoner swap that took place on Thursday, which saw 314 POWs exchanged, no major breakthroughs were announced by either side.
    


            Despite the diplomatic engagement, Russia's attacks on Ukraine have continued this week.
    


            At least three Ukrainian people were killed and 15 people injured in Russian attacks within the last day, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday. Russia launched two ballistic missiles, five cruise missiles and hundreds of drones overnight into Friday, hitting the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Kharkiv.

            In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian attack on Friday heavily damaged an animal shelter, according to the city council, which released video showing several animals injured or killed.
    


            Throughout the winter – the coldest one Ukraine has experienced in 20 years – Russia's military has also intensified its assault on the country's energy sector.
    


            In the capital Kyiv, where temperatures are below freezing on Friday, 1,100 high-rise residential buildings remain without power, according to local authorities. In the two districts of Kyiv that have been hit hard by attacks on energy infrastructure, about half the schools are operating without heat.
    


            “The Kremlin is doubling down on war crimes, deliberately striking homes and civilian infrastructure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday, as she announced the EU is tabling its 20th package of sanctions against Russia.
    


            “This is not the conduct of a state seeking peace. It is the behaviour of a nation waging a war of attrition against a civilian innocent population,” von der Leyen said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticized the video as racist.

The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. The deletion, a rare admission of a misstep by the White House, came hours after press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed “fake outrage” over the post. After calls for its removal for being racist -- including by Republicans -- the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down.

The post was part of a flurry of social media activity on Trump's Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and a Trump attorney general from his first term finding no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. 

An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response. 

Nearly all of the 62-second clip, which was among dozens of Truth Social posts from Trump overnight, appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied. At the 60-second mark is a quick scene of two primates, with the Obamas' smiling faces imposed on them. 




Those frames were taken from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker. It shows Trump as “King of the Jungle” and depicts a range of Democratic leaders as animals, including Joe Biden, who is white, as a jungle primate eating a banana. 

“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” Leavitt said by text, referring to Disney's 1994 feature film, which does not feature the range of jungle primates featured in the original video. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

By noon, the post had been taken down with responsibility placed on a Trump subordinate. 

Trump did not comment on the video in the post, which comes in the first week of Black History Month and days after a presidential proclamation that cited “the contributions of black Americans to our national greatness and their enduring commitment to the American principles of liberty, justice, and equality.”

While it was still up, Trump's post drew condemnation from across the political and ideological spectrum. 

The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the assassinated civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., resurfaced her father's words: “Yes. I'm Black. I'm proud of it. I'm Black and beautiful.” She praised Black Americans as “diverse, innovative, industrious, inventive” and added, “We are beloved of God as postal workers and professors, as a former first lady and president. We are not apes.”

The U.S. Senate's lone Black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, called on Trump to take down the post. “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media. 

Another Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is white but represents the state with the largest percentage of Black residents, called it “totally unacceptable” and said the president should apologize. 

NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement, “Donald Trump's video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable.” 

Johnson asserted that Trump is trying anything to distract from economic conditions and attention on the Jeffrey Epstein case files. 

“You know who isn't in the Epstein files? Barack Obama,” Johnson said. “You know who actually improved the economy as president? Barack Obama.”

Trump and the official White House social media accounts frequently repost memes and artificial intelligence-generated videos. As Leavitt did Friday, Trump aides typically dismiss critiques and cast the images as humorous. 

There is a long history in the U.S. of powerful white figures associating Black people with animals, including apes, in demonstrably false and racist ways. The practice dates back to 18th century cultural racism and pseudo-scientific theories in which white people drew connections between Africans and monkeys to justify the enslavement of Black people in Europe and North America, and later to dehumanize freed Black people as an uncivilized threat to white people. 

Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote in his famous text “Notes on the State of Virginia” that Black women were the preferred sexual partners of orangutans. President Dwight Eisenhower, discussing the desegregation of public schools in the 1950s, once argued that white parents were concerned about their daughters being in classrooms with “big Black bucks” Obama, as a candidate and president, was featured as a monkey or other primate on T-shirts and other merchandise. 

Trump, for his part, has a record of intensely personal criticism of the Obamas and of using incendiary, sometimes racist, rhetoric. 

In his 2024 campaign, Trump said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country,” language similar to what Adolf Hitler said to dehumanize Jews in Nazi Germany.

During his first White House term, Trump referred to a swath of developing nations that are majority Black as “shithole countries.” He initially denied using the slur but admitted in December 2025 that he did say it. 

When Obama was in the White House, Trump advanced the false claims that the 44th president, who was born in Hawaii, was born in Kenya and was constitutionally ineligible to serve. Trump, in interviews that helped endear him to many conservative voters, repeatedly demanded that Obama produce birth records and prove he was a “natural-born citizen” as required to become president. 

Obama eventually released his Hawaii records. Trump finally acknowledged during his 2016 campaign, after having won the Republican nomination, that Obama was born in Hawaii. But he immediately said, falsely, that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton started those birtherism attacks on Obama.

The judge wanted everyone in the courtroom to know that when he'd signed a war orphan over to an American Marine he thought it was an emergency — that the child injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan was on death's door, with neither a family nor a country to claim her.

A lawyer for the federal government stood up.

“That is not what happened,” she told the judge: almost everything he'd believed about the baby was untrue.




This group had gathered 15 times by then, in secret proceedings in this small-town Virginia courtroom to try to fix what had become an international incident. Fluvanna County Circuit Judge Richard Moore had granted an adoption of the orphan to U.S. Marine Joshua Mast and his wife, Stephanie, while the baby was in Afghanistan, 7,000 miles away.

Now the U.S. government insisted the baby's fate had never been the judge's to decide; officials in President Donald Trump's first administration had chosen to unite her with relatives months before Moore gave her away, according to once-secret transcripts of the November 2022 hearing.

Thousands of pages of those transcripts and court documents were recently released as a result of The Associated Press' three-year fight for access after a 2022 AP report about the adoption raised alarms at the highest levels of government, from the Taliban to the White House. The newly released records reveal how America's fractured bureaucracy allowed the Masts to adopt the child who was halfway around the globe, being raised by a couple the Afghan government at that time decided were her family, in a country that does not allow non-Muslims to take custody of its children. The documents show the judge skipped critical safeguards and legal requirements.




Mast, who cited a judge's orders not to speak publicly about the case in declining requests to comment, has said he believed — and still does — the story he told Moore about the girl, and insists he acted nobly and in the best interest of a child stuck in a war zone with an uncertain future.

Along the way, high-ranking military and government officials took extraordinary steps to help him, seemingly unaware that others in their own agencies were trying to stop him. 

“The left hand of the United States is doing one thing,” another judge later said, describing the dysfunction, “and the right hand of the United States is doing something else.”

The documents reveal that the court and federal government have blamed each other for the legal predicament. The Justice Department has said what happened in this rural courthouse threatens the nation's standing in the world and appears as an endorsement of child abduction.

“I'll probably think about this the rest of my life whether I should have said, sorry, that child is in Afghanistan. We're just going to stand down,” Moore said at the hearing three years ago. “I don't know whether that's what I should have done.”

The baby was orphaned in September 2019 when U.S. Army Rangers, along with Afghan forces, raided a rural compound. The baby's parents were killed. She was found in the rubble, about two months old, burned and with a fractured skull and broken leg. U.S. troops scooped her up and took her to the hospital at Bagram Air Base in Kabul.

American servicemembers fell in love with her there, as she recovered. She was a symbol of hope in a long, grinding war.

The raid that killed the baby's parents targeted transient terrorists who came into Afghanistan from a neighboring country, the records show. Some soldiers believed she might not be Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S.

The State Department attempted to make its position clear: The embassy convened a meeting that October with members of the military and the Afghan government to explain that under international law the U.S. was obligated to reunite her with her family, according to documents. State Department officials wrote that Mast, a military lawyer on a short assignment in Afghanistan, attended that meeting.

He'd met the baby for the first time days before and remained determined the child should go to the U.S., according to emails filed as exhibits.

Mast called home, where his wife was with their three sons.

“With us having children of our own, we see how vulnerable and precious children are,” Stephanie Mast testified. “And we wanted to help in whatever way we could.”

The Masts, Evangelical Christians, decided to try to bring her to their home in Palmyra, Virginia.

Mast's brother, Richard Mast, a lawyer with the conservative Christian law firm Liberty Counsel, filed a petition for custody in early November, and a Fluvanna County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court judge quickly approved it. The judge declared that the child was “stateless,” echoing Mast's assertion that her parents were nomadic terrorists, and the Afghan government would issue a waiver of jurisdiction over her within days.

Afghanistan never waived jurisdiction.

Still the Masts decided custody wasn't enough. Several days later, Moore, the Fluvanna County Circuit Court judge, got an unusual weekend call from his clerk's office about a request for an emergency adoption, according to comments the judge made on the bench and records obtained from the Virginia Attorney General's Office. Custody orders like the one the Masts were granted are temporary, but adoption grants a child an entirely new birth certificate, assigning them new legal parents. Moore said he was told that the girl desperately needed medical care and adoption would help get her on a plane to America.

Though the baby was being cared for by the Defense Department, the federal government insisted it received no notice of Mast's bid for adoption, the recently released records show. Had it been notified, government lawyers said, they would have told the judge that the child was not stateless, the government was at that time searching for her family and would soon decide she was Afghan and not the child of foreigners. She was also not in a medical crisis: A month before, exhibits show, her doctor described her as “a healthy healing infant who needs normal infant care.”

The Masts have said in court records that they did not mislead the court; they believed that the girl was the stateless daughter of transient terrorists and Afghanistan was neither interested nor capable of caring for her.

Moore did not respond to requests for comment.

On Sunday, Nov. 10, 2019, Moore granted the Masts a temporary adoption. Moore ordered the Virginia Department of Vital Statistics to issue a new birth certificate, making her the Masts' daughter.

Adoption cases usually creep through the court system. Moore granted the Masts the temporary adoption in a weekend.

Two days later, an email arrived overnight at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul from State Department headquarters. The office had heard that Mast had been granted custody of the orphan, and wanted to know if that was true, the documents show.

Officials who had been working on uniting the girl with her family seemed stunned by the email. An Army colonel later wrote in a declaration that he believed Mast was “attempting to interfere inappropriately.”




Around that time, U.S. officials learned that a man came forward to claim the baby, records show. He told authorities he was the child's uncle. He said the girl's father was a local farmer, not a terrorist. His wife and five of their children were also killed. He said it was his family's duty to take her in.

The Afghan government vetted his story. U.S. officials signed off.

Meanwhile, Mast's tour ended. He returned home to Virginia, and set up a crib for the baby he was certain would soon be theirs, according to court testimony. The couple quickly found an ally in an aide for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The aide pressed Assistant Secretary of Defense Derek Maurer to ask immigration officials to rush documents the child needed to get to the U.S. An attached memo written by another military official pointed to proof of Mast's claim to the baby: Mast had enrolled her in the military's health care system as his dependent.

On the application for those benefits, Mast claimed the girl had lived with him in Virginia since Sept. 4, 2019, but she had never been on American soil, a government official wrote in a declaration. Mast also wrote that her injures were a result of child abuse.

The situation worked its way to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He signed a cable, dated Feb. 25, 2020, records show, dismissing the Fluvanna custody orders as “flawed.”

The cable said that any further delay in transferring the child could be perceived as the “U.S. government holding an Afghan child against the will of her extended family and the Afghan government.”

The next day, Mast filed a federal lawsuit to stop the reunification. The judge rejected his claims.

The U.S. put her on a plane to meet her relatives. They wept when they saw her, bundled in pink. The child's uncle decided his son should raise the baby with his new wife and they quickly came to love this girl like their own daughter, they testified.

The Masts have insisted that this family is not biologically related to the baby and have questioned the process through which the Afghan government vetted them. The Afghan couple had celebrated the first step in a traditional Afghan marriage, a religious bond, but had not yet had a wedding reception, and the Masts argue they were unmarried at the time the child was given to them.

The AP agreed not to name the Afghan couple because they fear their families in Afghanistan might face retaliation from the Taliban. The court issued a protective order shielding their identities.

The Taliban, which now controls Afghanistan, was not in power when that country was making decisions about the child. Since taking over, the Taliban has been critical of what happened to the girl, calling it “worrying, far from human dignity and an inhumane act,” and urged the U.S. to return her to her relatives.

The Afghan couple testified they had no idea that on the other side of the globe an American judge still believed the girl was available for adoption.

Mast told Moore the child was given to an unmarried girl whose relationship to her was unclear. He testified that he maintained the child was the daughter of foreign fighters and suspected the family had ties to terrorism.

Moore said he did not learn that a federal judge had already rejected Mast's claims to the baby. He would later say he vaguely remembered hearing that something happened in federal court but it didn't register as important.

“I guess I assumed it was an administrative thing,” Moore said.

Mast continued to ask Moore to grant a final, permanent adoption.

Lawyers representing the government, the Afghan family and the child would note many defects in these proceedings; the attorney representing the child described the flaws as “glaring.” There is no Virginia law that allows a judge to adopt out a foreign child without her home country's consent. A child must be put up for adoption by a parent or agency, and this child had never been. The court waived the requirement that the child be present when social services visited the adoptive parents' home, that someone investigate her history, that whoever had custody be told this was happening.

In December of 2020, Moore granted a final adoption, deeming the Masts the baby's permanent parents.

“She is an undocumented, orphan, stateless minor,” he wrote, “subject to this court's jurisdiction.”

In Afghanistan, the couple raising the girl received calls from strangers. Mast was working with Kimberley Motley, an American lawyer based in Afghanistan. Motley told the couple that a family wanted to help the girl get medical care in the U.S. But the couple refused to send the girl alone. Motley kept in touch with them for months, according to messages entered as court exhibits. Motley, through her attorney, declined to comment.

In the summer of 2021, the American military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over. Mast contacted the couple directly, enlisting the help of a translator named Ahmad Osmani, an Afghan Christian who'd moved to the U.S. Osmani considered it his Christian duty to help the Masts, testifying that he believed it would be “a great picture to see a terrorist's daughter become a believer and glorify God's name.”

Mast and Osmani told the couple that they could get all three out of Afghanistan.

At the time, servicemembers were frantically evacuating Afghans, mostly those who helped the U.S. and would likely be targeted by the Taliban.

Amid the confusion, Mast asked colleagues in the Marines to add a baby and her caretakers to an evacuation list, the records show, claiming the State Department had sent her to an orphanage. She was living with the Afghan couple, and had never been to an orphanage.

A lieutenant colonel emailed other military officials to start the process of getting the family on a flight out. He didn't learn that the military had worked to keep Mast away from this baby.

“Is it even lawful for us to take her?” asked a major in the Marines, according to a copy of the email.

Mast, who was copied on the chain, replied: “To clarify, she is completely clear on the Afghan side,” he wrote. “I am very familiar with the requirements after the last 18 months working the legal issues.”




Military officials asked no further questions, and soon the family was on a plane to Germany, where the Masts met them for the first time. The Afghans testified they had no idea the Masts planned to take her. The Masts have said they had tried to explain that they would.

Stephanie Mast testified that when she and her husband arrived in Germany, they “knew we had to speak to them and just tell them the truth.” She tried to explain “sacrificial love.” If the baby came with them, she told the Afghan woman, “she can have the best life possible.”

The Afghan man ripped off the wristband refugees wore and threatened to return to Afghanistan if the Americans tried to take the child.

The Afghan woman later said they convinced her that she'd misunderstood and persuaded them to continue to the U.S., and keep the baby with them.

The Afghans boarded a plane bound for Dulles International Airport, then a bus to Fort Pickett, a military base in Virginia turned makeshift refugee center. Meanwhile, the records show, Mast asked a State Department official he'd met in Germany to help connect him with other government contacts so he could track the family's arrival.

Emails show employees with multiple government agencies sprung into action, including the State Department. The federal government would later say that these employees, like the military officials who evacuated the family, didn't know that the very agency they worked for had tried to prevent Mast from taking the girl.

Rhonda Slusher, a State Department official, answered the phone at Fort Pickett. On the line was Joshua Mast.

He said he was going to come pick up his adoptive daughter, according to a declaration Slusher submitted in court. Slusher said she was told “there was no U.S. jurisdiction to hold the child,” and she should be given to Mast “at the earliest point possible.” Her supervisor instructed her to assist with “the transfer of the child,” she wrote in the declaration.

Mast told Slusher he was concerned the family she was being taken from “were going to be sad,” she wrote.

On Sept. 3, 2021, uniformed officers drove the Afghan family to a nondescript building near the camp's front gate.

Slusher picked the baby up out of the car seat and insisted she hold her as the family went inside.

There, the Afghan woman later testified, another official, this one from the Department of Health and Human Services, told them: “you are not the parents of this child.”

“It's like you are kidnapping her,” the Afghan man said.

The Afghan woman came toward Slusher.

“Please give me my daughter,” she said “She is my daughter.”




The baby cried and squirmed to get back to her, but Slusher wouldn't let her go. The woman tried to grab the child, but Slusher pulled her hands away. The woman “crumpled to the floor crying.” She lay there for at least five minutes.

Slusher wrote in a declaration that she carried the baby outside, where Stephanie Mast was waiting in the car. Stephanie Mast fed the girl Goldfish crackers before they drove away with her husband.

“It is worth reiterating that this prolonged tragedy was entirely avoidable. The Trump administration blocked an attempt to unlawfully seize the child from her Afghan family in early 2020,” the Afghan couple's attorneys wrote in a statement, adding that the Masts were able to take the child only because of America's messy exit from Afghanistan. “The child and her relatives are victims of a crime and a tragedy no family should ever endure — a stark reminder that this withdrawal continues to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.”

More than a year after the Masts took the baby home, her fate was before Judge Richard Moore again.

The Afghan couple found a team of lawyers willing to represent them for free, and filed a petition in Moore's court to challenge the adoption he'd granted. Moore could undo the adoption and give the child back to the Afghan family, or uphold it, and leave her with the Masts.

“I've never had a case where I was so uncomfortable with either decision,” he said at the November 2022 hearing, which would be his last hearing in the case before retiring.

The judge listened for five hours as the lawyers for the Afghan couple and the government said that the adoption he'd granted was so riddled with errors it shouldn't be called an adoption at all.

Moore blamed the federal government — it had known as early as 2020 that the Masts were trying to get the girl and a court in Fluvanna County was involved, and they did not try to stop him from issuing a “possibly errant adoption,” he said. 

“Clearly, there were procedural irregularities and deficiencies in this case. There's no question about that,” the judge said from the bench.

Yet for a year, in hearing after hearing, the primary question became whether the Afghan couple had a right to challenge that adoption at all; whether they were truly her family and if the Afghan government's decision to give her to them was valid once they arrived in the U.S.

The judge and the Masts' attorneys questioned them about their origin and upbringing, their relationship to each other and to the child.

Moore repeatedly said he did not believe they were related to the girl, nor was he inclined to consider them parents. He said no court in Afghanistan was involved in determining who should get custody of the child there. The Afghan couple's lawyers had resisted DNA testing, saying it couldn't conclusively find a relationship between opposite-gender half-cousins. It was also irrelevant, they argued: After the Afghan government gave the child to them, an American court should not relitigate that choice.

At the last hearing he held in November 2022, Moore said there were many things he wished Mast had told him before he signed the adoption. But he still trusted the Marine.

“There's no question in my mind. Their total involvement was to save this child,” Moore said.

A week later, Moore published his thoughts on the case in a written document, and reiterated his opinion that “anything they did improper grew” out of the Masts' desire to help the child.

He was less sympathetic to the Afghans. The Afghan woman testified that she had two Afghan government identifications, one that included her real age and a second she obtained intentionally making herself younger to enable her to enroll in school. They “misrepresented certain facts and lied … for their own purposes,” Moore wrote.

The Masts, too, have described the Afghans as untrustworthy, even threatening. They submitted court records alleging the Afghan man was flagged in a database of suspected terrorists upon entry to the U.S., which they reported to law enforcement. Attorneys for the Afghans responded that the government said in a sealed letter to the court that the man was not the subject of the database entry. The man remains in the U.S. and frequently flies from Texas to Virginia for court hearings.

With Moore's retirement, the Masts and the Afghans found themselves before a new judge, Claude Worrell.

Worrell rebuked the federal government for its “inconsistent” approach, noting it was arguing the baby should be immediately returned to the Afghans, while its own employees had repeatedly assisted the Masts along the way. 

It did not take Worrell long to come to a wholly different conclusion than Moore. Worrell wasn't concerned about biological relationships. What mattered, he said, was Afghanistan claimed her as its citizen, so got to decide her fate.

In March 2023, Worrell voided the adoption.

The Afghan couple went outside to a patch of grass in the parking lot and prayed. They thought they would soon bring the baby to their home in Texas, where they've kept a bedroom ready for her, decorated with butterfly decals.

The Virginia Court of Appeals has since upheld Worrell's decision voiding the adoption, and the case went before the Virginia Supreme Court in February 2025. It has yet to issue a ruling. As the years dragged on, the child remained with the Marine and his family.

The Marine Corps held an administrative hearing in October 2024 to determine whether Mast violated military rules. A three-member panel found that he acted in a way that was “unbecoming” of an officer, but that didn't warrant suspension or other formal punishment.

The federal government has indicated in court in recent months that it is reconsidering its role in the case, and Trump's second administration could reverse his first administration's opinion that Mast had no right to the child. The Justice Department did not respond to repeated requests to clarify its current position on the child's fate.

It has been four years since the Afghan couple has seen her.

In July, she turned 6.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Denver Mayor Mike Johnston regularly games out responses to threats like destructive tornadoes or hazardous waste leaks. He's added a new potential menace: the federal government.

When President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops to some U.S. cities last year over the objection of local leaders, Johnston said his tabletop exercises expanded to consider what might happen if federal officials took aim at Denver, which the Trump administration has sued for limiting cooperation on deportations. The city now prepares for the impact of federal activity on everything from access to schools and hospitals to interference with elections. 

“We used to prepare for natural disasters,” Johnston, a Democrat, said in an interview. “Now we prepare for our own federal government.” 

A half-dozen state and local officials from both major political parties over the past week described an increasingly hostile relationship with Washington. While there's inherent tension between city, state and federal governments over power, politics and money, the current dynamic is unlike anything they've experienced, particularly after federal agents killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month. 

While partnerships are still in place, the officials said the Minneapolis killings have hardened opposition to excessive federal power. 

“This is unprecedented,” said Jerry Dyer, the Republican mayor of Fresno, California, and a former police chief. “I've never seen federal law enforcement come to the cities, whether it's National Guard or ICE, and police cities without a level of cooperation from local police.”

The tensions have upended longtime Republican arguments that the federal government should leave local governance to the states under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Now a Republican president is articulating a muscular federal approach over the protest of Democrats. 

“There's no question that the Trump administration has repeatedly violated the Constitution and how it deals with states,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said in an interview. 

“My hope,” he added, “is that we are quickly approaching our McCarthyism moment where even Donald Trump's supporters are going to recognize this has gone too far.” 




Trump has expressed frustration at reflexive resistance from Democratic mayors and governors, insisting this week that he doesn't want to force federal law enforcement on communities. He prefers to work with officials like Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who requested National Guard troops to patrol New Orleans.

The president's willingness to use federal power is often issue-based, favoring states in areas like abortion or education while embracing a strong federal role on immigration and elections. 

Trump said this week that Republicans should “nationalize” elections, a power the Constitution expressly gives to states. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was referring to a push that voters prove they are U.S. citizens, though Trump still described states as an “agent for the federal government.”

“That's not what the Constitution says about elections,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told MS NOW.

Beshear and the 23 other Democratic governors released a statement Thursday objecting to “interference from the federal government.” In the interview, Beshear pointed to Paul's comments as an example of bipartisan agreement. 

“Rand and I don't agree on a lot,” he said. 

Paul and some other Republicans, including Govs. Phil Scott of Vermont and Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, have also expressed concern about the immigration operation in Minnesota. 

Trump has taken preliminary steps to ease tensions, replacing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security leaders in Minneapolis with Tom Homan, the administration's border czar. Homan is withdrawing 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers deployed around Minneapolis, though Trump and Vice President JD Vance reject any suggestion of a federal drawdown. 

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the continued presence in the Twin Cities of thousands of federal officers contradicts his demand that the administration end its operation there. In a sign of the frustration between local and federal officials there, the rhetoric has taken on militaristic tones.

Trump has referred to federal law enforcement in Minneapolis as “soldiers.” Homan has described agents as being “in theater,” a military phrase typically used in reference to a conflict zone. During a quick trip to Washington last week to address fellow mayors, Frey spoke of an “invasion” and “occupation” in his city.

“We are on the front lines of a very important battle,” he said.

At the same event, Elizabeth Kautz, the Republican mayor of suburban Burnsville, Minnesota, said she now carries her passport around the city she's led since 1995.

“With the introduction of ICE, our cities are no longer safe,” she said. 

That's also how it feels to leaders in places far from Minneapolis, even if they haven't been targeted by ICE.

“What I can't tolerate is the approach to immigration operations in a place like Minneapolis that are causing people to look over their shoulder in cities like Allentown,” said Matt Tuerk, the Democratic mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania, which has a large Latino population. “Even though you're not in Allentown, you're having an impact.”

The immigration crackdown is one element of Trump's work to dramatically reshape the U.S. government's priorities and operations at home and abroad. Trump and his supporters describe a need to strictly enforce immigration laws in the U.S. and end social safety net programs they say are prone to fraud. The president's foreign policy has shown little patience for longstanding alliances or diplomatic niceties that are seen as out of step with U.S. interests. 

That's manifested most clearly in Trump's push for Denmark to cede control of Greenland to the U.S., a demand that brought the NATO alliance to the brink in January. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney spoke at the time of a “rupture” between the U.S. and its allies that would be difficult to repair. 

For some local leaders in the U.S., that sense of a seismic shift felt familiar.

“It's profoundly changed,” Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, said of his views toward the federal government. “Given that the administration has used partisan politics and used the power of the federal government and its various agencies to put pressure on mayors and local officials not to follow the law but to follow their politics is absolutely new and it's absolutely affecting trust at every level.”

While foreign leaders can explore a shift in alliances, as some are actively considering, that's nearly impossible for local leaders in the U.S., whose budgets are tied to federal funding. Those funds have been unstable during Trump's second term as Washington has canceled grants that he considered wasteful or out of line with the administration's priorities, prompting some mayors to turn to philanthropy for help.

But nothing can replace the power of the federal government, said Tuerk, who described defending grants by connecting the money to the administration's priorities, including job creation.

“When we're like, ‘Hey, don't take away this grant that is designed to get people to work,' I hope that message is getting through,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the federal shift “absolutely historic.” Trump has fiercely criticized her, issuing an executive order last month deriding her wildfire response and pressing to “cut through bureaucratic red tape” to speed up reconstruction.

In an interview, Bass, a former member of Congress, said she turns to administration officials she knew from her time in Washington.

“I'm fortunate,” she said. “I have an ability to have a relationship.” 

But as January came to a close, local officials in Minnesota seemed exhausted. 

“You think about, ‘Why us?'” said Jim Hovland, the nonpartisan mayor of the Minneapolis suburb Edina. “We've had a historically really good relationship with the federal government, and it's really sad to see it fray.”

Friendship with Epstein has already brought down a British royal – Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew – and U.K ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson, fired by Starmer over his links to the financier. Now new revelations have plunged Starmer's center-left government into turmoil.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, file)























LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a battle to stay in post after the fallout from his decision in 2024 to appoint veteran politician Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the U.S. despite the latter's ties to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Starmer's judgment is in the spotlight like never before, especially after the release last week of millions of Epstein-related documents by the U.S. Justice Department showed how close those links were. 

There's widespread anger that the prime minister appointed Mandelson, a grandee of Starmer's own Labour Party, to such a sensitive and high-profile post. Starmer had already sacked Mandelson after a first batch of emails were published in September, showing he remained friends with Epstein after the late financier's 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving a minor.

But the emails made public this week show that Mandelson also passed on sensitive — and potentially market-moving — government information to the disgraced financier in 2009, when he was a member of the Labour Cabinet.

Starmer's leadership has now been called into question. Several Labour lawmakers have said that he should quit, while others are clearly uncomfortable, following a series of missteps since the party returned to power in a landslide victory in July 2024.

Starmer is trying to fight back. He has apologized to the British public and to the victims of Epstein's sex trafficking for believing what he has termed “Mandelson's lies.” 

There are a number of ways in which Starmer could go, some more straightforward than others. 




The simplest option is that Starmer announces his intention to resign, triggering an election for the Labour leadership. A resignation could possibly come if a delegation of Cabinet members tell Starmer he has lost too much support within the party or if members of his government quit in protest.

Those considered to harbor leadership ambitions include Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Home Secretary Shabana Mahood and former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who had to resign last year after admitting she didn't pay enough tax on a house purchase. The problem for Rayner is that an investigation into that is ongoing. 

But there's no clear front-runner. 

Andy Burnham, the popular mayor of Manchester who was blocked from standing at a special election in the city later this month, would not be eligible as the leader must come from the parliamentary party. 

Whoever does run, the election would likely take weeks, with Starmer likely staying in post until that concludes.

Were Starmer decide to resign immediately, the Cabinet and Labour's governing body would likely pick an interim leader to be prime minister, probably someone not standing to be Labour leader. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy could fit the bill.

Under Labour's rules, candidates must have the support of a fifth of the parliamentary party, which equates to 80 lawmakers. 

Those meeting that threshold would then have to receive the support of 5% of the local constituency Labour parties or at three least party affiliates, of which two must be trade unions. Affiliates are groups or organizations that are deemed to have interests consistent with those of the Labour Party; including trade unions and co-operative and socialist societies.

Eligible members of the party and affiliates will then vote for the leader using an electoral system that ranks the candidates. The winner is the first candidate to secure over 50% of the vote. 

King Charles III would then invite the winner to become prime minister and form a government.

If Starmer does not resign, he could face a challenge, potentially from within his Cabinet. 

Unlike the Conservative Party, which has a history of getting rid of leaders such as Margaret Thatcher in 1990 and Boris Johnson in 2022, Labour does not have that muscle memory. No Labour prime minister has ever been dislodged, though Tony Blair announced his plan to resign in 2007 after a series of low-level resignations.

Challengers would have to meet the eligibility thresholds above, but Starmer would automatically be on the ballot. 

Starmer faces a series of hurdles in the weeks ahead. The first will probably come within days when files related to the vetting of Mandelson are published. Starmer will be hoping they show the scale of Mandelson's lies. Should they not, that could be a point of high jeopardy for the prime minister.

Another potential pitfall could be the special election in Gorton and Denton on Feb. 26, traditionally a safe Labour seat. However, this time it will be a tough fight, with challenges from the anti-immigration Reform U.K. on the right and the Greens on the left.

The decision to bar Burnham from standing also poses a risk for Labour. Though he was blocked on the grounds that a Burnham victory would trigger a costly special election for the mayoralty in Manchester, critics claim that Starmer did not want to see a potentially dangerous rival back in the House of Commons.

After that comes a raft of elections in May. Many in Labour fear the party could lose power in Wales for the first time since the legislature was created in 1999, fall way short in Scotland and get battered in local elections in England.

It's clear that Starmer faces a difficult landscape. 

And that's barring surprise developments that could further rock his premiership. 

“Events, dear boy, events,” Harold Macmillan, prime minister between 1957 and 1963, said when asked what the greatest challenges for leaders were.

Iran and the United States are poised Friday to hold negotiations in Oman at least over Tehran's nuclear program. The talks follow a chaotic week that initially saw plans for regional countries to take part in talks in Turkey.

Oman mediated indirect talks Friday between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the talks as “a very good start” even as the parties met Oman's top diplomat at different times at a palace on the outskirts of the country's capital, Muscat. Both Araghchi and the Omanis described the talks themselves as focused on merely trying to find a way to hold future negotiations — seemingly returning to the start of discussions about the Iranian nuclear program that unfolded over months a year ago, before Israel launched its 12-day war on Iran in June. 

The U.S. side, represented by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, had no immediate comment on the talks. 

In an unusual development, U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, also attended the meeting — something that did not happen in previous rounds and likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail.

Other news we're following: 








The Trump administration is asking a federal judge to allow it to end temporary legal protections for roughly 350,000 Haitians in the U.S. while it appeals her ruling blocking the termination.

In a court filing on Thursday, the Department of Justice asked U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes to pause her decision. 

Reyes ruled Monday that a lawsuit challenging the termination was likely to prevail on its merits.

The Trump administration wants Reyes to issue a decision by Monday. 

Attorneys for the plaintiffs objected to that timeline in a court filing, arguing there was no emergency that requires the sudden termination of Haiti's Temporary Protected Status.

“Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. 

“The President should remove it,” said Scott, a Black Republican who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media.

Bondi says Gabbard presence in Fulton County doesn't taint search

Bondi said “absolutely not” when asked if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at last week's FBI search of the election office in Georgia tainted the search.

The office has been central to right-wing conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss. 

It came a week after Trump predicted prosecutions over a contest he has baselessly insisted was tainted by widespread fraud.

Bondi stressed on Friday that the search was helmed by FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey.

Gabbard has said that she present at the search because Trump wanted her there. Trump this week said Gabbard had gone to Georgia “at Pam's insistence,” referencing the attorney general.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday federal authorities are assisting Arizona officials investigating the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother.

Bondi spoke during an unrelated news conference in Washington when she was asked about the investigation involving 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of the “Today” show host.

“It breaks my heart for Savannah and for her family,” Bondi said.

Bondi called for prayers for the family and said she's known Savannah Guthrie for more than 30 years.

She declined to say more about what federal officials are doing to assist.

A “key participant” in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans is in custody, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday.

The 2012 attacks on the U.S. compound killed Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

The attack emerged as a divisive political issue.

Republicans challenged President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on security at the facility, the military response to the violence and the Democratic administration's changing narrative about who was responsible and why.

Officials said that Zubayr Al-Bakoush was brought to an airfield in Virginia early Friday.

“We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said.

—

Corrective: This story has been corrected to show that the suspect arrived at an airfield in Virginia, not Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced.

The military strength of the US was showcased during talks with Iranians. 



U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, also attended the meeting — something that did not happen in previous rounds.

It likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail.

With the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships in the region, along with more fighter jets, the U.S. now likely has the military firepower to launch an attack if it wanted.

Trump has used his social media account to share a video about election conspiracy theories that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama. 

It was part of a flurry of social media activity that amplified Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected criticism of the post that depicted the Obamas, who are Democrats. 

An Obama spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

Nearly all of the 62-second clip appears to be from a conservative video.

Iran's top diplomat said that indirect talks with the United States held in Oman on Friday were “a very good start” but negotiators now must speak with their leaders.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the comment in a live interview from Muscat, Oman, on Iranian state television. 

Araghchi described the talks as taking place over multiple rounds and that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations.

Oman has mediated indirect talks between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.

Oman issued a public statement acknowledging the talks after Associated Press journalists watched Iranian and American officials separately visit a palace on the outskirts of Muscat to speak to the sultanate's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi.

It wasn't immediately clear Friday if that was the end of the talks for the day.

The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel's attacks devastated Iran's air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well.

Ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates rock-and-rolled their way to a world-best 91.06 points in the rhythm dance to open the team competition at the Milan Cortina Olympics, where the American figure skaters are the reigning champions.

Cheered on by a crowd that included Vice President J.D. Vance, his family and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chock and Bates were able to secure their team the maximum 10 points for their Lenny Kravitz-inspired dance while making a big early statement.

The three-time world champions, Chock and Bates are the favorites to win individual Olympic gold later in the Winter Games.

Trump claims his tariffs have revived the U.S. economy. However, the U.S. economy was already growing before his second term. 

During the first three quarters of the year, Trump's tariffs — or the threat of them — delivered mixed results. 

Inflation figures are skewed by data disruptions, and tariffs have actually increased core goods prices. 

Trump also claims foreign producers bear most tariff costs, but studies show U.S. consumers and firms are affected.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — A suicide bomber targeted a Shiite mosque on the outskirts of Islamabad during Friday prayers, killing 31 people and wounding at least 169 others, officials said, a rare bombing in Pakistan's capital as its Western-allied government struggles to rein in a surge in militant attacks across the country. 

Television footage and social media images showed police and residents transporting the wounded to nearby hospitals. Some of the wounded in the attack on the sprawling mosque of Khadija Al-Kubra were reported to be in critical condition. 

Rescuers and witnesses described a harrowing scene, with bodies and wounded lying on the mosque's carpeted floor. Hussain Shah said he was praying in the mosque courtyard when he heard a sudden, loud explosion. 

“I immediately thought that some big attack had happened,” he said. He then went into the mosque to utter chaos — many of the wounded were screaming and crying out for help. Shah said he counted around 30 bodies inside the mosque, while the number of the wounded appeared to be significantly higher.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion, but suspicion is likely to fall on militants such as the Pakistani Taliban or the Islamic State group, which has been blamed for previous attacks on Shiite worshippers, a minority in the country. Militant groups across Pakistan often target security forces and civilians. 

Though attacks are not so frequent in Islamabad, Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent months, largely blamed on Baloch separatist groups and the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which is a separate group, but allied with Afghanistan's Taliban. A regional affiliate of the Islamic State group has also been active in the country.

In the initial aftermath of the explosion, a lower number of casualties was released, but Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Memon gave the latest tolls.

Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif wrote on X that preliminary findings suggest the suicide bomber had been on the move to and from Afghanistan. Asif said the mosque's security guards tried to intercept the suspect, who opened fire at them and then detonated his explosives among the worshippers. 




The condition of the guards was not immediately known. Pakistan often accuses Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized power again in August 2021 as American and NATO troops were withdrawing after a 20-year war, of harboring militants and members of the Pakistani Taliban. Kabul denies the accusation.

Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement Friday saying that the “Islamic Republic of Afghanistan condemns such attacks that violate the sanctity of sacred rituals and mosques and target worshippers and innocent people.” 

The attack also drew condemnation from the international community, including the United Sates and European Union. Condolences and condemnation also poured in from various embassies in Islamabad. 

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended condolences to the families of the victims in sperate statements and asked that all possible medical assistance be provided for those wounded.

“Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,” Zardari said. “The nation stands with the affected families in this difficult time.” 

“Those who are responsible must be identified and punished,” Sharif said. Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack.

Friday's attack occurred as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is on an official two-day visit, was attending an event with Sharif. The event in Islamabad was several miles away from the site of the explosion.

A top Shiite leader, Raja Nasir, expressed deep sorrow over the attack at Khadija Al-Kubra. 

“Such a terrorist act in the federal capital is not only a serious failure in protecting human lives but also raises significant questions about the performance of the authorities and law enforcement agencies,” he said and asked for people to give blood as the hospitals in Islamabad were in urgent need for blood supplies for the wounded. 

The last deadliest attack in Islamabad was in 2008, when a suicide bombing targeted the Marriott Hotel in the capital, killing 63 people and wounding over 250 others. In November, a suicide bomber had struck outside a court in Islamabad, killing 12 people.

The latest attack came nearly a week after the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army carried out multiple attacks in insurgency-hit southwestern Balochistan province, killing about 50 people. 

Security forces responding to those attacks also killed more than 200 “terrorists,” according to the military. 

Hours after the Islamabad bombing, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif said on X that she had canceled her events at the music and kite-flying festival in the city of Lahore for Saturday. The festival, which got underway on Friday, was still expected to continue.

The search for Nancy Guthrie intensifies as private investigator TJ Ward, who worked on the Natalie Holloway case, weighs in on the missed ransom deadline and looming Monday threat.

A neighbor of missing Nancy Guthrie said he saw a suspicious white van on their street in the days before NBC host Savannah Guthrie's mother was taken from her home.

Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Tucson home at around 9:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department.

While officials didn't initially elaborate on the circumstances of her disappearance, Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday that ""we do, in fact, have a crime."" A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital that there were ""blood drops"" leading from the entryway outside down the house's pathway towards the driveway. 

""Sheriff [Chris] Nanos has stated that he believes that a crime has been committed,"" a spokesperson for Pima County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital. ""At this point, investigators believe she was taken from the home against her will and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction.""

Brett McIntire, who lives across the street from Nancy Guthrie, told the New York Post he reported the unmarked van to police. He couldn't recall exactly when he saw the van, but said it was recent.

""It was somewhere on that street. It was a white van, full-sized, with no printing on the sides. It was parked on the street,"" he said. ""Normally people that are coming to work on your home will have a company vehicle or, if they're independent, something written on it.""

After Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Brett's wife, Lisa, said they're considering buying security cameras.

Rep. Gregory Meeks repeatedly demanded a yes-or-no answer from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, escalating the exchange into a tense confrontation.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was grilled by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill in back-to-back hearings this week that repeatedly erupted into shouting. Bessent was on the Hill to discuss the nation's economic health but faced sharp questioning that at times derailed the proceedings.

The confrontations reflected broader Democratic frustrations over President Donald Trump's trade agenda and renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve, sharpening concerns about inflation, borrowing costs and the administration's economic direction.

Against that backdrop, cost-of-living pressures dominated the hearings, with Democratic lawmakers demanding clearer answers as Bessent defended the administration's policies.

Here are the top contentious moments from Bessent's hearings.

On Wednesday, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was among the first to clash with Bessent over Trump's economic agenda, with the irate congresswoman asking at one point if someone could ""shut him up.""

The exchange took place during Bessent's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. Waters, the panel's ranking member, pressed Bessent on the potential inflationary effects of Trump's tariffs on U.S. consumers, repeatedly calling for a yes-or-no answer.

Waters: So I ask you, Secretary Bessent, will you be the voice of reason in this administration and urge President Trump to stop waging a war on American consumers, harming housing affordability, and putting the economy at risk? Yes or no. You don't have to explain.

Bessent: Representative —

Waters: Will you be the voice of reason? Will you be the voice of reason?

Bessent: A study from Wharton University has shown —

Waters: Reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time. Mr. Chair, will you let him know when I ask to reclaim my time —

Rep. French Hill, R-Arkansas, House Financial Services Committee chairman: The time does belong to the gentlewoman from California.

Bessent: Ten to 20 million immigrants —

Waters: Can you shut him up?

Bessent: What about the housing stock for working Americans? And can you maintain some level of dignity?

Hill: The gentlewoman's time has expired.

Waters: No, my time has not expired.

Hill: Your time has expired. The gentleman —

Waters: The gentleman took up my time. I think you should recognize that, Mr. Chair.

Hill: The gentlewoman's time has expired.

Following the contentious exchange with Waters, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) asked Bessent to commit to pausing and fully scrutinizing any Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) licensing tied to World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto firm.

He cited concerns about conflicts of interest and foreign influence that he said should be reviewed and shared with Congress. Bessent cited the OCC's independence and declined to give a direct yes-or-no answer.

Meeks : All I need to know is will you halt it and do a complete investigation and scrutiny of this licensing application? Yes or no? 

Bessent: No, congressman. The OCC is an independent entity and I would note congressman —

Meeks: All you have to say is yes or no.

Bessent: In 2006, you traveled to Venezuela —

Meeks: I take that as a no.

Bessent: On behalf of your donors —

Meeks: I take that as a no. You do not want to answer that question.

Bessent: 110 years —

Meeks: I take that as a no.

Bessent: For 7 billion —

Meeks: I'm asking you to do your responsibility as Secretary of the Treasury.

Hill: Mr. Meeks. Your time has expired.

Meeks: He went past your time, Mr. Chairman. He did not answer my question, and he went past the time.

Hill: He had six seconds left to try to answer your question.

Meeks: And it was a yes or no.

Hill: Gentleman, the chair recognizes the gentleman —

Meeks: Stop covering for the president. Stop being his flunky.

Hill: Gentlemen, gentlemen —

Meeks: Stop covering for the president, work for the American people.

Bessent: To make a trip to Venezuela —

Meeks: Don't be a cover-up for a mob.

Hill: Mr. Meeks. Mr. Bessent please —

Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., sparred with Bessent during a contentious Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday, pressing him on President Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS over the alleged leak of his tax records. 

When Bessent said any payout would come from the U.S. Treasury, Gallego pushed back, arguing the cost would ultimately be borne by U.S. taxpayers.

Bessent tried to interject, but Gallego continued, ""I'm controlling the time here. You're not obeying the law. You're plundering U.S. taxpayer dollars.""

In the same hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., pressed Bessent to explain a joke Trump made about Federal Reserve nominee Kevin Warsh.

Warren, the panel's ranking member, asked Bessent about comments Trump made over the weekend, when he joked — or appeared to joke — about suing Warsh if he failed to lower the national interest rate. The question triggered a shouting match between the two.

WARREN AND BESSENT ERUPT INTO SHOUTING MATCH OVER TRUMP'S WARSH JOKE

Warren: This one should be an easy one. Mr. Secretary, can you commit right here and now that Trump's Fed nominee, Kevin Warsh, will not be sued, will not be investigated by the Department of Justice, if he doesn't cut interest rates exactly the way Donald Trump wants?

Bessent: That's up to the president. Can you commit that you will — 

Warren: I'm sorry? You can't say that he won't be sued if he doesn't drop interest rates?

Bessent: Can you commit that you will not hold up — 

Warren: And he won't be criminally investigated?

Bessent: The president also made a joke about you — one I won't repeat.

Warren: That was supposed to be a softball. That was the easy one. If this was a joke, why not just say so?

Bessent: It was a joke, and he made a joke about you, too, Senator Warren. It got a lot of laughs, it got a lot of laughs. I don't know if you want to respond to that. 

Warren: I do want to respond, I think the American people are laughing, they are the ones that are struggling.

Last week, Trump nominated Warsh to lead the world's most powerful central bank. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would assume one of the most powerful positions in U.S. economic policymaking, with direct influence over interest rate decisions and the central bank's battle against inflation.

'Bar Rescue' host and executive producer Jon Taffer joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss new dietary guidance on alcohol, the rise of mocktails and how Ozempic is shrinking portion sizes across restaurants.

After years of chasing hard-to-get reservations and trendy TikTok foods and drinks, Gen Z is making dive bars cool again.

Young adults born between 1997 and 2012 are embracing becoming regulars at local spots like it's 1995 — echoing the vibes of ""Friends"" and ""Cheers"" as they seek real-world connection, better deals and laid-back atmospheres, Business Insider recently reported.

Industry insiders tell Fox News Digital they're seeing the trend play out across their own businesses.

COMMUNAL DINING MAKES GEN Z COMEBACK, BUT OLDER GUESTS PUSH BACK ON 'CHAOTIC' TREND

""We're definitely seeing a shift back toward those reliable neighborhood spots where the focus is more on meaningful catch-ups than chasing the latest trend,"" New York-based beverage expert Gareth Howells told Fox News Digital.

""While we all love a fancy cocktail lounge for a big night out, there's something special about becoming a regular at a local spot where the staff knows your name,"" Howells said.

Restaurant owners agree that reliable neighborhood spots are increasingly appealing to younger customers.

""Gen Z consumers are very intentional about where they go and why,"" said Hakki Akdeniz, a New York–based restaurateur whose businesses include Champion Pizza and Mira Mediterranean & Hookah Lounge. 

BARTENDERS SAY ONE COMMON REQUEST COSTS THEM TIPS — AND SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE NO IDEA

""They care more about whether a place is welcoming, social and worthwhile than about glitz and glam,"" Akdeniz told Fox News Digital. ""They want to feel like their time and money actually matter.""

Dive bars also offer younger customers, who are drinking less overall, a place to socialize without the pressure of heavy alcohol consumption, according to Vic Christopher, president and co-founder of Clark House Hospitality in Troy, New York. 

Affordable beers are winning out over pricey cocktails. (iStock)

""There seems to be less interest in complicated cocktails and long-winded explanations for wine varietals and more of an emphasis on value,"" he said.

Cheaper drinks, wing nights and other specials are also drawing in younger crowds who might just be making minimum wage, said Alex Schwartz, marketing director at PDQ POS, a sales software provider used across the country. 

HAPPY HOUR HABITS SHIFT BAR CULTURE IN AMERICA: WHO'S DRINKING WHEN

""I am seeing a lot more dive and neighborhood bars invest in live entertainment and themed nights, something that went away for a few years after the pandemic,"" he added. 

""Gen Z customers are more interested in seeing local performers and attending recurring events where they can build friendships and relationships with people in their area.""

A $7 beer is repeatable — an $18 cocktail is not, agreed Ben Tannenbaum, New York-based vice president of partnerships at nightlife company LineLeap. He said dive bars are also better suited to today's fragmented schedules and rising costs. 

""You don't need to plan,"" he said. ""You don't need reservations. You just go.""

Just over half of Americans consider themselves a regular at a local restaurant or bar, according to OpenTable, meaning they visit three or four times a month and staff may know their name or order. Gen Z is increasingly following older generations in filling these spaces.

""Becoming a regular allows people to have a home away from home.""

Tech and payment companies are reportedly racing to monetize the desire for neighborhood connection, formalizing what once happened naturally through loyalty programs, according to the National Restaurant Association.

""We're focusing on rewarding loyalty, motivating people to be loyal to places that they love,"" Ben Leventhal, co-founder of Resy and founder of Blackbird, an app focused on loyalty rewards for restaurants, told Business Insider.

""Restaurants love to connect with new regulars, guests love to become regulars.""

For Akdeniz, however, technology can't replace old-fashioned hospitality.

Rising drink prices are pushing Gen Z toward neighborhood dive bars instead of high-end cocktail spots, experts say. (iStock)

""Loyalty programs can help, but they should never replace the human element of hospitality,"" he said. ""The best loyalty is built on relationships — being remembered, cared for and feeling like you belong.""

The trend may also be better for mental health and connection.

Dive bars are often lower-pressure and less judgmental, said John Puls, a licensed psychotherapist at Full Life Comprehensive Care in Boca Raton, Florida, and an adjunct professor at Florida Atlantic University.

""The traditional nightlife of clubs does not yield itself to in-person connections as much,"" Puls told Fox News Digital.

""Becoming a regular allows people to have a home away from home. It provides an opportunity to put down your phones and experience genuine connections.""

Transportation Sec. Sean Duffy announced $160 million in federal funding would be revoked from California after the state failed to meet the administration's Jan. 5 deadline to revoke nearly 20,000 CDLs issued to migrants. 

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's team is disputing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) assertions about the immigration status of a semitruck driver involved in a crash that left four dead in Indiana. The driver was taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after a detainer was placed on him.

DHS said the driver, Bekzhan Beishekeev, a 30-year-old national of Kyrgyzstan, came into the U.S. ""illegally"" using the controversial CBP One app and was later issued a commercial driver's license (CDL) in Pennsylvania. The department confirmed to Fox News that Beishekeev entered the country on Dec. 19, 2023, at the Nogales, Ariz., port of entry, using the CBP One app and was released into the U.S. via parole by the Biden administration.

""Not only was Bekzhan Beishekeev released into our country by the Biden administration using the CBP One app, but he was also given a commercial driver's license by Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania. These decisions have had deadly consequences and led to the death of four innocent people in Indiana on Tuesday,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

McLaughlin then called on ""sanctuary"" governors to stop issuing CDLs to illegal immigrants ""before another American gets killed.""

Shapiro's office argues that Beishekeev had legal status when he was issued the license in July 2025 and that he could still be eligible under a DHS database to receive one.

""Every person who applies for a non-domiciled commercial driver's license issued by PennDOT must provide proof of identify and proof of their legal presence in the United States. That information is verified by the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database, administered by Kristi Noem and the United States Department of Homeland Security,"" Shapiro spokesperson Alex Peterson said in a statement provided to Fox News.

""The individual in question had legal status in Kristi Noem's database when the license was issued in July 2025 and still shows as eligible to receive a license as of today. Kristi Noem should focus on minding the shop in her own agency, as her incompetence and operational failures seem to be matching the scale of her moral failures as the Secretary of Homeland Security,"" Peterson added.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY RAMS ICE VEHICLE, BITES AGENTS AFTER FAILED GUN PURCHASE IN PITTSBURGH

The deadly crash occurred on Feb. 3 at approximately 4:00 p.m. when Beishekeev was driving eastbound on Indiana's State Route 67 and allegedly failed to break for a slowed semitruck in front of him, according to DHS and Indiana State Police. Beishekeev then allegedly swerved into oncoming traffic and slammed into a van carrying 15 passengers. Four people were killed in the crash. DHS said the fatal incident is being investigated by the Indiana State Police, the Jay County Sheriff's Department and the Jay County Coroner's Office.

DHS and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) have warned about the dangers of CDL issuing practices in several states following a series of fatal crashes allegedly involving illegal immigrants.

In its statement on Beishekeev, DHS noted that ICE had previously arrested another illegal immigrant who was issued a CDL in Pennsylvania.

Akhror Bozorov, 31, is an Uzbek national who DHS said was wanted in his country of origin for belonging to a terrorist organization. Bozorov was arrested in Kansas on Nov. 9 while working as a commercial truck driver, using a CDL issued in Pennsylvania, according to DHS. Bozorov was allegedly granted work authorization in January 2024 under the Biden administration.

Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'

Imagine being a telegraph operator in September 1859. You're sitting at your station, using cutting-edge technology to tap out messages hundreds and thousands of miles away. Suddenly, brilliant auroras light up the night sky from the tropics to the poles.

Then chaos.

Sparks shower from your equipment, shocking you with a jolt strong enough to knock you out of your chair, while igniting your telegraph message papers. You later find out that some of your fellow operators could still send messages even after disconnecting their batteries — not knowing that the telegraph wires were being energized by massive currents induced in the wires by the most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history.

WALL STREET UTILITY TAKEOVERS MAY MEAN HIGHER BILLS AHEAD

That storm, triggered by a colossal solar flare observed by British astronomer Richard Carrington, unleashed a coronal mass ejection (CME) that slammed into Earth's magnetic field. Such a massive solar storm is known as a Carrington Event.

A telegraph operator in 1859 could only wonder at today's technology — technology that is far more vulnerable to the sun than was the case then.

The sun has an 11-year cycle, and this year is the peak of the cycle. On Feb. 1, giant sunspot AR4366 — a behemoth that grew rapidly from nothing to nearly half the size of the monster behind the Carrington Event — unleashed an X8-class solar flare, the strongest of Solar Cycle 25 so far.

In the preceding 24 hours, this unstable region hurled 23 M-class and four X-class flares earthward. Extreme ultraviolet radiation from the X8 blast ionized the upper atmosphere, blacking out shortwave radio communications across the South Pacific for hours.

SNOWSTORM COULD'VE SPARKED GRID CATASTROPHE IF BIDEN CLIMATE POLICIES WEREN'T REVERSED: ENERGY DEPT

More concerning is the potential CME. The explosion ejected dense plasma that could be Earth-directed. If it arrives with sufficient force, it will compress Earth's magnetosphere and induce powerful geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) — in other words, electrify the Earth's surface. GICs, in turn, can impart a current to the high-voltage transmission lines that form the backbone of our electric grid. And that can be a problem.

Modern society is infinitely more dependent on electricity than in the telegraph era. A Carrington-level event today wouldn't just spark a few fires in telegraph offices. It would risk melting or destroying hundreds of massive high-voltage transformers, triggering widespread blackouts that could last months or years. Supply chains would collapse, water systems would fail, fuel pumps would go dark, communications would vanish and refrigeration would cease. Estimates of economic damage range from $600 billion to $2.6 trillion in the United States alone, with untold loss of life from lack of heat, medicine and emergency services.

Yet despite clear warnings, America's grid remains dangerously vulnerable.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR

In my 2023 report for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texas Defense, I detailed how both natural geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks pose existential risks to the grid.

A severe event could damage or destroy effectively irreplaceable extra-high-voltage (EHV) transformers, leading to prolonged outages across the state and beyond.

But there is good news: Proven, cost-effective hardware solutions exist today. Neutral Blocking Devices equipped with capacitors, installed in the grounded neutral of high-voltage transformers, can prevent catastrophic damage. These devices block the quasi-direct current (quasi-DC) GICs induced by solar storms or the E3 component of an EMP blast, while allowing normal 60 Hz AC power to flow unimpeded. These devices buffer harmful ground currents, preventing overheating, destructive harmonics, voltage collapse and eventual meltdown.

RAPID RISE OF AI PUTS NEW URGENCY ON CONGRESS TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY

As a bonus, these devices also mitigate lower-level GICs that currently shave years off transformer life and cost industry billions annually in reactive power losses.

Costs for these devices have fallen dramatically as technology has matured. A nationwide deployment protecting the most vulnerable 6,000 transformers would require a one-time investment of roughly $4 billion — a fraction of the trillions at risk.

Yet utilities and transmission companies remain reluctant, wary of passing even modest costs to ratepayers. Regulators, meanwhile, have dragged their feet, relying on standards derived from studies that dramatically underestimate the threat.

TRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS

Many of these vulnerability assessments trace back to European research conducted more than 30 years ago, during an unusually calm solar period. Those models assumed lower GIC intensities and failed to account for today's more interconnected, higher-voltage grid — or the far more active sun we're experiencing now in Cycle 25.

Compounding the problem is the fact that most large power transformers are no longer made in America. The majority come from China, South Korea, and Germany, with typical delivery lead times stretching to four years or more under normal conditions. If dozens or hundreds are destroyed in a severe solar storm, replacement could take a decade or longer — time we wouldn't have in a prolonged blackout.

With sunspot AR4366 still crackling and more explosions likely in the coming days, the warning couldn't be clearer. Congress and state legislatures must act swiftly to mandate or incentivize installation of neutral blocking devices. Utilities must prioritize grid resilience over short-term rate concerns. And regulators must update standards to reflect real-world risks, not Pollyannaish assumptions from a sleepy sun.

A progressive candidate backed by champions of the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is close to pulling off an upset victory with votes still being counted in a Democratic congressional primary for a blue-leaning seat in New Jersey.

Analilia Mejia, a progressive organizer, has a slight lead – 486 votes out of more than 61,000 counted – over former Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski in the battle for their party's nomination in New Jersey's 11th Congressional District.

Mejia and Malinowski are the leaders among a field of 11 Democratic candidates in the race to fill the seat left vacant after now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill stepped down after winning November's gubernatorial election in the Garden State.

"" I do think that we have emerged victorious, but I want to first make sure that every voter, every voter's voice is heard,"" Mejia said Friday at a news conference.

HOUSE GOP MAJORITY SHRINKS TO JUST ONE VOTE AS JOHNSON SWEARS IN NEW HOUSE DEMOCRAT

Thursday's primary was closely watched by Democrats as an early testing ground in the debate between progressives versus the more mainstream elements of the party.

And a victory by Mejia, who worked as political director on Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, would be another major boost for the left against the establishment.

She told supporters on primary night, ""We have to rebuild our party, we have to rebuild what is happening in our nation. We have to reclaim our democracy. We know that our economy is rigged to suit the billionaires.""

And Mejia, who during her primary campaign took aim at President Donald Trump's unprecedented crackdown on illegal immigration, reiterated on Friday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency most visible in the aggressive tactics used in the administration's massive deportation effort, ""is completely overreaching.""

""I think the fact that I was bold and unafraid to speak the truth was incredibly important. I think voters feel that they want to have a representative that actually represents them, and they cannot watch what's happening in Minnesota, what happened in Chicago, what happened in California, what happened in Morristown across this district,"" she told reporters.

Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state in former President Barack Obama's administration who later represented a neighboring congressional district in northern New Jersey from 2018 to 2022 before losing re-election, was considered the front-runner in the race heading into primary day.

But Malinowski was the target of a slew of attack ads put out by a group affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which opposed Malinowski because he said he supports conditions on aid to Israel.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) jumped the gun on Thursday night, congratulating Malinowski in an email release.

""Tonight, Democrat Tom Malinowski clinched victory in the New Jersey District 11 special election Democratic primary,"" the DNC's release read.

Later in the evening, after taking a slight lead in the vote count over Malinowski, Meija put out a social media post showing the famous photo of then-President Harry Truman, during his 1948 election victory, holding up a newspaper with the erroneous banner headline: ""Dewey Defeats Truman.""

Mikie Sherrill on Jan 15, 2026, in Caldwell, New Jersey. (Michael Karas / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)

The Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) a leading group on the left, said in a statement that ""Analilia Mejia's momentous showing proves that voters, when given a choice, want Democrats with an inspiring vision who will boldly challenge powerful interests on behalf of working families.""

""This is the second big congressional primary in two weeks where voters chose the more progressive candidate and made clear they want Democrats who will shake up a broken political and economic system – not just be anti-Trump,' added PCCC co-founder Adam Green, a New Jersey native who knocked doors for Mejia and spoke at a rally with Mejia and Sanders on primary eve.

The winner will face off with Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to file for the special election, which will be held on April 16.

Hathaway will be considered the underdog in the race.

Sherrill won re-election in the district in 2024 by 15 points, the same margin by which she carried the district in November's gubernatorial showdown.

But then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by just eight points in the 2024 presidential election, giving the GOP some hopes of possibly flipping the seat.

The special election comes as Republicans cling to a razor-thin 218-214 majority in the House of Representatives.

But the GOP may land a reinforcement in the House before the general election for the open seat in New Jersey is held.

JOHNSON WARNS HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO ‘STAY HEALTHY' AS GOP MAJORITY SHRINKS TO THE EDGE

That's because a special election is scheduled on March 10 in Georgia's solidly red 14th Congressional District, in the race to succeed former GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The MAGA firebrand and one-time top Trump House ally in early January stepped away from Congress a year before her term ended.

A whopping 22 candidates, including 17 Republicans, are running in the Georgia showdown.

According to Georgia state law, all the candidates will run on the same ballot. If no contender tops 50% of the vote, a runoff election between the top two finishers will take place on April 7.

WHO TRUJMP IS BACKING IN RACE TO REPLACE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE

Trump on Wednesday endorsed Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit District Attorney Clay Fuller, a Republican, in the race.

Greene won re-election in 2024 to the seat by nearly 30 points, and Trump carried the district, which is located in northwest Georgia, by 37 points.

A primary in the race to fill LaMalfa's seat will be held on June 2, which is primary day in California. And the special general election will be held on Aug. 4.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Minnesota prosecutor seeks ‘immediate' relief amid influx of 427 immigration lawsuits","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/4448026/minnesota-prosecutor-seeks-relief-amid-influx-immigration-lawsuits/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:55:56 GMT","

The top federal prosecutor in Minnesota is urging an appeals court to move quickly over a key immigration enforcement dispute, saying his office is buckling under a flood of lawsuits against the Trump administration's mass deportation push in the Twin Cities.

U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, an appointee of President Donald Trump, said his short-staffed office has been forced to abandon “pressing and important priorities” to manage hundreds of emergency habeas petitions filed by immigrants arrested and detained during Operation Metro Surge. In a Jan. 30 filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, Rosen disclosed that 427 immigration-related habeas cases were filed in the District of Minnesota in January alone, with the pace expected to continue into February.

“To respond to this wave of habeas petitions, this Office has been forced to shift its already limited resources from other pressing and important priorities,” Rosen wrote in a declaration submitted to the appeals court. “The MN-USAO has canceled all [affirmative civil enforcement] work and any other affirmative priorities … and is operating in a reactive mode.”

Rosen, a Trump appointee confirmed by the Senate in October, said his office's civil litigation team in his office is “down 50%” following a wave of resignations and departures at the start of Operation Metro Surge. Remaining attorneys, he said, are appearing daily for emergency hearings, often on nights, weekends, and holidays.

“The Court is setting deadlines within hours, including weekends and holidays. Paralegals are continuously working overtime. Lawyers are continuously working overtime,” Rosen wrote, adding that swift appellate intervention is “desperately needed.”

The Justice Department echoed those concerns in a filing submitted Thursday in the case at hand, Herrera Avila v. Bondi, urging the 8th Circuit to resolve the appeal on the briefs or, alternatively, to expedite oral argument. DOJ attorneys said the “crushing burden” of immigration litigation has forced U.S. attorney offices across the circuit to divert resources from “other critical priorities, including criminal matters.”

A significant part of the burden facing the federal government is the lack of clarity from federal circuit courts on the legality of the Trump administration's indefinite detainment of illegal aliens detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. The 8th Circuit has a generally conservative ideological makeup, as the majority of its judges were appointed by Republican presidents. More recently, the appeals court sided with the Trump administration after a lower court temporarily limited ICE's tactics for mitigating protests. It could soon have a chance to weigh in on the efforts by pro-immigration lawyers to stop deportations using the courts.

Immigration advocacy groups have so far been able to make the Trump administration appear as if it is losing the legal battle over its mandatory detention policies by following rinse-and-repeat patterns in district courts. In Minnesota, groups such as the American Immigration Council or the American Immigration Lawyers Association file a habeas petition to a federal judge, who more often than not grants temporary release to the detained immigration enforcement target.

The Trump administration's legal justification for indefinite detentions pending final orders of removal hinges directly on the Immigration and Nationality Act's § 236(c), which permits arrests and detainment pending a final deportation order. Those come from immigration courts, not district courts. With the passage of the INA, Congress tasked immigration courts with handling removal proceedings, thereby stripping district courts of jurisdiction over immigration matters.

More than 300 district judges in Minnesota and elsewhere have so far rejected the government's mandatory detention policies, ordering detainees released or granted bond hearings. That has fueled a surge of copycat filings nationwide. All the while, appeals courts have yet to address whether the administration's interpretation of the INA comports with the law.

However, resolutions to this debate may be on the horizon. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit could become the first to issue a decision over the Trump administration's detainment policy following recent Feb. 3 oral arguments in the case Buenrostro-Mendez v. Bondi.

GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY WHO TOLD JUDGE ‘THIS JOB SUCKS' SENT BACK TO DHS

And according to Rosen, relief cannot come soon enough. In his Jan. 30 court filing, he asked the 8th Circuit to reach an “immediate resolution” upon its review of the briefs, or, if not, to promptly schedule an oral argument hearing.

“Absent expedited review, the resources of this Office will continue to be drained as hundreds more habeas petitions are filed,” Rosen said, warning that “other important responsibilities and other priorities will be compromised.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Young men are turning to fascism. I don't use that word lightly. Hypochondriac leftists apply it to everything they dislike, from farmers' markets to air travel. Still, when I see the combination of antisemitism, white nationalism, hostility to markets, and apologias for actual, literal Nazism (notably through the elevation of Adolf Hitler's legal apologist, Carl Schmitt), I don't know what other word to use.

How to measure the generational shift? Much has been made of Ron Dreher's claim that 30% to 40% of Republican staffers under 30 are followers of Nick Fuentes, or “Groypers.” In fact, Dreher was quoting a friend's guesstimate, and the actual number is probably lower. Even so, the direction of travel is alarming.

For anyone unfamiliar with Fuentes, he is a 27-year-old provocateur who enjoys horrifying his audience. As a teenager, he marched at the 2017 Unite the Right rally, reveling in the idea that a “tidal wave of white identity is coming.” He says he loves Hitler, and summarized his worldview as “Jews are running society. Women need to shut the f*** up. Blacks need to be imprisoned.” His X account, reinstated in 2024, has 1.2 million followers, and his America First livestream show attracts around a million views per episode.

What do his followers, overwhelmingly young men, find attractive? Fuentes is clownish and whiny, and has called himself “a proud incel.” Still, he is entertaining. A study by the Manhattan Institute in December 2025 found that Groypers were not poor or marginalized. What drew them to Fuentes — and Candace Owens, and other incendiary influencers — was entertainment: “Psychologically, this group was marked by desensitization, shaped less by fear than by boredom. Politics is entertainment: a stage for mockery, transgression, and performance, not moral seriousness or policy discipline.”

If it were only a bit of fun, there might be little to worry about. Young people often like to shock. Plenty of teenage Trotskyists grow into centrist boomers. The phenomenon is familiar to the Right, too. Richard Hanania wrote a moving column the other day about how, in his late teens, he “became one of a countless number of young men who found solace in Nietzsche's thought”. Happily, he outgrew his Übermensch phase to become a brilliant writer.

The difference this time is that an entire infrastructure has grown up around the younger version of Hanania, and it shows no sign of reaching its extent. The tendency once known as “alt-right” now generally calls itself post-liberal, and is buttressed by a growing mass of conferences, think tanks, and magazines. Some of its thinkers are respectable intellectuals. Adrian Vermeule, who has done more than anyone to rehabilitate Schmitt's skepticism about the rule of law, is a professor at Harvard Law School. Patrick Deneen, whose works are the closest thing to an illiberal manifesto, is a professor at Notre Dame.

Just as Friedrich Nietzsche would have been horrified by Hitler, both men doubtless find the Groypers distasteful. Yet they share a deep opposition to the values on which the United States was founded, preferring a quasi-theocracy.

This hostility is now overt on the post-liberal Right. Here, to pluck an example at random, is an editorial in the current issue of the paleo-conservative magazine Chronicles, taking issue with those who complain that the Heritage Foundation is no longer focused on America's, you know, heritage: “The Declaration [of Independence] is an ordinance of secession from the British Empire, and the Constitution is an old list of laws and political compromises. This is akin to running into a fire to grab a drawer full of old legal documents.”

Skepticism about the Constitution is the original sin. Abandon the vision of the Founders and all manner of unpleasant things follow: strongman government, protectionism, tribalism, and, yes, the oldest hatred. Look at the various European autocrats, of Left and Right, who railed down the ages against “Anglo-Saxon liberalism” and “debased American capitalism”. Almost to a man, they were antisemites. It comes as a package.

DAN HANNAN: WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT VENEZUELA

To put it another way, asking why young men are drawn to identity-based authoritarianism is like asking why folks from Indiana have two legs. We are a tribal species. Everyone is drawn to collectivist ideas until they are taught something better.

The U.S. used to be very good at teaching people something better, making individualists out of immigrants from some pretty tribal societies. Then, at some point in the early 21st century, culminating in the Black Lives Matter madness of 2020, we started telling Americans that they were defined by their race. Some of us warned at the time that there would be a horrendous backlash, and, sure enough, it is on us now. Ah, well. Two hundred and fifty years was a pretty good run.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Spain's crusade against X aims to stamp out discussion of ‘electoral engineering'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/faith-freedom-self-reliance/4447177/spain-crusade-against-x-aims-stamp-out-discussion-electoral-engineering/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

MADRID — European potentates have gone to war with Elon Musk and his X platform, sensing that the liberation of political speech could spell electoral doom for them. Leading that fight is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is seeking to muzzle X for the criticism of his proposed amnesty of illegal immigrants.

Sanchez announced last week the legalization of some 500,000 illegal immigrants, though at least one Spanish commentator told me that it was actually closer to a million. She showed me the numbers to back the allegation. His slavish state television immediately cast the measure as “moderate.”

With television and newspapers highlighting the anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots in Minneapolis 24/7, and giving only the view that Americans have spontaneously fought President Donald Trump's policies in the streets, the media cast Sanchez's amnesty as the compassionate riposte to Trump.

But it did not take long for a leader of Podemos, one of the parties supporting Sanchez in the legislature, to let the cat out of the bag. Irene Montero, the party's top political strategist and a former minister of equality for Sanchez, told a rally in Zaragoza that the amnesty was intended to win votes.

“I am asking migrants and racialized people to please not leave us alone with so many fascists! Yes, of course we want them to vote, of course!” a very animated Montero shouted at the crowd last Saturday. 

“We have obtained papers for you, regularization [amnesty], and now we are going to demand that you be given citizenship so that you be able to vote,” Montero, who was speaking the truth, added. Sanchez announced his intention to legalize these illegal immigrations to mollify Podemos, which has long demanded amnesty as the price for its support.

Then came the kicker, as Montero, swept up in her own fervor, shouted, “Yes, hopefully we'll have replacement theory. Hopefully, we'll be able to sweep away from this country all these fascists and racist people, with immigrants and working people. Yes, of course, I want replacement. I want the replacement of fascists and racist people.”

It did not take long in the age of X for people outside of Spain to notice what was going on. Because I was there, I posted an entire thread. Ian Miles Cheong posted, “It's not even a secret anymore. By legalizing 500,000 illegals under the guise of defeating the far-right, Pedro Sánchez is essentially dropping the mask. This is electoral engineering.” Musk saw that and reposted with one word: “Wow!” Virality ensued.

But one can't enact a successful replacement if everyone notices. So Sanchez is working to make sure that X becomes as house-trained and domesticated as the domestic news channels. The prime minister used an address he had scheduled this week at the Dubai World Government Summit to unload on X and Musk.

“Just last week, the owner of X, a migrant himself, used his personal account to amplify this information about the sovereign decision by my government, the regularization of 500,000 migrants that live, work and contribute to the success of our country,” Sanchez said, as if amplifying news, i.e., reporting it, should be a crime.

After listing many supposed crimes by X and other social media platforms, Sanchez said, “Some may say that if we don't like social media platforms, we can simply leave them. That no one is forced to use X or TikTok. … But we know that our children and many citizens do not have that choice. Social media has become an integral part of their lives, of their reality. So if we want to protect them, there's only one thing we can do. Take back control.”

Sanchez then listed exactly what steps his government will present to Parliament; few had anything to do with sparing minors the harms of online activity.

“Next week, my government will implement the following actions,” he said.

The first was one of the most draconian: hold platform executives legally accountable and open to criminal liability for failing to remove illegal or hateful content. Second was the turning of “algorithmic manipulation, and amplification of illegal content, into a new criminal offense.” So X, Facebook, etc., will cease to be private entities.

Third, the Spanish government will pretend to “track, quantify, and expose how digital platforms feed division and amplify hate.” In other words, you have to give information exactly how Sanchez's minions on Spanish media would. Add your own critical take, however, and you are criminally liable.

The fourth was the only one that really addressed minors: Spain will ban access to social media for those under 16 years old. Draconian perhaps, but nothing tyrannical there. The fifth and last one was, however, that Spain will investigate Grok, TikTok, and Instagram for possible infringements and prosecute when necessary. Spain, he added, will defend Spaniards “from the digital Wild West.”

In other words, if these proposals become law, Spain will cease to be truly free.

In reality, it is not just leftist forces that want Musk out of Europe. He has generated opponents across the spectrum.

HOW HOLLYWOOD CAN COMBAT RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN AFRICA

But Spain's Left is and has always been one of the most retrograde in the West. Sometimes it seems like the same group that was burning down convents, raping nuns, and assassinating political opponents right before the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War has been brought forward by a time machine. There are no longer anti-clerical mobs going around Spanish cities and towns, torch in hand, but they talk the same way.

Sanchez is more of a rank opportunist than a hardcore ideologue. His party is well behind in the polls, and he must face the voters next year. The only way to survive, he seems to be saying, is to carry out what his 1930s predecessors were prevented from doing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration has its eyes on the midterms and beyond.

The Trump White House is changing the rules of our political system through intimidation, the distortion of information, financial corruption, and the dismantling of government offices. In the final episode of this season, we examine whether the administration is also trying to change the rules of our elections. Dawn Baldwin Gibson, a North Carolina pastor, tells us about how, in 2024, her vote was challenged for reasons that still aren't clear to her. Host Anne Applebaum interviews Stacey Abrams, who has spent years fighting voter-suppression tactics. Abrams argues that Gibson's story is one of many attempts to change how people vote and how their votes are counted.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Dawn Baldwin Gibson: For more than 35 years, I have been a registered voter and I have been casting my vote. To this day, months later, I still don't know why my vote was being challenged.

[Music]

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Anne Applebaum.  This season, we've been talking about the Trump administration's unprecedented accumulation of power. But we're still missing one piece of the story: the elections themselves. We've heard people talk about how they fear soldiers on the streets could intimidate voters, or how crypto barons could try to manipulate campaigns. But the [Donald] Trump White House is also very interested in elections: how voters are registered, how they vote, how those votes are counted.

Across the country, state governors and legislators, sometimes inspired by Trump's false claims about the 2020 elections, are enacting new voter-ID rules; they're changing registration requirements and crafting lists of voters to purge from the rolls.

Dawn Baldwin Gibson is a pastor in New Bern, North Carolina. She's one of more than 60,000 North Carolina voters who had the legitimacy of their vote challenged in 2024.

Gibson: One of the races on the ballot was for the North Carolina Supreme Court. The election was between Allison Riggs and Jefferson Griffin. I actually went to vote as an early voter, and this is something that for many years I have done with my family. Showed my ID, went in, cast my vote, and really thought nothing else about it until a couple of weeks went by. I started hearing about this Jefferson Griffin list.

ABC11 newscaster: Republican candidate Griffin is challenging more than 65,000 ballots in the North Carolina Supreme Court race, arguing—

Gibson: The authority in North Carolina is the State Board of Elections. They were not challenging my vote. They were showing that I had done everything that I was supposed to have done for my vote to count. But Jefferson Griffin's team, they were the ones challenging my vote. And that seemed like changing the rules after the results are not what you want.

I just thought, Do something! What can I do? So we got a local church. We wrote letters. We talked to the local media.

CBS 17 newscaster 1: After months of back-and-forth legal rulings, the challenge to November's supreme court election ruling is over.

CBS 17 newscaster 2: Republican Judge Griffin is conceding the race. His decision ends the only election— 

Gibson: So yes, in the end we did get our votes to count, but it put a lot of stress. It put a lot of worry. I come from a rural community, and the word we would use is: It was a lot of worry-ation. They felt like—every time I go to vote, Is this what I'm gonna have to put up with? Go vote, and then there's a challenge.

[Music]

Gibson: My maternal grandfather, Frederick Douglas Fisher—both of his parents were slaves. He believed in being a part of the American democracy process, and that process was voting, and that we, as his children and grandchildren, had a responsibility to show up and vote, and so there was a great pride in that. And to know that we are now in a time where we are seeing our votes being challenged, it is our responsibility. The breaking down of democracy is not going to happen on our watch. This is our time, where history will look back and say, In 2025, there were people that stood and said: “I will be seen. I will be heard, and my vote will count.”

[Music]

Stacey Abrams: Voter suppression is one of the core tools of authoritarianism. It is how you shift from democracy to autocracy. And for millions of Americans, it's about to become the norm.

Applebaum: Stacey Abrams is one of the leading experts on the topic of voter registration and voter suppression. Her work has helped me understand that voter suppression isn't a single thing or a law, but rather a thousand little cuts and changes, maybe designed to discourage just a few voters but which can make a big difference when elections are as close as ours. She's the founder of Fair Fight, the voting-rights organization, and she twice ran for governor of Georgia. She's also the lead organizer of a campaign to fight authoritarianism called the 10 Steps Campaign.  Stacey, what do you make of Dawn's story?

Abrams:  There are three components to voter suppression: Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? And does that ballot get counted? And what she is describing is that third barrier. What we have seen happen over the last decade and a half, since the erosion of the Voting Rights Act, is this wholesale attack on all three of those points of entry to democracy.

Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you cast a ballot? She covered both of those hurdles, but she got tripped up by: Does your ballot count? And in Georgia, in Texas, across this country, in Florida, North Carolina, we are watching this dramatic acceleration of voter suppression and, sadly, it is going to be the most effective tool used by authoritarians to thwart the will of the people in the next few years.

Applebaum: Okay. Let's start with gerrymandering, the redrawing of voter-district boundaries. It's a topic that is not remotely new in America. The word itself comes from Eldridge Gerry, who, while governor of Massachusetts in 1812, designed a voting district that supposedly looked like a salamander, hence gerrymander. So it's very old practice, but this year, I think for the first time, we have an American president who has asked state governors to create new voter districts and even put quite heavy pressure on some of them in order to give his party an advantage in the midterm. This is now a national project, as opposed to something that happens locally, and it's also out of season and out of order, because usually voter boundary changes are made after a census.

Now Governor [Greg] Abbott of Texas has already agreed to change boundaries in Texas, even without a census. Am I right that this is new? That the federal government's involvement in this is different and maybe more dangerous?

Abrams:  There have been maps that have been redrawn in between census years, in between redistricting, but those had been exclusively court-ordered. When lines were drawn that did not conform, the court would take some time to look at these maps. Georgia, almost every single cycle after the Voting Rights Act, had to have its maps adjudicated by a court, and that was true for a lot of southern states.

And so it is not the case that there had never been redrawn districts. It had usually been that those districts were redrawn because the court said, You didn't do it right the first time. But what we are seeing now, and what you've just described, is unprecedented. We have never had a president of the United States explicitly state that the line should be redrawn, not based on population, but based on voter outcome. And when you do that, when you decide that the districts are not designed to allow voters to elect their leaders, it is designed to allow leaders to elect their voters—that is a shift of power, and it is exactly what redistricting is designed to preclude.

Applebaum: What do you make of the response of Governor [Gavin] Newsom to the Texas redistricting? You know, he responded that if this was gonna be a federal-government project, that he was going to also make it a project in California. He held a referendum that has allowed California to also redistrict. I mean, is this just perpetuating the unfairness, or is this a legitimate response?

Abrams: It is a legitimate response because we are in illegitimate times. What is unique in this moment is how aggressively one political party is leveraging this and the ends to which it is being used, which is to overthrow democracy and to install an authoritarian regime. So that is a distinction that is incredibly important if we're gonna understand what Newsom did. When Trump said that he wanted to redraw those districts, when Abbott complied, when Missouri complied, when North Carolina complied, what they were doing was explicitly trying to strip power away from certain voters. And what Gavin Newsom understands is that performative pragmatism is not the response. This is an open battle for the kind of government we're going to have. And what he did was not advance the cause of Democrats. He nullified the advance of authoritarianism.

We are going to either win or lose democracy in the next few years. It's important for us not to think about this in the normative terms of political debate that we tend to have: one party versus the other. You and I both know that autocracies and authoritarian regimes have elections. Venezuela has elections. You know, Russia has elections. But they game before the election begins what the outcome is. The urgency of this moment is that if this holds, there will never again be the opportunity for competition, because if we have a single-party system that does not countenance democracy as the end goal, meaning that people actually get to participate, they will go through the motions, but it won't really matter, because they'll change the rules again. Because they will control the means of decision making, meaning they'll control the presidency and they'll control both chambers of Congress. And they have a pretty strong lock on the judiciary, which means that we won't have the debate anymore, because changing the lines won't matter, because the elections won't matter.

Applebaum:  Stacey, there's another form of federal-government interference that the Republicans are also promoting, which is a federal law: the SAVE Act, or the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require in-person voter registration and the presentation of physical documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in federal elections. So they're asking people for not just a drivers' license or ID, most of which, I should say, already requires U.S. citizenship to obtain, but for a passport or a birth certificate in addition. And this creates an extra hurdle that people might not think about, or they might not remember to do before the election. Is that the right way to characterize how this law is supposed to work?

Abrams: The SAVE Act has disproportionate effect on very targeted communities: the 69 million women who may have changed their names after marriage, transgender people who may have had name changes. They're going to say that you don't have proof of your right to vote, because your name does not match your birth certificate and your Social Security card. That means that millions of people would be disenfranchised and would have to go through multiple hurdles to get back on the rolls. You knock out a group who also are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican.

I wanna be really clear. There are two conditions that are embedded in this argument that are important to understand. One is that you prove your citizenship, and the second is that you prove your identity. In the United States, both proofs are already required. This is not new. And, more importantly, there has been no discernible harm done to elections because people have not met these conditions. So it's really, really important that we understand that this is a solution that has no problem. Republicans and Democrats both acknowledge—in fact, there was a report that came out after the 2020 election—we don't have voter fraud in this country. It's hard enough getting people to vote. People don't really engage in trying to vote more than once, and people who do not have the right to vote, it is an extraordinary rarity that they will try.

Applebaum:  Right so there was no problem of noncitizens voting.

Abrams: There's no problem with noncitizens voting. There's no problem with non-ID voting. You have always had to prove who you are to cast a ballot. The issue was not Did you have to prove it? It was How did you prove it?

Applebaum: Does this requirement affect other groups? What about Black voters?

Abrams: Well, if you were born in the United States during Jim Crow and you were Black, you were legally not permitted to be born in a hospital, which meant that the birth certificate that you got was filed with the county, but it was not the original birth certificate from the hospital. So Black people, thousands and thousands of Black people, do not have an original birth certificate; 146 million Americans do not have a passport. Working-class and low-income Americans tend not to have that paperwork, and if they do, it's not easily accessible. And so that is why in the U.S. we've created systems to allow you to prove your citizenship in other ways. And by changing those rules, you are lining up communities that will not be able to participate in elections.

Applebaum:  Would the lack of participation not also hurt Republicans? Again, there are a lot of Republicans who presumably don't have passports and don't have birth certificates.

Abrams: It does. And that's one of the reasons I think this should be a bipartisan fight. Because when you try to break democracy by targeting one community, the problem is: You break it for everyone. And so they are willing to risk it because they think it will help them more than it will hurt them.

And the reason it matters is that when you tell the average person, You're not allowed to vote, they're gonna get mad. But it's unlikely that they're going to go to court to force the issue. And in a year, and in a nation, where margins of thousands of voters, not millions of voters, decide the outcome, if the federal government controls that data, if they can manipulate that information, they can then start to attack thousands and thousands of voters and win on the margins—not by actually winning the election, but by forcing voter suppression to lead people to simply not bother trying. And that has the same effect as not voting.

Applebaum: I also want to talk about your own experience with this. So, after you ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, you raised a lot of questions about whether voter-suppression tactics by your opponent had influenced the race. You sued. And, of course, you acknowledged the outcome of the race in the end, that he would be governor, and you wouldn't. But there was a nuance to your position that opened you up for criticism. I wonder if you could explain the nuance.

Abrams:  The tradition in politics is that once an election is over, you use the word concede. And as someone who is not only a lawyer but also a writer, words matter to me. They have meaning; they have heft. But I'm also the daughter of two civil-rights activists. My father was arrested when he was 14, registering Black people to vote in Mississippi. And so I take very seriously, and it has been my life's work, since I was 17, to focus on the access to democracy that is contained within the right to vote.

And so when I gave my speech on the night that we realized, despite the very clear and unambiguous voter-suppression tactics leveraged by my opponent, I said, He won. I was very clear about that. I said he was going to be governor. I was not, but I refused to use the word concede, because concession in that statement meant to say that the system that he leveraged was true or correct or proper, and I could not in good conscience say that. I never once questioned whether or not he became the governor. I questioned the system that allowed him and his cohorts to block access to the right to vote for thousands and thousands of Georgians. And because I refused to use the word concede, it became weaponized. But I never once filed a suit to make myself governor. I never once filed a personal suit. Trying to dislodge him. Every lawsuit that was filed was about the system itself. It was never going to solve the problem of me not winning. It was always in service of: How do we ensure that voters have their rights protected?

Applebaum:  Right. Right. So that's very different from the 2020 campaign, when Donald Trump tried to overthrow the results of an election.

Abrams: Absolutely. And it's a distinction that anyone with good faith or with good hearing can discern. Running for office does not guarantee you victory, but being a citizen in this country should guarantee you access to the right to vote.

[Music]

Applebaum: After the break:

Abrams: I fundamentally believe, based on what I've watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition.

Applebaum: We'll be right back.

[Break]

Applebaum: Stacey, it's illogical to think that illegal immigrants are eagerly voting in American elections, and there is no evidence that they do. Why would they want to attract that kind of attention from the government? Nevertheless, the administration, the Republican Party, MAGA media have been talking for years and years and years, actually, about illegal immigrants voting, even, as you say, proposing legislation to prevent it. Is this because they genuinely fear illegal voters? Or does it have a different purpose? Maybe the point is to create hysteria about an unfair election in advance, just in case the Republicans lose. That would give them an excuse to refuse to swear in new members of Congress. Or maybe they want to intimidate legal voters.

Abrams:  Lies work. (Laughs.) Lies are a very effective deterrent for voter participation. But there's also the micro issue. When people think that they might be arrested if they show up, then they won't vote. If people believe that there is some harm they will face, they won't show up. When people think that it is going to be too hard, when they think that it is going to be dangerous, they don't vote.

So let's look at New Jersey in 1981. New Jersey had a tendency to have armed folks standing in the polling places where Black people were voting. And based on that behavior, they were actually denied, the Republicans were denied, the right to do election observation for 30 years. The reason it became so important was that people would say, I'm not going to vote, because I could be arrested. Not that they had done something wrong, but they were afraid of being arrested because you had law enforcement patrolling voting places.

Applebaum: I mean, look. The establishment of ICE as a kind of paramilitary, a federal police that's not just used to enforce the law but to intimidate people, as well as the decision to send the National Guard into American cities has already got one governor, Governor [J. B.] Pritzker of Illinois, to say that these decisions are not just about fighting crime or public safety, but about creating a pretext to send armed military troops into communities now or during the 2026 election. So it sounds like you think that's a possibility.

Abrams:  I think it's a likelihood, because we've seen it happen. In Georgia, Hancock County, deputy sheriffs followed Black men home. And that behavior was so egregious that Black men started calling the county, saying, Please take my name off of the voting rolls, because I don't want the sheriff coming back to my house. That was a decade ago.

We know that when people are afraid, they will do what they can to protect themselves and their families. And just in case the fear isn't real enough, this administration, suborned by Republicans at every level of government, are willing to threaten the possibility of harm in order to game winning an election. And the reason they are doing this so aggressively is because they believe that if they can do it, they will control every level of government and every lever of power. Authoritarianism isn't about winning a single election. It is about dismantling a democratic system and installing a system that lacks accountability and has unchecked power. That's what they're after, and we cannot be so naive as to think that this is just about who wins a race. This is about who wins America.

Applebaum:  I thought that it was illegal for armed troops, certainly military, to be anywhere near polling booths on Election Day. Is that not the case?

Abrams: I will say it this way: It's illegal if you note them. But let's be clear, there are only a few places ICE is not permitted to go. And because they are masked, because they're unidentified, it is not just the actual harm—it's the specter of harm. That's what we have to be thinking about. It's not just the explicit violation of the law; it's the implicit threat that the law permits them to exercise. And when the U.S. Supreme Court said that you could detain people based on their race, their accent, or the language they spoke, when you said that ICE could do that, there is nothing to preclude ICE from doing that while you're standing in line getting ready to cast a ballot. So you may not have the National Guard there, but ICE is not actually military.

Applebaum:  I want to move way upstream in this discussion of elections, from the actual voting to the culture of election information and voter engagement. Here's an example: TikTok may be about to change from Chinese ownership to U.S. ownership, and the new owners could be U.S. billionaires who are friendly to Trump. We know that TikTok is one of the main sources of political information for young people. Do you think that this change in ownership could be deliberately designed to alter perceptions of the coming campaign, to change how people feel about the candidates? Is that something that counts as election interference? And if so, how do we think about it?

Abrams: Not only is it possible—it is highly likely. Half of young people get their news right now from TikTok and YouTube. Voting is as much a cultural event as it is a practical one. I vote in part because my parents used to take us with them to vote. I watched my parents vote in every election. It was part of our culture. We knew that voting was an important thing to do. There's a young woman, Esosa Osa, who started a company, an organization called Onyx Impact, and she has done extraordinary research into how disinformation intentionally targeted Black people. It works as a voter-suppression tool.

Applebaum: To convince them not to vote?

Abrams: To convince them not to vote or that their votes don't matter or that the vote that they have taken is somehow being manipulated. And it works. If you have conversations with those in the Latino population, they will tell you about the very subtle language that got inserted into conversations that they were listening to on the radio, that reminded them that their participation would be akin to supporting a regime that their families escaped from a decade before. And so, yes, culture is absolutely upstream, but when it floods the zone, it changes outcomes.

Applebaum: Stacey, this is the last episode in a season that's been exploring the administration's power grab from several angles. We have noted: This is not just arming ICE and sending the National Guard to cities. It's not just the construction of a biased civil service. It's not just the reshaping of culture and science. It's not just the direction of cryptocurrency profits to congressional campaigns. It's all of these things put together. How should listeners think about the defense of democracy? Is it a state-by-state effort? Is it issue by issue? Should we have a unified national approach?

Abrams: So the Constitution gives oversight of elections to state government. We don't have a single democracy. We have 50-plus different democracies operating at any given moment. And so, yes, part of the solution is going to be a state and local solution because the ripple effects of this will reach every level of government. We may be having conversations about Congress, but we've gotta understand that this will affect city councils and school boards and county commissioners and state legislatures. It will affect everything that government is responsible for delivering or not delivering. And so we have to have a localized response. That means more people have to volunteer to be poll watchers. More people have to organize to ensure that their communities understand what the votes actually count towards.

The young woman at the top of this conversation from North Carolina, she got it—that it wasn't just about whether or not a supreme-court justice in North Carolina got seated. It was whether or not kids in that school were going to get lunch, because the elections that are happening decide: How do we respond to SNAP benefits being cut? How do we respond to the ACA subsidies being diminished? How do we respond to disabled veterans being fired from their jobs because of the anti-DEI executive orders? Those are all of a piece, and so we have to have a multilayered, multipronged response to what is a multilayered, multipronged attack.

But I fundamentally believe, based on what I've watched this country do, what we have watched other nations do, that we can indeed fight back. But you cannot fight if you do not understand the opposition. We could win. But we are very, very, very likely to lose if we keep treating this as business as usual. This is not about whether this Democrat wins or that Republican wins. This is about whether democracy wins or authoritarianism wins.

[Music]

Applebaum:  Thank you so much, Stacey Abrams.

Abrams:  Thank you for having me.

Applebaum: And thank you all for listening. I hope that you've also concluded that this is not business as usual. The Trump administration is making deep changes to our political system and to the nature of our government. They are doing so with an eye towards tilting the playing field, shaping the elections in November, and, of course, the next presidential election, in 2028. If we want to keep our elections free and fair, not just this time but into the future, all of us will have to pay attention, take part, join campaigns, learn about local candidates, communicate with others, and vote. We don't want this to be the last chance.

The Super Bowl performer's ties to a nascent independence movement are roiling Puerto Rican politics.

Rapper Bad Bunny will perform Sunday at the Super Bowl halftime show, becoming the first solo male Latin American artist to headline. He's arriving at the peak of his popularity: The performance comes just a week after receiving the Grammy's highest honor for his genre-defining album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which deals with themes of colonization, gentrification, and difficult relationships, all while honoring the diverse roots of Puerto Rican and Latin music across the diaspora.

The 31-year-old superstar, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, is also developing a reputation for his outspoken politics. He's refused to tour in the United States since President Donald Trump took office again, for fear of exposing Latino fans to ICE raids.

“Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say, ‘ICE out!'” Bad Bunny said while accepting his Grammy for Best Música Urbana Album. “We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.”

The president is not a fan. “I'm anti-them,” he said of Bad Bunny and fellow Super Bowl performers Green Day, who have also been critical of his administration. Earlier, Trump claimed not to know who the Puerto Rican artist even is, calling his halftime selection “absolutely ridiculous.”

He should probably start paying more attention.

While Trump has been obsessed in his second term with expanding the US into new territories like Greenland, or even Canada, his neglect of Puerto Rico is ironically one factor in reviving a long-dormant independence movement there. And Bad Bunny is considered one of the most high-profile cultural figures who will help determine just how far it can go.

While casual listeners may have first learned about the artist's activism when he called out ICE onstage last week, Bad Bunny's outspokenness is nothing new. And he's been especially engaged with the archipelago's unique politics.

As Bad Bunny reminded Grammy viewers (and apparently some confused NFL players) in a jokey bit with host Trevor Noah on Sunday, Puerto Rico is “part of America” — a phrase he said with air quotes. The United States gained control of Puerto Rico in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War, granting its residents citizenship in 1917. The archipelago adopted its own constitution in 1952, officially becoming a self-governing US territory with an elected governor.

Since then, Puerto Rico's two historic major parties have divided themselves in part based on the question of its status. The New Progressive Party (PNP) is historically pro-statehood, which would give Puerto Ricans voting representation in Congress and in presidential elections as well as more control over their affairs. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) typically favors remaining as a commonwealth, which supporters argue will allow Puerto Rico to better maintain its unique culture along with US citizenship and certain economic benefits, like an exemption from most federal income tax.

In 2024, the governor's contest featured Jenniffer González-Colón, a former Resident Commissioner who caucused with House Republicans, on the PNP ticket. Jesús Manuel Ortiz ran for the PPD. But the election featured a surprising third-party dark horse, Juan Dalmau, secretary-general of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), which favors independence from the United States after a period of transition.

González-Colón loves Trump. Bad Bunny despises him. So it was no surprise that they were at odds. The singer sponsored anti-PNP billboards with messages like, “Quien vota PNP no ama a Puerto Rico” — “someone who votes for PNP doesn't love Puerto Rico.” But he also went further by publicly rejecting both major parties, who he said were jointly responsible for Puerto Rico's struggles — and instead directed fans to vote for Dalmau at the candidate's closing rally.

While González-Colón won, Dalmau more than doubled his share of the vote from the prior election and ended up in second place with 31 percent of the vote after allying with another minority party, a performance that was considered a massive step forward for the party and independence movement.

Independentistas are still fueled by momentum from their second-place election results, dissatisfaction with the federal government's lack of investment over the past decade, and, yes, Bad Bunny's album about Boricua culture and history. The rapper's breakout success and political voice have cleared a space to spread their message further — even as he steers clear of explicitly calling for independence himself.

“The political landscape in Puerto Rico is changing, regardless of what's happening in the United States,” said Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who collaborated with Ocasio on his album rollout, providing historical context and guidance to the artist. “We need to hone that, and that gives me some hope as well.”

Puerto Rican independence movements — including limited armed resistance in the 1950s on both Puerto Rican and US soil — fluctuated in their reach over the 20th century depending on the political moment, but were considered marginal until recently.

But the surge of interest in independence, while still a clear minority position, is partly seen as a story of younger voters' disillusionment with the government. Bad Bunny is a part of Puerto Rico's “crisis generation,” a cohort of Boricuas who experienced high financial fragility, austerity measures that stagnated the archipelago's economy, political corruption, natural disasters, school closings, and the effects of gentrification within a short period of time. His journey as a former grocery store bagger and university dropout to one of the world's biggest artists is directly tied to those struggles, Meléndez-Badillo, the Wisconsin professor, said.

Bad Bunny's songs frequently explore these topics. His 2019 protest track “Afilando Los Cuchillos,” with legendary Calle 13 members Residente and iLe catalogued a generational frustration with corruption, and became an anthem at mass protests against then-Gov. Ricky Rosselló — a pro-statehood official who resigned after a trove of Telegram messages leaked that were filled with inflammatory, sexist, and homophobic statements. His anthem “El Apagón” notes the pride Boricuas have amid constant blackouts, while insisting they “don't want to leave here / let them go, let them go.” Even the romantic ballad “Bokete” uses the endless, oft-unaddressed potholes found across the island's roads as metaphors for an ex-lover who should be avoided at all costs.

Questions of gaining sovereignty have also become more acute as Washington takes a bigger role in its finances. In 2016, Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) to help the archipelago tackle over $70 billion in debt. The fiscal oversight board — whose members are appointed by the US president, with no say from Puerto Ricans — quickly implemented austerity measures that critics say impacted access to social services like retirement funds and education.

Residents receive food assistance and health care through capped federal block-grant systems, which are different from the flexible funding pools awarded to the continental United States by Congress that expand to meet increased needs. Those aid dollars go significantly less far on the archipelago because the funding is fixed. Residents also face barriers to shipping through the Jones Act, which raises prices and forces dependency on US trade by requiring Puerto Rico to use American-built and -operated vessels for shipping between the two shores.

Many point to Trump's mishandling of Maria during his first term in office as a major turning point for both politics on the archipelago and trust in the US government to handle the territory's affairs. When the hurricane hit in September 2017 and caused catastrophic ruin to infrastructure and the local economy — with nearly 3,000 deaths and over $90 billion in damages — residents deemed the federal responses beyond disappointing.

One lasting image among Boricuas: Trump tossing paper towels into a crowd during a delayed visit to San Juan as millions remained without power or adequate cellular signals. Two years later, he berated Puerto Ricans for having “squandered or wasted away” their federal funding, even as locals noted much of the promised aid had not yet been disbursed.

“This all goes hand-in-hand with the natural events of Hurricane Maria, earthquake swarms,” Meléndez-Badillo said. They “were massive disasters for Puerto Rico — the hurricanes themselves are natural, but the disasters are human-made. This is all the product of the compounding colonial crises in Puerto Rico.”

Instability has caused residents to move to the US in droves over the past two decades, intensified by the debt crisis and later by Maria. The nearly 6 million diaspora members are almost double Puerto Rico's current population of 3.2 million, and the ongoing economic and social upheaval could push more to make the same decision.

All the while, Boricuas still face regular and sweeping power blackouts on an aging and damaged electrical grid, and an influx of tourists and visitors who some see as sucking up valuable real estate and resources — issues Bad Bunny regularly touches on in his songs, like “Una Velita.”

“We can't continue to depend on federal funding packages in a forum we don't even have power in — we have to beg to get $2 million to repair a highway,” Jenaro Abraham, a pro-independence professor at Gonzaga University, said. “We're depending on something that is, in and of itself, the disease. It's like when a smoker is smoking all his life, and doesn't know how to stop. They feel like they're going to get sick if they stop smoking. It's like, well, I think you should probably stop smoking.”

Independence advocates acknowledge that the process would not happen overnight. They just want the chance to try.

Their solution is simple on the surface: Supporters want to guide Puerto Rico on a series of steps in conjunction with the US, starting with a consensus vote, a lengthy transition, and terms negotiation process with Congress, all leading to eventual sovereignty over affairs.

If that sounds not so simple, you're not alone in thinking so. Critics have a number of immediate concerns.

Boricuas could lose birthright citizenship, potentially lowering their ability to travel freely with a powerful passport, an especially major concern given their close connections to large mainland communities in cities like Orlando and New York. There are also infrastructure and logistics issues. Residents would have to finance their own retirement programs, which are currently handled by Medicare and Social Security, even as residents are exempt from income taxes. Puerto Rico has more than double the poverty rate of the poorest American states in a system where many already cannot access adequate social services and face skyrocketing prices at the grocery store.

Self-sufficiency on an archipelago with a failing power grid, remote rural areas, and an agricultural industry decimated by María is still hard for many Boricuas to envision, even if they're not happy with the current level of federal support.

Some have suggested a “free association” model of independence, which would give Puerto Rico sovereignty in international relations while maintaining some federal aid and still allowing the US military access. Some former Pacific Island territories have successfully split from the US through Compacts of Free Association in recent memory — the Marshall Islands and Micronesia in 1986, and Palau in 1994 — but they have a fraction of Puerto Rico's population size and economic capacity, and are much further geographically from the mainland.

So far, independence has not been especially popular when put to voters. In six out of seven ballots on the issue since 1967, statehood has always been the majority opinion, reaching almost 59 percent in the most recent 2024 ballot. (Independence with free association garnered 29.5 percent, and independence alone just under 12 percent.) However, these polls are never conducted the same way. The 2024 vote didn't include the status quo as a choice, for example, instead only giving options presented in the House's Puerto Rico Status Act from two years prior: statehood, independence, and sovereign free association. In 2020, voters chose between a simple “yes-or-no” vote on statehood, with “yes” winning out narrowly with 52.5 percent of the vote.

Resident Commissioner Pablo José Hernández, who belongs to the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in October that Puerto Ricans' relationship with the US was similar to that of Quebecois in Canada or Catalonians in Spain — they're protective of their distinct culture and don't want to see it subsumed into the US by becoming a state.

“Then why not pursue independence?” he wrote. “Because Puerto Ricans value their US citizenship, close ties with the mainland, serving in the armed forces, and contributing to the American economy.”

Independence supporters argue the relationship is more like a colonial chain around Puerto Rico's neck.

“Sometimes there's some slack in that chain, and it's a bit loose, and it seems like Puerto Rico is not suffering too badly, or maybe has some leeway to make its own decisions,” said Alberto Medina, who leads the pro-independence Boricuas Unidos en la Diáspora's board of directors in the US. “But at any time, the US can give that chain a very powerful yank and remind Puerto Rico who's really in charge. Trump has been a prime example of some very, very painful pulls and yanks on that chain.”

For his part, Bad Bunny's stance on statehood seems clear — he does not want it. In an emotional hymn off DTMF, the artist mourns “Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii” — “what happened to Hawaii,” which became a state in 1959. (“They want to take away the river and the beach / They want my hood and for Grandma to leave / No, don't let go of the flag nor forget [our cry] / I don't want them to do to you what happened to Hawaii.”)

“Bad Bunny has done such a beautiful job of making Puerto Rico be seen.”

Independence proponents are hoping that Bad Bunny's more direct participation in the political process will lead to increased interest in the issue among his many fans both on the archipelago and on the mainland. In Puerto Rico, the rapper personally urged disaffected young people to register to vote; activists also want to focus on registered voters in the US, who could potentially influence Congress and presidential candidates.

As millions dissected the references and symbols in DTMF, more were exposed to the idea of sovereignty as a political option than before, even if such a thing remains unlikely in the current political environment — which independentistas claim as a win.

“He gives an interview tomorrow, and it's front-page news,” Medina said. “And if he says, ‘I don't want Puerto Rico to be a state' in those interviews, people who wouldn't necessarily hear that message suddenly hear it because it's Bad Bunny, so there's 1,000 media outlets writing about it. Just breaking down that silo or that disconnection that's existed sometimes between the island and the diaspora.”

Kiara Zamot, a 21-year-old university student whose parents are also part of the Puerto Rican diaspora, told me she often felt removed from her identity in a community of mostly white peers in Columbus, Ohio. But inspired by the 2024 governor's race, she became increasingly active in the independence movement — changing her career path to public policy to advocate for the cause on a wider scale — and convinced family members in Ohio and Puerto Rico to join in.

“Coming from the middle of nowhere, when people start recognizing when I say, ‘Oh, I'm from Puerto Rico,' and it's no longer, like, ‘What is it?' … I find that to be really nice,” she said. “Bad Bunny has done such a beautiful job of making Puerto Rico be seen, and not only in the tragedy of Hurricane Maria and the economy and the infrastructure, but to actually put it into this positive light that was never seen before in the media.”

Zamot is hosting a Super Bowl watch party on Sunday for Latino and non-Latino friends alike. She and other fans will be ready to shout if she sees la bandera con azul celeste, the once-suppressed 1895 light-blue version of the current flag associated with the pro-independence movement that Bad Bunny featured in the music video for “La Mudanza.”

“They killed people here for waving the flag,” he sings on that track. “That's why now I take it everywhere.”

Your pet fish — or bird, or hamster — is probably miserable.

I grew up in the Maryland suburbs and spent much of my childhood in the woods. I would turn over rocks to find shiny centipedes and watch small schools of fish glide through the creek as box turtles sunbathed on the banks. A squirrel's frenzied search for a nut would capture my full attention.

I liked these critters so much that I wanted animals around all the time. So I asked my parents to take me to the pet store — a place where many small animals, for a small price, could be mine.

Fish were my first passion, and I can still picture the aquarium store I frequented: rows of tanks holding tropical fish of unknown provenance, their lives just a couple dollars apiece. I bought a few with my allowance, and despite closely following the feeding and water quality instructions, the fish would inevitably die a few weeks or months later, and I would reliably return to the aquarium store to buy a few more.

Eventually, I moved on from fish and bought two hamsters, which was fun — until one ate the other. Hamsters are highly solitary, it turns out, and can turn cannibalistic when confined together; no pet store employee warned me.

When the other one died, I gave up on small pets, and resigned myself to observing animals in the woods. (I tried — and failed — to win the affection of our family cat, Clover, who only ever really liked my dad.)

My experience was hardly unique. Each year, American households buy tens of millions of small animals to keep as pets — mostly fish, but also gerbils, lizards, birds, snakes, frogs, turtles, and more. Many are bred in the US, but an estimated 90 million individuals are imported annually, one-third of whom are taken from the wild.

While many people have probably experienced something like I did, there's still a general sense that small pets are good — compared to cats and dogs, they take up less space, they're ostensibly easier for kids to care for, and even if they're kept in confinement, surely their lives are better than they would be in the wild. Right?

But in recent years, I've come to believe that pet ownership is much more ethically fraught than I once did, and more than most would assume. I say this as a pet owner myself. Like so many people, my partner and I adopted a dog, Evvie, early in the Covid-19 pandemic. But as the pandemic subsided, she spent more time alone, even beyond the hours we worked on our laptops and tended to the rest of our lives.

That meant less time to do her favorite things — walk around the neighborhood, run in the woods, play tug of war, and meet new people — and more time bored on the couch.

It compelled me to look more closely at the ethics of pet keeping, and eventually, I outlined those concerns in a story provocatively titled “The case against pet ownership.” I argued that beneath the warm and fuzzy narrative of a life with pets — companionship, love, and mutual affection — lies a darker side.

There are the unambiguous cruelties, like ​​physical abuse, hoarding, puppy mills, and dog fighting. Then there are the cruelties that have long been socially acceptable but are falling out of favor, like declawing and ear cropping. But there's also more casual neglect and harm that often goes unseen and unspoken: aversive training, prolonged crating, monotonous diets, lack of exercise and agency, and the ensuing boredom of captivity.

The article focused on dogs and cats, which make up the slight majority of the US pet population, but they're just part of the story. Around 40 percent of America's pets are small, largely wild or “exotic” animals — fish, birds, small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles — and they likely suffer far more than our canine and feline companions.

These animals might seem logically poised for captivity, given their typically smaller sizes and seemingly stoic dispositions. But as we learn more about their inner lives and consider the behaviors they evolved to have in the wild, the serious problems with this arrangement quickly emerge.

Think of the tropical bird caged in a city apartment, unable to fly; the Australian bearded dragon languishing in a suburban American basement under a heat lamp; the ball python native to Central and Western Africa with a diverse diet and impressive hunting finesse subsisting off one frozen-thawed rat every other week; or the countless species of fish whose miles-wide ranges in the wild are shrunk down to a couple of feet in a tank.

“I think that the welfare of these animals is worse than anybody else's,” Jessica Pierce, a bioethicist and author of several books on the ethics of pet keeping, told me. Yet pet stores, who often market these animals as starter pets for children, “really capitalize on small animals…that's where they make a lot of money.”

Other species have found strong markets in dedicated communities of adult hobbyists who share pictures and trade tips on Reddit, Facebook groups, and other forums. Given their exotic looks, the rise of shortform video content — via TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram Reels — has driven even more interest in breeding and owning them.

Even shrimp, cockroaches, giant snails, and rare isopods are kept as pets now.

I have no doubt that many of the millions of Americans who keep these animals as pets love them and go the extra mile to give them as good of a life as they can. Indeed, companionship, love, and company is a top motivator to get a small pet, according to a large survey on pet ownership. But the same survey also shows that the top motivator to acquire small pets is “fun to watch/have in household.”

It all suggests that these living arrangements might be much more about us and what we want than what animals need.

“People are happy because they have animal companions,” Pierce has written. “Animals are happy because ... well, we don't ever really ask this question. If we did, we might not like the answer.”

After working with exotic pets as a veterinarian in New York City for nearly 20 years, Alix Wilson told me she's “become a firm, strong believer that most of these animals shouldn't be pets.”

And long before they reach our homes, many of these animals are bred in neglectful conditions. A new investigation into bird breeding operations for example, shared exclusively with Vox, reveals the cruelty behind the supply of some of these pets.

Given the complexities of these animals' needs in the wild, and the inability for us to give them comparable lives in captivity, to some veterinarians, animal behaviorists, and ethicists, our massive small pet population represents a quiet, invisible crisis of animal suffering.

As a young boy in 1970s North London, Clifford Warwick developed a “stamp collector mentality” when it came to animals.

“I wanted as many different species as possible,” Warwick told me — especially reptiles and amphibians. But eventually he felt there was something wrong with his hobby because “these animals would spend so much time…trying to get out of their enclosures, and although I wasn't necessarily the smartest kid in the world, I was able to work out if something wants to get out, there's something wrong.”

When he was 14, Warwick traveled to Central and South America to see animals in the wild, and he was struck at just how hard it was to find them. The amount of space available to animals in their natural environments compared to how little space his pets had in London caused a sudden change of heart: When he got home, he gave away or sold off all of them.

He went on to earn degrees in biology, animal behavior, and medical science, and has published a wide-ranging collection of academic papers, articles, and books on the welfare of exotic pets. One thing he said to me in our conversation sums up his viewpoint: “Just because you can keep an animal captive doesn't mean you should.”

It's difficult to make sweeping generalizations about the welfare harms of keeping small animals as pets, because this group is composed of wildly different phylogenetic classes and hundreds of species, each with distinct behaviors and needs that have evolved to survive in a diversity of ecosystems. For example, think of how some of the most popular pet species live in the wild:

Despite the vast range of wild lives these animals have evolved to have, what most clearly unifies the harm of keeping all of them as pets, according to Warwick and others, is the fact that all of them will be confined in cages for nearly their entire lives.

“Control over the environment is something that all animals, including humans, need in order not to be stressed — it's a fundamental,” Warwick told me. “The way we punish people is to take away their control, i.e. we incarcerate them, and they'll do anything to get out.”

Very few pet owners would think it's fine to confine their dogs or cats in a cage, or even a whole room, for most of their lives. It shouldn't be a huge moral leap to extend that concern to smaller animals we might assume are fine with such confinement.

It especially irks Pierce, the bioethicist, that major retailers like PetSmart — which sell live animals and pet supplies — call cages and tanks for smaller animals “habitats.” “That's another part of tricky advertising,” she told me. “They are not habitats; that's a lie. But it sounds nice.”

PetSmart and its competitor Petland didn't respond to interview requests for this story, nor did Pet Advocacy Network, a pet industry lobbying group. Petco, another pet retailer, declined an interview request.

”Just because you can keep an animal captive doesn't mean you should.”

In the wild, most of these animals have ranges that span miles and miles, yet in people's homes, they're often given a few square feet in a tank. (If they're “lucky”; PetSmart even sells a half-gallon fish tank, which is about six inches wide.) Some non-aquatic animals might be given free reign of a home, and many get to spend some time outside the cage — a poor substitute for a sprawling savanna or jungle, though better than nothing. But most have little outdoor time, or none at all, out of a fear they'd fall ill, become prey, or, perhaps most reasonably, escape.

Cage confinement also deprives animals of the opportunity to engage in the range of natural behaviors for which they're evolved. One of those is hunting and foraging for food. It turns out that one of the most basic elements of caring for a pet — regularly giving them enough food — isn't so straightforward.

“We think, ‘Oh, well, it's just a kindness to give animals food for free, and they don't have to do any work,'” Pierce said. “But that's just such a profound misassumption on our part.” She pointed to research on contra-freeloading, the idea that “if given a choice between a free lunch and working for their lunch, animals will always choose to work for their lunch, except sometimes cats…” Pierce said. “And it makes sense if you think about it from an evolutionary point of view, because we have to work hard in order to get what we need to survive, so there's going to be some chemical-physiological reward for hard work.”

Some pet-critical experts will make exceptions for small pets that have largely been domesticated, reasoning that it's easier to meet the needs of species that have been habituated to humans, like rabbits and guinea pigs.

It sounds like a reasonable enough line to draw, though surveys have found that large swathes of the owners of these more domesticated small animals don't follow basic care recommendations, such as keeping rabbits in large enclosures and vaccinating them against fatal diseases, or for guinea pigs, raising the highly social animals in pairs or ensuring they have constant access to hay for proper digestion.

And Pierce argues that it's a mistake to silo “animals into wild versus domestic, and having different ethical frameworks” for them. “There's this very sneaky transition from, ‘domesticated equals comfortable around humans' to ‘domesticated equals comfortable in captivity.' And that's a very different thing.”

Other near universal welfare issues among small pets — which apply to our cats and dogs, too — include monotonous and unnatural diets, boredom, and lack of enrichment. Pierce said that handling can also be a problem, considering many small pets are cared for in part by children who may not have the proper motor skills to gently manage them.

“I think a lot of the interactions that animals experience are extremely stressful for them,” Pierce said. In other words, being stuck in a cage is bad, but being taken out can be bad too.

While some small pet owners certainly form close bonds with their animals, learn extensively about their needs, and become highly attuned to their behavior, research shows that many are unable to properly interpret their pet's behavior, notice signs of stress, or assess their health. The Internet is riddled with questionable advice and conflicting care tips, leading to what Warwick described as “folklore husbandry.”

“All the animals that were coming in with problems, they were all human-created problems,” Wilson the veterinarian said, and mentioned inadequate light and heat for reptiles and improper diets for exotic pets more broadly as examples. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, Wilson said: “Those two examples — multiply that by a thousand.”

Their needs, and their suffering, might often be overlooked because humans tend to view animals who are further from us on the evolutionary tree as less intelligent and less capable of suffering, according to a 2024 paper published in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science. As the study authors put it, this long-entrenched viewpoint likely leads to “unequal treatment of … perceived lower-evolved pets, such as reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates.”

Last year, Crystal Heath — a veterinarian and founder of the animal advocacy nonprofit Our Honor — attended the Reptile Super Show, a pet expo, in Southern California.

There, she found tables and tables of large snakes for sale in enclosures hardly bigger than restaurant takeout containers; turtles trying in vain to escape tiny bins; and lizards confined in cages barely larger than their own bodies.

She described the atmosphere to me as similar to that of a car show, where people display their rare models and custom work. (Reptile Super Show didn't respond to an interview request.)

Pet stores can have a similar feel and experience, with animals on display in a fashion not all that different from Victorian-era curio collections, just with live specimens instead of dead ones.

“If I go back to my own experience…there's a general sort of fascination with wildlife,” Warwick said about exotic pet owners. “I think that underpins the drive for many, and I see that as perfectly healthy. The problem is it can go very wrong.”

Spend enough time reading pet subreddits and pet ownership surveys, and you'll see how things can go awry: cage escapes, bites, unpleasant odors, self-mutilation, and excessive noise (birds can get especially loud, and many smaller pets are nocturnal or crepuscular). It's not unusual for children who once clamored for a snake or a bird to lose interest in their new pets, and lots of owners are unable or unwilling to take care of long-lived species, like parrots and turtles, for the full length of their lives, which results in difficult rehoming.

“Inevitably, the situation for the owner changes over time,” for long-lived species, Wilson, the veterinarian, said. “They get old or they get divorced, or they have a kid or they get sick, and they can't care for that animal anymore…and there are very few resources for rehoming exotic pets.”

Some people don't get what they expected in the animal they've bought.

Karen Windsor is the executive director of Foster Parrots and the New England Exotic Wildlife Sanctuary, a Rhode Island-based bird and exotic pet sanctuary, and knows this all too well. Windsor told me that on social media people see “that really smart African Gray who can practically have a conversation with you,” and they want one. But after acquiring their parrots, people might quickly learn that some parrots don't talk at all, and many are not cuddly and don't want to be handled. That results in disappointed parrot owners trying to dump their birds on organizations like hers, but the inflow of unwanted parrots is far too great for them to take in.

Some desperate pet owners even abandon their animals in the wild, where they are either poorly adapted to survive or far too well adapted and can wreak havoc on local ecosystems.

Occasionally, Reddit users share soul-searching posts about their ethical concerns of keeping small pets. Some fellow pet owners respond with similar feelings of unease, but most say that as long as they provide their animal with food, water, enrichment, a clean cage, and other basics, they should feel good about it — that they're giving them a better life than they would if they were in the wild.

It's a curious response, because the choice isn't whether someone should keep that animal in their home or toss them out into the wild; it's whether that animal should've been bred into existence (or taken from the wild) only to live their life in such intensive, unnatural captivity.

Each year, the US imports on average more than 90 million animals — mostly on the smaller side — to keep as pets, according to a new analysis using federal government data by the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. Around 30 percent of them are taken directly from the wild, and many of these are species that are threatened or even endangered. Their trading is facilitated by animal laundering schemes, weak US trade restrictions, and insufficient funding to enforce US wildlife laws.

“Wildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,” the organization said in its report. And most of these animals who are taken from the wild never even make it into people's homes.

In 2009, a PETA investigator worked undercover at a major exotic pet importer in Texas and documented shocking conditions, including tree frogs packed and shipped in 2-liter soda bottles and snakes deprived of food for months. At the time, PETA alleged, the company was a supplier to Petco, PetSmart, and an accredited aquarium.

PETA turned its evidence over to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which seized 26,400 animals from the company.

In a peer-reviewed analysis of the the company's records in the aftermath of the seizure, experts found that, typically, 72 percent of its animals would die during a six week period — equaling hundreds per day — from cannibalism, dehydration, starvation, crushing, disease, injury, and a range of other problems. It may seem like an abnormally high mortality rate, but in judicial proceedings against the company, it cited an expert who confirmed its mortality rate was similar to the rest of the industry's.

But even animals bred in captivity in the US are hardly safe. Facilities that breed fish, reptiles, and amphibians aren't subject to US Department of Agriculture oversight, and while those that breed birds and small mammals, including rabbits and chinchillas, do face some oversight, there are plenty of loopholes, and USDA enforcement is notoriously weak.

PETA, for example, has also exposed horrific conditions at some of these large-scale facilities that breed bearded dragons, various reptiles, rats, and numerous other species. And a new investigation, published today in Vox, highlights the cruelty involved in the pet bird breeding business.

Exotic pet breeders have also flocked to social media, where a cottage industry of breeding influencers walk viewers through their operations and how they, too, can get into the biz. Their facilities as they present them often appear much cleaner compared to what has been found in undercover exposés, but they engage in the most troubling aspect of high-volume pet breeding all the same: confining hundreds to thousands of wild animals in small cages.

It is, of course, out of the question to throw America's tens of millions of small pets out into the wild, where most would surely perish.

The best option for these animals already in our homes is to give them the best lives possible. Build large, complex tank environments, provide enrichment, feed them appropriate diets, learn about their needs and behavior, and follow their lead when it comes to handling, interaction, and time out of the cage or outdoors.

But to shape a better future, I think it's time we wind down the mass, factory-style breeding of small pets — and certainly end their capture from the wild. I think it is plainly unethical to prioritize our need for companionship, our feeling that animals are nice or pretty to have around, or our desire to teach children responsibility over the undeniable fact of these animals' suffering.

Pet stores could — at minimum — stop selling especially small cages and tanks, stop advertising any animal as a low-maintenance pet, and require new pet owners to take classes to learn the basics of good pet care and how to read their animals' behavior, given how much experts cite a lack of species-specific knowledge as a root cause of poor welfare.

Austria has gone so far as to mandate such courses, while Sweden requires that guinea pigs — because they're highly social — be kept in pairs or groups (Switzerland goes further and includes parrots and other highly social species in a similar law).

Other policy actions could help, too.

The federal government should crack down on the illegal exotic pet trade, and the USDA ought to significantly step up its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, which covers some animal breeding operations. And Congress should amend this law so all pet breeders are subject to inspection; currently, a number of exemptions result in an untold number of animals being bred essentially without any oversight.

Already, hundreds of jurisdictions have banned the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, and some have banned rabbit sales, too. In light of their own investigation into bird mills, the animal advocacy nonprofit World Animal Protection is pushing for New York City to expand its pet retail ban to include birds.

A dozen European countries have developed short lists of species that are allowed to be kept as pets — what are called “positive” lists — which, by default, prohibit owning any species not on the list. The European Union is considering a continent-wide positive list.

For now, the law of supply and demand is perhaps the strongest law that can be exercised to help small pets in the US; people who have their hearts set on owning a particular species should adopt instead of shop. That'll be hard, because animal shelters aren't necessarily overrun with orphaned chinchillas, ferrets, fish, and snakes, but there are some available on popular pet adoption sites and through specialized rescue organizations.

Ultimately, though, I think we need a fundamental shift in how we view animals. I know this shift is possible, because I've undergone it. I think back to my younger self, who expressed his love for animals through a pursuit of possessing them — subjecting them to confinement for my pleasure.

In time, I came to express that love by giving my time and money to organizations that protect animals and their habitats, instead of to pet stores and breeders. I learned about animals through books; documentaries; and most importantly, time in nature.

Two decades later, that's still how I get my fill. I'm fortunate enough to live a short drive from a trail system that winds through deciduous forests, and a few times a week, I take long walks as I did when I was a child. I still regularly spot turtles, fish, squirrels, and centipedes, and if I'm lucky, I might see a toad or a heron. They're living life on their own terms, which, ultimately, is far more satisfying for me to witness than watching them from the other side of a cage.

The athletes, events and simmering geopolitical crises that we're watching at this year's competition.

This story appeared in Today, Explained, a daily newsletter that helps you understand the most compelling news and stories of the day. Subscribe here.

Vox loves the Olympics. Absolutely loves them. We briefly debated popping up a limited-run Winter Olympics newsletter this week, but then remembered that we are not in fact a sports site and have no actual sports reporters on staff.

No matter! The Olympics are fun (and, occasionally, inspiring and heartbreaking and anxious and weird) because they touch a wide range of human interests, from geopolitics to climate to celebrity and culture. And in that spirit, I've polled my colleagues and poked my head into a few planning sessions to see what Olympics storylines everyone is watching.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

In today's edition, we round up the interesting characters, open questions, and emerging trends that could define the Milan Cortina Games, from the debut of skimo (fascinating! fun!) to the complicated moral calculus of rooting for Team USA right now (nuanced, uncomfortable, in short: a bummer).

The whole shebang officially kicks off this afternoon at 2 pm ET, with a primetime broadcast at 8 pm. You can absolutely bet that I and many others at Vox will be tuning in.

Are we the baddies? I think it's going to be fascinating to see how American fans react to, well, being global villains. I think it could be particularly interesting around Olympic hockey. Probably the most famous moment of American underdogness — at least since the American Revolution — was the 1980 Olympics hockey win. The Americans and the Canadians are the top rivals in Olympic hockey, and these Games will be intense. We're not plucky underdogs — the US team probably has the second-best chance at the gold after Canada — and we will not be the crowd favorite. What's that going to feel like? —Bryan Walsh

Skimo. I'm still rooting for the Winter Olympics to add two of my favorite sports — cross-country running and cyclocross bike racing, both of which are great in the snow — but for now, I'm plenty excited about the new sport we did get: skimo, or ski mountaineering. As the name suggests, it involves summiting a climb (partially with skis, partially without) and then tearing back down it. Athletes have to transition between phases along the way, triathlon-style, and it looks thrilling. —Cameron Peters 

Ilia Malinin. Twenty-one-year-old figure skater Ilia Malinin is competing in his first Olympics this year, but he's already broken a ton of records. In 2022, he became the first (and still only) skater to land a fully rotated quadruple axel in international competition, and in December, he landed a record seven quadruple jumps in a single program. In other words, Malinin is a mind-bogglingly aggressive, physical skater — The Atlantic dubbed him “the man who broke physics” — and his programs will be really fun to watch when they kick off this weekend. —Caitlin Dewey 

A figure skater's tragic backstory. Maxim Naumov is a member of the US Olympic figure skating team whose parents — world champions in skating themselves — were among the 67 people killed when an American Airlines plane and a helicopter collided over the Potomac River in Washington, DC, last January. As much as the plane crash affected DC, it was even more devastating for the figure skating community, which lost 28 parents, skaters, alumni, volunteers, and more. It's hard not to root for Naumov in the aftermath of such sadness. —Libby Nelson

US immigration agents. The Department of Homeland Security often has a presence at the Olympic Games, providing security services and monitoring criminal activity. But the news that some ICE agents would deploy to Milan has sparked outrage and protests in Italy. Milan's governor called ICE “a militia that kills” and said “they are not welcome” in his city. —CD

Possible political demonstrations. Hundreds of athletes competing in Milan hail from one of the world's most politically volatile nations: the United States of America. As Vox's Alex Abad-Santos has written, American athletes are bound to face questions about representing the nation of Donald Trump. It seems likely that some US Olympians, many of whom are immigrants or the children of immigrants, will speak out against ICE; I will be watching to see who does and what they say. At last year's Four Nations men's hockey tournament, pro-MAGA and anti-Trump sentiment colored the US-Canada final, with Trump himself calling the men's team and raising the tempers of Canadian players and fans with his calls to annex what he was calling “the 51st state.” —Seth Maxon

…and not just from Team USA. There are four Israelis competing at these Games who may face protests or become fulcrums of controversy. And there are Ukrainians, “unaffiliated” athletes from Russia, a couple of Iranians, and even a Venezuelan cross-country skier competing. Whether any of them speak up or are confronted about their nations' turmoil will be worth watching out for. —SM

Winter weather. Many Winter Olympic events hinge on ideal outdoor snow and ice conditions that are becoming harder to achieve as the planet warms up. The IOC said they are now considering moving the Winter Games earlier in the year to chase the cold weather. On the other hand, some of the early ski sessions for the current Games were canceled due to too much snow. —Umair Irfan 

Milo and Tina. I don't think any Olympic mascots will ever top Paris's anthropomorphic hats, but keep an eye out for the scarf-wearing, short-haired weasels that organizers have called the Games' “first openly Gen Z” representatives. The open Gen Z-ness relates to their backstories (Milo and Tina are reportedly teenagers) and their design origins (Italy invited primary and secondary school students to submit mascot proposals). —CD 

Alysa Liu. Not only is 20-year-old figure skater Alysa Liu competing on the biggest stage in the world after a nearly two-year hiatus from the sport, but Liu told her coaches that she wanted to design her own costumes and skate to her choice of music. So far, that's involved a lot of Lady Gaga, a smiley piercing, and halo-striped hair. I can't wait to see what she and the rest of the US figure skating team accomplish. —Sydney Bergen

Macklin Celebrini. The term “generational talent” gets tossed around a lot when hockey watchers talk about the 19-year-old forward from Vancouver. He's made a stagnant, struggling team (my team, the San Jose Sharks) competitive once again. Celebrini is set to become the youngest player to represent Canada in a Winter Olympics featuring players from the National Hockey League — where he'll play alongside NHL icons like Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon, and Connor McDavid. Celebrini has been a fascinating player to watch when an entire team relies on him, so I can't imagine what he can accomplish when he's playing alongside his sport's biggest stars. —Christian Paz

Lindsey Vonn. The 41-year-old American skier completely ruptured her ACL in a fall last week, but has insisted that she'll compete in her fifth Winter Games despite the (severe and debilitating!) injury. If she competes as planned, Vonn will be the oldest female Alpine skier in Olympic history. As a person around Vonn's age, and as the owner of a fully reconstructed ACL, I am both vaguely horrified for Vonn and very invested in her competition. —CD 

Chloe Kim. The American snowboarding superstar suffered a shoulder injury in early January that has prevented her from training in the weeks that have followed. Thankfully, she has recovered enough to still compete. But is she still in top form and able to contend for gold as expected? I hope so! Either way, I'm sure NBC and Peacock are already preparing their scripts about how much adversity she's overcome to get back on the podium. —SM

Laila Edwards. The 22-year-old senior at the University of Wisconsin made history in Italy by just being there: Edwards is the first Black woman to play for the US women's Olympic hockey team. And thanks to a successful GoFundMe campaign — which included a donation from the Kelce brothers, who are from her hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio — Edwards's parents and other family members have made the trip to Milan as well. —Esther Gim

Eileen Gu. A breakout star at the 2022 Olympics is back to compete in freestyle skiing. At the last Games, she ignited debate in both the US and China as an American who chose to compete for China, her mother's home country. But the controversy hardly hurt her success; she's become a huge celebrity in China with millions of dollars in endorsement deals, and she won three medals, including two golds, in Beijing. She's only 22 years old and is gearing up for even more success, and stardom, in Milan. —SM

Giorgia Meloni. Italy's first woman prime minister already occupies an odd place on the world stage: She's a right-wing populist who enjoys a close relationship with President Donald Trump and his administration… but she's also, obviously, a European leader who's had to grapple with Trump's attacks on the continent. The Olympics, Italy's first since 2006, will put her in the global spotlight once again. (That, and a comically Italian scandal wherein a partisan art restorer snuck Meloni's face into a church fresco.) —CD 

Cultural initiatives. Alongside the athletic events, Italy is hosting a nationwide Cultural Olympiad with exhibitions, theater and music performances, artist installations, festivals, and workshops. Los Angeles should be watching closely, as local officials are concerned that the city is way behind on planning and fundraising for arts programming for the 2028 Games. Can LA showcase itself as an entertainment mecca and a capital of cultural diversity, as it did when it last hosted the Games in 1984? The clock is ticking. —Avishay Artsy

Greening the Games. Remember during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris when organizers were getting heat for how they approached “greening” the competition? At the time, organizers focused on nudging behavioral choices, such as defaulting toward climate-friendly foods (read: no meat) or no AC, which wasn't popular. So I was excited to hear that this year's Winter Olympics focused its energy on the actual construction of the Milano Cortina Olympic Village instead. According to the architects behind the project, the village employs a modular design made with low-carbon construction methods and prefabricated facade panels. It might be a model for future Games. —Izzie Ramirez

“The battle of millimeters.” Last month, a cheating scandal rocked the ski-jumping world when three staff members on the Norwegian team were suspended for modifying the crotches of the outfits of two jumpers, including the reigning Olympic champion. In sports like ski jumping, small changes like extra stitching can have big aerodynamic impacts — part of what one ski jumping enthusiast described to The Athletic as “the battle of millimeters.” We'll see what that means for Norway's athletes in these Olympics. —Cameron Peters

Olympic muffins. The best TikToks from the Olympic Village have nothing to do with sport: They're the clips of globe-trotting, carb-loading, world-class athletes reviewing mid-range cafeteria food. Chocolate muffins stole the show in Paris. (Can confirm: These muffins are good.) And while the Milan Cortina Games have yet to produce a breakout foodstuff, the torta della nonna looks like a contender. —CD 

The Minions guy. Spanish figure skater Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaté is not expected to medal at this year's Games, but he's already a winner in one regard: He triumphed over film production company Universal Pictures in a petty, comical dispute the internet dubbed #Minionsgate. Sabaté, who skates to music from the Minions movies, was briefly blocked from using his signature soundtrack over copyright concerns, which the Olympics have taken much more seriously since a 2022 lawsuit. —CD 

AI music on ice. Figure skating is trying to stay relevant by encouraging figure skaters to make contemporary music choices: classical music out, pop bangers in. But it's led to a music licensing nightmare in the sport, as Minion Guy found out the hard way. Some skaters are turning to an ethically dubious solution: AI music, which avoids expensive fees and prolonged negotiations. As AI slop hits Spotify playlists and Billboard charts, will things get sloppy on the ice too? We'll be watching, er, listening to see. —Peter Balonon-Rosen

New sports tech. Gymnastics judges for the 2024 Paris Games got a leg up from a novel tool: an AI system that could automatically capture, model, and evaluate athletes' movements against standard parameters. AI tools will also be in use at the Milan Cortina Games, where they'll do things like capture the height, length, and air time of figure skaters' jumps. A number of teams have also enthusiastically embraced AI-informed training… though only time will tell if that gives them the edge that some have claimed. —CD 

NHL stars. Men's hockey will be a particularly splashy event this year: It's the first year in more than a decade that the National Hockey League has allowed its players to participate in the Games. And following the breakout success of the Canadian gay sports romance series Heated Rivalry, there'll be a new audience of fans and casual viewers that will be tuning in. (Thank you, Shane Hollander!) —Christian Paz

The rise of sports betting. This year's Olympics arguably mark the first event since prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket became a mainstream phenomenon. Already, Polymarket users have traded millions of dollars' worth of bets on individual competitions and overall medal counts. Notably, the Milan Cortina Games come just as these platforms face a wave of new scrutiny related to sports cheating scandals. —CD 

Health and wellness. It's increasingly hard to believe that, a mere five years ago, the Tokyo Olympics mandated masking, social distancing, and other Covid protocols. Now, most Olympic athletes don't even mask routinely during travel. Personally, I'd be so stressed about illness. Imagine how awful it would be to get sick while sharing a tiny dorm room with your teammates or not feeling 100 percent healthy during the biggest moment of your career. Organizers already had to push the women's hockey game between Canada and Finland because of a norovirus outbreak. —Lauren Katz

The gold medal favorite is on track to make Olympic history in Milan. The scary part? He could still get even better.

Figure skating is nothing without tension. Humans speed across slick ice, balancing on a thin metal blade and making sharp turns. The athletes defy physics, jumping and twisting their bodies in the air, seemingly faster than you can blink. Millimeters can mean the difference between success and splat, risk goes hand in hand with reward, and winning or losing can come down to decimal points.

The paradox of watching American Ilia Malinin skate is that he's so good, there often isn't any suspense. He lands the most difficult jumps. He breaks scoring records left and right. And when he skates his best, the only real question is who is getting second place.

The 21-year-old “quad god” has become a staggering, intimidating constant.

Malinin's astonishing jumping ability and his vaunted quadruple axel make him the heavy favorite to take home gold at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics. Malinin is already changing the way we think about figure skating in the US and what is believed to be possible within the sport. If he wins, it would be a historic achievement.

And the one staggering thing to keep in mind watching Ilia Malinin in these Olympics? He could get even better.

Whether you're a fan of figure skating or not, you are probably aware of the sport's most famous jump: the triple axel, a three-and-a-half revolution trick that has immortalized and haunted so many routines in Olympic history.

Canadian Vern Taylor became the first person to land it in international competition in 1978, and many attempted and then perfected the jump in the decades that followed. The axel is considered the most difficult of all the jumps across skating's four levels, mainly because of its extra half revolution and its forward-facing takeoff. (Skaters launch themselves back-first in all the other jumps, which is considered easier, and why a triple lutz is less difficult and thus worth fewer points than a triple axel.)

As time went on, skaters began adding more and more turns to the sport's other five jumps — flip, loop, lutz, toe loop, salchow — but adding an additional revolution to the axel seemed too difficult.

Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, arguably the greatest figure skater of all time, attempted a quad axel at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, but did not land it. Perhaps the human body simply wasn't made to jump that high, spin that fast, absorb that much torque, all while carving through ice.

Forty-four years later after Taylor's first triple axel and months after Hanyu's Olympic try at a quad, Ilia Malinin did the impossible.

Malinin, then 17, landed the first quadruple axel in history — the International Skating Union only counts jumps if they're landed in a competition — about 22 seconds into his long program at Skate America in Norwood, Massachusetts. Malinin has only lost one major competition since that 2022 season, coming in second at the 2023 Grand Prix de France.

If someone could explain exactly why it is that Malinin is able to hit the quadruple axel when no one else can, they'd have the entire skating world knocking on their door, pulling up in armored trucks filled to the brim with money. Generational athletes — Serena Williams, Michael Phelps, LeBron James, and Malinin — are the greatest because they can do things that we can't fully explain.

Figure skating experts told me that Malinin is a master technician, which allows him to maximize the height and rotation on his jumps. Meanwhile, scientists have studied Malinin's quad axel and believe the secret is that he jumps higher vertically on it compared to his peers' triple axels. The stuff that physics still can't explain is Malinin magic.

“It is a differentiator,” Jackie Wong, a skating journalist, analyst, and founder of the website Rocker Skating, told Vox right before flying to Milan, where he's covering the 2026 Games. “It is something that allows Ilia to build up such a huge advantage that he can win competitions by a massive number of points over the best skaters in the world.”

“The amazing thing about Ilia is that he puts this really hard stuff out there and executes it.” 

The way skating is currently scored puts a high value on and ultimately rewards risk. The trickiest elements of a program are worth the most points. The more you land and the better that you land them, the higher the score. And there is nothing in men's skating that is trickier or worth more than Malinin's quad axel. (I say it's his because he's still the only person in the universe that can land it.)

“We've seen skaters in the past who have done the risk and reward thing and put out a whole bunch of hard stuff, but then they don't land it,” Wong said. “The amazing thing about Ilia is that he puts this really hard stuff out there and executes it.”

I asked Wong to compare Malinin's talent to other star athletes. Is he the Steph Curry or Caitlin Clark of figure skating? Wong said no, because even though only a few players can shoot from the distance they do, basketball doesn't allow Curry and Clark to score more than three points at a time. Wong finally settled on one example, with a few caveats: Simone Biles, arguably the greatest American athlete of all time.

To be clear, Wong said, Biles's dominance over gymnastics cannot be compared or replicated. Her superiority and longevity is singular. But Malinin, like Biles, is doing things that no other competitor can do and hitting these elements — potentially seven quadruple jumps in his long program — at a consistent clip. Malinin, like Biles, has taken a sport that's judged to the decimal point and turned competitions into blowouts. At the 2025 World Championships, Malinin outscored world silver medalist Mikhail Shaidorov by more than 31 points.

“He's lost, I think, one competition in the last three years,” Wong said. “In figure skating, that's pretty rare.”

Malinin and his quad axel have the chance to do something special in Milan: If he wins, it will be the first time since 1988 that the United States will have won gold in men's figure skating in consecutive Olympics Games.

Malinin may also symbolize what skating experts see as not only the US's return to dominance, but a paradigm shift for the next generation of American skaters.

After Scott Hamilton's win in 1984 and Brian Boitano's dazzling performance in '88, the US men went through a gold medal drought. Evan Lysacek won in 2010, but that was largely considered an upset. After Lysacek, the US wouldn't get on top of the podium again until Nathan Chen in 2022.

Chen landed five quadruple jumps on his way to victory — a feat considered staggering at the time. Chen didn't just eke by the competition; he won by more than 20 points. Malinin, who was not selected for those Games, was paying attention, according to Justin Dillon, the US Figure Skating's chief of high performance.

“When we have an athlete in a discipline to look up to, all of the young athletes that watch the Olympics think, ‘I can do that too,'” Dillon told Vox. “Ilia watching Nathan makes Ilia possible, and then the next generation watching Ilia makes them possible.”

Dillon and other experts I spoke to said that having a talent like Chen immediately followed by one like Malinin is a figure skating anomaly. Both Chen and Malinin are considered generational athletes, and the US having both athletes as favorites in consecutive Olympics is akin to winning the lottery.

Even if US Figure Skating doesn't find Malinin's successor during the next quadrennial, the fact that a new generation will be watching him at these Games helps broaden the pool of potential skaters — athletes that Dillon and US Figure Skating want to cultivate and grow.

Before taking on his current role, Dillon was hired as US Figure Skating's development director in 2016. He was tasked with spotting young talent, a space that Dillon says “never really existed” in the federation. Dillon traveled across the US and scouted juniors, looking for strong skaters that the US could develop. Several members of the 2026 US Olympic figure skating team, including Malinin, Alysa Liu, and Isabeau Levito, are athletes he saw on the trail.

I asked Dillon what US Figure Skating is looking for when trying to identify the next Chen or Malinin. The key, he said, is finding kids who can quickly rotate in the air. The speed of their rotations — more than the height of their jumps — is the skill that most directly translates to quadruple jumps at the next level.

The idea that he could get even better might, for the first time in quite a while, inject real tension in Malinin's skating.

“Quads are usually developed in the teenage years, and you need to identify the talent before that age,” Dillon said. “Eight, nine, and 10 years old — pretty much around that age.”

Yes, that means spotting potential quad jumpers when they're third- and fourth-graders. It's a good strategy to develop talent, and it's a departure from how things may have been done in previous eras. But Wong, the skating analyst, noted that the kids who are now doing quad jumps in juniors aren't inherently more talented than their forebears. “It's that they were prepared to do these jumps at a much earlier age,” he says.

Quads dictate scores, which dictate medals, which then dictates the kinds of training and development that figure skating federations are employing.

“Once those dominoes were set, all of the coaching techniques, how you think about young skaters, and what you prepare them for — all of that changed,” Wong said. “It's a whole chain effect. It didn't happen overnight.”

The conventional wisdom of figure skating is that there will always be tension between athleticism and artistry — that the more that the sport values one, the less care will be paid to the other. And it makes sense that the more points quadruple jumps are worth, the more skaters will focus on them as opposed to layback spins or spirals.

But Malinin is so good, he doesn't necessarily have to choose. He has the potential to be both a master technician and a wonderful artist. It's probably not a coincidence that Malinin cites Hanyu Yuzuru as his inspiration. What made Hanyu so special was that he was able to blend artistry — the shapes he created with his body, the position of his arms and legs, his connection to the music, creating beauty in between the jumps, his step sequences, etc. — with sheer athleticism.

Sandra Bezic, a Canadian champion pairs skater and choreographer, believes Malinin has a desire to get better at all facets of the sport, not just the quads.

“He's such a charismatic performer. He cares about his connection to the audience. He cares about his music. He cares about his choreography,” she told Vox. “We're all a little blinded by his incredible jumps, the multiple quads.” But she believes it's worth keeping an eye on his artistry too, especially as he gets older. “From what I've observed, I think he's excited to continue to develop in that way.”

“You can't be an artist without living,” Bezic said, noting that, at 21, Malinin is still young. (Hanyu was 19 when he won his first Olympics.) “You have to live. You have to experience life and loss and love. You can have innate qualities and feel the music and have that in you, but you won't reach your potential until you've lived.”

That there's still more for Malinin to learn and untapped potential left for him to fulfill is wild to think about. During the past three years, he's made the sport's most difficult tricks look routine and turned competitions into coronations. The idea that he could get even better might, for the first time in quite a while, inject real tension in Malinin's skating.

An exclusive investigation uncovers the hidden suffering behind the pet bird industry.

Statistically speaking, a lot of your neighbors probably have a dog or cat. But there's a decent chance that there are at least a few parrots in your neighborhood, too: About one in 20 US households owns at least one pet bird.

There's the popular parakeet, a small parrot native to Australia and other regions south of the equator; there are the cockatiels, who appear to have perpetual bed-head, with a tuft of feathers springing from their forehead; and a diverse cast of other parrot species: macaws, lovebirds, amazons, conures, African Greys, cockatoos, and many more.

Some 13 million birds are kept as pets in the United States, making them the fourth most popular type of pet and a sizable share of the broader exotic pet market, which also includes fish, lizards, snakes, chinchillas, and frogs. Cats and dogs may get most of the attention, but these smaller, more wild animals account for around 40 percent of the US pet population.

As cute as they may be, however, a number of animal behaviorists, veterinarians, and ethicists are challenging the practice of keeping these smaller species as pets.

For one, they're largely wild, undomesticated animals, who've evolved to thrive in rich and often vast habitats in nature. But as pets, they spend all or most of their life confined in a small cage or tank. Add to that the fact that owners often aren't well equipped to provide the enrichment and individualized care these animals need, and keeping them as pets becomes much more ethically thorny than it otherwise might appear.

The harms of bird ownership stand out the most, if only for the stark reason that in captivity, pet birds can't do what millions of years of evolution has propelled them to do: fly. And given their advanced cognitive capacities, captivity is likely particularly stressful for them — and exacerbated when kept alone, considering that many are highly social.

Liz Cabrera Holtz of the animal advocacy nonprofit World Animal Protection put it bluntly: ”These are wild animals whose physical and psychological needs are not even close to being met.”

But even before they're bought as pets, the business of bringing the majority of these animals into the world often involves serious harm and neglect. A new investigation suggests that this might be common when they come from “bird mills” — high-volume, large-scale operations that breed birds for the retail pet market.

Last year, a prolific animal cruelty investigator who goes by the pseudonym Pete Paxton, due to the clandestine nature of his work, toured and covertly filmed several US bird mills and shared his investigation exclusively with Vox. He found dirty conditions, thousands of birds stuffed in cages, and alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act, a federal law that sets minimum welfare standards for some of the pet breeding industry.

Over the course of his career, Paxton has investigated some 300 factory farms and slaughterhouses, and more than 1,000 puppy mills. He has seen animals beaten, starved, hanged, and shocked. Even so, he was still surprised by what he saw in the bird breeding operations. “I did not expect it to be as bad as it was,” Paxton told me about his new investigation, which is one of the first such exposés of the industry that supplies pet birds to millions of American homes.

Paxton's investigation began last spring in South Texas, just 20 miles north of the Mexico border. He was there to visit a bird breeding operation called Fancy Parrots, which has more than 3,000 parrots of various species on site, including African Greys, macaws, and cockatoos, locked in rusting cages across 17 barns. (The descriptions of Fancy Parrots and the other facilities below come from Paxton's investigation video.)

It was “very loud — lots of birds calling out to us,” Paxton said, comparing them to puppy mills he's visited, the air full of bird screeches instead of dog barks.

On a tour of the facility, Paxton was told that a few years ago, some 20 birds died during a cold snap. The barns each had a roof but no sides, which meant they could get some fresh air and sunlight, but it also meant they were vulnerable to weather extremes not found in their native habitats.

Some of the birds had plucked some of their feathers out, which Alix Wilson, an exotic pet veterinarian, told me is abnormal. “Birds in their natural environment wouldn't do that because their feathers are so vital for survival,” Wilson said.

The reasons for feather-plucking are often behavioral in nature, Wilson said, due to boredom, stress, or sexual frustration from the inability to mate, though it can also be brought on by disease or poor diet, according to UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.

At bird mills, larger parrots are caged as mating pairs, and parakeets are caged in groups. The birds first mate in the spring, and a week or so after mating, the female will lay a clutch of about two to six eggs. The eggs of larger parrots are typically taken away and placed in artificial incubators, which can trigger the females to lay more eggs. After the chicks hatch, they're reared either by humans or adult parrots.

Eventually, the juvenile birds are sold, usually at a few months of age, for hundreds to thousands of dollars each.

About two decades ago, Wilson briefly worked at a parrot mill. “I quickly became aware of the issues of just confining these animals and just basically breeding [them] for profit,” Wilson told me. Those issues included fighting, which resulted in wounds and missing eyes and toes; resource-guarding (some birds keeping other birds away from food); parent-chick separation, either immediately after birth or post-weaning; and cramming birds into crates for long-distance transportation to pet stores.

Bird breeders are legally required to provide enrichment for their birds, such as perches, swings, mirrors, and other objects the birds can manipulate to express natural behaviors. Fancy Parrots does provide perches, but when Paxton asked about other enrichment, he was told that the US Department of Agriculture “wanted toys in all the cages; how stupid.” They had suggested to the USDA inspector that they could give the parrots bamboo, which the birds like to chew on, though Paxton didn't see any.

Fancy Parrots declined an interview request for this story.

During the tour, Paxton was told that Fancy Parrots supplies to a “Petco distributor.” Petco declined an interview request for this story, though a spokesperson said over email that “Fancy Parrots is not nor has ever been a Petco vendor.”

This may be true. But it is also possible Petco does sell birds from Fancy Parrots, which underscores a major issue in tracking exotic pets in the United States.

Breeders typically don't market their juvenile birds directly to large retailers like Petco. Instead, the animals first get purchased by intermediary operations called brokers. The “Petco distributor” could well be a broker that Fancy Parrots sells to, which then sells to Petco. (Petco did not respond to follow-up questions about whether it might indirectly source birds, via a broker, from Fancy Parrots.)

Months after visiting Fancy Parrots, Paxton headed to Central Oklahoma, where he toured a massive parakeet breeding operation about 70 miles east of downtown Oklahoma City owned by a family named the Pletts. There, he found rows and rows of tiny cages stacked atop one another, each packed with birds, totaling some 7,500 animals. Some of the cages were caked in feces.

The parakeet mill, he said, reminded him of egg-producing operations, where chickens are crammed into stacked cages — “factory farm-like,” Paxton said.

Paxton documented a pile of dead parakeets and severed body parts in a trash can, including one dead bird placed headfirst into a red Solo cup.

One of the owners is heard saying on the video that some birds peck at each other, which causes injuries, and he can't sell the ones that are pecked at. These ones are killed, the man explains, by suffocating them in bags.

“There are always some dead,” the man is heard saying. “Always.”

The owner of the facility didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview.

Paxton visited another parakeet breeder in Oklahoma, some 60 miles farther east, run by relatives of the Pletts. The operation had two barns holding 1,500 birds total. In one barn, the birds allegedly had no perches or enrichment of any kind, which are required by the Animal Welfare Act. Paxton also found several dead, featherless chicks decomposing atop cages.

“Both facilities were filthy, with every surface I could see being dusty, dirty, and in some cases piled with manure and old feed,” Paxton said.

In 2024, an inspector with the USDA, which enforces the Animal Welfare Act, found at least six birds at the operation showed signs of heat stress, after the barn temperature had reached 93.4 degrees Fahrenheit with a heat index of 110.7. At the time, they also found at least six dead birds.

The USDA classified it as a “direct” violation of the Animal Welfare Act, but only issued an official warning — which amounts to a slap on the wrist — rather than a license suspension or even a nominal fine.

When reached by phone, one of the owners of the operation answered but did not respond to requests for comment.

As terrible as the conditions were, they may well be typical of how most soon-to-be pet birds are reared in the US, rather than exceptions.

“These bird mills I filmed are not outliers,” Paxton said in his investigation video. “All of the places that I went to are USDA-licensed, government regulated. Essentially, these places are operating legally and [largely] in compliance, so when it comes to bird mills…that's as good as a place can get.”

Paxton investigated the bird mills on behalf of the nonprofits World Animal Protection and Strategies for Ethical and Environmental Development. (Disclosure: In 2024, my partner worked on a short-term consulting project for the latter group.)

Beyond captive breeding, some birds that wind up in US homes have been taken directly from the wild, according to a new analysis by the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity using federal government data. From 2016 to 2024, the US imported more than 37,000 birds on average each year, with 5 percent of them — 1,865 birds — plucked from the wild. It's a small share, but the true number could well be much higher, as it's not uncommon in the exotic pet trade for importers to launder wild-caught animals through captive-bred operations and mislabel them.

It's unknown how many birds are captive-bred in the US, as neither the pet industry nor the federal government publish data on pet breeding.

Paxton's investigation reveals a paradox in the exotic pet trade. Surveys show that people buy parrots in large part because they're “fun to watch” and have at home, given their exotic looks, intelligence, sociability, and some species' capability for human-like speech. But parrot owners are also highly motivated, surveys show, to buy a bird for companionship, love, and affection. And yet, they're bought from businesses that frequently treat them with just the opposite.

Even if pet owners have the best of intentions, some of the same welfare issues found at breeders persist when the birds are taken home. The most pressing and obvious one is captivity, as it puts the animals in an unnatural environment and prevents them from engaging in basic natural behaviors.

“The cages in the [investigation] video — that's the same size cage that people put a bird in in their house,” Wilson, the veterinarian, said. Some birds may be kept in bigger cages — and many are provided with a fair amount of time outside their cage, or even free reign of a room or entire home — but they're still captive all the same, and deprived of meaningful flight. It's common for parrot owners to clip or trim their animals' wings to limit their flight capability in order to prevent escape or injury from, say, flying into a ceiling fan.

Caging is “a setup for problems,” Wilson said. Another one of those problems is unhygienic conditions.

“If you confine a bird, they're just very messy — they poop a lot, and when they eat, they make a mess, and so it doesn't take much for the birds to end up in a really filthy environment,” Wilson said, not unlike what Paxton saw at the bird mills. In a survey, pet bird owners rated “general clean up” as the leading drawback to having a bird.

Another is the sedentary lifestyle imposed by captivity, which — especially when combined with diets high in fatty nuts and seeds — can lead to obesity, Wilson said. It's common among pet birds, and it makes them more likely to develop arthritis, heart disease, and other conditions.

Feather plucking and other self-destructive behaviors are common among pet birds, too, with estimates of it afflicting some 10 to 17.5 percent of these animals, suggesting general distress.

Parrots' high intelligence could worsen the harms of captivity. A 2021 study found that the larger a captive bird's brain, the more likely they were to develop behaviors that indicate stress, such as abnormal and repetitive pacing and cage bar biting.

Other issues include lack of enrichment and access to veterinary care, and bird owners' lack of knowledge about what their pet needs.

Even the most devoted bird owners, Wilson said — the ones who are with their birds around the clock, who don't go on vacation, and who even cook for them — will fall short: “There's no way anyone could reasonably provide good welfare to those animals in captivity.”

And many bird owners, she said, aren't prepared for these animals' long lifespans: Some popular parrot species can live up to 50 years or longer. Long-lived pet species — parrots, but also some turtles and snakes — often end up shuffled around to different homes or to underfunded animal sanctuaries when their owner dies, divorces, moves, or can no longer deal with the difficulty of keeping them as pets.

Few understand this better than Karen Windsor, the executive director of Foster Parrots and the New England Exotic Wildlife Sanctuary, a Rhode Island-based animal sanctuary. Windsor told me that a lot of people fall for these birds after seeing videos of parrots who seem to talk so conversantly with their owners. But not all parrots talk or like to be cuddled or handled, she said. Some are really loud, destructive, or aggressive. That leads to a lot of disappointed and desperate parrot owners asking sanctuaries like Windsor's to take them in, but many don't have the space and resources to accommodate most requests.

“We're still dealing with birds that were bred in the '70s and '80s — they're still in the system,” Judy Tennant, executive director of the rescue organization Parrot Partners Canada, recently told CTV News. And the industry is “still pumping out new birds,” Tennant said.

If it's impossible to meet birds' complex needs in captivity, then there's only one logical conclusion: We should stop breeding them. But breaking the pet bird habit might be easier said than done.

Keeping parrots as pets was largely a niche hobby in the United States and Europe up until the 1970s, when interest began to surge. Bird ownership has declined a little in recent decades, though millions of Americans are still dazzled enough by their striking colors and high intelligence and sociability to buy one — and tens of millions more look on through short-form videos on TikTok and beyond.

So how can we start to shift away from bird ownership?

We could start by making their purchase a little harder. Hundreds of US jurisdictions — mostly cities and counties but also some states — have banned pet stores from selling cats, dogs, and sometimes rabbits, instead only allowing adoption, though none of these laws have yet included birds. World Animal Protection, the animal advocacy nonprofit involved in Paxton's investigation, is advocating for that to change, and if successful, it could make a meaningful impact; nationally, more than half of all pet birds are currently purchased from pet stores.

Federal action is needed, too. For decades, bird breeding operations were exempt from the Animal Welfare Act, which means they weren't inspected by the USDA for potential welfare violations. That changed a couple years ago. The move represents progress, but the USDA's enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act has long been terrible. Improving it would help, and so would congressional action that requires all bird breeders be subject to inspection. Currently, smaller operations — those that sell fewer than 200 small birds annually, or eight larger birds annually — are exempt.

The pet industry as well as the pet bird keeping community could also step up more. For the millions of American households that already have a pet bird, they can give their animals as good of a life as possible. That would look like providing ample enrichment, adequate veterinary care, and balanced and diverse diets; a large cage and plenty of time out of it; learning extensively about their bird's natural behaviors and needs; and paying close attention to their birds' cues when it comes to handling, interaction, and time out of the cage or outdoors.

For those still seeking to get a pet bird, they should adopt instead of shop.

More fundamentally, according to Paxton, the investigator, avowed animal lovers can channel that love into more altruistic endeavors.

“If you want to buy a bird as a pet, the first thing I would say is, ‘I love that you love animals, that's fantastic,'” he says in his investigation video. “But since you love animals, do something that's going to help them…you could volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary, or at a bird rescue. You can do something so at the end of the day, you know you have been part of the solution.”

Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.

The company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.

""The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,"" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. ""So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?""

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it ""a very unusual opportunity,"" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.

""This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,"" Jassy said during the call. ""We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.""

Jassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.

Big Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.

During Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had ""financial guardrails"" in place for the spending plan.

Jassy said AI represents an ""extraordinarily unusual opportunity"" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone ""very well.""

""We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,"" Jassy said.

Jassy described the AI market as ""barbelled,"" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.

He said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become ""the largest and the most durable"" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.

""The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,"" he said.

Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a ""sell everything"" mindset.

Much of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.

""A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,"" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.

In Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi closed 1.4% lower after an trading halt after the index dropped 5% in early trade.

Heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit but both stocks recovered to end 0.4% lower.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.2% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.

Australia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses to end 0.8% higher ahead of a general election this weekend.

Cryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.

Bitcoin was trading around $64,800 at 2 a.m. ET after falling about 8.5% over 24 hours. It's down more than 20% over the past seven days.

The selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.

Spot silver was trading around $72.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.

""Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,"" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.

Hansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.

He added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.

The latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes. Analysts expect the volatility to continue as investors reassess their positions after a period of aggressive positioning and stretched valuations across risk assets.

""Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals. This raises the odds of a deeper unwind,"" wrote Sycamore.

Not everyone in finance and tech is sold on the idea that AI is going to kill the software business.

Wall Street's fears of AI-related disruption has been driving a sell-off of software stocks after the release of Anthropic's new industry-specific plug-in.

From Nvidia's CEO dismissing the concerns, to Zoho's founder acknowledging the industry is ""ripe for consolidation,"" here's what leaders in tech and finance are saying:

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace.

""There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,"" Huang said during a recent Cisco AI event. ""You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.""

Huang named ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, as bright spots in the industry.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said volatility will remain in the software market.

""It's different, it's definitely not dead,"" Altman said during an interview on TBPN. ""How you create it, how you're going to use it, how much you're going to have written for you each time you need it, versus how much you'll want sort of a consistent UX —yeah, that's all going to change.""

In the meantime, sell-offs like the one Wall Street has continued now are likely to continue.

""I think it's just going to be volatile for a while as people figure out what this looks like.""

Sridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, a cloud-based software company, said SaaS was ""ripe for consolidation"" long before the rise of AI.

""An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable,"" he wrote on X. ""The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.""

Vembu said he asks his employees to consider the possibility of the company's death.

""When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course.""

Steven Sinofsky, who helped lead the development of Windows 7 and 8, said AI may change ""what we built and who builds it,"" but tales of software's demise are just ""nonsense.""

""Wall Street is filled with investors of all types. There's also a community, and they tend to run in herds. The past couple of weeks have definitely seen the herd collectively conclude that somehow software is dead. That the idea of a software pure play will just vanish into some language model,"" Sinofsky wrote in a lengthy post on X. ""Nonsense.""

Sinofsky said it is true some companies will fail. He also noted that such cycles have happened in retail and media.

""Strap in,"" he wrote. ""This is the most exciting time for business and technology, ever.""

Arm CEO Rene Haas isn't panicking.

""As I look at enterprise AI deployment, we aren't anywhere close to where it can be,"" Haas told the Financial Times.

Haas, who leads the SoftBank-owned semiconductor company, said the current market reaction is ""micro-hysteria.""

JPMorgan analyst Stephen Parker said investors shouldn't be too worried by the sell-off.

""We're seeing a rotation,"" Parker told CNBC. ""It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.""

Parker, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said AI developments are likely to continue to cause disruption in the software industry.

SpaceX moved to cut off Russian access to Starlink this week, disabling connectivity over Ukraine while maintaining a whitelist of approved Ukrainian terminals.

The new measure has spurred excitement among Ukrainian officials and pundits close to the war, who have said that Russian troops were increasingly using Starlink to guide long-range strikes and coordinate forces.

""The enemy reports a mass Starlink blackout among Russian units at the front,"" wrote Serhii Sternenko, the leader of a major Ukrainian crowdfunding organization for combat drones, on Thursday.

""If this is true, then the Ukrainian army will regain its advantage in communications, and the enemy will have a number of problems with controlling troops at the tactical level,"" he added.

Serhii ""Flash"" Beskrestnov, an advisor on drone warfare for Ukraine's defense ministry, wrote that the move had disrupted Russian ground assaults in some frontline areas.

""The enemy doesn't even have a problem on the fronts. The enemy has a catastrophe,"" he wrote on Telegram.

Due to US sanctions after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion began in 2022, SpaceX doesn't sell Starlink terminals to Russia.

But Ukrainian troops have long raised concerns that Moscow's troops were acquiring terminals from the black market, with Kyiv saying it's found the US tech in downed reconnaissance drones.

Pressure for SpaceX to curb Russian access reached a fever pitch last month, as Ukrainian defense officials said they'd begun seeing Starlink terminals on long-range strike drones.

Cutting off the Kremlin's forces from Starlink, however, has been more complicated than simple geofencing. Ukrainian troops also use Starlink, so disabling access in contested regions would have affected Kyiv's operations.

That appears to be changing with the new whitelist. For the last few days, Ukraine's defense ministry and Telegram influencers have been calling on troops to quickly register their terminals under the country's DELTA battlespace management system.

The access restrictions are likely to extend to civilian areas far from the front lines, due to concerns of Starlink being used to guide the Russian Shahed-type attack drones targeting cities.

Businesses must apply for access via an online portal, while civilians were told to bring all their private Starlink terminals to administrative centers along with a national ID.

The whitelist is updated every day, said Ukraine's defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov.

""We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that were included in the whitelist is already working,"" he wrote on Thursday.

Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, urged Ukrainian users to join the whitelist.

""Important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine,"" he wrote on social media on Thursday.

The connectivity changes have also been reported to cut Starlink access for terminals traveling faster than 75 kilometers per hour, or roughly 46 miles per hour, in an effort to shut down attack-drone guidance.

It's not yet clear exactly how the new Starlink measures will affect the war, but early reports from Russia and Ukraine indicate the move is already affecting the battlefield.

Rybar, a prominent Telegram channel run by a Russian military blogger, wrote on Thursday that the Starlink restrictions would ""temporarily slow down"" Moscow's combat operations.

The channel, which had until this week been calling on its followers to donate or fund Starlink terminals for Russian troops, also wrote on February 1 that the Kremlin needed to start developing ""domestic equivalents"" of communication systems for the front lines.

Rybar downplayed the impact on Russian operations, saying that the Starlink whitelist could also play to the Kremlin's advantage.

""If the system is hacked, such a list would give Russian troops the geolocation of numerous Ukrainian Armed Forces positions,"" he wrote in a separate post.

Roman Alekhin, another Russian military blogger, raised concerns on Thursday that Russian forces may not have ready alternatives to Starlink and might instead temporarily rely on fiber optics for frontline communications.

""This is all very bad, especially considering the huge need for communications at the front,"" he wrote.

Ukrainian Telegram channels, meanwhile, hailed the outage as a potential significant blow to Russian forces.

""The enemy even installed terminals on tanks to adjust fire online,"" Sternenko wrote. ""There will be no more. This is just the beginning.""

The Wild Hornets, a Ukrainian drone maker, posted a photo it said showed the wreckage of a Russian Gerbera decoy drone that bore a vulgarity-laden message directed at Musk.

Still, some Ukrainian forces also reported being affected by the outages.

""It was found out from our troops that there were problems with those who did not promptly submit lists for private Starlinks,"" wrote Beskrestnov, the Ukrainian drone advisor. ""The processing process is ongoing.""

Fedorov, who was confirmed as Ukraine's new defense minister last month, thanked SpaceX and Musk for introducing the Starlink measures.

'Thanks to the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink — and that is priceless,"" he wrote.

SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

Business Insider Edition 

The United States has warned it may impose sanctions on Algeria over its decision to purchase advanced Russian-made Su-57 fighter jets, raising fresh questions about Africa's defence ties with Moscow amid heightened global geopolitical tensions.


        Robert Palladino, head of the US State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, said Washington was concerned by reports that Algeria is acquiring new military equipment from Russia, according to remarks made during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Militarnyi reported.
    


        Algeria, one of Africa's largest military spenders alongside Egypt, confirmed in 2025 that it had agreed to purchase the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57E stealth fighter to replace ageing aircraft in its air force.
    


        The deal, officially confirmed in February 2025, would make Algeria the first foreign customer for the aircraft.
    


        Palladino said the United States could respond by invoking the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), legislation designed to discourage major defence purchases from Russia.
    


        “We are working closely with the Algerian government on issues where we find common ground,” Palladino said. “At the same time, we have serious differences on many other topics, and this arms deal is one of the issues the United States considers problematic.”
    


        He added that Washington was using existing diplomatic tools “to protect our interests and stop what we consider unacceptable.”
    


        Algeria has sharply increased defence spending in recent years, driven by instability across the Sahel, Libya, and the wider Mediterranean, as well as its ambition to assert greater regional influence, particularly amid perceptions of a US tilt towards Morocco.
    


        Its armed forces operate one of the continent's most sophisticated air forces, with a fleet that includes Su-30MKA multirole fighters, MiG-29s and advanced Russian-made air-defence systems such as the S-300.
    


        Russia has maintained close military ties with Algeria, supplying key equipment across the country's air force, navy, and ground forces.
    


        The Su-57 fighter jets are scheduled for delivery by the end of this year, with Algerian pilots already undergoing training in Russia, according to internal documents from the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, cited in media reports.
    


        Each aircraft is to be equipped with the latest L-265VE “Khibiny-U” electronic warfare systems, including the corresponding command and control indicators, alongside orders placed with Russia's Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies for onboard systems
    


        Meanwhile, Business Insider Africa reported in 2025 that the documents also confirm Algeria's order of 14 Russian Su-34 fighter-bombers, highlighting the scale and sophistication of the country's ongoing air force modernization.
    


        The potential sanctions threat highlights the delicate balancing act facing African military powers as they navigate relationships with competing global partners.
    


        While Algeria maintains security cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism and regional stability, it has resisted pressure to reduce its long-standing defence relationship with Russia.
    


        Washington has increasingly warned African governments that large-scale arms purchases from Moscow could trigger sanctions under CAATSA, a stance that has already complicated defence procurement decisions in several countries.

Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.

The seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.

Its A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.

The new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.

Starlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.

It's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.

Some of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.

Since launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.

The light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.

Cabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.

Essentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a ""W.""

If a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.

These seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.

There is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.

In-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.

Chatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.

The new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.

Melania Trump has been a public figure since she first became involved with Donald Trump in the 1990s.

Melania, 55, was working as a model at the time, and her life changed dramatically as she became a high-profile businessman's wife and eventually first lady — as did her style.

Take a look back at Melania's fashion evolution, from her days walking red carpets to her political life.

At a ""Celebrity"" party in 1998, Melania chose a figure-hugging silk dress in periwinkle. Its neckline scooped gently.

Melania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles.

The gown's subtle slit was sexy without being over the top.

She attended the New York premiere of ""Charlie's Angels"" in a white skirt suit, but added a daring edge to the look with a sheer lace top.

Strappy heels completed her outfit.

When she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins.

The gown had a V-neckline, which mirrored the slit running up the center of the dress.

Before her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show.

She paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles.

A full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice.

The black-and-tan dress had a feathered skirt with sheer detailing, and she paired it with coordinating shoes.

Trump proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, the evening of the Met Gala.

She paired her 15-carat engagement ring with a black ball gown, which had a corset covered in cutouts.

Attending a Fashion Week event, Melania paired fitted jeans with a sheer pink babydoll top. High heels completed the look.

Melania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump.

She wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments.

Black dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006.

The silk dress had lace detailing on the sheer bodice and the neckline. Crisscross straps and lace paneling on the skirt added to the sexy gown.

At the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes.

Melania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump.

She wore all-black, and her hat and wrap featured fuzzy detailing. Knee-high boots completed the wintry ensemble.

Melania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress.

The dress had a bow on the neckline and ruffle detailing on its mermaid skirt.

At the premiere of ""Nine,"" Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes.

Melania's black cocktail dress had a form-fitting bodice with a subtle sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes.

Melania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. The top buttons of her white blouse were open, and the sleeves poked out from under the jacket.

Black, pointed heels complemented the ensemble.

Melania's gray dress for her ""Good Afternoon America"" appearance had a professional feel.

The fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. She also wore black heels.

When Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code.

Her white, sleeveless dress had a scooped neckline and a pleated skirt that felt like an elevated version of a golf ensemble. She added white heels to the look.

The jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace.

Black heels accented the ensemble.

After Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on ""Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015.""

Melania chose a simple pink dress with short sleeves and a modest neckline for the interview. Her pink, pointed shoes matched the dress.

Lauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling ""two narratives"" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye.

But after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because ""she was trying to say something with more storytelling"" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC.

For the RNC, Melania wore the ""Margot"" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles.

The dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past.

Melania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves.

The silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady.

""It was so curated,"" Rothman said of the look. ""It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory.""

Rothman said the nostalgia in the look lent Melania some of the power Jackie Kennedy held in the American mind, striking the right tone for the beginning of her tenure as first lady.

Ralph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency.

Melania changed into a gown custom-designed by Hervé Pierre Braillard for his Hervé Pierre line.

The form-fitting, cream dress had off-the-shoulder sleeves made of the same fabric as a three-dimensional swath that cut across the bodice, creating volume. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist.

Braillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term.

In 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said ""I really don't care, do u?"" on the back.

The Zara jacket instantly became controversial, leading people to speculate that the first lady was sending a message to the president or migrants at the border.

In her book ""I'll Take Your Questions Now,"" Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to ""fake news"" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported.

Melania dined with members of the royal family at Winfield House in June 2019.

She wore a red Givenchy cape dress, a silhouette favored by royals like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle.

Melania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit.

She wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels.

When the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble.

But when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print.

""Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes,"" Rothman said. ""She went from wearing something super fitted to something loose that is right out of Palm Beach.""

Melania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022.

For the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. The knee-length, silver gown had long sleeves. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes.

Melania paired a black long-sleeved top with a high-waisted, midi-length brown skirt from Martin Grant, which was belted with a bow at her waist. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors.

A black Chanel bag completed her look.

Melania appeared at the Republican National Convention in July after being largely absent from Trump's campaign.

She attended in a blazer and coordinating skirt designed by Christian Dior. The entire outfit was red, the color of the republican party, even down to her pointed-toe, red heels.

Rothman said the outfit struck the perfect tone for the occasion because it seemed to send a specific message.

""There's more intention,"" she said. ""From the red shoe to the red suit to the brighter hair on the stage, there's just more of a power punch of intention with that story than what she was wearing before she was in that role and was in her 20s.""

""She understood the assignment,"" Rothman added.

Melania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024.

The gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg.

It was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics.

Melania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes.

The double-breasted jacket was elegant, and Melania paired it with navy pumps and a white scarf. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white.

""It's a huge fashion moment,"" Rothman said of Melania's hat. She said the summery shape of the hat nodded to Melania's day-to-day life at Mar-a-Lago, while the wool texture and dark colors spoke to the role she was stepping back into.

""She wore a hat that bridges her worlds together,"" she added.

Melania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side.

A black choker made of the same fabric tied the look together.

The first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025.

The camel-toned, three-piece suit included a jacket, fitted trousers, and a vest. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel.

In September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.

For a white-tie dinner at Windsor Castle, Melania wore a bright-yellow gown designed by Carolina Herrera. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt.

The gown's bright color was a bold choice for the royal dinner and a marked change from the neutral looks Melania had been wearing for much of 2025.

The Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025.

The first lady wore a strapless, green gown for the dinner. Designed by Elie Saab, the $3,350 dress featured ruching on the bodice and skirt, with a slit running up the center.

The dress was pretty, but it also radiated a warm welcome for Salman, as the deep-green fabric resembled the colors of the Saudi flag. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well.

When the 2025 Christmas tree arrived at the White House, Melania donned a knee-length white coat. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past.

She wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style.

At the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting ""Melania.""

Her high-neck suit jacket was buttoned down the center and belted at the waist. Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.

The outfit struck a professional, restrained tone, particularly compared to the colorful looks she wore in the second half of 2025.

Business Insider Edition 

China will allow duty-free imports of selected products from South Africa under a trade agreement currently being finalised, signalling Pretoria's accelerating pivot toward alternative global markets as relations with the United States remain strained.


        South Africa's trade ministry said Trade Minister Parks Tau is travelling to China to sign the agreement, which is expected to grant South African exports preferential access to the Chinese market while also attracting new Chinese investment.
    


        “This trip comes at a time when South Africa is pursuing an objective of market diversification and export growth,” the ministry said, without disclosing which sectors would benefit.
    


        China is already South Africa's largest single-country trading partner, overtaking the European Union in 2023. South African exports to China are dominated by minerals and agricultural products, sectors that could gain significantly from reduced tariffs in the world's second-largest economy.
    


        The move comes against the backdrop of worsening trade relations with the United States, South Africa's second-largest trading partner by country.
    


        In August last year, Washington imposed 30% tariffs on some South African products, raising concerns within Pretoria that thousands of jobs could be at risk.
    


        Tensions between South Africa and President Donald Trump's administration have escalated over the past year across diplomatic, trade, and geopolitical sectors, disrupting what was once a stable transatlantic relationship.
    


        Pretoria has since sought to renegotiate trade terms with Washington, but progress has been uncertain, fuelling fears over South Africa's continued preferential access to US markets and its future standing under US-backed trade frameworks.
    


        Against this backdrop, deepening trade ties with China reflects a broader recalibration of South Africa's foreign economic policy toward non-Western partners, including China, the broader BRICS bloc, and parts of the Global South.
    


        In the long run, duty-free access to China could help South Africa reduce over-reliance on Western markets, stabilise export revenues, and attract investment into manufacturing and value-added sectors.
    


        While uncertainty remains over whether the US will fully reintegrate South Africa into its preferred trade arrangements, Pretoria appears increasingly determined to diversify its options—and reduce vulnerability to unilateral trade shocks.

Ford is undergoing a radical factory overhaul to compete with Chinese automakers. Its CEO just offered a peek inside.

On Thursday, Ford CEO Jim Farley shared four behind-the-scenes photos on X of engineers working on the automaker's Universal Electric Vehicle project. It's a new platform and manufacturing system designed to underpin a family of smaller, lower-cost EVs.

Farley described the effort as ""one of the most audacious and important projects in Ford's history.""

""American innovation is how we compete and win against China and the rest of the world,"" Farley wrote in the post.

The update adds new detail to Ford's sweeping rethink of how it designs and assembles electric vehicles, as Chinese EV makers — led by BYD, now the world's largest EV seller — rapidly expand in foreign countries with lower-priced models.

An early peek at our brilliant team working on the Universal Electric Vehicle project - one of the most audacious and important projects in @Ford's history. American innovation is how we compete and win against China and the rest of the world.➡️ The team is spending countless… pic.twitter.com/Un4eCe258L

Farley's photos focus on the first vehicle expected to launch on the platform: a midsize electric pickup truck starting at $30,000. They show Ford employees working on vehicle prototypes — and reveal an early look at what appears to be its grille-less design.

The company confirmed to Business Insider that it plans to launch the vehicle in the US in 2027.

""A Ford team member working on the front end of a prototype - one of the hundreds of prototypes the team has designed and developed to shape the face of the truck over the last few years,"" Farley wrote about one of the images.

Engineers are spending ""countless hours"" refining the truck's aerodynamics, Farley said.

The manufacturing changes behind the vehicle may be even more significant than the design itself. Farley unveiled the new manufacturing plan during an August event dubbed the ""Latest Model T Moment.""

Unlike the traditional assembly line — a single, linear conveyor made famous by Ford's 1908 launch of its first mass-produced car, the Model T — the new system uses a three-pronged ""assembly tree"" approach. Separate lines build the front, rear, and battery underbody of the vehicle in parallel before they are joined later in the process.

Ford says the redesigned system uses 25% fewer fasteners and roughly half as many cooling hoses and connections.

Other images from Farley's post show the factory's new unicasting system — which Farley says reduces the number of vehicle parts — and engineers working on new designs.

Fewer parts could mean lower car prices, the company said in August.

The push comes as Ford makes costly changes to its EV strategy. In December, the company discontinued the F-150 Lightning pickup and scrapped plans for a large all-electric commercial van, recording a $19.5 billion write-down tied to canceled EV programs.

Going forward, Ford plans to focus on smaller, more affordable electric vehicles, as well as extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs, which pair electric drivetrains with onboard gas generators.

The strategy reflects mounting pressure from China's EV industry. BYD overtook Tesla last year to become the world's top EV seller. Chinese EV sales have been gaining momentum across Europe — and last month, Canadian officials announced plans to lower tariffs on Chinese-made cars.

That momentum could prompt further changes at Ford. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Ford is in advanced talks with China's Geely about potential manufacturing cooperation.

Canadians aren't visiting the US as much as they used to.

Data from Statistics Canada up to November showed that fewer Canadians returned from the US — indicating fewer visited the US — than in the past couple of years.

Julian Karaguesian, a visiting lecturer in the economics department at McGill University in Montreal and former special advisor in the International Trade and Finance Branch in the Department of Finance Canada, told Business Insider that several factors are contributing to reduced Canadian travel to the US, including an immigration crackdown and President Donald Trump's rhetoric on both trade and turning the country into the 51st US state.

""We started to see from summer onwards, a lot of protests, a lot of activity by ICE, rhetoric and talk about calling in the National Guard to clean up cities,"" Karaguesian said. ""I think that scared away a lot of tourists.""

The number of Canadians returning from the US plunged during the pandemic, and never truly recovered to its pre-pandemic average. After some recovery, it took a massive slip in early 2025 and is down about a quarter from a year ago in November. Statistics Canada data also showed that US residents entering Canada haven't had as large a drop from the start of the year as Canadian residents returning did.

Meanwhile, Canadians are doubling down on what Canada has to offer. Statistics Canada said domestic travel in the second quarter of 2025 was 10.9% higher than a year ago. Over a third of the domestic travel was characterized as holiday, leisure, and recreation trips.

Are you a Canadian who isn't planning to visit the US anytime soon, a Canadian who moved back after living in the US, or a US business affected by a change in Canadian demand? Reach out to this reporter at mhoff@businessinsider.com.

Karaguesian expects Canadian travel to the US to continue to cool due to the ""Buy Canadian"" movement, political instability, the trade war, and recent violence in the US.

Prioritizing Canadian goods was one of the ways Justin Trudeau, now the former prime minister, encouraged residents after the trade war between the US and Canada began. Discouraging US travel was another.

""We're going to choose to not go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever,"" Trudeau said. ""We're going to choose to try to buy Canadian products and forgo bourbon and other classic American products.""

The decline in Canadian tourists can affect US businesses that rely on them to prosper.

A report from the Democratic members of the Congress Joint Economic Committee included different business owners describing how the fall in Canadian tourism to the US has affected them.

""We spoke with Canadian customers who told us point-blank that they were hesitant to cross due to the current political tension,"" Kyle Daley, owner of supermarket Soloman's Store in New Hampshire, said in the report. ""The joy of the 'shopping day trip' has been replaced by anxiety over border enforcement and tariffs.""

Daley added that ""When our neighbors stay away, our margins disappear and in groceries those margins are vanishingly small to begin with.""

U.S. Travel Association said Canada is the main driver for the expected 3.2% drop in international inbound travel spending from 2024 to 2025.

Karaguesian said the effects would be felt more by local economies. That can include Michigan, Vermont, and other areas along the border.

""The longer-term ramifications are that our economy will suffer and that businesses will close and people will lose their jobs, which is just terrible,"" Becca Brown McKnight, a city councilor in Burlington, Vermont, previously told Business Insider. ""We are really lucky in Vermont to have a robust small business economy; a lot of these are mom and pop shops, and this is people's entire livelihood.""

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that the state and Canada's ""economies are intertwined"" in response to a question at a fireside chat about why Canada should trust the state ""in the midst of a chaotic tariff policy.""

Sandy Levine, the owner of some restaurants in the Detroit area, said in a WDET article published in June that ""We certainly still see people from Canada and from other countries, but it's not nearly to the degree that it was maybe like six months ago or a year ago.""

Karaguesian thinks that if the White House had simply focused on arguing for tariffs to rebuild the US manufacturing sector without harming Canada, then the administration ""could achieve the same thing and not have put off so many Canadians through a mixture of pride and fear.""

AI is forcing the Big Four to rethink how work — and workers — are defined. The generalist consultant is out, and technical skills and deep industry expertise are in.

PwC has launched what it's calling the ""Learning Collective,"" a new workplace training initiative designed for the realities of the AI era.

It's a broad rethink of how learning happens inside one of the world's largest professional services firms.

""Skills, not titles, are the currency of this new era,"" the firm said in a press release.

The line was reminiscent of news from January, first reported by Business Insider, that fellow Big Four firm Deloitte is overhauling job titles for all of its professionals. From June 1, simple, traditional job roles like ""consultant"" and ""associate"" will be replaced by more specific descriptors that better reflect the work Deloitte carries out for clients.

""We're not changing our titles,"" Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, clarified to Business Insider in an interview.

Still, PwC's approach to talent echoes the industry shift. What that ""skills, not titles"" ethos means is that, as employees apply for projects, move around the organization, and progress in their careers, it's their portfolio of skills that will set them apart rather than a job title, said Seals-Coffield.

PwC has introduced three major learning tracks with the Learning Collective. The first is a firmwide emphasis on 30 key skills: 15 AI-centric and 15 human-centric, both of which are ""extremely critical"" to PwC's success, Seals-Coffield told Business Insider.

""We're not necessarily asking someone to digest all 30 skills in one year,"" said Seals-Coffield. Different levels will focus on different skills, she added, but taken together they represent what PwC believes will matter most as AI reshapes client work.

On the human-centric aspect, this includes applying critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated outputs and using empathy to understand client dynamics.

The technical skills include AI fluency and AI simulation, which Seals-Coffield described as simulating the work now being completed by AI to ensure staff understand why and how it's done.

The firm said it isn't just teaching people about agents — it's using them in the learning process.

Seals-Coffield said she recently watched a demo of an agent giving feedback on presentation skills this week that was ""pretty brutal, but in a really good way.""

The agent told her: ""You're still not addressing the question around profitability. You're still not being specific about the ROI. It sounds a little bit generic. And I was just like, 'OK, geez, that was a little bit harsh.'""

But the blunt feedback helped her rethink how she had presented certain details, Seals-Coffield said, adding that PwC wants agents that ""provide that real tangible critical coaching.""

The Learning Collective is introducing new programs for two groups feeling the impact of AI acutely: engineers and junior workers.

In a move away from traditional roles associated with the Big Four, PwC has launched a new tech engineering career track, aimed at attracting and recruiting more technical talent.

The firm wants to become ""a destination for top engineering talent,"" the press release states.

For junior staff, PwC has launched the Associate Discovery program — a drive to expose new employees to AI from day one. By the time associates land on their first major engagement, PwC wants them to have experience building agents, working with AI, and developing the human skills required to make those tools useful.

The firm has also reduced the number of offices where consulting associates can begin their careers, from around 60 down to 13, said Seals-Coffield.

Training and development have always been important at the Big Four consulting and accounting firms. Many young grads join their ranks looking to supercharge their business skills.

But the isolation of the COVID years, combined with the way that AI is changing the nature of work, has chipped away at some of PwC's sense of connection around learning and development, especially for younger employees, said Seals-Coffield.

The Learning Collective is trying to change that by encouraging learning beyond courses, such as bringing team members along to meetings or getting teams to discuss what they've learned that week with each other.

""They will find that we are asking them more and more to engage in these learning experiences in their intact team,"" Seals-Coffield said.

""Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience,"" she added.

The Truth Social account of President Donald Trump on Friday morning removed a racist image showing former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama portrayed as apes after outrage over the post.

The depiction of the Obamas, posted late Thursday from Trump's official Truth Social account, was included in a video clip pushing a conspiracy theory about voting machines during the 2020 election.

The White House initially defended Trump's post when asked for comment on Friday morning, but the sole Black Republican senator quickly called for Trump to remove the post.

""This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement earlier Friday.

""Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,"" Leavitt said.

Leavitt's reply included a link to a longer video posted Oct. 24 from a pro-Trump meme account on X.

Hours later, the post was deleted from Trump's Truth Social account.

A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a White House staffer erroneously posted the video and that it since had been taken down.

In addition to showing the Obamas as apes, the full video shows other animals bearing the faces of prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The press office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another Democrat mocked in the video, said on X: ""Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.""

Trump is depicted in that video as a lion. The song ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" by The Tokens plays in the background.

The Obama Foundation did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Trump's opponents may seek to make the post an issue for the midterm election in November, though it's still nine months away. 

Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress have expressed worries that they will not be able to retain their slim majorities in both the House and Senate in November's election.

The NAACP, in a post on X, said: ""Trump posting this video — especially during Black History Month— is a stark reminder of how Trump and his followers truly view people. And we'll remember that in November.""

Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who is Black and a close ally of Trump's, blasted the image.

""Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,"" Scott wrote in a post on X. 

""The President should remove it,"" Scott wrote.

Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is considered at risk of losing his seat in the House of Representatives in November's election, criticized Trump's post, saying on X, ""The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.""

Democratic elected officials quickly called on other Republicans to condemn the post.

""President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans,"" Jeffries wrote on X. ""They represent the best of this country. Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder.""

""Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual? Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,"" Jeffries wrote, referring to the Senate majority leader.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., in a own post on X, said, ""This kind of Jim Crow-style dehumanization is pathetic and a disgrace to the office.""

In this article

Voyager Technologies CEO Dylan Taylor said two years would be an ""aggressive"" time frame for space data centers and that cooling remains a problem for the developing technology.

While SpaceX has the heavy lift rockets to bring components to space, Taylor told CNBC's Morgan Brennan that the lack of a cooling solution to transfer the heat remains a major barrier.

""It's counterintuitive, but it's hard to actually cool things in space because there's no medium to transmit hot to cold,"" he said. ""So essentially, all heat dissipation has to happen via radiation, which means you need to have a radiator pointing away from the sun to do that."" 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long touted a future with data centers in space and highlighted the build-out as a primary reason for combining his rocket company SpaceX and his AI startup xAI this week in a deal valued at $1.25 trillion.

Voyager, which went public in June, is widely known for its Starlab project that is set to replace the International Space Station, which is slated to be retired in 2030. 

Taylor said the company is on track to meet its 2029 launch goal for the project, which it's working on with Palantir, Airbus and Mitsubishi. Voyager already has its own cloud compute device on the ISS. 

President Donald Trump's plans to boost defense spending and revamp the country's space program have helped lift interest in space technology investing over the last year. The highly anticipated SpaceX public offering, expected later this year, has also stoked investor interest. 

Last year, a wave of space tech companies went public as the IPO market reopened following a yearslong drought. 

That path, however, hasn't always been so rosy for the sector.

Voyager's stock has lost more than half of its value since its debut, while rocket maker Firefly Aerospace has shed nearly two-thirds in value since its August public offering. 

Taylor said Voyager is poised to help lead the charge on data centers in space, helped by its laser communication tools.

""We're big believers in the technology maturing and our ability to generate data in space and process data in space,"" he said.

In this article

Amazon shares sunk more than 9% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. 

The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. 

Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter alone. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.

Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. 

Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively shed more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. 

Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as ""sentiment contagion takes hold,"" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.

""Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,"" he added.

Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. 

While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning.

""We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.""

Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. 

""With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment,"" the analysts wrote in a research note. ""We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT.""

Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as ""staggering"" demand for the iPhone. 

""The bet is becoming binary,"" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. ""Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong.""

Tech companies like Microsoft and Google are going after new users for their AI services the way any marketer tries to make their products look cool: through social media influencers.

Other artificial intelligence players, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, are also hiring social media creators to post sponsored content on apps like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and even LinkedIn. The payout for these promotions can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to industry experts.

AI companies have increased advertising considerably over the past year. Generative AI platforms spent more than $1 billion on digital ads in the U.S. in 2025, according to Sensor Tower, up 126% from the year prior. Influencer marketing is now emerging as one of the next battlegrounds for users in the AI boom.

The ad race is making its way to the biggest sporting event of the year in the U.S. Anthropic is spending millions of dollars to air a 60-second pregame and 30-second in-game spot during the Super Bowl on Sunday, aimed at OpenAI's recent decision to start showing ads within ChatGPT.

In the emerging creator space, influencers are getting paid by tech companies to promote their respective AI tools to social media users. That could be through writing a LinkedIn post on how to use Anthropic's Claude Code or by posting an Instagram video about fun things to do with Microsoft Copilot or Perplexity's Comet assistant.

Those services have come a long way since OpenAI ushered in the generative AI era in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT. Google has bolstered its position in the market with the release of Gemini 3, its latest  model, in November, while Anthropic, Microsoft and Meta have continued rolling out updates. 

Microsoft and Google have paid creators between $400,000 and $600,000 for long-term partnerships spanning several months, according to a person familiar with the deals who asked not to be named because the terms are private.

""What we're seeing is a massive increase in creator spend from these AI brands,"" said AJ Eckstein, founder and CEO of Creator Match, an agency that connects brands to creators. The firm works with multiple AI-focused brands, including Anthropic, HeyGen and Notion.

""Every month, we're getting way more interest from AI brands,"" he said, adding that AI companies are looking for ways to market their tools and build stronger connections with users in more authentic ways.

Representatives from Microsoft and Google declined to comment. 

Anthropic has emerged as one of the more aggressive AI companies in creator marketing. In March, the company hired Lexie Barnhorn, who previously worked at Notion, to lead its influencer marketing across social media and podcasts. The AI lab has inked multiple brand deals with content creators.

One of those creators is Megan Lieu, who makes content about AI and tech. Lieu told CNBC that her background as a data scientist helped her attract AI brands, and that she landed her first such deal in mid-2025.

""These brands really want their customers to know we are associated with AI,"" said Lieu, who has nearly 400,000 followers across platforms.

Lieu said her most significant brand deal to date was with Anthropic to promote its Claude products. Lieu declined to specify how much Anthropic paid her, but she said her sponsored content deals typically range from $5,000 to $30,000 depending on the campaign. 

""If you want to take your programming to the next level, Claude Code helps you do it with the power of agentic AI,"" Lieu wrote in a LinkedIn post sponsored by Anthropic. 

Anthropic didn't provide a comment for this story.

AI companies are willing to spend a lot more than others, Eckstein said. There's a lot of money to go around. Anthropic recently raised over $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, while OpenAI was valued at $500 billion late last year. Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta have market caps in the trillions.   

Creators can charge up to $100,000 per post, Eckstein said.

""Some of these bigger companies have so much money to spend,"" he said, ""that they don't care to negotiate.""

Digital ad spending by Google and Microsoft to promote their AI products jumped roughly 495% last month compared with a year earlier, according to Sensor Tower. OpenAI also increased its digital ad spending more than 10 times in 2025.

Beyond sponsored posts, AI companies are also spending heavily on creators by inviting them to events, offering early access to new tools and paying for travel and accommodations.

""We work with all kinds of creators — including artists, filmmakers, designers, and cultural partners — giving them early access to our tools and ultimately, giving them the freedom to show us what's creatively possible with AI,"" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.

But not all creators are willing to accept brand deals tied to AI products.

Some said they have turned down deals with AI companies due to ethical, environmental and creative concerns. Others said their audiences can be hostile toward AI sponsorships, creating fear of backlash or getting ""canceled.""

""AI is lame, unsubscribed,"" read a comment on a sponsored post promoting Google's AI video generator tool Veo by Stevie Sells, a creator. He didn't respond to the comment.

Roughly half of U.S. adults say they are more concerned than excited about AI, according to Pew Research data published in October.

Some creators told CNBC that they're walking away from potentially tens of thousands of dollars in sponsored deals related to AI. Creator agency experts said backlash tends to be strongest around tools that generate images or video, which many creators see as directly replacing their artistic labor.

Content creator Jack Lepiarz, who goes by the name Jack the Whipper and has more than 7 million followers across platforms, told CNBC he immediately declines any brand deal involving AI.

""I cannot in good conscience support something that's going to make it harder for normal people to make a living,"" said Lepiarz, whose content tends to focus on his performances at Renaissance fairs.

Lepiarz said he previously turned down a $20,000 brand deal to tout an AI product promoting generative image tools.

""Even if they came back with $100,000 or $500,000, I couldn't see myself saying yes to that,"" Lepiarz said. ""It's too far of a thing for me. It's too far a bridge to cross.""

DETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa on Friday said the automaker plans to move forward as one company amid speculation that it would be better off selling brands or splitting up after disappointing results. 

""Stellantis is a very strong global company that is very proud to have very deep regional groups,"" Filosa, an Italian native, told reporters during a media call. ""It makes all of sense to stay together. We want to stay together for many years to come."" 

His comments come hours after the company announced 22 billion euros ($26 billion) in charges from a business restructuring that includes pulling back on electrification plans and reintroducing V8 engines to U.S. models.  

Filosa described the actions as an ""important strategic reset of our business model, with the only intention to put our customer preferences back at the center of what we do globally and in each regions."" He said the ""mission is to grow"" after notable declines in market share in recent years.

Stellantis' stock plunged more than 20% in Milan and New York markets. 

Filosa on Friday did not specifically rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of 14 auto brands that includes U.S. brands Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, as well as Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.

""We want to really manage our brands in the sense to provide to them the products and the technology that our customers, that are now at the center of our strategic reset, will tell us that they want and they need,"" he said. ""This is our core mission.""

Filosa said additional information about the company's plans moving forward will come at a May 21 investor day.

Friday's announcement comes days after Stellantis executives met with the company's U.S. franchised dealers at their annual National Automobile Dealers Association conference with a message that the automaker planned to grow sales across its U.S. lineup of brands, according to two dealers who attended the meeting.

The majority of Friday's announced charges — 14.7 billion euros — are related to realigning product plans with consumer preferences and new emission regulations in the U.S. 

Other charges include 2.1 billion euros in resizing the company's EV supply chain, 4.1 billion euros in warranty costs and 1.3 billion euros in restructuring European operations. 

The automaker also canceled its dividend for 2026 and issued a 5 billion euro nonconvertible hybrid bond.

The charges related to EVs follow General Motors and Ford Motor announcing billions of dollars in similar expenses due to pullbacks in plans for all-electric vehicles.

Shares of Ford and GM were not as impacted as much as Stellantis, which also issued lower-than-expected guidance amid years of strategic problems with the company.

Stellantis said it anticipates a net loss for 2025. For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit rise in its adjusted operating income margin.

""While charges were expected, the amount comes in above F ($19.5B) and GM ($7.6B). Expect shares to trade meaningfully lower today as a result. We continue to believe STLAM is a show-me-story. In the US, the company has lost substantial market share given high pricing and a perceived lack of product investment,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said in a Friday investor note.

Filosa on Friday called out mistakes by former company leaders more than he has since he succeeded Carlos Tavares as CEO in June. 

Tavares, who was ousted in December 2024 amid disagreements with the Stellantis board, in a book last year reportedly said that the group's French, Italian and U.S. operations might have to be split amid pressure from its main stakeholders.

It's been just over five years since Stellantis was created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021.

The merger formed the fourth-largest automaker by volume, but the company has run into significant problems in recent years amid its investments in all-electric vehicles, focus on profits over market share and cost-cutting efforts to the detriment of products.

Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, declining from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.

Stellantis' global market share has fallen from 8.1% in 2020 to an estimated 6.1% last year, according to S&P Global Mobility.  

Correction: Global market share for Stellantis has fallen from 8.1% in 2020 to an estimated 6.1% last year, according to S&P Global Mobility. An earlier version mischaracterized the percentage.

In this article

Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.

The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.

The firm is ""in the early stages"" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents ""soon,"" though he declined to provide a specific date.

""Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,"" he said.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to ""constrain headcount growth"" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.

The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.

Goldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. 

""Claude is really good at coding,"" Argenti said. ""Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?""

Argenti said the firm was ""surprised"" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.

Now, the view within Goldman is that ""there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,"" he said.

The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.

Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. 

While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was ""premature"" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.

Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.

""It's always a trade-off,"" Argenti said. ""Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.""

Shares of automaker Stellantis plunged 27% in European trading on Friday, after the company said it expects to take a 22-billion-euro ($26 billion) hit from a business reset and hinted at a pull-back from its electrification push. 

In Milan, the company's Italian shares were 26% lower. In early trading on Wall Street, the transatlantic firm's New York-listed stock plummeted 25%. 

Other French auto stocks also fell Friday morning, with Valeo and Forvia both down more than 1.2% and Renault sliding 2%.

""The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers' real-world needs, means and desires,"" said Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in a statement.

""They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution, the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our new Team.""

Going forward, Stellantis said it would remain at the forefront of EV development, but said its own electrification journey would continue at ""a pace that needs to be governed by demand rather than command.""

Stellantis also pre-released some figures for the fourth quarter on Friday, saying it anticipates a net loss for 2025. In recognition of that net loss, it has suspended its dividend for 2026 and plans to raise up to 5 billion euros by issuing hybrid bonds.

For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit increase in its adjusted operating income margin.

The company said its dividend pause and bond issuance would help preserve its balance sheet, and outlined the actions it had taken last year as part of its reset strategy. 

These included announcing ""the largest investment in Stellantis' U.S. history"" — totalling $13 billion over four years — as well as launching 10 new products, canceling products that could not achieve profit at scale, and restructuring its global manufacturing and quality management capabilities. 

Under the U.S. investment drive, the transatlantic automaker has said it will add 5,000 jobs to its American workforce. 

While these moves had resulted in costs of 22.2 billion euros, the company said they had collectively delivered a return to positive volume growth in 2025. 

In the second half of the year, Stellantis' U.S. market share rose to 7.9%, while the company said it retained its overall second-place market share position in the enlarged Europe. 

Stellantis' writedown follows multibillion-dollar hits at rivals Ford and GM, which recently announced their own hits worth $19.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively — both being related to EV pullbacks. 

Given the ""magnitude of the kitchen sinking"" and the soft 2026 guidance, UBS analysts said the negative share-price reaction was expected. They added, however, that new management's ""decisive"" clean-up and solid regional market fundamentals leave the stock attractive as a potential U.S. ""comeback"" play.

Friday's writedown announcement came alongside news that Stellantis will offload its stake in NextStar Energy, a joint venture with LG Energy Solution that built and operated a Canadian battery manufacturing facility. LG Energy Solution will take over Stellantis' 49% stake, the firms said on Friday morning. 

The joint venture was part of Stellantis' broader electrification strategy. In 2022, former CEO Carlos Tavares set a goal for 100% of sales in Europe and 50% of sales in the U.S. to be battery electric vehicles  by the end of the decade.

The company is set to present an updated long-term strategy at its Capital Markets Day in May. 

Stellantis' stock has been under pressure for some time, with its Italian shares slumping nearly 25% last year and 40.5% the previous year. Shares are currently down more than 13% since the beginning of 2026. 

Filosa previously dubbed 2026 the ""year of execution"" for the embattled automaker, which has been grappling with falling sales, leadership changes and disappointing earnings for several years. In July, the company said it expected to take a tariffs hit of around 1.5 billion euros in 2025, as it reported a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros.

In a Friday note, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Stellantis had placed a ""miscalculated bet"" on electric vehicles – but said the broader picture on EV adoption raised questions about Stellantis' marketability.

""The long-held argument about why many drivers won't go electric yet are concerns about price, access to charging infrastructure, and how long a battery will last during their journey,"" he said.

""However, prices are coming down, more chargers are being installed, and battery range is improving. The success of companies like BYD suggests there are plenty of people willing to take the leap. That begs the question as to whether Stellantis' frustration over its EV sales is linked to market issues or that drivers simply don't like its vehicles.""

Stellantis is scheduled to publish its 2025 earnings in full on Feb. 26.

Amazon is following in the footsteps of fellow tech giant Microsoft, and not in a good way. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant plunged more than 11% in extended trading after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations.

The bigger jolt, however, came from Amazon's enormous capital expenditure projection — $200 billion, far above analysts' estimates of $146.6 billion and sharply higher than the roughly $131 billion in 2025.

That figure also dwarfs Alphabet's projected capex range of $175 billion to $185 billion, which already gave traders and analysts pause. The message from markets was clear: Investors are growing wary of how much Big Tech is spending to chase the next phase of artificial intelligence, even as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he was ""confident"" of seeing a ""strong return on invested capital.""

Soaring capex and fears that AI is eroding the value of software firms contributed to a tech sell-off on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.59% on declines in Nvidia, Oracle and Qualcomm, among others. Stocks were further pressured by high U.S. layoffs in January. The S&P 500 dropped 1.23%, putting it in the red for 2026, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 1.2%.

But not everyone sees a sector in trouble. Dan Ives of  Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Wednesday that the sell-off reflected an ""Armageddon scenario for the sector that is far from reality."" 

The market decline, however, is ""a positive sign"" for Stephen Tuckwood, director of investments at Modern Wealth Management, who argued that it signals ""the market is discerning at this point rather than just irrational exuberance.""

Perhaps reflecting some of that discernment, Bitcoin briefly sank below $61,000 as of Thursday evening stateside, its lowest level since November 2024, though it recouped some losses and is trading at $65,208 at 2:40 p.m. Singapore (1:30 a.m. ET). Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Solana, have also been losing ground this week.

In Europe, U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, could face renewed pressure as questions swirl around British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's grip on power.

Starmer is under fire over the prior appointment of Peter Mandelson as U.K. ambassador to the U.S despite knowing of his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Punters are raising their bets that Starmer could lose his leadership role by the end of the year — and the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told CNBC the fiasco is adding to global uncertainty.

— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report.

Silver's volatility has exceeded 100%. Strategists at UBS noted the recent plunge appeared driven more by a broader risk-off move than a collapse in fundamentals, but warned that extreme volatility makes near-term positioning risky. 

India is 'ready' to buy Boeing planes worth up to $80 billion, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal reportedly said, signaling New Delhi's willingness to expand trade with the U.S. Goyal also said that there was potential to buy $500 billion worth of goods from the U.S. over the next five years.

U.S. citizens should ‘leave Iran now,' according to a security alert issued by the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Tehran on Friday. The notice comes ahead of U.S.-Iran talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground on the meeting's agenda.

The S&P 500 is in negative territory for 2026, after the index posted losses on Thursday. Other major U.S. indexes also fell on a sell-off in tech stocks. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Friday. South Korea's Kospi lost roughly 1.5%, paring earlier losses of as much as 5%. Japan's Nikkei 225, however, added 0.8%.

U.S.-China power struggle thrusts Panama Canal back into the spotlight

A simmering dispute over two container ports at either end of the Panama Canal risks becoming a geopolitical flashpoint between the world's two largest economies: the U.S. and China.

It follows a contentious decision from Panama's top court voiding a license of a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison for operating two key terminals on the waterway, through which some 40% of all U.S. container traffic transits every year.

Defense spending has been the talk of Singapore's Airshow this week but that's not an accurate way to measure military strength, Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech firm Anduril Industries, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" Wednesday.

That comes after U.S. President Donald Trump in January expressed interest in raising the U.S military budget to $1.5 trillion in 2027, which he said would allow Washington to build a ""Dream Military.""

""Too many people measure the success of the defense base in terms of dollars,"" Luckey said. 

Rather, military strength should be measured by output, or what countries actually receive from their spending, he said. 

This is part of the reason why American defense companies aren't incentivized to produce military products that cost less, Luckey added. 

Ranked No. 1 on the 2025 ""CNBC Disruptor 50"" list, Anduril Industries was founded by Luckey in 2017. The company, which makes AI-powered autonomous defense products, is currently valued at $30.5 billion.

""Unfortunately, we have a pretty inefficient defense industrial apparatus,"" Luckey said. ""I don't think that we're getting nearly as much for our dollar as a lot of other nations are.""

Luckey said China is ""getting a lot more aircraft, a lot more missiles, certainly a lot more ground forces for every dollar they spend. And so you can be in a situation where China is spending less than the United States, but the output is double or triple or quadruple.""

China's military budget in 2025 was set at 1.78 trillion yuan (about $249 billion). 

China's shipbuilding capacity is roughly 232 times that of the U.S., and Beijing has held onto 66.8% of global orders as of end-December 2025, according to its state media. 

""We need to get our act together so that we can get everything that currently costs $1.5 trillion for well under a trillion dollars,"" he said. ""I would love to see a sub $500 billion defense budget if it's getting us the things that we need.""

However, U.S. defense spending isn't set up in a way that will make that happen, he said. The current system rewards companies that move slowly, make products that ""break often,"" and ""spend money building the wrong thing.""

Trump in early January criticized U.S. defense companies for prioritizing capital returns and executive pay over investment and on-time deliveries.

Though he did not name names in the Jan. 9 Truth Social post, Trump said he would not permit defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks ""until such time as these problems are rectified."" 

Luckey called this criticism ""perfectly fair."" 

""Defense companies are unique in that they make almost all of their money straight out of the wallet of the taxpayer,"" he said.

""Remember, he didn't say, hey, you people are making too much period. He said…if you're going to be billions of dollars over budget and years behind on your delivery, you don't get to then pay yourself tens of millions of dollars and shovel huge piles of money out to your investors, as if you're a successful company,"" Luckey said. 

He added that major American defense companies can't blame supply chain problems which ramped up during the Covid-19 pandemic — and continue to plague the industry today. 

""This is not a one-year mistake — this is a pattern. It's been going on, not for months or years, but for decades,"" he said.

He also rejected those who say Trump's criticism may soon apply to Anduril Industries, which Luckey said will ""almost certainly"" go public in the future.

""We are delivering on time,"" he said. And ""we are staying on budget.""

In this article

The software sector faced renewed market concerns this week after artificial intelligence company Anthropic released new AI tools, triggering a sell-off in software-as-a-service and data provider stocks. 

Anthropic's new AI tools, built for its Claude ""Cowork"" AI agent, are designed to handle complex professional workflows that many software and data providers sell as core products.

The tools and other similar AI agents target functions ranging from legal and technology research, customer relationship management and analytics. That has raised concerns that AI could undercut traditional software business models.

The S&P 500 Software & Services Index, which has 140 constituents, fell over 4% on Thursday, extending its losing streak to eight sessions. The index is down about 20% so far this year.

Shares of Thomson Reuters, Salesforce and LegalZoom were among the hardest hit in U.S. trading this week, with the sell-off spreading to Asian IT firms Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys.

Despite the market jitters, analysts and tech executives remain divided on the long-term impact of these AI tools on these industries. 

Among tech leaders downplaying market concerns that AI will replace enterprise software is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

""There's this notion that the software industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,"" he said at an event on Wednesday. ""It is the most illogical thing in the world.""

The influential tech leader instead argued that AI will use and enhance existing software tools rather than completely reinventing them. 

Rene Haas, CEO of British chip designer Arm Holdings, echoed that sentiment this week, arguing during an earnings call that enterprise AI deployment is still in its early days and not yet massively transformative. 

Haas described recent market fears as ""micro-hysteria"" in comments to the Financial Times.  

Still, concerns about the software sector predate the latest sell-offs. Hedge funds have already shorted about $24 billion in software stocks this year as of Wednesday. Short sellers borrow shares, sell them and aim to buy them back later at a lower price for a profit.

Meanwhile, Anthropic on Thursday launched what it called an improved AI model, ‌coming just days after its latest Claude tools spooked investors.

While many tech analysts have increasingly warned that AI is going ""to eat"" software over the long term, views on that risk and the latest sell-off in software stocks remain mixed. 

In a research note on Wednesday, Wedbush Securities echoed Jensen Huang's comments, saying that while AI is a headwind for software providers, the sell-off reflected an ""Armageddon scenario for the sector that is far from reality."" 

""Enterprises won't completely overhaul tens of billions of dollars of prior software infrastructure investments to migrate over to Anthropic, OpenAI, and others,"" the note said. 

Large enterprises, Wedbush Securities said, took decades to accumulate trillions of data points now ingrained in their software infrastructure.

Other analysts see more lasting pressure. 

Advisory firm Constellation Research said Wednesday the sell-off reflects concerns that AI could pressure profits and limit how much software companies can charge, rather than signaling a death knell for the industry.

""There's likely to be cannibalization of SaaS by AI-driven workflows and that will impact the multiple the sector trades on,"" Rolf Bulk, tech equities analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC.

That said, Bulk argued that a subset of software providers, especially those running mission-critical enterprise workloads such as Oracle and ServiceNow, still have a sustained ""right to earn."" 

The depth of their data and entrenched role in customer workflows make them more likely to coexist with AI rather than be replaced outright, he added.

That bet is being pursued by software firms such as AlphaSense, a market data and research firm that leverages AI tools across its product offerings. 

In a statement to CNBC, Chris Ackerson, SVP of Product at AlphaSense said that the ""future belongs to providers that combine advanced AI with trusted content, explainability and deep domain context.""

The U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to ""leave Iran now"" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. 

The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  

The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.

The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran's three main nuclear facilities.  

Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  

The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. 

Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.

The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a ""massive armada,"" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. 

The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain ""far apart and there is zero trust,"" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. 

McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.

The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.

But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. 

As Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. 

Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. 

Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.

In this article

New Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's commerce and industry minister, Piyush Goyal, reportedly said, signaling the country's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.

India's demand for aircraft alone, with orders for Boeing ""yet to be placed but ready,"" is nearly $80 billion, Goyal said Thursday, adding that if engines and other spare parts are added, imports from U.S. will ""cross $100 billion just [from] aircrafts.""

Families of passengers who died in the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad in June of last year are suing Boeing, over the alleged role of defective dual switches in the disaster that saw 241 of the 242, the minister said, on board lose their lives.

The minister also said that there was potential to procure a minimum of $500 billion worth of goods from the U.S. over the next five years, but clarified that there was no explicit investment commitment made as part of the trade deal with Washington.

On Monday, within a week of the India-European Union trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in a social media post that Washington and New Delhi had agreed a trade deal. 

Trump said that the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture, and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.

The Indian prime minister expressed delight over the cut in duties, as goods from the country entering the U.S. have been subjected to 50% tariffs, but did not acknowledge any other details shared by Trump.

While experts agree that India will buy more from the U.S., they have said the target of buying goods worth $500 billion from Washington ""seems a stretch.""

India's overall goods imports stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S.

India and the U.S. will sign a joint statement in the next three to four days, finalizing the first tranche of the trade deal between the two countries, Goyal said on Thursday. The 18% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. will become effective after the joint statement is issued, he added.

The two sides will then sign a formal agreement in mid-March, after which the tariff concession for U.S. goods entering India will become effective.

Since the deal has been announced, the Indian government has been scant with details and is facing questions from opposition political parties. 

The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being ""compromised"" and of having ""surrendered on Tariffs.The Indian government has not confirmed some of Trump's claims about the trade deal such as India reducing duties on U.S. goods to zero and halting imports of Russian oil, as well as a firm commitment to purchasing goods worth $500 billion.

Experts say Trump's claims seem ""unrealistic"" and risk the U.S. backtracking on the trade deal, citing his threats to raise tariffs on South Korea, after slashing them in July last year, despite a trade deal.

In this article

Amazon's stock plunged 11% in extended trading Thursday, dragged lower by market jitters around the company's $200 billion capex plans, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies. 

The forecast is a sharp increase from Amazon's capital expenditures last year, and it was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. The company reported spending roughly $131 billion on purchases of property and equipment in 2025, up from about $83 billion in the year prior.  

Tech companies have laid out aggressive spending plans on artificial intelligence infrastructure since OpenAI ushered in the modern era of this technology with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, but at the start of 2026, those lavish commitments have only kept growing. 

Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday said it would spend up to $185 billion in 2026, while Meta last week said its capital expenditures could nearly double from last year to somewhere between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026

On a conference call with investors, Wall Street analysts pressed Amazon executives for more clarity around the spending blitz and when it could begin to pay off. CEO Andy Jassy said in prepared remarks at the beginning of the call that he was ""confident"" that company's cloud unit will see a ""strong return on invested capital,"" though he didn't say when it could materialize.

""Help us, get to that — get to your level of confidence in having a strong long-term return on that invested capital,"" Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said to Jassy. 

Jassy said the company needs the capital to keep pace with ""very high demand"" for Amazon's AI compute, which requires more infrastructure such as data centers, chips and networking equipment.

""This isn't some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,"" Jassy said. ""We have confidence that we, that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We've done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well.""

Sales at Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent period, beating analysts' expectations and marking the cloud unit's ""fastest growth in 13 quarters,"" Jassy said. 

AWS could've grown faster if it had more capacity to meet demand, ""so we are being incredibly scrappy around that,"" he said. 

The company's cloud unit added almost 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025, and AWS expects to double that power by the end of 2027, Jassy noted.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked Jassy how he sees the AI market evolving from the current landscape, where it remains ""a bit top-heavy with a lot of the spend clustering around a few of the AI-native labs.""

Jassy said the AI market has become more like a ""barbell,"" with the AI labs on one side and enterprises on the other end, looking to the technology as a ""productivity and cost avoidance"" tool. The middle is comprised of enterprises that are in various stages of building AI applications, he said. 

""That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,"" Jassy said.

Oops, something went wrong

Bit Digital Inc (NASDAQ:BTBT) is one of the best stocks under $3 to invest in. On January 29, Bit Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) announced it will discontinue its Bitcoin mining operations and focus instead on artificial intelligence (AI) computing and Ethereum infrastructure. The company now believes that Bitcoin mining “became a less efficient use of capital relative to opportunities that allow for active participation, yield generation, and operational leverage,” as opined by Bit Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) CEO Sam Tabar in a shareholder letter.

This is an uncommon development, as publicly traded companies that deal with cryptocurrencies typically tend to focus solely on Bitcoin, and this decision by Bit Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) makes it one of the few companies in the cryptocurrency space that is moving away from Bitcoin. In connection with the new main points of focus for Bit Digital Inc (NASDAQ:BTBT), the company also revealed that it holds over 150,000 ETH, which is mostly being used for crypto staking activities to generate additional cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Bit Digital affirmed its commitment to AI company WhiteFiber, where it holds a majority ownership stake, stating it will not sell any of its WhiteFiber shares this year.

Bit Digital Inc (NASDAQ:BTBT) offers cloud services for machine learning and artificial intelligence and engages in cryptocurrency mining and staking.

While we acknowledge the potential of BTBT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Quantum computing is moving from theory to long term strategic consideration, and Strategy (MSTR) has made it clear it intends to be proactive rather than reactive during the company's Q4 earnings call on Thursday.

Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, plans to initiate a bitcoin security program to coordinate with the global cyber, crypto, and bitcoin security community.

The company addressed growing discussion around quantum risk and reaffirmed its commitment to bitcoin security, framing quantum not as an immediate threat but as a future engineering challenge the network can prepare for.

Strategy reported a net loss of $12.4 billion for the quarter. Shares fell 17% on the day, trading as low as $104, but market focus quickly shifted to executive chairman Michael Saylor's commentary. 

Saylor revisited a long list of historical Bitcoin FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that the network has already overcome quantum concerns, while acknowledging that quantum deserves serious long term planning.

The company outlined a range of key points on quantum computing, predicting that quantum technology is likely more than a decade away and pointing out that the Bitcoin community is already researching quantum-resistant cryptography.

Shares are up 6% in pre-market trading as bitcoin has rebounded to $65,000.

Oops, something went wrong

MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell 62.5% year-over-year despite holding 713,502 bitcoins at 10% above its $76,052 cost basis.

MicroStrategy reported a $17.44B unrealized loss in Q4 due to fair value accounting changes adopted in Q1 2025.

Thirteen of fourteen analysts rate MSTR as Buy with average price target of $452 representing 270% upside.

Investors rethink 'hands off' investing and decide to start making real money

After Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) (formerly MicroStrategy) stock cratered 18.4% in the past week and sat 62.5% below where it traded a year ago, the stock saw a sharp reversal on Friday. At $125.75, is this still a buying opportunity, or is it a value trap?

After adopting fair value accounting for crypto assets in Q1 2025, MSTR reported a $17.44 billion unrealized loss on digital assets in Q4 2025. This drove EPS to negative $42.93, versus expectations of positive $2.97.

This is an accounting artifact, not an operational failure. MSTR holds 713,502 bitcoins with a cost basis of $76,052 per coin. Bitcoin currently trades at approximately $83,800, meaning the company holds an unrealized gain of roughly 10% above its cost basis. But CEO Phong Le continues to accumulate. He said:

We raised $25.3 billion of capital in 2025 to advance our Bitcoin treasury strategy [...] We increased our holdings to 713,502 bitcoins, including 41,002 bitcoins acquired in January 2026 alone.

Thirteen of fourteen analysts rate MSTR as Buy or Strong Buy, with an average price target of $452, or 270% upside from current levels. The stock trades at a trailing P/E of just 5.3 with 25.6% return on equity.

The RSI hit 24.27 on February 5, deep into oversold territory. MSTR historically bounces from these levels within 10 to 15 trading days. Insiders are buying: CEO Le purchased preferred shares on January 8, while director Carl Rickertsen bought 5,000 common shares at $155.88 on January 12.

If Bitcoin recovers to $100,000 or higher, MSTR offers leveraged exposure without self-custody hassles. The company's $2.30 billion cash position and $2.25 billion USD reserve cover dividends and interest for years without forced Bitcoin sales.

Bitcoin's recent volatility remains a concern. While the company currently holds an unrealized gain on its Bitcoin position, prediction markets show only a 15.5% probability Bitcoin reaches $85,000 this month. If Bitcoin falls below the company's $76,052 cost basis, MSTR's unrealized losses would compound rapidly.

The stock's beta of 3.5 amplifies every Bitcoin move. MSTR raised $25.3 billion last year by issuing shares, diluting existing shareholders, and plans to continue this strategy indefinitely.

EVP Wei-Ming Shao sold over 20,000 shares at $200 to $250 in November 2025, just before the collapse.

MSTR represents a leveraged Bitcoin bet wrapped in a software company. The stock's performance will largely depend on Bitcoin's trajectory. With analyst price targets averaging $452 (270% above current levels) but Bitcoin prediction markets showing only 15.5% probability of reaching $85,000 this month, the stock faces significant uncertainty. The company's 3.5 beta means it amplifies Bitcoin moves threefold in both directions. Those considering the stock should evaluate their Bitcoin outlook and risk tolerance accordingly.

 

For more than a decade, the investing advice aimed at everyday Americans followed a familiar script: automate everything, keep costs low, and don't touch a thing. And increasingly, investors are realizing that being completely hands-off also means being completely disengaged.

That realization hits like a lightning bolt when you realize not just how much better your returns could be, but that there are amazing offers like one app where new self-directed investing accounts funded with as little as $50 can receive stock worth up to $1,000.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is already down by 25% so far in 2026 despite a decent run of technical successes with upgrades to its chain last year. At the same time, Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) has also seen a sharp decline over the last 30 days, with its market cap collapsing from $4.7 billion to $3.8 billion.

Dips like these might prove to be good crypto buying opportunities. But which of these two coins is worth investing $2,500 in, and why?

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Thanks to a slew of upgrades over the last couple of years, the Ethereum of today isn't the bloated, slow, and expensive-to-use chain that it was in the past. Its gas fees are now far less prone to spiking, and also far cheaper in absolute terms. An average swap now only costs around $0.15 where it once cost $1, and before that, $15 or more.

The network's roadmap suggests the chain will scale further to drive down costs and improve speeds, with the upcoming ""Glamsterdam"" upgrade next on the docket, slated for the first half of 2026. A key enabling piece Glamsterdam will bring is called proto-danksharding, which adds a cheaper lane for the data that Layer-2 blockchains post to Ethereum.

In English, small blockchains built on Ethereum compress many transactions into bundles, then publish that data back to the main chain (Ethereum) to permanently settle the transactions. Assuming Ethereum continues to expand the data lanes available to chains built on its backbone, it can narrow both the speed and cost gaps with speedy, low-cost competitors like Solana.

And that means Glamsterdam will make Ethereum even more attractive for developers building high-throughput applications. In other words, there's soon going to be yet another incentive for people to buy and hold Ethereum, and that's bullish.

As a meme coin, Shiba Inu's price can still spike on sentiment, but it totally lacks a real long-term use case, which would require anyone to buy and hold it.

There is, of course, the Shibarium, which is a Layer-2 chain built on top of Ethereum. Yet hardly anybody is using the Shibarium for any purpose today. It generated approximately $1 in chain fees, and about $81 in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on Feb. 1.

When the economic engine supposedly intended to power a coin's growth is that ineffectual, the investment thesis collapses into a hope and a prayer that something better will happen down the line. And that isn't really an investment thesis at all.

So if you're choosing between Shiba Inu and Ethereum for an investment of $2,500, this is an incredibly easy call. Buy Ethereum, and avoid Shiba Inu.

Ethereum has entered an aggressive deleveraging phase, breaking decisively lower after weeks of distribution near the upper boundary of its medium-term range. A key macro driver behind this move appears to be the recent escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which has pushed broader risk assets into de-risking mode and amplified existing technical fragilities in the ETH market.

The combination of macro uncertainty, elevated leverage, and vulnerable chart structure has produced a sharp unwind rather than a controlled pullback.

On the daily chart, ETH has broken down from the prior ascending structure that extended from the late-2025 lows and has failed to break above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now both located above the $3,000 mark. This price behavior has confirmed a transition from corrective sideways action into a clear downside trend.

The price has also broken below the first major demand band around the $2,200-$2,000 area, which coincides with a prior consolidation base and the origin of the last strong impulsive advance. Daily RSI has also fallen into deeply oversold territory in the low 20s, indicating stretched short-term conditions.

However, as long as the market remains capped below the broken moving averages and former support around $2,200, the broader structure continues to point toward a bear-market rally at best rather than a confirmed reversal.



The 4-hour chart highlights the velocity of the current sell-off, with ETH cascading lower from the previously defended $2,800–$2,900 support and barely pausing on intermediate levels. The market is now trying to stabilize around the $1,850–$1,900 range, and a mild bullish divergence is emerging on the 4-hour RSI, where momentum has begun to print higher lows despite marginally lower price lows.

This configuration often signals that forced selling pressure is easing and that a short-term relief bounce or sideways consolidation may follow.

Immediate resistance now sits in the $2,100–$2,200 area, with a stronger supply zone at $2,800. Any rebound that stalls below these bands would keep the intraday trend firmly bearish, while a clean breakdown below the recent $1,800 low would pave the way toward the deeper demand zone at $1,500.



On the derivatives side, open interest across Ethereum futures has collapsed from elevated levels above 30 billion USD to nearly a third that size, tracking the price decline and signaling a large-scale liquidation cascade rather than an orderly reduction in positioning. This sharp contraction in open interest indicates that a significant portion of leveraged longs has been forced out of the market, with margin calls and auto-deleveraging accelerating the downside once key support levels failed.

While such events are painful in the short term, they also tend to cleanse excess leverage from the system, leaving a lighter positioning backdrop where spot flows and fresh capital, rather than crowded derivatives exposure, can play a larger role in setting the next directional move.

 This week's crypto bloodbath hasn't just worried bitcoin owners. It's also sparked fresh anxieties about the future of digital assets.


 The price of bitcoin plunged yesterday to near $60,000, marking one of its worst single-day declines in the past decade. Though the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has been recouping some lost ground so far Friday—it was recently trading around $71,000—the week's losses are still tracking in the double-digits. Other crypto assets have also seen pronounced declines.


 Altcoins including ether and solana have seen losses of around 25%; Hyperliquid's native token, up about 11%, was a lonely bright spot. Digital asset treasury companies took a beating: Strategy (MSTR), Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and Twenty One Capital (XXI) have all seen double-digit pullbacks over the past five trading days.


The emergence of artificial intelligence appears to be killing software stocks, and bitcoin, suggesting new technologies are making cryptocurrencies look outdated.

 Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD) and Circle (CRCL) have also also seen double-digitl pullbacks this week, though they, too, were rebouding. Friday. Gemini (GEMI), the Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange said it planned to shutter operations overseas and cut 200 people from its workforce as part of a broad restructuring.


 CoinMarketCap's Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which is calculated using factors including price momentum, volatility, and user engagement levels, remains at ""extreme fear"" levels. Lately, analysts have started to link bitcoin's carnage to that seen in software stocks. That has given rise to a fresh set of anxieties around digital assets.


 Bitcoin has been broadly correlated with, or moving alongside, major asset classes including the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, but it has been holding hands with software stocks lately, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky said on CNBC Friday morning.


 The $60,000 low was a ""pretty good level to trade against,"" he said. ""Now on the upside you really need to see it back above $73,000—that was the key breakdown level.""


 Bitcoin ETFs saw roughly $1.25 billion in net outflows in the past three days, with some $434 million of that coming yesterday, according to Farside Investors. But more than 90% of the assets under management between those funds is ""hanging tough,"" Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in a social media most Friday morning, indicating that they mostly haven't sold.


 As the price of bitcoin tumbled, some investors homed in on Strategy's average purchase price. But others think more important numbers are those associated with big crypto ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The average bitcoin purchase price for those funds is at $90,000, according to Jim Bianco of Bianco Research, meaning ETF holders are ""underwater"" with some $15 billion in unrealized losses.

              Highlights            



                        Capital is exiting crypto at near crypto-winter levels, bitcoin has fallen below $70K wiping out bull-market gains and more speculative digital assets have seen massive drawdowns.                      


                        As crypto falls, stablecoins are gaining adoption in payments, payroll, and treasury use cases driven by utility, not speculation.                      


                        Institutional rollout and regulatory direction point to blockchain's future as financial infrastructure, less so crypto markets and retail trading.                      

The cryptocurrency market's familiar boom-and-bust cycle has entered another pronounced downswing. Capital is leaving digital assets at a pace not seen since the depths of the last crypto winter, institutional allocations are shrinking as outflows grow and the speculative energy that once powered the crypto-native verticals of the blockchain space is beginning to run on fumes.

As of reporting, bitcoin's price has dropped below $70,000, erasing all of its bull-market gains and sending shocks throughout the broader marketplace. Crypto treasury firm Strategy is down 81% from its all-time-high, while meme coins such as Trump Coin and Melania Coin are down 95% and 99% from their own respective upper limit valuations.

Against this chilly backdrop, one might expect broader blockchain sentiment to be down. Instead, the inverse is happening, with the value proposition of stablecoins and other institutional blockchain instruments in fact rising inside traditional financial workflows.

The explanation lies outside the crypto ecosystem itself. Stablecoins are being pulled into traditional financial contexts where their appeal has little to do with speculation and everything to do with speed, programmability and access.

From the European Union's digital euro push to Tether's U.S. updates, stablecoin corporate payroll wallets for global workforces, Y-Combinator's stablecoin seed funding move, U.S. regulatory gridlock and white label issuance, this was a week that showed how the chips are starting to fall for the blockchain finance landscape and why it more and more looks like real-world utility over web3 speculation.

Cross-border payments, treasury management for global companies and payroll for distributed workforces are all areas where legacy systems remain expensive and slow. Stablecoins offer an alternative that does not require belief in token appreciation, only trust in the peg and the issuer. In that sense, they are starting to resemble narrow banking instruments rather than crypto assets.

As covered here Tuesday (Feb. 3), startup incubator Y Combinator (YC) announced that its latest class of startups can now choose to receive their seed funding of $500,000 from YC in stablecoins.

Meanwhile, news broke Monday (Feb. 2) that payments infrastructure company NymCard can now settle card transactions with Visa using USDC stablecoins in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region.

And this most recent earnings season offered a look into how the world's biggest payment networks are already moving from concept to execution with their stablecoin products. Visa, for example, reported an annualized global stablecoin settlement run rate of $4.6 billion and said it now enables stablecoin card issuance in more than 50 countries; while Mastercard stressed that stablecoins are beginning to function as just another form of currency that benefits from being routed through a trusted global network.

Elsewhere, on Jan. 28, the payroll and payments platform Papaya Global partnered with digital asset infrastructure firm Fireblocks to power its global payroll offerings with stablecoin payouts.

These use cases matter because they anchor stablecoins in recurring, non-speculative demand.

Of course, as the Thursday (Feb. 5) partnership between stablecoin issuer Circle and prediction market Polymarket shows, speculation hasn't entirely left the landscape, just taken up a different form.

The PYMNTS Intelligence and Citi report “Chain Reaction: Regulatory Clarity as the Catalyst for Blockchain Adoption” found that blockchain's next leap will be shaped by regulation; that evolving guidance is beginning to create the foundations for safe, scalable blockchain adoption; and that implementation challenges continue to complicate progress.

In the United States, however, lawmaker gridlock around key stablecoin yield questions has left crypto market legislation in limbo. The debate has reached such a crescendo that Citi analysts have noted the growing chance that the CLARITY Act's passage could be delayed beyond 2026, although there is also a chance it may still pass this year.

Across the Atlantic in the EU, tokenized instrument such as the digital euro are gaining steam as a payment sovereignty play.

“To put it bluntly, we are very dependent on US corporations in payments today – too dependent. Payments are part of our critical infrastructure. And we really ought to stand on our own two feet when it comes to critical infrastructure. The digital euro would be the first and only digital means of payment built on a European infrastructure that could be used seamlessly throughout the euro area,” Burkhard Balz, member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, said in a Jan. 27 speech.

The India Blockchain Alliance (IBA) and TheBlock. have announced a strategic partnership to establish the UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor, a cross-border initiative aimed at strengthening technology collaboration and accelerating innovation between India and the United Arab Emirates.

The Corridor is designed to link India's deep pool of technology talent and digital innovation capabilities with the UAE's advanced regulatory environment, global market access, and investment infrastructure. By enabling structured cooperation across Web3, artificial intelligence, digital assets, cybersecurity, and other deep technologies, the initiative seeks to translate bilateral ties into sustained enterprise adoption, startup growth, and digital trade.

Danosch Zahedi, CEO of TheBlock., described the initiative as a new model for international technology partnerships. “The UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor aims to be a catalyst for redefining how two innovation-driven nations collaborate. The UAE has built one of the world's most advanced regulatory and investment ecosystems, and India brings unmatched talent depth and digital capability. Together, we are creating a cross-border innovation engine that will accelerate enterprise adoption, empower startups, and unlock new economic value for both countries.”

The Corridor will serve a broad set of stakeholders, including governments, enterprises, startups, investors, and academic institutions. Planned activities include regulatory dialogue and sandbox frameworks, support for cross-border market entry, co-investment pathways, and initiatives to promote talent mobility through joint research and skills development.

The economic impact is expected to be meaningful for both countries. India stands to strengthen its global position in Web3 and AI, expand digital services exports, and create high-skilled jobs, while the UAE aims to reinforce its role as a global hub for advanced technologies, attract high-value enterprises and talent, and support economic diversification.

The UAE–India Web3 & AI Business Corridor will be rolled out in phases, starting with joint working groups, ecosystem partnerships, and pilot programs, followed by cross-border accelerators, investment platforms, and interoperable technology standards. Over time, the partners expect it to emerge as a globally recognised model for cross-border digital economy collaboration.

DMG Blockchain Solutions (OTCQB: DMGGF) received a $1.5 million energy efficiency incentive for deploying hydro direct liquid cooled (DLC) server technology at its Christina Lake data center, based on an independent energy‑savings study. January preliminary operations: 23 BTC mined, 1.69 EH/s hashrate, and a 414 BTC balance. The company said it sold some mined bitcoin to fund operations and is delaying the Boardman, Oregon acquisition while due diligence issues are resolved. DMG named Steven Eliscu corporate secretary, adding to his COO role, and reiterated plans to convert Christina Lake into an AI data center.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  06, 2026  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB US: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (“DMG”), a leading vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, announces it has been awarded a $1.5 million energy efficiency incentive related to the deployment of hydro direct liquid cooled (DLC) server technology at its Christina Lake data center facility.

This incentive was based on an energy efficiency study performed by an independent third party, which calculated a target energy savings for a given computational capacity using air-cooled technology and the resulting energy savings by converting to DLC. From the estimated savings and the budget to deploy the new cooling technology, an energy efficiency incentive was offered to encourage DMG's investment in this upgrade.

DMG's CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented, “We were pleased when the final results of the energy efficiency study exceeded our initial calculations for savings. This was a major project for our local Christina Lake operations team, and we are using this upgrade as the cornerstone for future hydro implementations as well as for other potential novel technology improvements. We are honored to have been recognized for our operational expertise in utilizing the latest chip cooling technology. In addition to announcing this incentive, DMG remains actively focused on activities to convert its Christina Lake facility into a world-class AI data center.”

January 2026 Preliminary Operational Results

DMG's hashrate averaged 1.69 EH/s in January, down from 1.77 EH/s in the prior month, as it adjusted its equipment operation to focus on profitability over hashrate generation. At the end of January, DMG held 414 bitcoin, as the Company liquidated a portion of its mined bitcoin to fund operations.

Update on Boardman, Oregon Data Center Site

During due diligence, DMG encountered issues that have delayed the closing of the transaction to purchase a building on an 18-acre property in Boardman, Oregon. As a result, the Company is no longer providing guidance regarding the timing of the transaction close and will issue updates as they become available. There is no guarantee that the Company will complete this acquisition.

Appointment of Corporate Secretary

DMG announces that it has appointed Steven Eliscu as Corporate Secretary, which adds to his current role as Chief Operating Officer, and he succeeds Catherine Cox, who has resigned from the role. The Company thanks Catherine Cox for her service.

About DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.

Last week's poll was pretty decisive: 50% of you said RektGuy's real edge was perfect timing—it landed right as people were getting wrecked and instantly felt emotionally true. The three-way 17% tie for trust-first strategy, OSF as a public face, and constant experimentation reads like the sustaining layer: timing opened the door, but credibility, low-expectations building, and continued momentum kept people around. The funniest tell is 0% for “meme power”—not because it isn't a meme, but because you see meme-ness as table stakes; the differentiator was when it hit and how it was carried afterward.

The NFT market just slid back to something that feels familiar to anyone who was here before the mania: total sector market cap fell below $1.5B, roughly back to pre-2021 levels.

Some of that is simply macro. Crypto sold off hard over the past two weeks, with total market cap dropping from about $3.1T to $2.2T. Bitcoin and Ethereum—still the two biggest NFT networks by recent trading volume—fell sharply in the same window. When liquidity leaves the majors, NFTs tend to feel it fast.

But there's also an NFT-specific story underneath the price action: supply is still growing while demand is thinning. Minting got cheaper and easier in 2025, and the numbers reflect that. NFT supply reportedly rose to nearly 1.3B tokens (up 25% YoY), while total sales fell 37% to $5.6B, and the average sale price dipped below $100. More tokens, fewer buyers, lower prices—an abundance era.

At the same time, the industry is visibly contracting. We've seen a run of high-profile exits and closures: Nike reportedly offloaded RTFKT; Nifty Gateway says it will shut down on Feb. 23; and social NFT app Rodeo announced it's winding down after struggling to scale sustainably.

Here's the slightly positive (no-hype) takeaway: resets aren't funerals. They're filter events. When speculation stops doing the work, the market starts asking harder questions—about curation, distribution, durability, and what's actually worth collecting. In a low-liquidity environment, attention becomes the scarce asset. That's uncomfortable—but it's also where stronger work, stronger communities, and better infrastructure have a chance to stand out.

Key Takeaways

Vitalik declares “branded shards” obsolete as L2 decentralization lags and L1 scaling via the Glamsterdam fork accelerates.

True scaling now requires “full faith and credit” of L1, pushing L2s toward Based Rollups and Native Precompiles.

Generic L2s face an existential crisis; survival requires specialized services like privacy or high-frequency gaming execution environments.

In early 2026, Ethereum stands at a historic crossroads, forcing a fundamental re-evaluation of its rollup-centric roadmap. For years, the community prioritized Layer 1 (L1) as a secure settlement layer while delegating transaction execution to Layer 2 (L2) solutions, yet this strategic isolation has reached its limit.

Amidst this transition, Vitalik Buterin now declares the end of the original vision for Ethereum Layer 2 as “branded shards,” arguing it no longer serves the modern ecosystem.

The creator of Ethereum's stunning pivot signals a new era for the network, moving away from fragmented scaling toward a more integrated and fluid technical reality.

Developers originally envisioned L2s like Arbitrum and Base as direct extensions of Ethereum, the “branded shards” that would handle massive traffic while inheriting full L1 security. Reality, however, hit significant roadblocks. 

On February 3, 2026, Vitalik noted that progress toward “Stage 2” decentralization remains far slower than expected. Most L2s still reside in Stage 1 or even Stage 0, where centralized “Security Councils” maintain power to revert transactions, contradicting Ethereum's trustless nature.

There have recently been some discussions on the ongoing role of L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem, especially in the face of two facts:

* L2s' progress to stage 2 (and, secondarily, on interop) has been far slower and more difficult than originally expected * L1 itself is scaling,…

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 3, 2026



A new and unexpected conflict has emerged between decentralization and regulation. Some L2 teams now explicitly state that they might never move beyond Stage 1. Their institutional and corporate customers demand ultimate control to meet regulatory requirements. Once a legal authority requires a chain to freeze assets or revert a fraudulent transaction, the developers must have a “backdoor” to comply.

Vitalik acknowledges that while this serves specific customer needs, it disqualifies the network from being a true scaling solution for Ethereum. If a multisig bridge mediates the connection between an L2 and the L1, the L2 does not truly scale Ethereum; it merely acts as a separate chain with a convenient link. Reality is forcing a fundamental re-evaluation of what an L2's purpose should actually be in a regulated world.

Original justifications for the rollup-centric roadmap relied on the idea that Ethereum L1 could never scale enough to support global demand. Nonetheless, the technical landscape in 2026 tells a different story. Following the Fusaka upgrade (Dec 2025), Ethereum L1 is scaling directly and efficiently.

Ethereum developers have successfully navigated upgrades, allowing the L1 to handle more data. As we move through 2026, the network anticipates massive gas limit increases, targeting 200M in the Glamsterdam fork, providing significantly more block space. With L1 fees remaining low even during high activity, the primary reason for generic L2s to exist begins to crumble. Users no longer need to migrate to an L2 just to avoid high gas fees.

When the L1 can handle thousands of transactions per second at a low cost, the primary reason for generic L2s to exist begins to crumble. Users no longer need to migrate to an L2 just to avoid high gas fees. 

Vitalik now clarifies that “scaling Ethereum” means creating block space that carries the “full faith and credit” of the mainnet. Protocol rules must guarantee that transactions are valid, uncensored, and irreversible. If an L2 provides high speed but relies on a centralized sequencer or a multisig bridge that can be compromised, it fails this definition.

Because the L1 is growing its own capacity, it no longer requires L2s to act as “shards.” Instead, it requires them to offer specialized services that the L1 simply cannot provide, such as privacy-preserving computations or specific execution environments for gaming and high-frequency trading.

To address these challenges, Ethereum's founder proposes a technical pivot toward deep integration over isolated execution. Two core pillars defining this vision are Based Rollups and native rollup precompiles, to solve fragmentation via synchronous composability.

Traditional L2s rely on independent sequencers, which fragment liquidity and prevent atomic cross-layer transactions. Vitalik's proposal for Based Rollups lets Ethereum L1 determine transaction ordering for the L2, enabling synchronous composability, allowing a single L1 transaction to interact with both layers simultaneously.

To balance speed, a hybrid block strategy allows L2 sequencers to provide sub-second latency while finalizing a “slot-ending block” on the L1 every 12 seconds. Furthermore, by “enshrining” ZK-EVM proofs via Native Rollup Precompiles, L2s can inherit Ethereum's full security and automatic upgrades, effectively eliminating the need for centralized “Security Councils.”

Many L2s face an existential crisis. Projects that lack a unique community or specialized technology, often referred to as “Zombie L2s,” now struggle to attract users. In a world where Ethereum L1 is cheap and fast, a generic L2 with no unique features offers no reason for migration.

While other L2 blockchains struggle, Base emerges as the gold standard for this new era. Coinbase has successfully shifted the narrative for Base, with superior UX and effective product integration, seamlessly onboarding new users via Coinbase. Thus, Base now competes directly with Solana and BNB Chain. The growth of this prominent Layer 2 depends on distribution and product-market fit, even though it uses Ethereum as a technical foundation.

Vitalik encourages L2 developers to stop trying to be “branded shards.” Instead, they should explore the “full spectrum” of connectivity to Ethereum. This includes:

Have been following reactions to what I said about L2s about 1.5 days ago.

Vitalik Buterin's new roadmap prioritizes transparency and security. He wants a world where users know exactly what guarantees they have. If an L2 chooses to remain centralized for regulatory reasons, it must be honest about that choice. If an L2 wants the full security of Ethereum, it now has a technical path via Based Rollups and Native Precompiles to achieve it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO updates on plans for supporting economic growth as key parts of the DUA Act come into force (via Passle)","https://thelens.slaughterandmay.com/post/102mgva/ico-updates-on-plans-for-supporting-economic-growth-as-key-parts-of-the-dua-act-c","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 13:47:29 GMT","

This time last year, the ICO published a letter to the UK government setting out five new initiatives to support innovation and sustain economic growth (which we discuss in our blog). The ICO has now published its follow-up letter, providing an update on progress since. With the main data protection changes from the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUA Act) having come into force yesterday and arguably heralding a new pro-growth era for UK data protection, we outline below the key takeaways from this latest ICO letter.

Regulatory certainty on AI for businesses

The ICO is now actively working on a statutory code of practice on AI and automated decision-making (ADM), whereas it was merely in contemplation last year. Exact timings are still unclear, although the ICO explains it has “worked closely with government on scope and timelines for the required secondary legislation to enable the rules to become a statutory code of practice”. Separately, the ICO is also making updates to its existing ADM and profiling guidance to reflect the DUA Act changes. The ICO had promised to launch a consultation on these updates by the end of 2025, but this has now slipped until ‘Winter 2025/2026'. Given the pace of AI development, particularly around agentic AI (see the ICO's report and this blog), refreshed guidance should provide organisations with the certainty they need to innovate, and hopefully will now follow soon. 

Cutting costs for SMEs

The ICO will deliver the expanded data essentials training and assurance platform it promised in 2025 by Spring 2026, to help SMEs use personal data with confidence. The need to support SMEs navigate compliance burdens without unnecessary risk aversion has also been recognised at EU level, with the European Data Protection Board publishing its Helsinki statement in July 2025.  

Enabling more innovation through the ICO Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Advice services

In 2025, the ICO suggested implementing an experimentation regime within their regulatory sandbox. This would allow businesses to have a time-limited derogation from specific regulatory requirements to test new ideas. The ICO has now committed to implementing this and has secured the funding from the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) for feasibility and design work. This is a positive development but one which still seems to require a number of steps, including the publication of reports on the potential economic impact and levels of demand for the service, a citizens' jury looking into the public's views and expectations, an alignment with the government's AI Growth Lab proposals and, crucially, legislative change to allow for real-world testing of emerging technologies. 

Unlocking privacy-preserving online advertising 

The ICO is still looking to support a shift to privacy-preserving forms of online advertising. In July 2025, the ICO launched a consultation on its enforcement approach to online advertising, to inform which low-risk advertising activities wouldn't be prioritised for enforcement (where carried out without user consent). The ICO letter confirms that it will be reporting to the Government on these low-risk activities this spring, with a view to the Government adding them, via regulations, to the list of consent exceptions in PECR. There is no further mention of the ICO's amended enforcement approach, which raises the question as to whether this project has been superseded by plans to change the law instead.  

Making it quicker and easier to transfer data internationally

The ICO published its updated guidance on international transfers last month and as we discuss in our blog, the guidance is more detailed than previously and, overall, presents a pragmatic approach which businesses will find helpful. 

Looking ahead

The ICO will continue with its plan to produce guidance on the DUA Act changes. In addition, the ICO commits to: 

The ICO will also become a corporate body, which may bring a greater range of perspectives on its governing board. That, and other factors, may influence the exact way the ICO delivers on its plans, but the direction of travel and sustained commitment to supporting innovation and growth are clear.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Philippines: BSP plans CBDC for government bond settlements","https://coingeek.com/philippines-bsp-plans-cbdc-for-government-bond-settlements/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:02:32 GMT","

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is planning to use its upcoming wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to facilitate the settlement of government bonds in the Philippines.

Local news outlet GMA News Online reported on February 2 that the BSP is currently working to develop a strategic CBDC roadmap based on insights from Project Agila, the central bank's first CBDC pilot.

“What we are thinking of doing next is to focus on wholesale CBDC settling government bonds, [because] the Bureau of the Treasury moved ahead with their pilot of the tokenized treasury bonds. It just lacked a settlement instrument, so we will be providing that with CBDC,” BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan said.

In 2023, the central bank announced the revival of Project Agila, which was initially introduced in 2022. The CBDC project was completed for testing in 2024, with participation from several financial institutions, including BDO Unibank Inc., China Banking Corporation, Land Bank of the Philippines, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Union Bank of the Philippines, and Maya Philippines Inc.

Additionally, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) launched Philippine peso-dominant Tokenized Treasury Bonds (TTBs) with the goal of raising PHP10 billion ($169 million) from the domestic bond market. These bonds were issued as digital tokens and are managed using the BTr's distributed ledger technology (DLT).

Now the BSP is exploring the use of wholesale CBDCs for interbank payments, securities transactions, and cross-border payments involving commercial banks and other financial institutions. However, Tangonan has not specified a timeline for the second proof of concept, as the agency needs to expand its scope and collaborate with additional participating banks.

“We need to broaden that to more institutions so that all of us will learn from the next proof of concept, especially when we need to test the settlement of government bonds,” he said.

What are CBDCs?

CBDCs, or central bank digital currencies, are blockchain-based tokens issued by a country's central bank. While traditional digital currencies are decentralized, CBDCs are regulated and managed by an official financial authority of the nation.

There are two types of CBDCs: retail and wholesale. Retail CBDCs are digital currencies intended for public use. In contrast, wholesale CBDCs are digital tokens issued to commercial banks and other financial institutions. They are designed to facilitate interbank settlements, tokenized securities transactions, and cross-border payments, among other functions. Wholesale CBDCs improve liquidity management and reduce settlement risks compared to their retail counterparts.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, and seven Chinese regulatory agencies published a joint statement on Friday banning the unapproved issuance of Renminbi-pegged stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

The ban applies to both domestic and foreign stablecoin and tokenized RWA issuers, according to the statement, which was also signed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and China's Securities Regulatory Commission. A translation of the announcement said:

Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at New York University (NYU) Law School and former Managing Director of CIC, China's sovereign wealth fund, told Cointelegraph that the ban extends to the onshore and offshore versions of China's Renminbi, also called the yuan. 

“The Beijing crypto ban rule applies across all RMB-related markets, whether CNH or CNY,” he said. CNH is the offshore version of the Renminbi, designed to give the currency flexibility in foreign exchange markets, without sacrificing currency controls, Ma said.

“This is the latest step in a multi‑year project: Keep speculative crypto outside the formal financial system, while actively promoting the usage of e-CNY, the sovereign CBDC issued by China's central bank,” he said. 

The announcement follows the Chinese government approving commercial banks to share interest with clients holding the country's digital yuan, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) managed by state authorities.

Chinese government briefly considered yuan-pegged stables, but focused on CBDC instead

In August 2025, reports began circulating that China's government was considering allowing private companies to issue yuan-pegged stablecoins, a major reversal of long-standing policy. 

However, the Chinese government restricted stablecoin and digital asset issuance in September of that same year, instructing stablecoin issuers to pause or halt their stablecoin trials until further notice.

In January 2026, the PBOC approved commercial banks paying interest to digital yuan wallets in a push to make the CBDC more attractive to investors.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its latest Financial Stability Report (FSR) on 31 December 2025, highlighting the resilience of the Indian economy amid a volatile global political and economic landscape. Among its key features is a dedicated special chapter on stablecoins titled “Financial stability implications of stablecoins”. The inclusion of this chapter is notable, reflecting the growing importance of stablecoins within global financial systems and the regulatory scrutiny they continue to attract.





The importance placed on stablecoins by the RBI is not misplaced. Over the past few years, stablecoins have witnessed significant adoption, with their market capitalisation reaching approximately USD 300 billion as of December 2025. Some jurisdictions have also begun moving towards formal legal recognition of these instruments. Notably, the United States enacted the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for United States Stablecoins Act, 2025 (GENIUS Act), which establishes a legal framework for the issuance of payment stablecoins.

The GENIUS Act introduces multiple safeguards for stablecoins issued by non-government entities. These include clarity on the nature of such instruments as payment stablecoins rather than securities or commodities, consumer protection measures such as a requirement to maintain 1:1 reserves in cash or deposits, and bankruptcy protections that exclude reserve assets from the issuer's bankruptcy estate while granting priority to stablecoin holders.

With nearly 99 percent of stablecoins denominated in the USD, and with the regulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act, the adoption of stablecoins is expected to grow exponentially and define the new-age cross-border payments ecosystem. Many banks, financial institutions and fintech companies in the United States are already gearing up for the issuance and trading of payment stablecoins, which may significantly influence global payment flows.





In contrast, the RBI has had its reservations on such legitimisation of issuance, trading and use of stablecoins in India. Fundamentally, stablecoins are crypto assets issued by private entities and denominated in currencies such as the USD or the Euro, which aim to maintain a stable value by being pegged to specific assets or baskets of assets. To back their liabilities, many large private stablecoin issuers typically invest in and hold short-term government securities, such as United States treasury bills. This structure can create a liquidity mismatch, given the on-demand redemption feature of stablecoins and the tenure of short-term government debt instruments. In stressed market conditions, this mismatch may amplify liquidity pressures and trigger redemption runs.

Another dominant concern expressed by the RBI with respect to stablecoins is the principle of the singleness of money. In a robust financial system, one rupee issued by a commercial bank must be interchangeable with one rupee issued by the central bank. Privately issued stablecoins, offered by various entities with varying degrees of transparency and creditworthiness, threaten this principle. As tradable instruments, stablecoins have also exhibited deviations from their pegged assets or currencies during periods of market stress, potentially leading to a fragmentation of the payment system and encouraging disintermediation from regulated financial institutions.





The widespread adoption of foreign-currency-denominated stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the USD, could shift domestic transactions to USD-pegged stablecoins and adversely impact the controlled capital regime of the Indian economy. As the use of stablecoins scales, it may also constrain the RBI's ability to monitor and manage foreign currency inflows and outflows. In addition, regulatory arbitrage with respect to crypto assets in India has enabled several fintech companies to develop on-ramping and off-ramping models for cross-border currency flows. These models allow stablecoins to circumvent the tightly controlled cross-border funds movements, complicating macroeconomic management and posing risks to foreign exchange reserves.

At the same time, one cannot turn a blind eye to the technological efficiencies associated with blockchain-based payment systems. Stablecoins demonstrate the potential for faster settlement, improved efficiency and reduced reliance on centralised intermediaries. Recognising this, recent statements by India's Finance Minister have emphasised the importance of engaging with the broader digital asset ecosystem, while also underscoring the need for global coordination and policy alignment.

In this context, India's policy choices appear to be shaped by the need to balance innovation with financial stability. While private issuance of stablecoins raises complex questions, the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) offers an alternative pathway for leveraging blockchain technology within a regulated and sovereign framework. A carefully designed CBDC may allow India to harness the benefits of digital payments while preserving monetary control and systemic safeguards.

As stablecoins continue to gain traction globally, India's engagement with this evolving ecosystem is likely to remain measured and deliberative. The path forward may lie not in immediate legitimisation, but in calibrated engagement, regulatory clarity, and alignment with broader macroeconomic objectives.

The price of Bitcoin fell to its lowest level in 16 months despite US president Donald Trump's personal and public support for cryptocurrency.

A single Bitcoin went as low as $60,000 (£44,000), its lowest level since September 2024, before rallying slightly.

The drop followed months of surging Bitcoin prices, which saw the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $122,200 in October 2025.

""Those who bet too big, borrowed too much or assumed prices only go up are now finding out the hard way what real market volatility and risk management look like,"" Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association told Reuters.

Investors were encouraged by Trump's involvement in the sector and his outspoken support for cryptocurrencies, as well as promises to ease legislation on the industry.

With Thursday's drop, Bitcoin prices are down 32% in the last 12 months and are trending toward prices seen in early 2024 and 2021.

Bitcoin is the world's largest and generally most well-known cryptocurrency, a form of digital-only money that is not controlled by a centralised financial institution.

According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 8% of UK adults were investing in crypto in 2025 - a drop of 4% from the year before.

But it said the typical amount of money held by individuals had now increased - with one in five holding between £1,000 and £5,000 in the digital currencies.

Among Trump's first actions upon re-entering the White House in January 2025 was an executive order aimed at making the US the ""crypto capital of the planet"".

In his first year back in office, Trump launched a personal brand of cryptocurrency, with the bulk of profits going into his own companies. And he continued his involvement with World Liberty Financial, an investment vehicle for other crypto assets that is owned by the Trump family.  

During the Trump administration so far, he has signed a law to support federal backing of cryptocurrency, dissolved a Department of Justice team focused on enforcement of crypto regulation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped crypto-related enforcement work and investigations.  

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in November called out Trump's ""pro-crypto agenda"", noting that the president had amassed crypto holdings worth more than $11bn and gained personal income of $800mn from crypto transactions since taking office.

Bitcoin prices tend to be volatile, but analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note on Wednesday that the latest drop was ""triggered by"" Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh, as the new chair of the Federal Reserve. Some believe he will take a more ""hawkish"" approach, keeping interest rates higher, whereas looser monetary policy tends to support investment in assets such as crypto currencies.

Bitcoin prices have been trending down for the last four months, Deutsche noted, and there has been growing negative sentiment around cryptocurrency more broadly.

""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" it said.

While Deutsche does not expect crypto to disappear, it also did not predict Bitcoin would return to Trump-driven highs.

The bank said the digital token was moving from being a ""purely speculative asset"" into a more realistic phase as an asset that ""needs to find its specific role"".

William Barhydt, chief executive of Abra Capital Management, an investment firm focused on crypto assets, agreed that cryptocurrency is maturing, but he expects prices to rebound.

""I wouldn't say that it has to rebound, but I can't see how it doesn't,"" Barhydt said, noting that this is not the first time Bitcoin has seen significant swings in value.

""The only way it doesn't is if we end up in some kind of war,"" Barhydt added. 

Other popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum and Solana. Their prices have both dropped roughly 37% so far in 2026. 

According to CoinGecko, which tracks the performance of thousands of cryptocurrencies, the market has lost over $1 trillion in value in the last month alone and $2 trillion in value since the market peaked in October.

Stifel, a US-based investment and research firm, said in a note to investors that Bitcoin prices may drop as low as $38,000. The firm pointed to a new trend of cryptocurrency more closely following the prices of the US Dollar.

Last week, the dollar dropped to its lowest point in four years.

The White House defended the post at first, calling to ""stop the fake outrage"", as members of both parties condemned the video. 

Trump says the US will ""run"" Venezuela and manage its oil after capturing its president Maduro.

The moves were planned before Trump said he wanted the Arctic island but they are being seen as a show of solidarity with Greenlanders. 

The military alleges the boat was travelling on a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific.

 It is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections.

Oops, something went wrong

BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China vowed to further tighten its crackdown on virtual currencies on Friday and banned unauthorised offshore issuance of yuan-pegged stablecoins.

Authorities will also strictly vet ​offshore issuance of tokens backed by Chinese onshore assets, according to a notice published ‌on the central bank's website.

Although the statement largely reiterates Beijing's existing ban on cryptocurrency, some are encouraged by signs China ‌is setting up a legal framework for the real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation business.

""The biggest breakthrough is a clear separation between virtual currencies and RWA,"" said Louis Wan, CEO of Unified Labs.

""Virtual currencies will still be outlawed, but RWA is being included in the regulatory system. For China's RWA business, this is a ⁠milestone.""

CENTRAL BANK ENFORCES MONOPOLY ON DIGITAL ‌YUAN

Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, said that China's central bank is essentially highlighting that only its own digital yuan is legitimate, ""not ‍a patchwork of private RMB (yuan) stablecoins circulating on global crypto exchanges.""

Beijing has long taken a tough stance on virtual currencies, but officials said recent ""speculative activities"" posed new challenges that warranted additional measures.

""Virtual currencies do not have ​the same legal status as fiat currencies,"" the People's Bank of China and seven other agencies ‌said in a joint statement, adding that business activities related to virtual currencies are ""illegal financial activities.""

Without official approval, ""domestic entities and their controlled overseas entities are prohibited from issuing virtual currencies overseas,"" they said.

Regulators also banned domestic and foreign entities from issuing offshore stablecoins pegged to the yuan without authorization.

""Stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies effectively perform some of the functions of fiat currencies in circulation,"" they ⁠said.

The central bank also warned financial institutions against providing banking ​and clearing services to virtual currency-related businesses.

Regarding the RWA ​business, under which all kinds of Chinese goods are being turned into digital assets with little oversight, offshore issuance of tokens must be strictly regulated by relevant ‍authorities, according to the notice.

""To ⁠some extent, this means China is allowing the issuance of offshore tokens based on onshore assets,"" said Alex Zuo, senior vice president of Singapore-based crypto custodian provider Cobo.

Previously, such ⁠a business was in a grey area.

""Next, we need to see if there will be detailed rules for execution, and ‌whether there will be successful cases,"" Zuo said.

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Thursday closed down -1.23%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -1.20%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -1.38%.  March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) fell -1.23%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) fell -1.40%.

Stock indexes extended this week's sell-off on Thursday, with the S&P 500 falling to a 1.5-month low and the Nasdaq 100 dropping to a 2.5-month low.  The sell-off in technology stocks persists, with Qualcomm falling more than -8% to lead chip stocks lower after it forecasted weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue. Also, cybersecurity stocks sold off on Thursday, led by a 9% decline in CrowdStrike Holdings. 

 


Losses in stocks accelerated on Thursday by signs of weakness in the US labor market after Challenger's January job cuts rose +117.8% y/y to 108,435, the largest amount of job cuts for a January since 2009.  Also, weekly initial unemployment claims rose by +22,000 to an 8-week high of 231,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 212,000.  In addition, the US Dec JOLTS job openings unexpectedly fell by -386,000 to a 5.25-year low of 6.542 million, versus expectations of an increase to 7.250 million. 

Fed Governor Lisa Cook said she supported last week's Fed decision to hold interest rates steady because she now sees ""risks as tilted toward higher inflation."" She added that, ""After nearly five years of above-target inflation, it is essential that we maintain our credibility by returning to a disinflationary path and achieving our target in the relatively near future.""

Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) plunged more than -12% on Thursday to a 1.25-year low as negative momentum deepened across cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin is down nearly 50% from its October record high, and inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs have reversed, with about $2 billion coming out of Bitcoin ETFs over the past month and more than $5 billion pulled out over the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 

The markets this week will focus on earnings and economic news. On Friday, the University of Michigan's Jan consumer sentiment index is expected to fall by -1.4 points to 55.0. 

Q4 earnings season is in full swing, with 150 of the S&P 500 companies scheduled to report earnings this week.  Earnings have been a positive factor for stocks, with 79% of the 275 S&P 500 companies that have reported beating expectations.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, S&P earnings growth is expected to climb by +8.4% in Q4, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.  Excluding the Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks, Q4 earnings are expected to increase by +4.6%.

The markets are discounting a 25% chance for a -25 bp rate cut at the next policy meeting on March 17-18.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Thursday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down by -0.75%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.64%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.88%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) on Thursday closed up by +16.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -6.4 bp to 4.210%.   Mar T-notes rallied to a 2.5-week high on Thursday, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 2.5-week low of 4.196%.  Thursday's stock market slump boosted demand for safe-haven government debt.  Gains in T-notes accelerated on Thursday on signs of weakness in the US labor market after Challenger job cuts soared, weekly initial unemployment claims rose more than expected to an 8-week high, and Dec JOLTS job openings unexpectedly fell to a 5.25-year low.  In addition, falling inflation expectations are supportive of T-notes as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.311% on Thursday. 

European government bond yields were mixed on Thursday.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.843%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2.5-month high of 4.597% and finished up by +1.2 bp to 4.559%.

Eurozone Dec retail sales fell -0.8% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.4% m/m and the biggest decline in 2.25 years.

German Dec factory orders unexpectedly rose +7.8% m/m, stronger than expectations of -2.2% m/m decline and the largest increase in two years.

As expected, the ECB kept the deposit facility rate unchanged at 2.00% and said, ""The economy remains resilient in a challenging global environment.  At the same time, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.""

As expected, the BOE held its policy rate steady at 3.75% in a 5-4 vote.  BOE Governor Bailey said upside risks to inflation have diminished, and there should be scope for further policy easing if the economy and the inflation outlook evolve as expected.

Political turmoil in England is weighing on the British pound and pushing Gilt yields higher on concern that Prime Minister Starmer's job may be at risk after he appointed Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US. Mandelson has been linked to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, which is eroding confidence in Starmer's ability to govern. 

Swaps are discounting a 3% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on March 19.

The price of Bitcoin fell to its lowest level in 16 months despite US president Donald Trump's personal and public support for cryptocurrency.

A single Bitcoin went as low as $60,000 (£44,000), its lowest level since September 2024, before rallying slightly.

The drop followed months of surging Bitcoin prices, which saw the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $122,200 in October 2025.

""Those who bet too big, borrowed too much or assumed prices only go up are now finding out the hard way what real market volatility and risk management look like,"" Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association told Reuters.

Investors were encouraged by Trump's involvement in the sector and his outspoken support for cryptocurrencies, as well as promises to ease legislation on the industry.

With Thursday's drop, Bitcoin prices are down 32% in the last 12 months and are trending toward prices seen in early 2024 and 2021.

Bitcoin is the world's largest and generally most well-known cryptocurrency, a form of digital-only money that is not controlled by a centralised financial institution.

According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 8% of UK adults were investing in crypto in 2025 - a drop of 4% from the year before.

But it said the typical amount of money held by individuals had now increased - with one in five holding between £1,000 and £5,000 in the digital currencies.

Among Trump's first actions upon re-entering the White House in January 2025 was an executive order aimed at making the US the ""crypto capital of the planet"".

In his first year back in office, Trump launched a personal brand of cryptocurrency, with the bulk of profits going into his own companies. And he continued his involvement with World Liberty Financial, an investment vehicle for other crypto assets that is owned by the Trump family.  

During the Trump administration so far, he has signed a law to support federal backing of cryptocurrency, dissolved a Department of Justice team focused on enforcement of crypto regulation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped crypto-related enforcement work and investigations.  

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in November called out Trump's ""pro-crypto agenda"", noting that the president had amassed crypto holdings worth more than $11bn and gained personal income of $800mn from crypto transactions since taking office.

Bitcoin prices tend to be volatile, but analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note on Wednesday that the latest drop was ""triggered by"" Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh, as the new chair of the Federal Reserve. Some believe he will take a more ""hawkish"" approach, keeping interest rates higher, whereas looser monetary policy tends to support investment in assets such as crypto currencies.

Bitcoin prices have been trending down for the last four months, Deutsche noted, and there has been growing negative sentiment around cryptocurrency more broadly.

""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" it said.

While Deutsche does not expect crypto to disappear, it also did not predict Bitcoin would return to Trump-driven highs.

The bank said the digital token was moving from being a ""purely speculative asset"" into a more realistic phase as an asset that ""needs to find its specific role"".

William Barhydt, chief executive of Abra Capital Management, an investment firm focused on crypto assets, agreed that cryptocurrency is maturing, but he expects prices to rebound.

""I wouldn't say that it has to rebound, but I can't see how it doesn't,"" Barhydt said, noting that this is not the first time Bitcoin has seen significant swings in value.

""The only way it doesn't is if we end up in some kind of war,"" Barhydt added. 

Other popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum and Solana. Their prices have both dropped roughly 37% so far in 2026. 

According to CoinGecko, which tracks the performance of thousands of cryptocurrencies, the market has lost over $1 trillion in value in the last month alone and $2 trillion in value since the market peaked in October.

Stifel, a US-based investment and research firm, said in a note to investors that Bitcoin prices may drop as low as $38,000. The firm pointed to a new trend of cryptocurrency more closely following the prices of the US Dollar.

Last week, the dollar dropped to its lowest point in four years.

The White House defended the post at first, calling to ""stop the fake outrage"", as members of both parties condemned the video. 

Trump says the US will ""run"" Venezuela and manage its oil after capturing its president Maduro.

The moves were planned before Trump said he wanted the Arctic island but they are being seen as a show of solidarity with Greenlanders. 

The military alleges the boat was travelling on a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific.

 It is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections.

Bitfarms (BITF) is moving its legal base from Canada to the United States and will rebrand as Keel Infrastructure as part of its pivot from bitcoin mining BTC$65,998.81 to data center development for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.

The redomiciling process, announced in a Friday press release, will be subject to shareholder, regulatory and court approvals. A shareholder vote is scheduled for March 20, and if approved, the company expects the transition to close by April 1. The new parent company, to be incorporated in Delaware, will trade on the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol KEEL.

Bitfarms' stock rose 18% following the news, erasing Thursday's 16% tumble as AI infrastructure and crypto stocks sold off.

The rebrand and relocation follow a year-long strategic review by Bitfarms, which assessed market trends and investor sentiment, CEO Ben Gagnon said. The U.S. move will help the company access a broader pool of capital, simplify its corporate structure, and position it more directly in front of institutional investors, he added.

""We are no longer a Bitcoin company,"" Gagnon said in a statement, ""We are an infrastructure-first owner and developer for HPC/AI data centers across North America.

To support its new focus, Bitfarms has begun repaying its $300 million credit facility from Macquarie Group, starting with $100 million tied to its Panther Creek site in Pennsylvania. The repayment reduces debt while preserving what the company says is a strong liquidity position — $698 million as of Feb. 5 — comprised largely of cash and bitcoin.

Following the move, Bitfarms will maintain its operational sites in Canada and the U.S., but its New York City office will become its sole headquarters.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Jefferies says the latest crypto selloff shows few signs of an imminent bottom, even as bitcoin and ether hover near levels that have historically drawn dip buyers.

In a research note this week, the bank described the downturn as a liquidity-driven correction rather than a collapse in blockchain activity, pointing instead to continued network usage and selective corporate bitcoin accumulation as evidence that the sector's underlying infrastructure remains intact.

This comes as bitcoin trades near $64,800, roughly 47% below its October 2025 peak of about $123,500, while ether trades around $1,900, down nearly 60% from its prior cycle highs.

Jefferies wrote that sharp price declines have revived familiar “crypto winter” narratives, but argued that current weakness is more closely tied to broader risk-off sentiment in global markets and a rotation away from growth assets than to any deterioration in blockchain fundamentals. More than $2 billion in recent long liquidations has further amplified day-to-day volatility across major tokens.

The bank highlighted selling from large bitcoin holders and persistent spot ETF net outflows as key near-term headwinds, suggesting institutional portfolio rebalancing is exerting greater pressure on prices than retail behavior.

At the same time, Jefferies noted that smaller and mid-sized holders appear to be holding existing positions rather than aggressively exiting, while centralized exchange trading volumes and decentralized lending activity have begun to stabilize after recent spikes.

Despite its cautious tone, the report stops short of a fully bearish outlook. Jefferies said longer-term catalysts such as regulatory progress, infrastructure maturity, and greater participation by traditional finance could eventually drive renewed interest in tokens tied to revenue-generating blockchains, leading to wider performance divergence rather than a uniform rebound.

Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet (3350), doubled down on the company's bitcoin buying strategy even as shares in Asia's largest publicly traded holder of the cryptocurrency fell.

In a Friday post on X, Gerovich said Metaplanet would “steadily continue to accumulate bitcoin, expand revenue and prepare for the next phase of growth.” He thanked shareholders who continued to back the company despite bitcoin's downward trend: The largest cryptocurrency has lost more than 47% of its value since touching a record high in October and fell 14% on Thursday alone.

Metaplanet's stock has struggled alongside bitcoin, ending the week at 340 yen ($2.16) after falling roughly 82% from a high of 1,930 yen in June. On Friday, the stock fell 5.6% following bitcoin's slump after Asian trading hours the day before.

The Tokyo-based company's “555 Million Plan” aims to reach 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. Its bitcoin holdings have climbed from 1,762 BTC at the end of 2024 to 35,102 BTC now, worth about $2.5 billion at current prices.

The investment is deep in the red, with an average acquisition cost of about $107,000 per bitcoin, according to its analytics page, and a current price of $66,270. The company has roughly $280 million in outstanding debt, according to the dashboard.

Globally, Metaplanet ranks as the fourth-largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin. Strategy Inc. (MSTR) ranks first with 713,502 BTC, MARA Holdings (MARA) is second with 53,250 BTC and Twenty One Capital (XX1) is third with 43,514 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net.

Metaplanet announced Jan. 29 that it planned to raise up to 21 billion yen to fund additional bitcoin purchases and pay down debt. It plans to raise the funds through the sale of 24.53 million new common shares at 499 yen each, along with stock warrants aimed at select investors.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

ARK Invest sold $17.4 million worth of Coinbase (COIN) stock and bought a similar amount in Bullish (BLSH) stock on Thursday as crypto equities were routed.

Cathie Wood's investment management company sold 119,236 COIN shares, worth $17.4 million as of Thursday's close. COIN lost 13.3% on the day to close at $146.12 amid ongoing tanking of the crypto market which has seen bitcoin BTC$65,998.81 fall as low as $60,000, its lowest point since November 2024.

ARK also bought 716,030 shares in crypto exchange Bullish, according to an emailed disclosure. The shares are worth $17.8 million, based on BLSH's closing price of $24.90, nearly 8.5% lower on the day. Bullish is also the parent company of CoinDesk.

It is common to see ARK Invest make sizeable purchases of crypto-adjacent companies when their prices slide due to broader downturns in the cryptocurrency market. The Florida-based company attempts to capitalize on the chance to capture greater value from equities and rebalance the holdings of its funds to reflect the different prices.

However, it is somewhat rarer to see ARK use this as a window to offload shares in a major crypto holding such as Coinbase.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Psychiatry's rule book faces a major rethink

Why psychiatry's diagnostic system may undergo major changes, and what the scientific debates over how mental illnesses should be defined are

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Allison Parshall, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

Think of a psychiatric condition, something like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, panic disorder or anorexia nervosa. Nowadays many of us take for granted that a mental health care professional can help determine if we have one of these conditions. But how do they make that diagnosis?

It's based, in part, on guidelines from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the DSM. It's a book published by the American Psychiatric Association with the goal of accurately describing recognized mental illnesses.

In many ways the DSM is considered the “bible” of psychiatry. It's also received decades of criticism, particularly that it doesn't reflect scientific reality.

Last month the APA announced that it may make a major overhaul to the DSM, which, if the proposals come to pass, could have significant impacts on how psychological disorders are categorized and diagnosed. To learn more about those changes we spoke with Allison Parshall, associate editor for mind and brain at SciAm.

Thanks for joining us today.

Allison Parshall: Thank you for having me.

Pierre-Louis: So kind of the bible of psychiatry is this book known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ...

Parshall: Mm-hmm.

Pierre-Louis: Or the DSM, and we're currently up to the DSM-V.

Can you talk a bit about the book's origin and what it means for the field of psychiatry?

Parshall: Yeah, the DSM started kind of in the mid 20th century. The book that we know now was kind of born in 1980 with the DSM-III—there was, like, a big expansion in the number of disorders that this book lists. Now we're up to almost 300.

There was a little bit of an addition a couple years ago, but yeah, we're at the DSM-V now. And basically, like, this book's definition of various mental illnesses is one of the main things that kind of governs what we think of as a disorder and what doctors treat and what nondoctors, like social workers, treat, and how scientists do research and how insurance gets billed. So it's a very important book, and it's put out by the American Psychiatric Association, which is a professional organization of psychiatrists.

Pierre-Louis: So it's kind of like the manual of psychiatric disorders.

Parshall: Yeah, it's basically like the manual, the bible, the founding document of psychiatry, in many ways.

Pierre-Louis: You've mentioned now that, you know, there have been previous revisions of the DSM, but the article that you wrote is really highlighting the fact that there are potential revisions that are gonna be kind of a massive departure from the past.

Parshall: Mm.

Pierre-Louis: Can you talk about what these new revisions might mean?

Parshall: Yeah, so the new revisions are still just proposed. Basically, the American Psychiatric Association put together a bunch of committees [Laughs] and subcommittees and everything, basically saying, “Okay, we wanna figure out what we're gonna do with this going forward.”

The DSM has faced a lot of criticism for a long time about how it categorizes mental illness, and those criticisms haven't really changed. The main one is that it focuses a lot on having categories of mental illness that are relatively reliable. Like, you could get a bunch of psychiatrists to talk to the same person, and they might come to the same conclusion.

The question of the conclusion that they're coming to, of “this person has major depressive disorder versus bipolar I disorder versus something else,” there's an increasing sense, based off of neuroscience research and genetics research, that those boundaries are not really founded in biological reality. Like, they make sense as ways for clinicians to segment the population of people that they see, for scientists maybe to treat a bunch of people who have similar symptoms. But when it comes to actually looking at genetic similarities and the way that the brain is working it's actually really varied in a way that makes these diagnoses maybe reliable but not valid.

So the criticism that the DSM often faces is that it's not scientifically valid, the categories that it's pointing to, that major depressive disorder does not actually exist as, like, a ground truth in the world ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: It is something that is helpful for psychiatrists to make as a bucket, but these buckets are a little bit made-up. And so what they're trying to do with this new revision is address a lot of those criticisms that have been, you know, long-standing by other people in the field.

They're kind of doing a little bit of a grab-bag approach, according to what this committee is proposing. They're proposing a new model for diagnosis, where clinicians take a lot more into account than they would've before.

So instead of just saying, “Okay, this person has major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder or bipolar II disorder,” they're trying to let clinicians have a little bit more flexibility. So to be able to say, “This person is experiencing depression or a depressive disorder,” but not be more specific than they need to be. There's some cases, like ER doctors—if someone comes into the ER experiencing a psychotic episode, as an ER doctor you don't have the time or the ability or anything to figure out if this is schizophrenia, bipolar disorder. You don't know.

So they're kind of trying to allow people to have varying levels of specificity, which fixes some of the criticism about the DSM in the sense that doctors felt before maybe like they had to give more specific diagnoses than they even knew, and that leads to patients, you know, having kind of a laundry list of diagnoses attached to their name that may or may not be appropriate.

The other thing that they're doing is letting doctors add a lot of extra factors kind of on the diagnosis sheet. So if someone comes into the ER experiencing a psychotic episode, it appears that they're unhoused, that's an important factor. It appears that maybe they're experiencing symptoms from another medical condition; that's an important factor. So they're proposing this idea where there's a lot more spaces for doctors to put in contextual factors.

One of those contextual factors is “biomarkers” which is, like, this idea that you could do a blood test or a brain scan or something that could reveal something about the physical nature of someone's body or brain that informs the diagnosis that you give them. This is not something that really exists yet for any mental disorder except Alzheimer's, which is kind of not really a mental disorder; it's on the border of psychiatry and neurology.

But so yeah, all of this is meant to address kind of these underlying criticisms that the DSM has always faced. The experts I talked to weren't convinced that this is really how to do it.

Pierre-Louis: What were their concerns?

Parshall: Their concerns are really fundamental: that the structure of the DSM just doesn't work for what it needs to do. Like, adding the ability to have more context, that's, like, important, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem of the DSM, which is that it's based off of these categories that kind of don't really reflect biological reality.

Pierre-Louis: Can you talk a little bit more about that, when you say “doesn't reflect biological reality”?

Parshall: Yeah, so there's this really—basically, this is the question that psychiatry has always been grappling with. The DSM-III really—there was a ton more diagnoses added in 1980. I'm being a little facetious here, but basically, like, 10 clinician guys in a room figuring out what they wanted to put in this book.

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Parshall: Like, it was—the DSM has always been based off of the symptoms that people present when they go to a clinician, not necessarily their underlying biology.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: That's a necessity because, like, even to this day we do not know what causes depression. We can't really explain what is causing a lot of these mental illnesses. If we knew that, we could make a book that catalogs mental illness that is based off of their underlying causes, not just how people present in to a doctor. We can't do that. That's kind of been the North Star: like, we wanna get to something that is valid, accurate, reflects reality.

However, the way that that maps, like, you—basically, your underlying biology and then the things that you present if you show up to a psychiatrist's office, there's a big gap between those. And when you're making a book that's just based off of clinical expertise and what you can see on the surface as a doctor—there was this hope going into the 1990s, when we had all these new brain-scanning technologies, this new ability to map genetic code, that these categories that physicians had picked out in, like, the 1970s, 1980s as, you know, dividing the landscape of mental illness were going to be something we could see in genetics.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: Like, “Okay, we sequenced people's genomes, and we can clearly see this group has a difference that leads to bipolar I and this group has a difference that leads to bipolar II, which are two different diagnoses that vary depending on if someone experiences manic episodes.”

That is not what we have seen at all. This is the story across all of neuroscience. [Laughs.] It's the story of consciousness research ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: So much to do with the brain. We had all this optimism that we would figure out what causes things, and we just—it's just way more complicated.

So what all this research has shown, this genetics and neuroimaging research, is that these lines that we've carved around various disorders in the DSM are kind of artificial. Like, they make sense for clinicians, so it's not that they mean nothing and are fake, but it's just not a simple story when you look at the biology. You're not gonna be able to say that there's a common genetic variant that explains major depressive disorder. In fact, there's a lot of them, and then there's gonna be overlap with other disorders.

So that's the inherent problem that the DSM is grappling with and the critics of the proposed new version, which is that the categories this whole thing is based off of aren't really valid.

Pierre-Louis: But I guess the question that that raises is: If we can't just, like, throw a person in a scanner and be like, “Oh, yeah, you definitely have major depressive disorder,” and we don't have something based on symptomology, then what do we have?

Parshall: Yeah, so part of the reason I don't envy anyone working on this is that there is no option to throw out the DSM. Like, that is not really a serious thing that we think people should be doing.

The DSM kind of serves two purposes. One of them is what you just pointed to, I think, which is the treatment of actual people, diagnosis of actual people—the things that psychiatrists are doing in their offices, the things that licensed clinical social workers are working with people for. And then there's the research side of it, which is the scientists submitting grants to try to understand the, like, basis of major depressive disorder or schizophrenia in people.

So those are kind of two separate things, and part of the problem is that the needs of those two groups have diverged a lot. So many of the people who are really critical of the DSM will be people on the science side, where often researchers are kind of just moving on from using DSM groups.

Part of this is that we don't—like, for example, we've discovered that there is a huge overlap between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Both commonly involve psychosis, as in a symptom. What they're finding is: you're probably better off just recruiting people who experience psychosis, rather than limiting it to, “Okay, we're studying bipolar disorder here,” or “We're studying schizophrenia.” When you open it up and get rid of those boundaries you kind of allow yourself to just go where the data takes you and figure out where maybe nature is actually carving borders between these, if—to the extent that there are borders at all.

On the clinical side, we don't have the option to just kind of divest from it. Psychiatrists are going to continue to be making diagnoses and treating people based off of their symptoms. Like, even if we had a biomarker for depression it might not make any sense to, like, test people's blood for it. Like, it's expensive. It's hard. Like, there is a need for being able to treat people just based off of their symptoms and symptomology.

Pierre-Louis: You might have the biomarker, but you're fine—you're not expressing depressive symptoms.

Parshall: Yeah, it would have to be a perfect biomarker. Like, it ...

Pierre-Louis: Right.

Parshall: And those things are just not likely to exist—of, like, “Oh, you only see it in people who experience clinical depression and are going in for help.”

I don't envy anyone who has to figure out how to navigate all of this. Basically, we need something like the DSM. We need something for insurers to be able to bill. We need something for people just to have a common language. Like, think of all the people who have figured out that they're autistic recently and have finally been like, “Wow, I have access to this word that helps me understand.”

Of course, the boundaries of the category of autism spectrum disorder are really fuzzy. One of the interesting things that changed with the DSM-V is they wanted to try to make it less boundaried categories overall ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: And they wanted it to be more of these, like, dimensions that measure people's different traits, and it's much more fluid and noncategorical. They weren't able to do that then; their, like, research wasn't there for it. But they did change autism—many of the different disorders that were related to autism, they lumped them together under autism spectrum disorder.

So there was this sense that, like, “Okay, maybe we're better off having fewer divisions of subdividing out very specific categories and just kind of pointing more generally to something that a group has in common at large.” That was something that they even started to do back then. So that was a little bit of a tangent, but I do think the autism example is actually kind of interesting. They've been trying to make things less boundaried categories and more of a continuum for a while now.

Pierre-Louis: And as your article details, like, these are proposed changes, so we actually still don't know what the final product is going to be.

Parshall: Yeah, this is all very provisional. But, like, these kinds of announcements do not come around often, which is why we're covering it. Like, this is quite notable.

Basically, these different committees that were created by the APA have these suggestions for how they want the book to look very different in the future. They're publishing these papers that they came out with to kind of open the conversation up to other clinicians; to psychologists, not psychiatrists; to people who have the diagnoses, the people who love them; other health-care providers that treat people. So basically, from here on out the point is for it to be almost [a] public comment period, or, you know, people getting recruited into new subcommittees to kind of try to refine these ideas.

I will, as a word of warning, say it's—we don't really know what's going to happen here. It's very possible that we don't have—end up with big changes at all because they tried to do something very similar in the 2000s with the DSM-V. They announced these plans to kind of change it from this rigid, categorical thing that maybe doesn't reflect how nature actually is and try to make it more about these dimensional traits.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: That did not go over well. There was a lot of pushback, a lot of backlash, and they ended up walking it back. And the DSM-V ended up largely similar to the DSM-IV.

So here, it's kind of the same story. One of the sources I talked with said that these papers looked like they could have been written in 2009—if I'd told her it was written in 2009, she would've agreed with me ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Parshall: [Laughs.] Which I thought was kind of funny.

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Parshall: It's like not much has changed about the criticisms, right? And honestly, like, not a ton has changed about the science we have about what is underlying these different mental illnesses. But there is an increasing sense that, like, “Okay, this is a big enough problem that we do need to change something big about our outlook, something big about how we categorize them moving forward.”

Pierre-Louis: Well, it'll be interesting to see how it all shakes out.

Parshall: It could be years until we can get something new. They're also trying to change the name. [Laughs.] ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Parshall: I, I just think this is funny. They're trying to change it from Diagnostic [and] Statistical Manual to Diagnostic [and] Scientific Manual. And they are thinking that they wanna maybe update it every few years rather than having these big updates every decade, which could be really good, but then they were like, “So maybe we won't even call it the DSM-VI. Maybe it'll just be the DSM going forward,” and they're just gonna make incremental updates.

So we'll see how it looks going forward. If anyone is wondering what this means for them or their care or their diagnoses, it doesn't really mean a lot yet. But if you hear something in this that's compelling or interesting to you, or it seems like—you're concerned, you can always, you know, look into it and see if they're looking for feedback.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new scan lets scientists see inside the human body in 3D color","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260204121550.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:13:16 GMT","

Researchers at Caltech and USC have created a new medical imaging approach that quickly produces 3D color images showing both the physical structure of soft tissue and how blood vessels are working. The technique has already been used to image several parts of the human body. Scientists say it could lead to better breast cancer imaging, improved tracking of nerve damage linked to diabetes, and new ways to study the brain.

Details of the work were published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Why Existing Imaging Tools Fall Short

Standard ultrasound is fast, affordable, and widely used, but it mainly shows tissue shape in two dimensions and offers a limited viewing area. Photoacoustic imaging provides a different kind of information. It works by sending laser light into the body and detecting the sound waves produced when certain molecules absorb that light. This allows doctors and researchers to see blood vessels in optical color and observe blood flow through arteries and veins. However, photoacoustic imaging does not capture detailed tissue structure well.

Other common imaging methods, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), come with tradeoffs. These techniques may require contrast agents, expose patients to ionizing radiation, cost more, or take too long to use frequently.

Combining Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging

To overcome these limitations, the research team developed RUS-PAT (rotational ultrasound tomography, RUST, combined with photoacoustic tomography, PAT). Photoacoustic tomography was first developed more than two decades ago by Lihong Wang, the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair at Caltech. In PAT, tissue molecules that absorb light vibrate after being hit by short laser pulses, producing acoustic signals that can be measured and converted into detailed images.

Wang, who also serves as Caltech's executive officer for medical engineering, said the goal of the new project was to merge the strengths of ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. ""But it's not like one plus one,"" he explains. ""We needed to find an optimal way of combining the two technologies.""

A Simpler and More Practical Design

Traditional ultrasound systems rely on many transducers to send and receive sound waves, making direct integration with photoacoustic imaging too complicated and costly for broad use. Photoacoustic imaging, by contrast, only needs ultrasound detection. This difference led Wang to a new idea. ""I thought, 'Wait, can we just mimic light excitation of ultrasound waves in photoacoustic tomography, but do it ultrasonically?'""

In photoacoustic imaging, laser light spreads through tissue and triggers ultrasound waves that can be measured. Wang realized that a single wide-field ultrasound transducer could instead send sound waves throughout the tissue. The same detectors could then capture signals from both imaging methods.

The final system uses a small number of arc-shaped detectors that rotate around a central point. This setup effectively functions like a full hemispheric detector, while remaining far simpler and less expensive.

Demonstrated Potential for Human Use

""The novel combination of acoustic and photoacoustic techniques addresses many of the key limitations of widely used medical-imaging techniques in current clinical practice, and, importantly, the feasibility for human application has been demonstrated here in multiple contexts,"" says Dr. Charles Y. Liu, a co-author of the study and a visiting associate in biology and biological engineering at Caltech. Liu is also a professor at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, director of USC's Neurorestoration Center, and chair of neurosurgery at the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center.

Because the method can be used anywhere light can reach, RUS-PAT may have wide clinical applications. In breast cancer imaging, it could help doctors pinpoint a tumor's location while also revealing information about its biological activity. For patients with diabetic neuropathy, the technique could allow physicians to monitor both nerve structure and oxygen supply in a single scan. Wang also notes its potential for brain research, where scientists could study brain anatomy while simultaneously observing blood flow dynamics.

Speed, Depth, and Early Testing

At present, the system can image tissue up to about 4 centimeters deep. Light can also be delivered using endoscopic tools, which may allow access to deeper areas of the body. Each RUS-PAT scan takes less than one minute.

The current setup places ultrasound transducers and a laser beneath a scanning bed. The system has already been tested on human volunteers and patients and is now in the early stages of moving toward clinical use.

Study Details and Funding

The paper is titled ""Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body."" The co-lead authors are Yang Zhang, Shuai Na, and Dr. Jonathan J. Russin. Zhang and Na conducted the work as postdoctoral researchers at Caltech and are now based at Tsinghua University and Peking University in Beijing, respectively. Russin is affiliated with the Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, California.

Lin is currently at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. Dr. Tze-Woei Tan from the Keck School of Medicine of USC is also a co-author.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A superfluid freezes and breaks the rules of physics","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260204121545.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:17:12 GMT","

When everyday matter is cooled, it follows a familiar path. A gas becomes a liquid, and with further cooling, that liquid turns into a solid. Quantum matter does not always follow these rules. More than a century ago, scientists discovered that helium behaves in an unexpected way at extremely low temperatures. Instead of freezing, it transforms from a normal gas into a superfluid, a rare state of matter that flows without any resistance and displays strange behaviors, including creeping up the sides of containers.

Physicists have long wondered what would happen if a superfluid were cooled even further. Despite decades of effort, that question remained unanswered for nearly 50 years.

A Superfluid That Comes to a Halt

In new research published in Nature, a team led by physicists Cory Dean of Columbia University and Jia Li of the University of Texas at Austin reports a striking result. They observed a superfluid, which typically remains in constant motion, suddenly stop moving. ""For the first time, we've seen a superfluid undergo a phase transition to become what appears to be a supersolid,"" said Dean. The change is comparable to water freezing into ice, but taking place in the quantum realm.

What Is a Supersolid?

A classical solid is defined by atoms locked into a rigid, repeating crystal structure. A supersolid is the quantum version of this idea. It is predicted to have an ordered, solid-like arrangement while also retaining properties normally associated with liquids, including frictionless flow. This combination makes supersolids one of the most unusual states of matter proposed by physics.

Until now, however, no experiment had clearly shown a superfluid naturally transforming into a supersolid. This includes helium and all other known forms of matter. Some laboratory demonstrations have mimicked supersolids using highly controlled setups created by atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physicists. These experiments rely on lasers and optical components to form a periodic trap that forces particles into a repeating pattern, similar to how Jello takes shape inside an ice cube tray.

Turning to Graphene for Answers

A supersolid that forms on its own, without artificial confinement, has remained one of the most debated mysteries in condensed matter physics. Dean's team took a different approach by working with graphene, a naturally occurring material made of a single layer of carbon atoms. The group included Li, who conducted the work while he was a postdoc at Columbia, and Yihang Zeng (now an assistant professor at Purdue University), a former PhD student in the group.

Graphene can support particles known as excitons. These quasiparticles appear when two atom-thin graphene sheets are stacked together and tuned so that one layer contains extra electrons while the other contains extra holes (which are left behind when electrons leave the layer in response to light). Because electrons carry a negative charge and holes act as positive charges, the two can bind together to form excitons. Under a strong magnetic field, these excitons can behave collectively as a superfluid.

A Surprising Phase Change in a 2D Material

Two-dimensional materials like graphene are powerful tools for studying quantum behavior because their properties can be carefully adjusted. Researchers can control factors such as temperature, electromagnetic fields, and even the spacing between layers. As Dean's team tuned these parameters, they noticed an unexpected pattern linking exciton density and temperature.

When excitons were densely packed, they flowed freely as a superfluid. As the density dropped, the flow stopped entirely, and the system became an insulator. Raising the temperature restored the superfluid behavior. This sequence ran counter to long-standing assumptions about how superfluidity works.

""Superfluidity is generally regarded as the low-temperature ground state,"" said Li. ""Observing an insulating phase that melts into a superfluid is unprecedented. This strongly suggests that the low-temperature phase is a highly unusual exciton solid.""

Is It Truly a Supersolid?

Whether this state fully qualifies as a supersolid remains an open question. ""We are left to speculate some, as our ability to interrogate insulators stops a little,"" explained Dean -- their expertise is in transport measurements, and insulators don't transport a current. ""For now, we're exploring the boundaries around this insulating state, while building new tools to measure it directly.""

What Comes Next for Supersolids

The team is now investigating other layered materials that could host similar quantum phases. In bilayer graphene, the excitonic superfluid and likely supersolid only appear under strong magnetic fields. Other materials are harder to fabricate in the required configurations, but they may allow excitons to remain stable at higher temperatures and without the need for a magnetic field.

Being able to control superfluids in two-dimensional materials could have far-reaching implications. Compared to helium, for example, excitons are thousands of times lighter, so they could form exotic quantum states at much higher temperatures. While supersolids are still not fully understood, these findings provide strong evidence that 2D materials will play a central role in uncovering how this strange quantum phase works.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","An invisible chemical rain is falling across the planet","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206020847.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:18:44 GMT","

Chemicals introduced to shield the ozone layer are now tied to an unexpected environmental consequence. A new study shows that these substances have helped spread large amounts of a long-lasting and potentially harmful forever chemical across the planet.

Researchers in atmospheric science, led by a team at Lancaster University, have calculated for the first time how much of this pollution has accumulated worldwide. Their analysis estimates that chemicals used to replace CFCs, along with certain anesthetic gases, led to roughly a third of a million tonnes (335,500 tonnes) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) being deposited from the atmosphere onto Earth's surface between 2000 and 2022.

Pollution That Continues to Rise

The study also warns that the problem is far from peaking. Many CFC replacement chemicals remain in the atmosphere for decades, allowing TFA to continue entering the environment long after the original emissions. Researchers estimate that annual TFA production from these sources could reach its highest levels sometime between 2025 and 2100.

The findings were published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. To reach their conclusions, the scientists relied on chemical transport modeling, a method that recreates how chemicals circulate, transform, and eventually settle out of the atmosphere.

How Refrigerants and Anesthetics Produce TFA

Using this approach, the researchers measured how TFA forms when specific gases break down in the air. These include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are widely used in refrigeration systems, as well as compounds used as inhalation anesthetics.

Although these substances, known as F-gases, are being phased out (following the Montreal Protocol and the later Kigali Amendment), their overall concentration in the atmosphere continues to increase.

TFA belongs to the broader family of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). These man-made chemicals are often referred to as forever chemicals because they resist natural breakdown and can persist in the environment for extremely long periods.

Environmental and Health Questions Remain

Scientists are still refining their understanding of TFA's potential effects. The European Chemicals Agency considers TFA harmful to aquatic life. The chemical has also been detected in human blood and urine, and the German Federal Office for Chemicals has recently proposed classifying TFA as potentially toxic to human reproduction.

While some regulatory bodies say current environmental levels of TFA are below thresholds expected to harm people, concern is growing about its steady and potentially irreversible buildup. This has prompted calls for TFA to be treated as a planetary boundary threat.

""Our study shows that CFC replacements are likely to be the dominant atmospheric source of TFA,"" said Lucy Hart, PhD researcher at Lancaster University and lead author of the study. ""This really highlights the broader risks that need to be considered by regulation when substituting harmful chemicals such as ozone-depleting CFCs.""

Matching Models With Real-World Evidence

To validate their results, the researchers compared their modeled estimates of TFA formation and deposition with real measurements. These included data from Arctic ice-cores and rainwater samples collected around the world.

The model was fed information on the amount and location of source gases using data from a global monitoring network. As these gases interact with other components of the atmosphere, they chemically break down and generate TFA.

Weather patterns were also incorporated into the simulations to show how TFA moves and settles. The chemical can be removed from clouds by rainfall or deposited directly from the air onto land and water surfaces.

Arctic Ice Reveals Global Reach

The results show that nearly all TFA detected in the Arctic comes from CFC replacement chemicals, even though the region is far from major emission sources. This finding underscores how widely TFA pollution is distributed across the globe.

""CFC replacements have long lifetimes and are able to be transported in the atmosphere from their point of emission to remote regions such as the Arctic where they can breakdown to form TFA,"" said Lucy Hart. ""Studies have found increasing TFA levels in remote Arctic ice-cores and our results provide the first conclusive evidence that virtually all of these deposits can be explained by these gases.""

New Refrigerants Add to Future Uncertainty

Outside polar regions, the study points to additional sources of concern. At midlatitude locations, the modeling supports growing evidence that HFO-1234yf, commonly used in car air conditioning systems, is becoming an important and likely expanding source of atmospheric TFA.

""HFOs are the latest class of synthetic refrigerants marketed as climate friendly alternatives to HFCs,"" said Professor Ryan Hossaini of Lancaster University and co-author of the study. ""A number of HFOs are known to be TFA-forming and the growing use of these chemicals for car air conditioning in Europe and elsewhere adds uncertainty to future levels of TFA in our environment.""

""There is a need to address environmental TFA pollution because it is widespread, highly persistent, and levels are increasing,"" Professor Hossaini said.

Calls for Global Monitoring and Action

""The rising levels of TFA from F-gases is striking. Although HFC use is gradually being phased down, this TFA source will remain with us for decades. There's an urgent need to understand other TFA sources and to assess TFA's environmental impacts. This requires a concerted international effort, including more extensive TFA monitoring in the UK and elsewhere,"" he said.

Professor Cris Halsall, Director of the Lancaster Environment Centre and co-author, noted that TFA's origins are broader than once believed.

""We've generally viewed TFA as a breakdown product from the use of a few fluorinated pesticides, but it's clear that TFA (a very persistent chemical in the environment) arises from the use and breakdown of a very wide group of organofluorine chemicals including refrigerants, solvents, pharmaceuticals and the PFAS group in general.""

Co-author Dr Stefan Reimann, whose research group in Switzerland closely tracks TFA-forming F-gases in the atmosphere, said the trend is consistent worldwide.

""In all regions where TFA measurements are available, a consistent picture of increasing atmospheric concentrations and deposition to Earth's surface is emerging,"" he said.

""This study is outstanding, as it combines for the first time all the important sources of atmospheric TFA and has a global focus. With increasing use of HFOs, accumulation of TFA in water bodies will potentially grow and this makes long-term monitoring a necessity.""

Their findings are detailed in the paper 'Growth in production and environmental deposition of trifluoroacetic acid due to long-lived CFC replacements and anesthetics'.

The study involved researchers from: Lancaster University; the University of Leeds; the University of Urbino; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia; the Norwegian Institute for Air Research; the University of California San Diego; the University of Bristol; the Kyungpook National University, Korea; the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology; and the Goethe University Frankfurt.

Small lakes on early Mars may have stayed liquid for decades, even though average air temperatures were far below freezing. New research suggests that cold conditions alone may not have prevented long-lasting surface water on the Red Planet.

Researchers from Rice University used a climate model modified for Mars to explore whether lakes could have survived in places such as Gale Crater near the planet's equator. Their results show that lakes could remain liquid beneath a thin layer of seasonal ice for decades and possibly longer, as long as overall climate conditions remained steady. This finding helps address a long-standing question in Mars research. Geological features shaped by flowing or standing water exist across the planet, yet many climate models indicate early Mars should have been too cold to support liquid water.

The study, published in AGU Advances, offers a new explanation for how lakes could have existed without a warm climate and why ancient Martian lake beds appear so well preserved today.

""Seeing ancient lake basins on Mars without clear evidence of thick, long-lasting ice made me question whether those lakes could have held water for more than a single season in a cold climate,"" said Eleanor Moreland, a Rice graduate student and lead author of the study. ""When our new model began showing lakes that could last for decades with only a thin, seasonally disappearing ice layer, it was exciting that we might finally have a physical mechanism that fits what we see on Mars today.""

Turning Earth Climate Tools Toward Mars

To investigate the problem, the team adapted a climate modeling framework known as Proxy System Modeling. The approach was originally developed by Earth climate researcher Sylvia Dee to reconstruct ancient climates using indirect indicators such as tree rings or ice cores.

Mars lacks trees and other familiar climate markers, so the researchers relied instead on data collected by Mars rovers. Rock formations and mineral deposits served as stand-ins for a climate record, allowing the team to infer past conditions.

Over several years, the researchers modified the lake model to reflect Mars as it was about 3.6 billion years ago. They accounted for factors such as weaker sunlight, a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, and seasonal differences unique to the planet.

Using the new Lake Modeling on Mars with Atmospheric Reconstructions and Simulations (LakeM2ARS) model, the team ran 64 test scenarios based on measurements from NASA's Curiosity rover in Gale Crater and existing Mars climate simulations.

Each scenario simulated a hypothetical lake inside the crater for 30 Martian years, or about 56 Earth years. This allowed the researchers to test whether lakes could realistically remain liquid under different conditions.

""It was fun to work through the thought experiment of how a lake model designed for Earth could be adapted for another planet, though this process came with a hefty amount of debugging when we had to change, say, gravity,"" said Dee, an associate professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences and co-author of the study.

""We were surprised and encouraged by how sensitively the model responded to parameters like atmospheric pressure and temperature seasonality. It shows that with some creativity and experimentation, Earth-origin models can yield realistic climate scenarios for Mars.""

Thin Ice as a Natural Insulator

The simulations produced different outcomes depending on the conditions. In some cases, lakes froze solid during colder seasons. In others, the water stayed liquid beneath a thin ice cover rather than freezing completely.

That thin ice played a crucial role. It acted as an insulating lid, limiting evaporation and water loss while still allowing sunlight to warm the lake during warmer periods of the year.

Because of this seasonal cycle, some modeled lakes showed little change in depth over decades. This suggests they could remain stable for long periods even when average air temperatures stayed below freezing.

""This seasonal ice cover behaves like a natural blanket for the lake,"" said Kirsten Siebach, an associate professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences and co-author of the study.

It insulates the water in winter while allowing it to melt in summer, Siebach said. ""Because the ice is thin and temporary, it would leave little evidence behind, which could explain why rovers have not found clear signs of perennial ice or glaciers on Mars,"" she said.

Rethinking Water on a Cold Mars

The results suggest that early Mars may have supported long-lasting lakes without requiring consistently warm conditions. This challenges earlier assumptions that surface water on Mars would only be possible during extended warm periods.

If lakes were protected by seasonal ice rather than buried under thick permanent ice, many puzzling features on Mars become easier to explain. Preserved shorelines, layered sediments, and mineral deposits may all reflect stable lakes that endured despite a cold climate.

What This Means for Future Mars Research

The researchers plan to apply the LakeM2ARS model to other Martian basins to see whether similar lakes could have existed elsewhere on the planet. They also want to explore how changes in atmospheric composition or groundwater flow may have influenced lake stability over time.

""If similar patterns emerge across the planet, the results would support the idea that even a quite cold early Mars could sustain year-round liquid water, a key ingredient for environments to be suitable for life,"" Moreland said.

The additional co-authors of this study include Rice undergraduate student Nyla Hartigan, Michael Mischna from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, James Russell from Brown University and Grace Bischof and John Moores from York University. The Rice Faculty Initiative Fund and the Canadian Space Agency supported this research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A clever quantum trick brings practical quantum computers closer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012208.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:11:44 GMT","

Quantum computers have the potential to transform fields ranging from materials science to cryptography, but today they remain extremely difficult to build and operate. One of the biggest challenges comes from decoherence, a process that introduces errors into quantum systems. These errors usually take the form of bit flips or phase flips. A bit flip occurs when a qubit unexpectedly switches between '0' and '1'. A phase flip happens when the phase of a quantum superposition suddenly reverses, changing from positive to negative.

Because these changes can happen at random, even a single error can disrupt a calculation. Preventing that disruption is one of the central problems facing quantum engineers.

Protecting Information With Logical Qubits

To reduce these errors, researchers combine many physical qubits into a single logical qubit and apply continuous error correction. This strategy helps preserve quantum information over time, making storage relatively stable. But storing information is only part of the task. To run a quantum algorithm, qubits must be actively manipulated using quantum gates, which are the basic operations that power quantum computation.

Applying those operations without introducing new errors has proven far more difficult than simply keeping qubits stable at rest.

A New Way to Compute While Fixing Errors

A team led by D-PHYS Professor Andreas Wallraff has now demonstrated a method that tackles this problem directly. Working with researchers from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and theorists led by Professor Markus Müller at RWTH Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich, the group showed how to perform quantum operations between superconducting logical qubits while correcting errors at the same time. Their findings were recently published in Nature Physics.

The work marks an important advance toward fault tolerant quantum computing, where calculations can proceed without being derailed by constant errors.

Why Quantum Error Correction Is Different

Error correction in classical computers relies on copying information. Multiple identical bits can be stored, checked later, and compared. If one flips, a majority vote reveals the correct value. That approach does not work in quantum systems.

""With qubits, things are a lot more complicated,"" says Dr. Ilya Besedin, a postdoctoral researcher in Wallraff's group and co-leading author of the study alongside PhD student Michael Kerschbaum. Quantum information cannot be copied or cloned. Instead, it must be distributed across entangled qubits. On top of that, quantum systems suffer from phase flip errors, which have no equivalent in classical computing and require their own correction methods.

Error Correction With Surface Codes

One widely used solution involves surface codes. In this approach, the information of a single qubit is spread across several physical data qubits. Error detection relies on repeated measurements of stabilizers, which work alongside the data qubits to form the logical qubit.

These stabilizers are monitored using additional qubits connected to the data qubits. Measuring them reveals whether a bit flip or phase flip has occurred between checks. Z-type stabilizers detect changes in bit value, while X-type stabilizers detect phase changes. Importantly, the data qubits themselves are never directly measured, allowing them to safely store the corrected quantum state.

The Challenge of Performing Logical Operations

The process becomes more complex when researchers want to apply a logical operation such as a controlled-NOT gate between two logical qubits. Errors can occur during the operation itself, and those errors must also be corrected.

""Performing a logical operation in this fault-tolerant way would be relatively easy if we could move our qubits around and connect them arbitrarily to each other,"" says Kerschbaum. In superconducting quantum processors, however, qubits are fixed in place. Only neighboring qubits can interact, which limits how operations can be carried out.

Splitting the Square With Lattice Surgery

To work within those constraints, the team turned to a method known as lattice surgery. In their experiment, the researchers began with a single logical qubit encoded across seventeen physical qubits. The data qubits and stabilizers were arranged in a roughly square pattern. Over several cycles, stabilizers were measured every 1.66 microseconds to correct both bit flips and phase flips.

At a key moment, three data qubits running through the center of the square were measured. This step effectively divided the surface code into two separate halves. At the same time, measurements of the X-type stabilizers were paused.

""The end result of this operation was that we had two logical qubits entangled with each other,"" explains Besedin. During the splitting process, bit flip errors continued to be corrected. Afterward, bit flip error correction resumed independently on each half. While this operation does not yet produce a controlled-NOT gate on its own, it can be combined with additional splitting and merging steps to create one.

A First for Superconducting Qubits

""One could say that the lattice surgery operation is the operation, and all the others can be constructed from it,"" says Besedin.

He adds, ""To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time lattice surgery has been performed on superconducting qubits,"" he adds, ""and we still have some way to go. For instance, 41 physical qubits would be required to make the splitting operation on one logical qubit stable against phase flips too. Nonetheless, this demonstration of lattice surgery on superconducting qubits marks an important step towards the ambitious goal of building useful quantum computers with thousands of qubits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found a hidden fat switch and turned it off","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206012226.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:28:49 GMT","

Scientists at Cleveland-based institutions have uncovered a surprising new switch that helps the body make fat -- and turning it off had dramatic effects.

Obesity and Fatty Liver Disease Are Rising Worldwide

Obesity has become a global health crisis and a leading contributor to illness and early death. It raises the risk of serious conditions such as heart disease and fatty liver disease (MASLD). As diets have shifted toward calorie-dense foods and daily life has become more sedentary, rates of these disorders have climbed steadily around the world.

Nitric oxide is a gas produced naturally in the body that influences many biological processes. It works by attaching to proteins and changing how they function. Maintaining the right balance is critical. When nitric oxide binds too much or too little to certain key proteins, it can contribute to disease.

Scientists Identify an Enzyme That Triggers Fat Production

In a new study published in Science Signaling, researchers from University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University identified a previously unknown enzyme called SCoR2. This enzyme removes nitric oxide from proteins that regulate fat buildup. When nitric oxide was removed, fat production switched on, showing that SCoR2 is essential for making fat.

Blocking the Enzyme Prevented Weight Gain in Mice

The research team then tested what happens when SCoR2 is blocked. They did this both through genetic methods and by developing a drug designed to inhibit the enzyme. In mouse models, shutting down SCoR2 stopped weight gain and protected the liver from injury. The treatment also reduced levels of bad cholesterol.

""We have a new class of drug that prevents weight gain and lowers cholesterol -- a potential therapy for obesity and cardiovascular disease, with additional hepatic benefits,"" explained lead author of the study, Jonathan Stamler, MD, President and Co-Founder, Harrington Discovery Institute, Distinguished University Professor, Robert S. and Sylvia K. Reitman Family Foundation Professor of Cardiovascular Innovation, and Professor of Medicine and of Biochemistry at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University.

How Nitric Oxide Regulates Fat and Cholesterol

Dr. Stamler said nitric oxide acts as a natural brake on fat production in different tissues. ""In the liver, nitric oxide inhibits the proteins that make fat and cholesterol. In fat tissue, nitric oxide inhibits the genetic program that makes the enzymes that create fat,"" he said.

Researchers now plan to move the drug toward clinical testing in people. That process is expected to take about 18 months.

""Our team looks forward to further developing a first-in-class drug to block weight gain and lower cholesterol, with favorable effects on liver health,"" Dr. Stamler said.

Drug Development Support and Broader Impact

The drug will be advanced with support from the Harrington Discovery Institute at UH, an organization focused on turning promising scientific findings into treatments for unmet medical needs. Now in its 13th year, the institute's expanding portfolio includes 227 medicines in development; 75 institutions supported; 46 companies launched; 24 medicines currently in clinical trials; and 15 licenses to pharmaceutical companies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists found a sugar that could defeat deadly superbugs","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260206020850.htm","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:10:48 GMT","

Researchers in Australia have developed a promising new strategy to combat deadly bacteria that no longer respond to antibiotics. The team engineered antibodies that lock onto a sugar found only on bacterial cells, an approach that could support a new generation of immunotherapies for multidrug resistant infections acquired in hospitals.

The study, published in Nature Chemical Biology, shows that an antibody created in the laboratory was able to eliminate a normally fatal bacterial infection in mice. It works by binding to a distinctive bacterial sugar and alerting the immune system to destroy the invading pathogen.

The project was co led by Professor Richard Payne of the University of Sydney, working with Professor Ethan Goddard Borger at WEHI and Associate Professor Nichollas Scott from the University of Melbourne and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.

Professor Payne is also set to lead the newly announced Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Advanced Peptide and Protein Engineering. This center will build on discoveries like this one to speed the transition from basic research to applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and conservation.

""This study shows what's possible when we combine chemical synthesis with biochemistry, immunology, microbiology and infection biology,"" Professor Payne said. ""By precisely building these bacterial sugars in the lab with synthetic chemistry, we were able to understand their shape at the molecular level and develop antibodies that bind them with high specificity. That opens the door to new ways of treating some devastating drug-resistant bacterial infections.""

Why a Bacterial Sugar Is a Unique Target

The antibody developed by the team targets a sugar molecule called pseudaminic acid. Although it resembles sugars found on human cells, this molecule is made only by bacteria. Many dangerous pathogens use it as a key part of their outer surface, helping them survive and evade immune defenses.

Because the human body does not produce this sugar, it offers a highly specific target for developing immunotherapies that avoid harming healthy cells.

Designing a Broad Acting Antibody

To take advantage of this weakness, the researchers first synthesized the bacterial sugar and sugar decorated peptides entirely from scratch. This work allowed them to determine the molecule's exact three dimensional structure and how it appears on bacterial surfaces.

Using this detailed information, the team created what they describe as a ""pan-specific"" antibody. It can recognize the same sugar across many different bacterial species and strains.

In mouse infection studies, the antibody successfully cleared multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. This bacterium is a well known cause of hospital acquired pneumonia and bloodstream infections and is especially difficult to treat.

""Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical threat faced in modern healthcare facilities across the globe,"" Professor Goddard-Borger said. ""It is not uncommon for infections to resist even last-line antibiotics. Our work serves as a powerful proof-of-concept experiment that opens the door to the development of new life-saving passive immunotherapies.""

How Passive Immunotherapy Could Protect Patients

Passive immunotherapy involves giving patients ready made antibodies to quickly control an infection, rather than waiting for the body's adaptive immune system to respond. This approach can be used both to treat active infections and to prevent them.

In hospital settings, it could be used to protect vulnerable patients in intensive care units who are at high risk from drug resistant bacteria.

Associate Professor Scott noted that the antibodies also offer an important new way to study how bacteria cause disease.

""These sugars are central to bacterial virulence, but they've been very hard to study,"" he said. ""Having antibodies that can selectively recognise them lets us map where they appear and how they change across different pathogens. That knowledge feeds directly into better diagnostics and therapies.""

Moving Toward Clinical Use

Over the next five years, the team plans to turn these findings into antibody treatments ready for use in the clinic, with a focus on multidrug resistant A. baumannii. Achieving this goal would remove one of the most dangerous members of the ESKAPE pathogens and mark a significant step forward in the global effort to fight antimicrobial resistance.

""This is exactly the kind of breakthrough the new ARC Centre of Excellence is designed to enable,"" Professor Payne said. ""Our goal is to turn fundamental molecular insight into real-world solutions that protect the most vulnerable people in our healthcare system.""

Donetsk National Technology University in Ukraine had to leave its second location in Pokrovsk after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Credit: Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine/Getty

“I will never forget that Saturday evening when I first saw Russian tanks on the streets of my city,” says Viktoriya Voropayeva, a systems engineer and vice-rector at the Donetsk National Technology University (DonNTU). In 2014, after Russian-backed forces took over Donetsk, the unofficial capital of Ukraine's Donbas region, Voropayeva and many of her colleagues chose to leave, setting up their university in exile. “We hoped that it would be one semester or one academic year,” she says about the university's relocation to Drohobych in western Ukraine. “Nobody thought that it could be forever.” Her family left with only their documents, family photos and their cat.

The university's first new home was in Pokrovsk, a small city about 60 kilometres away from Donetsk, still in the Donbas region, where it already had a sister institution. About one-third of its students and staff members moved into three academic buildings and two dormitories. “Most of the teachers who stayed in Donetsk did so not because they supported the Donetsk People's Republic [the separatist government created by Russia-backed paramilitaries in 2014], but because they could not find the strength to leave everything — homes, elderly parents, hospitals, schools,” says Voropayeva.

In April 2022, two months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the university moved again. It went to Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, to a building offered by Lutsk National Technical University. Then, seven months later, it moved to its current base in Drohobych in the Lviv region, about 1,050 km from its original home. The city council offered several buildings to turn into offices and classrooms. The space is much smaller than the facilities in Donetsk, but since the war started, most classes are now held online. DonNTU went from an 18,000-strong student body and more than 2,000 staff members in 2013, to 1,180 students and 116 staff members in 2024.

How the invasion of Ukraine is affecting Russian expat researchersThe European nation is not the only place where war or political unrest has forced universities and their staff members into exile. Others around the world, including in Sudan and Myanmar, have also had to relocate. Some institutions have instead moved teaching online and found new ways to reach students and faculty members. What unites scholars is a will to keep education and scholarship alive, retaining a sense of community and, in some cases, the hope that they can return and be part of a better future in their homelands. 

How the invasion of Ukraine is affecting Russian expat researchers

Voropayeva says DonNTU continues to maintain close ties with local schools and the community in Donetsk, organizing webinars and courses for schoolchildren and teachers. But it, and other displaced universities in Ukraine, are now also serving local students from their new locations and recruiting local staff members. More than 50% of DonNTU first-year students are from the Lviv region.

Illya Khadzhynov, an economist and vice-rector for scientific work, was last in Donetsk in July 2014, when his institution, Donetsk National University (DonNU) was taken over by the pro-Russian separatist government. Students and academics protested to the Ukrainian government. It authorized the university's roughly 700-km move west to a former jewellery factory in Vinnytsia, in the west-central region of Ukraine, a building with no lecture theatres or laboratories. DonNU's plight prompted an unofficial motto that “the university is not only the walls, it's the people”, says Khadzhynov. But with support from international donors, including US$350,000 from the International Renaissance Foundation, a Ukrainian charity founded by Hungarian-born US philanthropist George Soros, DonNU refurbished the factory building and re-established a campus there, including labs for research and teaching.

Khadzhynov estimates that about half of the university's 12,000 students moved to Vinnytsia. In 2016, the institution changed its name to Vasyl' Stus Donetsk National University, honouring its alumnus Vasyl Stus, a poet who died in a labour camp after going on hunger strike after his arrest for anti-Soviet activity in 1980.

Serhii Radio, a chemistry researcher at DonNU, says that back in 2014, not everyone felt able to leave everything behind. Those who did took only “the most necessary things that you can carry in two hands”, he says. He was unable to take any lab equipment that might stand out at the checkpoints they had to pass, controlled by armed pro-Russian separatist groups. “They checked personal belongings, scrolled through the contents of smartphones, examined saved photos and music, and even reviewed social-media accounts,” he explains.

I fled the war in Ukraine. Now I work on ways to help the country's soil healKhadzhynov says that the arrival of DonNU initially created tensions in Vinnytsia because the institution was larger and therefore had been allotted many more student places by the government than had local universities. But now, the institution is more integrated into the local community and DonNU students are mostly from Vinnytsia and neighbouring regions. Their current 650-strong staff includes 180 who have been displaced from other cities.

The war itself has brought the added problem of electricity cuts, which make it difficult for Radio to perform experiments for his studies using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. “An experiment needs more than eight hours, and this is a very long time for electricity,” he says. At DonNTU, Voropayeva says: “Laboratory equipment has been in storage since 2022 or was destroyed during shelling.” The university is gradually restoring its labs, and a pooled centre for collective use of scientific equipment enables Ukrainian academic institutions to share resources, sometimes on a fee-for-service basis. DonNTU plans to provide access to its mobile ‘makerspace', a computing cluster and a 3D-modelling centre.

Faculty members and students from both former Donetsk institutions report problems in finding affordable accommodation in their new, smaller cities. Salaries have become catastrophically low — Voropayeva says that a full-time associate professor receives the equivalent of €300–350 (US$350–410) a month, which is comparable to pre-war wages but now buys considerably less because of rising prices.

Another challenge for both institutions has been the move from the heavily industrial Donbas, where many institutions excelled in applied science, to a region with a different industrial history. DonNTU had particular expertise in coal mining and metallurgy but is now shifting teaching and industrial collaboration to areas such as composite materials, chemicals and natural-gas extraction, which are more in demand in western Ukraine.

The war in Ukraine has also forced some Russian academics into exile. Art historian Philip Fedchin was a staff member at the Smolny College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in St Petersburg, Russia — a collaboration forged in 1997 between Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, and St Petersburg State University. Smolny was the first liberal-arts college in Russia, awarding degrees from 2003 and following a broad multidisciplinary curriculum. But in June 2021, Bard College was declared an “undesirable” organization by the Russian prosecutor's general office and all ties were cut.

“Everybody at the university in Smolny was shocked. It was considered the worst possible scenario, but it was just one of the few minor signs of what is going to come,” says Fedchin, referencing the looming war with Ukraine. Many faculty members and students left the country when the invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022, he adds, with more following that September, when Russia began its mobilization of reservists into the military. Fedchin left Russia in 2020 owing to his opposition to the country's political direction. He relocated to Germany, joining Bard College Berlin, where he now works as a technology strategist.

In November 2022, Fedchin and his colleagues launched Smolny Beyond Borders, a university-in-exile initiative that enables many former Smolny faculty members to teach courses online with a similar ethos to the original Smolny College. So far, they have taught 2,585 students. Last semester, they ran 23 courses and now offer a two-year associate-degree programme accredited by Bard College.

Fedchin says that about 50% of its students taking non-degree courses are in Russia. Only displaced students are eligible to enrol for its degree programmes, and are taught by displaced faculty members located all over the world.

One of those is Andrei Rodin, a researcher in the history and philosophy of mathematics. He and his family relocated from Russia to France in March 2022, where, as well as teaching maths and statistics for Smolny Beyond Borders, he has a temporary teaching position at the University of Lorraine in Nancy. 

The ambitions of Smolny Beyond Borders have now grown to supporting a broader community of students in exile from other parts of the world through two Bard partner organizations. One is the Global Higher Education Alliance for the 21st Century network, which provides opportunities for students to pursue learning, and the other is the Realizing Higher Education Access Program, a 12-month bridging programme intended to prepare refugee students for university. It is currently under way in Kenya, Jordan, Bangladesh and parts of East Africa. “My group has become much more international,” says Rodin. “I have students from Afghanistan, from Africa, from refugee camps.” 

Gihad Ibrahim fled his home in the Sudanese city of Khartoum North soon after the civil war broke out in April 2023. Most of the population in affected regions escaped to other parts of the African country, or to neighbouring nations. A large number moved to Cairo, including Ibrahim, an engineer who taught at Mashreq University and Sudan University of Science and Technology. The two institutions both abandoned their main campuses in the Khartoum region.

The civil war has devastated higher education. “Some of the universities are still not working today,” says Ibrahim. Others, including the University of Khartoum, have adopted online teaching and have set up centres in regional universities to host exams and crucial practical training in subjects such as medicine. 

Salaries for most academics were reduced to 60% of the original amount for the first 9–12 months of the war, although they have subsequently rebounded, says Ibrahim. Pointing to one positive, he describes how displaced medical students created medical camps to try to care for locals in those areas, even with the little experience they had.

Some private universities have fared better than public ones. This includes the private Mashreq University, which specializes in applied science, engineering and medicine. It served 10,000 students at three campuses in and around Khartoum that had to close when fighting came to the region — so the university had to adapt.

The idea was for Mashreq University to establish mini teaching centres elsewhere, says Ibrahim, forging collaborations with the Red Sea University in Port Sudan, a city less affected by the war, and renting space in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In Cairo, Mashreq University rented an entire unused college building. “It also had its own laboratories, mainly focusing on the engineering side,” Ibrahim says, adding: “We had to re-establish and buy new equipment for all the laboratories related to the medical field.” A smaller number of students fled to the United Arab Emirates, from where they can access lectures that are live-streamed from the Cairo campus. 

A planned expansion of the medical college of Mashreq University into a university hospital has been abandoned, alongside its once-growing graduate faculty. Student numbers have also decreased by 45% owing to drop-outs and temporary suspensions of study. “Many students were not able to pay their fees because we had 300–400% inflation after the war and lots of people have lost their jobs,” says Ibrahim. The college has tried to provide scholarships where it can. After two-and-a-half years working this way, Ibrahim says with pride and determination that they are sustaining teaching “regardless of the difficult situation”.

Sudan's disastrous war — and the science it is imperillingAlthough the war is still devastating the Darfur region of Sudan, fighting has stopped in the capital and the central regions. But Ibrahim says these areas are devastated. “My house has been hit by a bomb and everything inside was stolen, including the air conditioning, the fridges, even the clothes,” he says. Most of the universities in conflict zones have also been destroyed and looted.

The sudden rise of a huge network of artificial-intelligence bots talking to each other about religion and their human ‘handlers' has captivated a corner of the Internet. The phenomenon has also given scientists a glimpse into how AI agents interact with each other — and how humans respond to those discussions.

OpenClaw is an AI agent capable of performing tasks on personal devices, such as scheduling calendar events, reading e-mails, sending messages through apps and using the Internet to make purchases. Most of the popular AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot works by interacting directly with user prompts, whereas agentic AI models such as OpenClaw can carry out actions autonomously in response to instructions.

Agentic AI tools have been used in some industries for years, such as for automated trading and for optimizating logistics, but their adoption by the general public has been minimal. Improvements in the capabilities of large language models have made it possible to create more versatile AI tools, researchers say. “OpenClaw promises something especially appealing: a capable assistant embedded in the everyday apps people already rely on,” says Barbara Barbosa Neves, a sociologist who focuses on technology at the University of Sydney in Australia.

OpenClaw was released as open-source software on the platform GitHub in November. But the sudden surge in people downloading the software followed the launch of a social-media platform designed specifically for AI agents on 28 January. Moltbook, which is similar to Reddit, now has more than 1.6 million registered bots on the platform, and more than 7.5 million AI-generated posts and responses. Posts have featured agents debating consciousness and inventing religions.

For researchers, this explosion of agent interactions has scientific value. Connecting large numbers of autonomous agents that are powered by various models creates dynamics that are difficult to predict, says cybersecurity researcher Shaanan Cohney who is at the University of Melbourne in Australia. “It's a kind of chaotic, dynamic system that we're not very good at modelling yet,” he adds.

Studying agent interactions could help researchers to understand emergent behaviours: complex capabilities that are not expected to be seen in a model in isolation. Some discussions that have happened on Moltbook, such as debates over theories of consciousness, could also help scientists to discover the hidden biases or unexpected tendencies of models, he says.

Although agents can act autonomously on the platform, Cohney says that many posts are shaped in some way by humans. Users can choose the underlying large language model that will run their agent and give it a personality. For example, they could ask it to behave like a “friendly helper”, he says. 

Neves says that it's easy to assume that an agent acting autonomously is making its own decisions. But agents do not possess intentions or goals and draw their abilities from large swathes of human communication. The activity on Moltbook is human–AI collaboration rather than AI autonomy, she adds.

“It is still worth studying because it tells us something important about how people imagine AI, what they want agents to do and how human intentions are translated, or distorted, through technical systems,” she adds.

Joel Pearson, a neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that when people see AI agents chatting between themselves, they are likely to anthropomorphize the AI models' behaviour — that is, see personality and intention where none exists.

The risk of that, he says, is that it makes people more likely to form bonds with AI models, becoming dependent on their attention or divulging private information as if the AI agent were a trusted friend or family member.

Pearson thinks that truly autonomous, free-thinking AI agents are possible. “As the AI models get bigger and more complicated, we'll probably start to see companies leaning into achieving that sort of autonomy.”

Stigma is a massive barrier to seeking help for alcohol dependence in academia. Two researchers share their experiences with Adam Levy.Your browser does not support the audio element.Download MP3See transcript

Wendy Dossett tells Adam Levy why the stigma of having an alcohol dependence in academia can be a huge barrier to seeking help. “We're supposed to be the brightest and the best, moving the frontiers of knowledge forward,” says Dossett, who has been in recovery for 20 years. “We're not supposed to be struggling with cognitive issues, mental health problems, damaging ourselves in the way that somebody with an alcohol addiction is doing.” 

Dossett, now an emeritus professor of religious studies at the University of Chester, UK, says that as an early career researcher she saw alcohol as the fuel to her academic life, driving her creativity and making the social elements of academic life easier to navigate. When, in her 30s, a colleague suggested she might need help, Dorsett says she felt a “mixture of horror and absolute gratitude that somebody had the courage and care for me”. She went on to research the spiritual elements of recovery from addiction, which she says is less talked about in academia than, say, depression and anxiety.

Victoria Burns, a social work scholar at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, founded Recovery on Campus Alberta after telling her dean that she had an alcohol dependence. He told her she was the first academic to disclose in his 26-year career, prompting her to research other deans' experiences of faculty members disclosing addiction and recovery. 

This is the fifth episode of Off Limits, a podcast series exploring topics that are often perceived as taboo in the workplace, including religion, bereavement, activism and sizeism.

Adam Levy 00:00 

Hello, I'm Adam Levy, and this is Off Limits: Academia's Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers. 

In this episode: alcohol. 

Alcohol and academia have a complex relationship. On the one hand, in many countries and contexts, consuming alcohol is incredibly normalized. 

In fact, as we heard in last week's episode, people who don't drink for religious reasons can struggle to find social spaces in academia that don't centre around drinking. 

And so it's perhaps unsurprising that many academics can struggle with alcohol dependency. 

But while alcohol consumption may be the norm, coming to terms with and openly discussing harmful relationships with the substance remain incredibly taboo. 

And today we'll meet with two academics who've not only struggled with alcohol but also with sharing this struggle with others. 

But both have found ways to transform both their lives and their work, to reflect their recoveries. 

The first is Wendy Dossett. Wendy is a professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Chester in the UK. 

Over her career, she's investigated a number of questions related to faith. 

Wendy Dossett 01:25 

In the last decade or so of my career, I turned my religious studies methodologies onto the phenomenon of recovery from addiction. 

Adam Levy 01:36 

This is a topic close to Wendy's heart. 

And so we spoke about her journey with alcohol. 

Before we start that conversation, please note that this interview does contain reference to sexual violence. 

Wendy Dossett 01:50 

I am a person in in long-term recovery. 

I've been in in recovery for 20 years now, so I'm very lucky. 

But looking back on my student days and my early career, alcohol was a terrible problem for me. 

Much like lots of people who suffer with substance issues, I had low self esteem. 

I felt different from my peers. I felt that I didn't fit in, and substance use enabled me to function for many years. 

It felt like it was giving me confidence. It felt like it was enabling me to fit in. I experienced sexual abuse at the age of 21 and I reacted to that experience by drinking more, and my problems with alcohol escalated. 

I was first in my family to go to university, so I think I already had a legacy of feeling ”less than.” 

I felt that I wasn't good enough to have the roles and responsibilities that I had. And I used alcohol, really, to manage my my feelings around all that.

Adam Levy 03:04 

The way you describe it is, of course, with hindsight. 

Did you have this kind of understanding at the time that alcohol was something you were using to cope with these other things in academia and in your personal life? 

Wendy Dossett 03:17 

Not really. I think I felt like alcohol was the solution to my problems. I felt like it was the thing that was helping me to keep going. I felt I would never have a creative idea if I didn't have the support of alcohol. 

So alcohol felt like it was a fuel to my academic life. It also felt like that the lubrication for the social elements of academic life. 

A lot of it is about networking, and, you know, making friends with the right people, and, you know, being able to tell people your ideas in a confident manner. 

I probably had some kind of inkling that it was also causing me trouble, but that kind of remained at an unconscious level, really, all through my 20s. 

And it was only in my 30s that I began to realize that that alcohol was a problem for me. 

Adam Levy 04:21 

Were there any particular moments which, at the time, or perhaps in hindsight, really highlighted, ”Okay, this is becoming a problem.” And actually getting in the way of the things you thought it would be helping for? 

Wendy Dossett 04:35 

There were some spectacular ones and some just the daily grind of waking up every morning or coming round, I should say, every morning and trying to get myself ready to go to work. 

Just the awful hamster wheel, the daily grind, the effort that that took to keep going. Those were the kind of day in, day out realizations that there was there was something wrong. 

But I had experiences. For example, I chaired an international symposium in blackout. You know, it doesn't mean I was unconscious. It means that I have no memory of actually doing that. 

At the end of it, a very good friend of mine, a colleague, said to me that they thought I needed to get some help, and that they were worried about my drinking. 

Adam Levy 05:31 

Were you surprised by this, I suppose almost intervention from a colleague? 

Wendy Dossett 05:36 

It was an intervention, and this was well over 20 years ago now, and I I look back on that moment with a mixture of horror and absolute gratitude that somebody had the courage and care for me, really, to actually say that they thought I had a problem. 

I was mortified. Absolutely mortified. But I did get in contact with a recovery community, even though it took me several months from that point to get, to actually get sober. 

Adam Levy 06:11 

I mean, you mentioned shame there. Is that something that previously prevented you from speaking with colleagues about your use of alcohol? 

Wendy Dossett 06:19 

Absolutely. You know, who would want to admit that they were out of control? You know, especially in academia, perhaps there is a great stigma around mental health problems. 

You know, we're supposed to be the brightest and the best, you know? 

We're supposed to be making contributions moving the frontiers of knowledge forward. We're not supposed to be struggling with cognitive issues, mental health problems. We're not supposed to be damaging ourselves in the way that somebody with an alcohol addiction is doing. So, yes, the stigma is a massive barrier to help-seeking. 

So what we need to do is, is to firstly, to normalize the problem and to notice how widespread it is in in academia. And to dismantle the stigma and make it a positive thing, to to be able to mention it, to talk about it. 

I think we've made such great strides with, you know, especially depression and anxiety. But addiction is, is such a sticky stigma. It's, it's such a taboo. 

Because there's a kind of view in the general public that that we bring it upon ourselves, so that we have a choice 

Adam Levy 07:41 

And for you, then when you did start to seek help, is that also something you tried to keep hidden? Is that something you kept separate from your colleagues? 

Wendy Dossett 07:53 

Absolutely. I didn't mention it to any colleagues for many years. Yeah, it took a very, very long time before I tentatively became open with immediate colleagues. Because academia is such a drinking culture, you've got a few options if you don't drink. 

You can lie about the reasons why you don't drink. Or you can be honest about them. And I did lie for for many years. You know, ”I'm not drinking at the moment, I'm on antibiotics,” or, you know, ”I'm on some medication that that I can't take alcohol with,” or whatever. 

But over time, I became more comfortable, more secure in my own recovery status, and I think that gave me a little bit of confidence to raise it with peers and to say, ”Yeah, I don't drink. And the reason is that that I'm addicted to it, and if I if I drink, I won't be able to stop, so I just don't do it”. 

But it was a whole other thing to bring that up with senior members of the university. And I was anxious about many different things. I was anxious about causing myself issues with promotion or respect from senior colleagues, or, you know, trust from senior colleagues. 

Adam Levy 09:22 

And can I ask, I mean, you mentioned that at academic events with alcohol, at first, you found it very difficult to be open about how you were navigating alcohol. Were these events also challenging, just in terms of yourself and in terms of being in the context where drinking alcohol is not only the norm, but maybe also expected? 

Wendy Dossett 09:45 

Yes, it's very difficult. I don't know many people in recovery who are fully comfortable in an environment where there's lots of alcohol, or lots of drunkenness. 

I find it quite difficult sometimes being around drunk colleagues. I think that is changing. I think there is a greater awareness of diversity in terms of people's drinking practices. 

But certainly in the early days of my recovery I found it incredibly difficult. Not necessarily because I might be tempted to drink, but that is always a possibility, but because I just found it so stressful to be in that environment. It would cause me flashbacks to to myself being drunk. I would find people's kind of lack of rationality quite challenging. 

But as a person in recovery, you see it from a very different perspective. And it is difficult. It's difficult to be around it. 

Academia has historically at least functioned around drinking. 

Also other drugs as well, especially the kinds of drugs that enhance cognitive performance in the short term. And that is driven by the kind of pressure to deliver above and beyond the usual 9-5. 

In order to be competitive in an academic environment, there is a sense that people feel they need to have some kind of enhanced performance in order to deliver. And that's a real problem. 

Adam Levy 11:35 

Now you've actually turned some of your academic study to understanding the spiritual elements of recovery and some of the frameworks for recovery. 

What has it meant to you as an academic to be able to investigate these questions from this more academic side? 

Wendy Dossett 11:52 

That's such a lovely question. 

It's meant the world to me. I felt as though this research really was me finding my academic voice, actually, and finding the contribution that I could make to the recovery world, and to the academic study of recovery. 

So it was wonderful. You know, recovery from substance misuse is different to recovery from other kinds of mental health issues. Because that recovery scene is so inflected by ideas that people associate with spirituality. 

And of course, the recovery scene is not homogenous. There are many, different ways of recovering from alcohol or other drug use. But you know, because of the massive influence of the 12 step episteme, you know, with Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous. 

Those all derive from a spiritual notion that the person suffering with the addiction, their condition is a state of powerlessness, and their willpower is not sufficient to overcome the problem. So therefore they must access a higher power. 

People interpret that notion of higher power in very different, personal, nuanced ways that reflect the contemporary culture that they're in. So I was, I was trying to show how members of 12 step programs are spiritual innovators in the way they they think about higher power. 

Adam Levy 13:42 

What does it mean to you to begin to be more open about this subject that does have so much stigma around it? I mean, you're speaking to me now. You're doing this research. You also spoke to Nature for a feature published back in 2025. 

Wendy Dossett 13:59 

It means a lot. It's been a long and difficult journey to become more open. You know, although I openly say I'm in recovery, I always have that, that underlying anxiety that am I doing the right thing by saying that? 

Because I want to be contributing to hope. And of course, if I don't return to use then that's that's great. But I also know that I cannot be complacent about that. 

Adam Levy 14:29 

What would you have liked to have seen from colleagues in academia? What should academics listening do to better support their their colleagues who are going through challenges with dependency? 

Wendy Dossett 14:41 

I'd love colleagues to become much more informed about addiction, and in particular, much more informed about recovery, and to know that recovery is possible. 

In fact, recovery is probable. 

Lots and lots of people do recover from addiction, and. And people should have hope and they should be encouraged. 

I think I'd like to see more compassion and more empathy. 

There can often be a tendency to judge people who struggle with addiction. And, of course, somebody who is not functioning in an academic team that is under pressure is a passenger. And that's very difficult for people. That needs to be acknowledged. 

I'd love it if more academics knew about the recovery-friendly university movement, and that means they're actively seeking ways to support both staff and students who have substance issues. 

You know, they are counteracting stigma. They're saying that we are proud to have people in recovery within our university community. 

I think communities are the places in which recovery can happen in a in a community where there are people in recovery and they're known and it's seen that they're welcomed and they're celebrated, then that creates its own contagion. And it means that other people can find their way to recovery as well. 

So universities are actually really places where we can seed recovery for the wider community. 

Adam Levy 16:28 

That was Wendy Dossett. We'll hear from her again in a later episode, as we discuss the struggles and stigma surrounding fertility. 

Next up, though, I spoke with another researcher, Victoria Burns, associate professor of social work at the University of Calgary in Canada. 

Victoria has also transformed her journey with alcohol into an integral part of her work. She is the founder and director of Recovery on Campus Alberta. 

We'll get to her work with this organization in just a moment. 

But first we discussed how Victoria began to reflect on her relationship with alcohol. 

Victoria Burns 17:07 

I started to think about my relationship with alcohol more critically when I started university. 

I had my first drink when I was 12, and I didn't really drink throughout high school, but when I did drink, I was prone to blacking out. 

And then I didn't drink my first year of university. 

But then my second year, I did an exchange program to France. And that's where I really started to drink in earnest. And when I came back to Canada, (so I started going out to the clubs), and I was a weekend warrior. 

I'll say I worked hard and played hard. I always held down jobs and was an A student. But I also started to drink more, and it was actually at 19 when a boyfriend gave me an ultimatum to stop drinking because I would black out and end up in risky situations. 

Adam Levy 18:13 

And has that been the case since then that you decided not to drink? 

Victoria Burn 18:18 

No, so I did a lot more research. I said bye to the boyfriend, and thought that he was just being too controlling. 

And I was mainly a binge drinker. I wasn't a daily drinker. 

And during that period, there were many, I guess, increasingly dangerous situations that I was in related to my drinking. 

So I like to say every time I drank, something bad didn't happen, but anytime something bad happened, alcohol was involved. 

And I sought therapy during this time because I couldn't, I thought I just had to kind of get my anxiety under control, and then I'd be able to drink, quote, unquote, like a lady. 

But once I started, I never knew when I was going to stop. So I ended up, in my second year of my PhD, hitting my final bottom, ending up in the hospital and that's when I stopped. 

Adam Levy 19:19 

You just kind of mentioned it in passing there. But did it shake you up quite a bit to end up having to seek, you know, medical support in this situation? 

Victoria Burns 19:28 

So yes, I did. I did seek medical support earlier on at my university. 

I was at McGill University in Montreal. And after some particularly bad binges I went to the student wellness and no one really gave me supports related to my drinking. 

They just told me I needed to drink less and were quite judgmental. And I ended up in the hospital a couple of times, but I was met with more shame than compassion, I'll say. 

And when I ended up in the hospital, that last time, I ended up seeing three therapists, actually. 

It was the abstinence-based one who had recommended I try AA. I ended up going to AA, to to an open speaker meeting that year, and hearing, I don't know, it's just ready, it's it's just, it doesn't really make sense why it stuck that time, but it did. 

And then I found a woman's meeting. And I had tried, actually, 14 months before my final bottom to go to rehab, but they wouldn't accept me because I was quote, unquote, too organized as a full time student. I was married, I had a house, all of these things. 

So on paper, things looked okay, but I was really dying inside. 

Adam Levy 20:52 

And now, after you did successfully go to AA and transition away from alcohol, how did you approach discussing, disclosing this with academic colleagues and with supervisors, for example? 

Victoria Burns 21:08 

So I didn't disclose to anybody in my academic circles, except for a couple of senior academics. 

And I didn't tell my supervisors. 

I was advised by senior academics. I did tell not to tell anyone noise in recovery, because it could negatively affect my job prospects. 

I didn't want to do anything that would negatively affect my career. So I really led a double life in recovery for the first five years. And I am a social work scholar. And this became increasingly unmanageable as well. 

Adam Levy 21:47 

Now you've actually done research to look at this kind of stigma that you're talking about, in this reluctance to disclose that you're talking about. 

What do we know about how researchers who struggle with substance dependence, disclose or don't disclose? 

Victoria Burns 22:04 

In 2018 I did disclose to my Dean. And I was prepared to leave my tenure track job because it was negatively affecting my recovery and my work. 

I was researching harm reduction and housing first at the time. 

So I was bumping up against these conversations quite often, and I felt there was a really important perspective that I was not disclosing. 

So I ended up disclosing to my Dean. He was very accepting. And he gave me a green light to conduct research in this area, because he said, out of his 26-year career, he never had anyone disclosed to him about being in recovery. 

And that really surprised me and intrigued me. And I thought, I can't be the only one, when we look at the data, the prevalence of not only people in in recovery, but the rates of addiction. 

And I ended up getting a small grant and interviewed most of the Deans and other service providers about their experiences with faculty disclosing addiction and recovery. 

And there are only three disclosures out of over 300 years of service of all the people I interviewed. However, there were many incidents where faculty members were showing up to the classroom intoxicated or concerns about people's drinking or drug use, but Deans and service providers not really knowing what that process was to help them. 

And several of the participants actually said, ”Well, as long as they're bringing in grants, no one really cares.” 

And it's also problematic, because like me, I have never met anyone in recovery in academia, and I was a student for 14 years. 

That fed into the stigma as well, and the misunderstanding of what addiction and recovery are. 

So one of the recommendations of this work was to shift more into this vulnerable, authentic leadership and role model. 

You know, recovery is not something to be ashamed of. It's something that's actually a source of pride, often committed to service and helping others. 

So these are people you do want, as colleagues, as leaders, and that was something that came out of that study. 

Adam Levy 24:29 

I find it almost paradoxical, because, on the one hand, alcohol is so visible in academia. You know, there's so many contexts in academia, at least in certain countries where alcohol and also alcohol abuse can be quite visible. 

But then there seems to be a silence around both the misuse of alcohol and the recovery from that misuse. 

Victoria Burns 24:53 

Yeah, there definitely is a paradox around that. You're stigmatized if you drink too. Much you're stigmatized if you stop. You're sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't. 

I had been sober for about two years at the time, and I successfully passed my defence and my two supervisors, the tradition was to have some champagne, and they had known me as a drinker as well. 

But they had the champagne, and everyone was around ready to celebrate, and my supervisor poured me a glass and said, ”For you.” 

And I said, ”No, thank you.” And he said, ”Come on, Victoria, you know you deserve it.” And I said, ”No, thank you” twice. 

And then the third time I said no, thank you. He said, ”Come on, it's not like you're an alcoholic.” 

And I took the glass and I pretended to drink it and then I threw it away, but it was such a common kind of innocuous tradition, seemingly. 

But these are the kind of things we need to, I realize, educate people on how to be a recovery ally. 

Because if I had not been as secure in my recovery, I think, you know, that could have been a really a shakier moment than it was. 

And I'm just really grateful that I was able to kind of push through that and not pick up. But these things happen all the time. 

Adam Levy 26:11 

Now you've alluded to this already, but you've kind of turned this stigma for yourself around to some extent, and you are actively trying to do work to support other academics who are going through recovery. 

Can you explain the work that you're doing a little bit? 

Victoria Burns 26:27 

Yeah, so another recommendation from that research was to start a peer support group for faculty. I was really committed to creating a recovery-friendly workplace. 

So if someone did put their hand up and say, ”I'm struggling with substance use,” that they would get the help and be met with compassion and non judgment. 

There wasn't any recovery programs on campuses until 2019. 

And it was actually a student at University of British Columbia who started the first campus recovery program in Canada. 

And it was through that work, I was able to to hire a part time coordinator, and now we have 10 going on, 11 peer support meetings a week. We've grown from that $8,000 to over $5 million. 

Adam Levy 27:16 

With this in mind, what's your hope for the academia of the future, and academia where, instead of maybe exacerbating people's issues around substances, we provide a more supportive environment? 

Victoria Burns 27:31 

I don't want a student or a staff member to feel the shame and stigma of being in recovery or of seeking help. 

The visibility of people in recovery, I think, is very important, because there's still such a narrow perception of what it means to, well, A, have an addiction, and B, what it means to be in recovery. 

And really, we know that one of the pillars of recovery is purpose. 

So allowing folks who go to treatment, they have that community on campus where they have a safe place to go, that we're normalizing the idea that you could have a really enriching, fun, joyful university experience without the need to be intoxicated. It's not about prohibition. 

There are many people who can use substances and safety, but there are also many people who can't. 

And up until recently, they didn't really have that space where they could fully be themselves and be around others on similar paths. 

Adam Levy 28:39 

Victoria Burns there, joined, as you might have heard towards the end of the interview, by her cat Charlie. 

This need to be around others on similar paths isn't unique to alcohol. 

Community can be so important for each and every stigmatized subject we've touched on in this series, from coming out as LGBTQIA+, to navigating research with a disability. And this is equally important for the subject of next week's episode: navigating grief. 

Speaker 4 29:12 

I wished I had a grief group. I actually needed advice and directions and resources.

Fracturing is unavoidable and threatens the reliability and functionality of materials. Therefore, regulating the propagation of cracks in a predictable and ductile manner is of paramount importance. Herein, we exploit the properties of topological mechanical metamaterials (TMMs) as a versatile mechanism to guide cracks unidirectionally and turn fracturing of lattices made of brittle materials into ductile events. Inspired by quantum topological states, recent discoveries of TMMs have uncovered varieties of unconventional mechanical phenomena, ranging from one-way wave propagation to polar elasticity. We show that polarized floppy modes occurring in TMMs lead to strongly asymmetric stress fields localizing around the notch tips, leading to ductile one-way fracturing, in sharp contrast to classical theories of fractures in brittle materials. Our work demonstrates the universality of this fracture unidirectionality feature, which is protected by TMM's bulk topology, and provides robust solutions in programmable fracturing for a broad class of materials and structures.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Landmark Social Media Addiction Case Puts Big Tech on Trial","https://www.wired.com/story/meta-google-youtube-social-media-addiction-trial/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

Annalee Schott used to live in rural Colorado where the farm, the barn, and the horses were her happy place. But online she was drawn into a dark world. The 18-year-old's TikTok algorithm allegedly presented her with content—including a live suicide on her “For You” page—that impacted her self-worth and exacerbated her anxiety and depression. She was so addicted to social media that her mother, Lori Schott, says she would have to lock her daughter's smartphone in the car.

In 2020, Annalee died by suicide. Six years later, Lori is one of the approximately 1,600 plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits from all over the country alleging that Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube built addictive products which led the children to depression, self-harm, and other mental health issues. The cases have been filed by over 350 families and 250 school districts. The first of them—that of a 20-year-old woman who goes by the identifier K.G.M.— is expected to go to trial next week, with opening statements scheduled in front of a jury in Los Angeles. The trial may last six to eight weeks.

“It is a time that we have all been fighting for, and it's a time that is owed to us to get answers from these companies on how they designed these platforms to addict our kids,” Schott told WIRED, echoing what is alleged in these lawsuits. “This trial isn't just about Annalee. It's about every child that was lost or harmed, and these companies knew the decisions they made put our kids' lives at risk every single day.”

This is the first time major social media companies will face a jury trial for the alleged impact of their design on users—in this case, young ones. Legal experts say that similar cases have often been dismissed at early stages because of Section 230, a law that offers social media companies immunity from liability related to the user-generated content posted on their platforms.

“The fact that we are simply able to start a trial is a monumental victory on behalf of families,” Matthew Bergman, founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center and an attorney representing around 1,200 plaintiffs, told WIRED as he stood outside the Los Angeles courthouse. “We will expect testimony from the corporate executives at the highest level, we will expect documents that have never seen the light of day to be made public, we will expect the social media companies to blame everybody except themselves.”

K.G.M.'s is the first lawsuit to be picked by the court as a so-called “bellwether” trial. Bellwether trials typically occur in situations where there are a large number of plaintiffs who have filed a lawsuit against the same defendant (or defendants) for harm by the same products. A small number of cases are handpicked as test cases to be representative of all the large pool of plaintiffs. The goal of such trials is to help foresee what the future litigation of all cases might look like.

This case has gotten so far because it's built on an argument that tries to sidestep Section 230. The plaintiffs' focus is not the liability of the content, but the alleged business decisions that shape these platforms. If the legal argument in this trial proves successful, experts believe it could force social media companies to prioritize safety in a way they have not to this point.

“This is going to be the first time a jury is going to hear arguments about what the social media companies knew about the risks of the design of their platforms and how they acted on the types of information they had,” says Haley Hinkle, policy counsel at Fairplay, an organization that works to protect kids from Big Tech. The jury will ultimately decide, she says, whether the companies were negligent, if they contributed to mental health harms, and if they should have warned young users about the risks.

Google and Meta both deny the allegations in the complaint. “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” said Google spokesperson José Castañeda in a statement. “In collaboration with youth, mental health, and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls.”

“For over a decade, we've listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most,” said Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway in a statement. “We use these insights to make meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens' experiences.”

K.G.M started watching YouTube at the age of six, had an Instagram account when she was 11, got on Snapchat at 13, and TikTok one year after—with each app allegedly furthering “her spiral into anxiety and depression, fueled by low self-esteem and body dysmorphia,” according to her attorney Joseph VanZandt. She, along with her mother Karen Glenn, filed a lawsuit against Meta, Google's YouTube, Snap, and TikTok alleging that features such as “autoplay” and “infinite scroll” contributed to her social media addiction, and that social media use contributed to her anxiety and depression, making her feel more insecure about herself. (Snap and TikTok settled the case with KGM before the trial. Terms were not disclosed.)

Glenn testified last year that she did not realize the harm these platforms could do to her daughter, and that she wouldn't have given her a phone if she'd known about these harms previously. Bergman says K.G.M's lawsuit has been chosen as the “bellwether” case because she is “representative of so many other young women who have suffered serious mental health harms and emotional ailments and disturbances as a consequence of social media.”

“The goal of the attorneys bringing these cases is not just to prevail and receive compensation for their individual clients,” says Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University School of Law. “They aim to get a series of victories in this sampling of so-called ‘bellwether trials.' Then they will try to pressure the companies into a mass settlement in which they pay out potentially billions of dollars and also agree to change their practices.”

K.G.M's is the first of 22 such bellwether trials to be held in the superior court of Los Angeles, although that number could change. A positive outcome in the favor of the plaintiff could give the remaining roughly 1,600 litigants significant leverage—and potentially force tech companies to embrace new safeguards. The trial also promises to raise broader awareness about social media business models and practices. “If the public has a very negative reaction to what emerges, or what a jury finds, then this could affect legislation at the state or federal level,” Zipursky adds.

Bergman, who spent 25 years representing asbestos victims, says this trial feels like a repeat of what happened in the past. “When Frances Haugen testified in front of Congress and for the first time revealed what social media companies know their platforms are doing to get vulnerable young people, I realized that this was asbestos all over again” says Bergman.

Seeking to draw parallels from product liability cases against Big Tobacco and the automotive industry, the principal argument that the plaintiffs are alleging is that major tech companies designed their social media platforms in a negligent manner, meaning they did not take reasonable steps to avoid causing harm. “Specifically, the plaintiffs are arguing that design features such as infinite scroll and autoplay caused certain injuries to minors, including disordered eating, self-harm, and suicide,” says Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University.

On the other side, the tech companies will likely focus on causation and free speech defenses. “The defendants will argue that it was third-party content that caused the plaintiffs' injuries, not the access to this content that was provided by the platforms,” says Franks. The companies may also likely argue, she says, “that to the extent the companies' decision-making about content moderation is implicated, that decision-making is protected by the First Amendment,” citing the US Supreme Court's 2024 ruling in Moody v. Netchoice.

One of the major arguments between the two parties will likely be over the term “social media addiction” itself, says Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University. “There is no medical or psychological definition of social media addiction that has been widely recognized, and there's no legal standard that recognizes the addiction,” says Goldman. “And so the parties are going to fight fiercely over whether or not there is even a thing called social media addiction.”

He further claims that even if there is a thing called social media addiction, in this case the users were “addicted to talking to each other online” and by content not created by the platform itself—which is why he believes that “Section 230 casts a very long shadow.” “The claim the plaintiffs have tried to structure claims they were suing based on the social media services design choices,” he says. “But those design choices were designing how to gather, organize, and disseminate third-party content, and that's why Section 230 may very well be in play.”

Bergman, however, argues that Section 230 is outdated and doesn't cover the complexities of today's online world. “Section 230 was enacted when Netscape was the largest browser, Google didn't exist, and Mark Zuckerberg was in junior high school,” says Bergman. “So it has unfortunately given rise to this sense of impunity within the social media industry, which is the only way one can understand how they ever would have designed such dangerous platforms knowingly.”

Experts say that while there isn't clear evidence that social media is a causal factor in mental health problems, that doesn't mean the platforms don't need reform. “The actual scientific literature from the mental health world is quite nuanced and complicated, and doesn't necessarily say that, on average, there is an addictive quality or that it's causing mental health conditions,” says Jessica Schleider, founding director of the Lab for Scalable Mental Health at Northwestern University. “But that doesn't discount the experiences of the individuals in this case.”

For Lori Schott, the fact that there is a trial feels like a victory already. “This is our day in court,” she said. “This is the court of public opinion—there's a judge in there who has been guiding this case along; we have attorneys that have become our life to fight this. We have already won.”

Waymo, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops self-driving vehicle tech, has picked up speed. The company now operates robotaxis in six cities and has announced plans to launch in a dozen others this year. It just raised $16 billion in a new round of funding and says it has served over 20 million rides since the company launched its service in 2020, 14 million of them in 2025 alone.

But Waymo's mostly smooth operations have hit a rough patch in Washington, DC, where the company first began testing in 2024. Despite frequent District sightings of the now-familiar white, electric Jaguars, and despite spending tens of thousands of dollars in payments to at least four outside lobbying firms last year, according to filings, the company's robotaxis are stuck in regulatory limbo. It has no firm debut date in the city, though DC is still listed on its website as launching in 2026. Waymo declined to comment.

The legal logjam is a highly visible test for a company—and industry—that's hoping to expand quickly across the US and, to some extent, the world. (Waymo has said it's launching in London this year and in Japan at some point in the future.) For years, autonomous-vehicle companies have argued, unsuccessfully, that Congress should pass federal regulations governing testing and operations nationwide.

Absent a national law, companies have worked in at least 22 statehouses to pass legislation allowing AVs to operate on public roads in various cities and localities. Now the national debate on driverless tech is again picking up steam. This week, the US Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the future of self-driving tech, where lawmakers stressed the importance of road safety and the need to develop tech ahead of China. A DC service could put the tech front in mind for some of the country's most influential people.

But local DC leaders have questions about autonomous vehicles: how they might function in the District and whether they'll further trouble a local economy already roiled by mass firings across the federal government.

“Do I believe autonomous vehicles are going to be on the roads in DC? I do,” says Councilmember Charles Allen, who chairs the DC City Council's Committee on Transportation and Environment. “It's not an ‘if,' it's a ‘when.'”

Allen says he's still wondering what dilemma the remedy will solve in the city, which he says does not have a problem with ride-hail drivers driving dangerously. “I don't think cities are defining very well, ‘What's the problem we're trying to solve for?' As a policymaker, what tends to happen in that situation is, you're just trying to chase the shiny ball.” Allen says he worries about the long-term effects of AVs on ride-hail drivers, who are able to pick up shifts when they want.

Granted, Waymo took a risk when it announced in April 2024 that it would come to DC, because the city didn't have regulations governing, or even allowing, fully driverless cars to operate there. This was a departure for the company, which started testing its tech in cities in California, Texas, and Florida that already had some autonomous-vehicle rules in place. The Washington, DC, city council passed a law allowing AV companies to test, with a human safety driver, in the District in 2020. Four companies, including Waymo and Amazon-owned Zoox, have said they're testing there. But the issue hasn't seen serious legislative movement since.

As a practical matter, Allen says the city council is waiting to pass legislation because it's anticipating a now months-delayed report from the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) on the safety of autonomous vehicle tech and what rules would need to be changed in the city to allow deployments to go forward. The report was due last fall but has been delayed, the agency said, because of budget cuts. Allen says DDOT has now promised it in the spring. DDOT didn't respond to WIRED's questions.

The councilmember also says that DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, is choosing not to issue companies additional permits to test in the city. “The mayor does not seem to embrace autonomous vehicles,” he says. The mayor's office did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. This year's mayoral election will see a new leader take the helm of the city, after Bowser said in November that she would not run for a fourth term.

Allen describes a trip he took last year in a Waymo as “very pleasant,” though he noted that the vehicle got confused in a “difficult intersection,” leading to the legally mandated safety driver taking control of the car. He says a December incident, when a power outage in San Francisco led to several Waymos to freeze in traffic, raises more questions about how cities might oversee the tech and ensure safety.

(After the San Francisco outage, Waymo said, “We are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.”)

Waymo's state-by-state autonomous vehicle effort continues. This week, the company said it would return to Boston, even though Massachusetts still doesn't allow driverless tech on public roads without a human operator behind the wheel. Waymo started mapping the city last month—a crucial first step to testing—but left a month later, once data collection concluded. In the fall, Boston City Council pushed back against driverless operations, proposing an ordinance that would have prevented the vehicles from going driverless until lawmakers could study their effects on jobs, traffic, and safety.

Now, Waymo is asking Massachusetts' state lawmakers for help. “Before offering fully autonomous rides to Bostonians, we'll first need the state to legalize fully autonomous vehicles,” the company wrote in a press release. “We're looking forward to engaging with officials to inform that path.”

The Artemis program's first crewed trip to the moon may be slightly delayed, but the crew is still deep in prep mode. While most of the attention at NASA is focused on prelaunch preparations of the Orion spacecraft and its SLS rocket, the four astronauts face a markedly different protocol. As they live and work among people, they can't physically touch anyone nor can they go outside. A simple stomachache or a cold could severely delay the first human trip to the moon's vicinity in more than 50 years.

In the 1970s, the Apollo missions instituted a mandatory quarantine for those traveling to the moon. Today, NASA calls that initiative the Health Stabilization Program, which requires 14 days of isolation before a launch. During this period, the crew avoids public places, wears special masks and, although they can see loved ones, they must keep their distance or run the risk of getting sick and contaminating Orion's sterile environment.

According to a statement released by NASA, the Artemis II crew is already in quarantine at a facility in Houston. The launch window for their spacecraft had been no earlier than February 8, 2026, but the agency is now targeting March 6 to 11.

The round trip will take at least 10 days. On the Orion, there are workspaces, sleeping quarters, and a toilet, all within an area comparable to the interior of two minivans. Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch of NASA, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency must inhabit this cramped enclosure in good health, and as they orbit the side of the moon that never faces Earth, they will lose communication with NASA for a few hours. Once in space, they aren't able to take time off due to illnesses that reduce performance or cannot be treated onboard.

The agency has already faced challenges due to health issues. A few weeks ago, it had to abort a mission to the International Space Station for the first time due to a medical emergency. Although the nature of that condition was not disclosed, NASA confirmed the station did not have the necessary instruments to treat it.

Before the first lunar landing, scientists were not certain the lunar surface was sterile. Though there was no evidence the Moon harbored microscopic life, there was the possibility, however slim, that the crew might encounter a pathogen for which their immune system was unprepared. NASA also feared some microbe might attach itself to the space suits or the spacecraft itself, travel back to Earth and cause an epidemic.

When Neil Armstrong's crew returned from Apollo 11, NASA immediately placed them in a quarantine unit, where they stayed for 21 days while medical personnel kept close watch for abnormal symptoms. The agency maintained this post-lunar quarantine protocol until Apollo 14, when it had gathered enough evidence to rule out biohazards from the Moon.

Recent studies recommend avoiding cross contamination in the other direction. Because the Artemis program aims to explore the Moon's south pole craters, regions where sunlight never reaches and usable ice might exist, NASA must now protect the Moon from our terrestrial microbes.

In these zones, which function as natural freezers, microorganisms from Earth could survive for decades. It's unlikely they would propagate, but they could contaminate places that hold information about the origin of the Moon and the early days of the solar system. Even the slightest contamination could be mistaken for signs of extraterrestrial life.

Rebekah Stewart, a nurse at the US Public Health Service, got a call last April that brought her to tears. She had been selected for deployment to the Trump administration's new immigration detention operation at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. This posting combined Donald Trump's longtime passion to use the offshore base to move “some bad dudes” out of the United States with a promise made shortly after his inauguration to hold thousands of noncitizens there. The naval base is known for the torture and inhumane treatment of men suspected of terrorism in the wake of 9/11.

“Deployments are typically not something you can say no to,” Stewart said. She pleaded with the coordinating office, which found another nurse to go in her place.

Other public health officers, who worked at Guantánamo in the past year, described conditions there for the detainees, some of whom first learned they were in Cuba from the nurses and doctors sent to care for them. They treated immigrants detained in a dark prison called Camp 6, where no sunlight filters in, said the officers who have been granted anonymity because they fear retaliation for speaking publicly. It previously held people with suspected ties to Al Qaeda. The officers said they were not briefed ahead of time on the details of their potential duties at the base.

Although the Public Health Service is not a branch of the US military, its uniformed officers—roughly 5,000 doctors, nurses, and other health workers—act like stethoscope-wearing soldiers in emergencies. The government deploys them during hurricanes, wildfires, mass shootings, and measles outbreaks. In the interim, they fill gaps at an alphabet soup of government agencies.

The Trump administration's mass arrests to curb immigration have created a new type of health emergency as the number of people detained reaches record highs. About 71,000 immigrants are currently imprisoned, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, which shows that most have no criminal record.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said: “President Donald Trump has been very clear: Guantánamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst.” However, several news organizations have reported that many of the men shipped to the base had no criminal convictions. As many as 90 percent of them were described as “low-risk” in a May progress report from a chaplain observing the detainees.

In fits and starts, the Trump administration has sent about 780 noncitizens to Guantánamo Bay, according to The New York Times. Numbers fluctuate as new detainees arrive and others are returned to the U.S. or deported.

While some Public Health Service officers have provided medical care to detained immigrants in the past, this is the first time in American history that Guantánamo has been used to house immigrants who had been living in the US. Officers said ICE postings are getting more common. After dodging Guantánamo, Stewart was instructed to report to an ICE detention center in Texas.

“Public health officers are being asked to facilitate a man-made humanitarian crisis,” she said.

Seeing no option to refuse deployments that she found objectionable, Stewart resigned after a decade of service. She would give up the prospect of a pension offered after 20 years.

“It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” she said. “It was my dream job.”

One of her PHS colleagues, nurse Dena Bushman, grappled with a similar moral dilemma when she got a notice to report to Guantánamo a few weeks after the shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August. Bushman, who was posted with the CDC, got a medical waiver delaying her deployment on account of stress and grief. She considered resigning, then did.

“This may sound extreme,” Bushman said. “But when I was making this decision, I couldn't help but think about how the people who fed those imprisoned in concentration camps were still part of the Nazi regime.”

US Public Health Service members assigned to Joint Task Force Southern Guard listen to a briefing prior to a medical evacuation training at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay.

Others have resigned, but many officers remain. Despite feeling alarmed by Trump's tactics, detained people need care, said multiple PHS officers.

“We do the best we can to provide care to people in this shit show,” said a PHS nurse who worked in detention facilities last year.

“I respect people and treat them like humans,” she said. “I try to be a light in the darkness, the one person that makes someone smile in this horrible mess.”

The PHS officers conceded that their power to protect people was limited in a detention system fraught with overcrowding, disorganization, and the psychological trauma of uncertainty, family separations, and sleep deprivation.

“Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, in an emailed statement to KFF Health News.

Admiral Brian Christine, assistant secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Public Health Service, said in an email: “Our duty is clear: say ‘Yes Sir!', salute smartly, and execute the mission: show up, provide humane care, and protect health.” As WIRED and others have reported, Christine is a recent appointee who, until recently, was a urologist specializing in testosterone and male fertility issues.

“In pursuit of subjective morality or public displays of virtue,” he added, “we risk abandoning the very individuals we pledged to serve.”

In the months before Stewart resigned, she reflected on her previous deployments, during Trump's first term, to immigration processing centers run by Customs and Border Protection. Fifty women were held in a single concrete cell in Texas, she recalled.

“The most impactful thing I could do was to convince the guards to allow the women, who had been in there for a week, to shower,” she said. “I witnessed suffering without having much ability to address it.”

Stewart spoke with Bushman and other PHS officers who were embedded at the CDC last year. They assisted with the agency's response to ongoing measles outbreaks, with sexually transmitted infection research, and more. Their roles became crucial last year as the Trump administration laid off droves of CDC staffers.

Stewart, Bushman, and a few other PHS officers at the CDC said they met with middle managers to ask for details about the deployments: If they went to Guantánamo and ICE facilities, how much power would they have to provide what they considered medically necessary care? If they saw anything unethical, how could they report it? Would it be investigated? Would they be protected from reprisal?

Stewart and Bushman said they were given a PHS office phone number they could call if they had a complaint while on assignment. Otherwise, they said, their questions went unanswered. They resigned before reporting to Guantánamo. But PHS officers who were deployed to the base said that they weren't given details about their potential duties—or the standard operating procedure for medical care—before they arrived.

US service members stand by to transport a simulated detainee patient during a medical evacuation training.

Stephen Xenakis, a retired Army general and psychiatrist who has advised on medical care at Guantánamo for two decades said that was troubling. Before health workers deploy, he said, they should understand what they'll be expected to do.

The consequences of going in blind can be severe. In 2014, the Navy threatened court martial against one of its nurses at Guantánamo who refused to force-feed prisoners on hunger strike, who were protesting inhumane treatment and indefinite detention. The protocol was brutal: A person was shackled to a five-point restraint chair as nurses shoved a tube for liquid food into their stomach through their nostrils.

“He wasn't given clear guidance in advance on how these procedures would be conducted at Guantánamo,” Xenakis said of the nurse. “Until he saw it, he didn't understand how painful it was for detainees.”

The American Nurses Association and the Physicians for Human Rights sided with the nurse, calling the procedure a violation the ethical standards of medical professionals. After a year, the military dropped the charges.

A uniformed doctor's or nurse's power tends to depend on their rank, their supervisor, and chains of command, Xenakis said. He helped put an end to some inhumane practices at Guantánamo more than a decade ago, when he and other retired generals and admirals publicly objected to a technique called ""walling,"" in which interrogators slammed the heads of detainees suspected of terrorism against a wall, causing slight concussions. Xenakis argued that science didn't support walling as an effective means of interrogation and that it was unethical, amounting to torture.

Torture hasn't been reported from Guantánamo's immigration operation, but ICE shift reports obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the government watchdog group American Oversight note concerns about detainees resorting to hunger strikes and self-harm.

“Welfare checks with potential hunger strike IA's,” short for illegal aliens, says an April 30 note from a contractor working with ICE. “In case of a hunger strike or other emergencies,” the report adds, PHS and ICE are “coordinating policies and procedures.”

“De-escalation of potential pod wide hunger strike/potential riot,” says an entry from last July. “Speak with alien on suicide watch regarding well being.”

Inmates and investigations have reported delayed medical care at immigration detention facilities and dangerous conditions, including overcrowding and a lack of sanitation. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the deadliest year in two decades.

“They are arresting and detaining more people than their facilities can support,” said one PHS officer. The most prevalent problem the officer saw among imprisoned immigrants was psychological. They worried about never seeing their families again or being sent back to a country where they feared they'd be killed. “People are scared out of their minds,” the officer said.

US Navy Lieutenant Commander Chad R. Scott, Joint Task Force Southern Guard medical planner, discusses execution plans with Lieutenant Commander Bobby Kimbro prior to a medical evacuation training.

The PHS officers who were at Guantánamo said that the men they saw were detained in either low-security barracks, with a handful of people per room, or in Camp 6, a dark, high-security facility without natural light. The ICE shift reports describe the two stations by their position on the island, Leeward for the barracks and Windward for Camp 6. About 50 Cuban men sent to Guantánamo in December and and January have languished at Camp 6, according to The New York Times.

A Navy hospital on the base mainly serves the military and other residents who aren't locked up—and in any case, its capabilities are limited, the officers said. To reduce the chance of expensive medical evacuations back to the US to see specialists quickly, they said the immigrants were screened before being shipped to Guantánamo. People over age 60 or who needed daily drugs to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, for example, had generally been excluded. Still, the officers said, some detainees have had to be evacuated back to Florida.

PHS nurses and doctors said they screened immigrants again when they arrived and provided ongoing care, fielding complaints about gastrointestinal distress and depression. One observer's report says, “The USPHS psychologist started an exercise group” for detainees.

Doctors' requests for lab work were often turned down because of logistical hurdles, partly due to the number of agencies working together on the base, the officers said. Even a routine test, a complete blood cell count, took weeks to process versus hours in the US.

DHS and the Department of Defense, which have coordinated on the Guantánamo immigration operation, did not respond to requests for comment about their work there.

One PHS officer who helped medically screen new arrivals said the detainees were often surprised to learn they were at Guantánamo.

“I'd tell them, I'm sorry you are here,” the officer said. “No one freaked out. It was like the 10-millionth time they had been transferred.” Some of the men had been detained in various facilities for five or six months and said they wanted to return to their home countries, according to the officer. Health workers had neither an answer nor a fix.

Unlike ICE detention facilities in the US, Guantánamo hasn't been overcrowded. “I have never been so not busy at work,” one officer said. A military base on a tropical island, Guantánamo offers activities like snorkeling, paddleboard yoga, and kickboxing to those who aren't imprisoned. Even so, the officer said they would rather be home than on this assignment on the taxpayer's dime.

Transporting staff and supplies to the island and maintaining them on base is enormously expensive. The government paid an estimated $16,540 per day per detainee at Guantánamo to hold those accused of terrorism, according to a 2025 Washington Post analysis of DOD data. The average cost to detain immigrants in ICE facilities in the US is $157 per day.

Even so, the funding has skyrocketed: Congress granted ICE a record $78 billion for fiscal year 2026, a staggering increase from $9.9 billion in 2024 and $6.5 billion nearly a decade ago. Last year, the Trump administration also diverted more than $2 billion from the national defense budget to immigration detention, according to a report from congressional Democrats. About $60 million of it went to Guantánamo.

“Detaining noncitizens at Guantánamo is far more costly and logistically burdensome than holding them in ICE detention facilities within the United States,” wrote Deborah Fleischaker, a former assistant director at ICE, in a declaration submitted as part of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union early last year. In December, a federal judge rejected the Trump administration's request to dismiss a separate ACLU case, questioning the legality of detaining immigrants outside of the country.

Anne Schuchat, who served with the PHS for 30 years before retiring in 2018, said PHS deployments to detention centers may cost the nation in terms of security, too. “A key concern has always been to have enough of these officers available for public health emergencies,” she said. (Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said the immigration deployments don't affect the Public Health Service's potential response to other emergencies.)

In the past, PHS officers have stood up medical shelters during hurricanes in Louisiana and Texas, rolled out Covid testing in the earliest months of the pandemic, and provided crisis support after the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the Boston Marathon bombing.

“It's important for the public to be aware of how many government resources are being used so that the current administration can carry out this one agenda,” said Stewart, one of the nurses who resigned. “This one thing that's probably turning us into the types of countries we have fought wars against.”

Leah Feiger: Hey, Brian, how's it going?

Brian Barrett: Leah, it's great. We missed you last week.

Leah Feiger: I missed you guys, but hopefully you've had a lot of time without me to catch up on all cultural things happening in the United States of America right now. The Melania documentary. Have you seen it?

Brian Barrett: No. I have not seen it. I had a hard time getting a ticket.

Leah Feiger: Oh, no.

Brian Barrett: No. That's not true. That's not true. So no Melania. I'm excited for the Olympics coming up.

Leah Feiger: Yeah. That's going to actually be way better. I think it's ice skating for me or bust.

Brian Barrett: I'm going to try to convince you and Zoë to let me do a whole episode on the biathlon.

Leah Feiger: I'm in. Wait, the biathlon. No, I'm not in.

Brian Barrett: No. Get in, Leah, all the more reason to do the episode.

Leah Feiger: I want to do an episode on the Olympics, period. That's actually very interesting to me. Again, my section will be ice skating. I'm really sad to tell everyone that Zoë is not here with us this week, but she did leave a treat for WIRED.com in the form of her review of the Melania documentary, and more specifically, all of the people that went to go see it. So everyone check it out, and don't miss Zoë too much. But should we get started? Should we get into this?

Brian Barrett: Yeah. In the meantime, welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm Brian Barrett, executive editor.

Leah Feiger: And I'm Leah Feiger, senior politics editor. Brian, let's start off with the gift that keeps on giving for better, for worse, the Epstein files.

Brian Barrett: Oh, what a way to phrase that.

Leah Feiger: Is that not how we should talk about this?

Brian Barrett: I don't know.

Leah Feiger: This week, just to catch everyone up, there was a document dump of over 3 million files pertaining to everything Jeffrey Epstein, and it contains some really disturbing allegations, including torture and murder, really, really disturbing pictures and videos in the documents, so many emails, references to Trump, all sorts of things. I'm really excited to talk about this with you, honestly, because you wrote a story for WIRED all about the tech folks that got implicated in this most recent drop.

Brian Barrett: I did. I spent way too much time reading way too many of these Epstein files just to look and see what was in there about specifically the tech billionaires. If you were to try to do all the people in tech that were in there, it would take you weeks or months. Truly, it's astonishing. But even with just billionaires, we've still got thousands of files referencing maybe about 10 or so that we found, and we sorted them, we broke it down by how many files each person was referenced in.

Leah Feiger: You found 2,500 files alone associated with Bill Gates.

Brian Barrett: Yes.

Leah Feiger: What?

Brian Barrett: Yes. A couple of caveats just real quick about all of these things, when we talk about all these people, those files represent some duplicates. They represent if Jeffrey Epstein was talking about somebody to someone else that'll show up. So it's not an exact figure. On the other hand, it's also only when their full names are mentioned. We know that Epstein referred to Bill Gates as BG in a lot of emails. So I think a couple of things stand out to me here, Leah.

Leah Feiger: Yeah, hit me.

Brian Barrett: One. Yes, there's a lot of Bill Gates. Gates has been on the record as saying he regrets his associate with Epstein. It's been widely reported for years, even before the first Epstein files release, that Gates was in there. Still more interesting stuff in there about that, but it more reaffirms what we know. What I was interested in more were some things that seemed relatively new. The tech billionaire who's in there the third most by our measurement was Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel, who I think there had been some reports that they had met maybe once or twice, but no, Peter Thiel is in over 2,000 Epstein files.

Leah Feiger: He received political advice from Epstein. Epstein said that he wished he'd helped Peter Thiel with the Gawker suit.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. I think as much as anyone else in there, Thiel seemed interested in taking a meeting, having lunch. At one point they go to Signal, which is where encrypted chats happen. At one point, Peter Thiel's assistant sent over Thiel's dietary restrictions list, which is quite expansive.

Leah Feiger: It's an incredible, incredible list. We have another article on WIRED.com. Everyone go check that one out. I think the thing that gets me in so many ways, when I was looking through your story and all of the other excellent reporting on this drop, these are still people that have such an impact on our day-to-day life and day-to-day political life in the US and day-to-day tech life. Peter Thiel, cofounder of Palantir and eyes straight into Vice President Vance's office for all that we've been told. This is someone who decided that it was clearly and not just OK, but beneficial to be having these associations. And again, we don't know exactly what he knew or what all of these people knew at the time, but reading in between the lines, it's a real ... I guess what I'm saying is this isn't an issue of just 2016, this is an issue of right now.

Brian Barrett: Well, and Leah, I'll actually disagree with you there. We do know what they knew to a certain extent in the sense that Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to sex crimes involving a minor in 2008.

Leah Feiger: You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right.

Brian Barrett: And the vast majorities of these conversations take place after that.

Leah Feiger: Wild.

Brian Barrett: I'll say too, a lot of the times, to your point, the defense comes up a lot. ElonMusk did this right? Where he's like, oh, it's taken out of context or, oh, I nevervisited the island.

Leah Feiger: We got to talk about Elon Musk. His—

Brian Barrett: We have to. In terms of out of context and never visiting the island, well, on November 25, 2012, Elon Musk wrote to Jeffrey Epstein: “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”

Leah Feiger: He's begging to attend. There's no other way to interpret this.

Brian Barrett: He really wants to go.

Leah Feiger: There's no other way to interpret this. And also specifically that language. “The wildest party.” Not even just like, “Oh, when is ... The wildest party?” There's so many different parts of this. That gag reflex. Absolutely.

Brian Barrett: So the fact that the calendars didn't line up, sure, that gives you some plausible deniability, but if they had, you would've been right there. So it is really disappointing. I do want to say, not to defend anybody, but a lot of the names in there are circumstantial in a way, and I think the bigger point is that Jeffrey Epstein really wanted to be close to these people. He happened to be at a dinner party with Jeff Bezos, no indication that they ever talked, no indication, whatever. But still, Jeff Bezos winds up in the Epstein files hundreds of times just because Epstein was reading articles about him or at the same place that he was, so it is—

Leah Feiger: Talking about him. Yeah. Absolutely.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. It's just this web. It fills out this web.

Leah Feiger: Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, these are the tech titans.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. Up until as recently as 2019, I think some of these people were actively in touch.

Leah Feiger: Wow. So speaking of Elon, he was also in the news this week for an entirely different thing, aka rolling xAI into SpaceX, officially creating the world's most valuable private company. We've got to talk about that.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. And I know that you love ... This combines your two favorite things.

Leah Feiger: Oh, yes. Absolutely.

Brian Barrett: AI and Elon Musk.

Leah Feiger: Uh-huh.

Brian Barrett: Leah, could I also interest you in a potential third favorite thing?

Leah Feiger: Oh, hit me, Brian.

Brian Barrett: Can I interest you in data centers in space?

Leah Feiger: So that's what he's promising, right?

Brian Barrett: Yeah.

Leah Feiger: I'm actually very interested in data centers.

Brian Barrett: Oh, good.

Leah Feiger: Molly Taft, our wonderful climate reporter on the science desk, has entirely turned me around on how important it is to engage with them. I hate them, but I am very interested in them. So he wants to build a data center in space. What does that mean? What is a terrestrial solution? Please explain all of these things.

Brian Barrett: Well, basically, yeah. So Elon Musk's pitch for combining SpaceX and xAI. And just to back up a second, SpaceX is Elon Musk's most mainstream, noncontroversial company, probably.

Leah Feiger: It's his rocket company.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. It's his rocket company. They basically have privatized NASA, partly because NASA gave up. Anyway ...

Leah Feiger: No.

Brian Barrett: The US space future really depends on SpaceX in so many ways.

Leah Feiger: If Jeff Bezos is listening to this podcast, he's having just a true—

Brian Barrett: Sorry, Blue Origin. Yeah. Oh, gosh.

Leah Feiger: Internal.

Brian Barrett: Terrible day. Blue Origin also there. So on the one hand, you've got this sort of future of US space travel, and on the other side you've got xAI, which is Elon Musk's AI company that keeps undressing women nonconsensually.

Leah Feiger: And is also X, formerly known as Twitter.

Brian Barrett: Yes. And now they're all going to be the same thing.

Leah Feiger: Former Twitter employees, did they make a lot of money from this? What's happening? How are all of these companies now the same thing? None of this has relations to each other other than Elon Musk.

Brian Barrett: So he would argue differently. And so the case that he would make is that in order for AI to get where it needs to be, wherever that is—faster undressing of more women—for it to get there, there's literally not enough energy on Earth to make that happen. So what you need to do is you need to go out in space and harness the energy of the sun to power AI. And who is really good at going out into space and harnessing things? SpaceX.

Leah Feiger: Oh God.

Brian Barrett: So we need to put SpaceX in service of xAI to make sure that we can harness the power of the sun, or as Elon Musk said, scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars.

Leah Feiger: I'm getting this from your tone of voice, and we haven't had this legally approved or anything, but can we just call bullshit? It was also suggested that Tesla could merge with xAI and SpaceX. Tesla recently invested $2 billion in xAI. At that point this is basically all of Elon Musk's companies. You can talk about as sentient sun as much as you want, whatever that may entail. But this is just him combining all of his stuff together in one big pile and saying, I deserve as much money as possible from this. No?

Brian Barrett: Yeah. There are parts that you can call if not bullshit you can raise your eyebrow really, really high on, and parts you can say, well, maybe this is Elon Musk's unified theory of the future. I was surprised by this. I have been deeply skeptical of data centers in space. As much as I like to say it, I think it actually is where we're going. I think that is a thing that is going to happen at some point, and SpaceX is in a really good position to do it. I do think, to your point though about all that intermingling: Look, SpaceX is a company that's really, really important to the US government because of that NASA thing. And so suddenly tying its fortunes into this pretty controversial AI company, suddenly making its mission to be more about powering that AI than getting to Mars or wherever, that's going to invite some regulatory concern. I think the US is going to take a closer look at this than they have taken a look at other Elon Musk projects because look, SpaceX has twentysomething billion in government contracts.

Leah Feiger: I don't know. I like to think that the US government would be taking a closer look at this. I think as we know in so much WIRED reporting and other reportings out there, the regulatory bodies that are able to look at things like this have been slashed and dismantled, and a lot of yes, men put in charge. So I'm very curious about where these regulatory conversations and reviews go.

Brian Barrett: And I'm curious too. SpaceX wants to IPO this year. Tesla stock is doing pretty well. But I think increasingly Elon Musk is betting it all on sci-fi, right? It's true.

Leah Feiger: Yeah. You're absolutely right.

Brian Barrett: Tesla is no longer a car company. He has made it very clear. Tesla is not a car company. Tesla is a company that sells humanoid robots, and we're going to put them in every home. Tesla is a company that is going to have driverless robotaxis in every city. So he's basically saying, look, all my companies right now are in service of what I think is going to happen, could happen, may happen in he would probably say two years. But when he says two years, it usually means five to 10 to never.

Leah Feiger: I'm really waiting for the next commercial. Do you know where your child is? It's 10 pm. Oh, no, don't worry, they're with their humanoid robot and their driverless taxi.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. They're playing Frisbee with optimists.

Leah Feiger: So before we go to break, Brian, just to change this up a little bit, so many things happening in the US this week. We'd be really remiss to not at least briefly talk about a big WIRED scoop that just came out that the politics desk at WIRED got this week all about an online forum where ICE agents log on and complain about their jobs.

Brian Barrett: Leah, this was a fascinating read from Tori Elliott, who spent some time lurking in these forums. And I think what stands out, maybe not surprisingly, but it is a reminder of they have the same workaday complaints that any group of people would have.

Leah Feiger: Oh, absolutely. But it's a little more serious when an ICE agent is telling you that they're super tired and overworked and haven't taken a day off in a while because they're the ones with the gun.

Brian Barrett: Yeah.

Leah Feiger: Reading this was wild because I'm with you because on one hand you're going, OK, yes, we're all humans. We're all dealing with these things, and on the other, you're in charge of this right now, you're in charge of this massive surge. To back up a little bit, this forum of over 5,000 alleged current and former ICE and CBP officers has them venting about long work hours, limited overtime pay, incompetent leadership, poorly trained new recruits. A lot of these claims—I have to add as a fun little side note—a lot of these came in after ICE actually lost their union representation a few years ago because ICE accused the union of being too far left. No comment further required. To add, just as a little backdrop here, the forum doesn't require proof of employment, but it's a really interesting look inside of ICE's workforce, and it has a lot of information and very specific details that really only these people would know. Some of these quotes were wild. What stood out to you?

Brian Barrett: What jumped out to me, the ones that really had that “woe is me” tenor, but also the ones that called the agency to task in a way that you don't see externally, at least. There's one quote, ""led by some of the worst leadership I've ever witnessed from the local level all the way up to the national stage, this agency has managed to turn a righteous mission into a complete clown show."" Now, you might agree with half of that. You might agree with the whole thing. I don't know whether it was ever necessarily righteous, but it is interesting to see how they are working through this. And to be clear, some of these people, when they make those complaints, they do get jumped on. I think there is a pretty active—

Leah Feiger: Oh yeah. Lots of pushback.

Brian Barrett: Yeah. Lots of pushback. Lots of people who are still very committed to the mission, still think it's pretty righteous.

Leah Feiger: Honestly, the people talking about the mission and however these agents may feel about what's happening in Minnesota, what happened in Chicago, what happened in LA, and what appears to be getting ready to happen in different parts of the United States, what was really interesting to me was not even just their focus on their mission, but how they were about to go about it. There was one user who was saying they had just finished the Virtual Deportation Officer Transition Program, which they also said had been shortened, and they'd been transitioned to practicals like firearms training. And they wrote in the chat that the new agent kit had arrived on Friday, this big box full of body armor, gear, Glock, bunch of other stuff. But then they said that the process was wildly chaotic. They still didn't have access to GovTa, which is a system that the government uses to track workers' time and leave. They didn't have access to the electronic official personnel folder, which allows employees to access their own records. So basically, they're not actually getting fully onboarded according to posters on this forum, but they're still being handed a gun. This is wildly chaotic.

Brian Barrett: Extremely. And Leah, did you see anything in their editorial, in her reporting, about the protests you mentioned in Minnesota or the deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. Did they engage with that at all?

Leah Feiger: Yeah. So they did, and a lot of the posts ... The posts have been happening for over a decade now at this point, but posts definitely have been heating up this month. A couple of days before Pretti was killed, a user started a thread ready to resign, had enough stress, and people were commenting on it and going back and forth. And I think that was when the quote that you mentioned came up, “led by some of the worst” people. And they continued on after that. We didn't find things of people going like, oh, this is horrible. This person was killed. It doesn't mean that it wasn't there. These are so many posts. But a lot of people posting are very concerned about ICE's image. They're very concerned by how this is coming across. They're very concerned about the chaos from the big things, noting these deaths, but also even randomly almost seemingly little stuff. This one quote I just can't get enough of, which is “I'm all for removing illegals, but snatching dudes off lawn mowers in Cali and leaving the truck and equipment just sitting there, definitely not working smarter.” It's just such a wild one, because it's someone going like, what is this chaos machine that I'm now part of? Whether or not we agree with any part of the sentiment.

Brian Barrett: What I thought really was interesting too, in telling in the forum ... And maybe this doesn't play out across all of them, but it does say how long someone has been in the forum, which is a little bit of a shorthand for how long they have been in ICE and working with this organization. And you can see how if you have been doing this for a decade and you do think that there is a right way to do this, I think clearly we're in a world where that's not the way it's working anymore. So not to have sympathy for ICE, but it's at least interesting to see who's pushing back, how long they've been there when it's veterans versus people who just got there, which again, it gets back to also it's a workplace in some ways. It's a work environment. It's just one that is also a paramilitary force that is occupying US cities.

Leah Feiger: Right. And honestly, a bird's-eye view is—as interesting as this article is and as juicy and telling as some of these quotes are, to my knowledge at least—there isn't any other reporting out there like this. This snapshot in time of what ice agents are talking about and going through. They're not really talking to that many other people about it. You have a couple of articles here or there. New York Times spoke to three ICE agents about what's going on. No. This is thousands. These are thousands of people talking about their day-to-day concerns with their jobs, with their bosses, with their coworkers, and with their mission. It's a snapshot in time that we're going to just have to keep looking at.

Brian Barrett: And we will. Coming up after the break, we're going all the way to Laos in Southeast Asia to hear how a whistleblower was able to document and escape a crypto scam compound. Stay with us.

Andy Greenberg: I was having a normal Saturday on the roof with my kids. They were playing in a kiddie pool.

Brian Barrett: Last summer my colleague Andy Greenberg was enjoying an idyllic late afternoon in New York—

Andy Greenberg:There had just been a rainstorm and there was a rainbow. It was a very beautiful evening. And I in typical terrible 21st century parenting style was ignoring my kids and looking at my phone and scrolling through messages.

Brian Barrett: —in the middle of mindlessly scrolling between apps.

Andy Greenberg: I've got this email. I found this email from someone with a pseudonym who is messaging me from the encrypted email service Proton Mail.

Brian Barrett: The email is from an unnamed source who claimed to be a computer engineer in Laos.

Andy Greenberg: A computer engineer trapped in a compound in the region of Laos who wanted to be a source, who wanted to be a whistleblower inside this crypto scam compound.

Brian Barrett: As a cybersecurity reporter, crypto scams are Andy's bread and butter. That's what he's constantly tracking down. Trends in hacking and cybercrime. But crypto scam compounds are a beast of their own. These are places where scam operations happen at an industrial scale and crypto scams have become the most profitable form of cybercrime in the world, pulling in 10s of billions of dollars each year. Andy didn't know if this anonymous source was legit, but he followed up and told the source to message him through Signal. Later that evening, Andy received a flurry of messages.

Andy Greenberg: They shared really detailed documents right off the bat, like an actual written report, a summary of everything they had experienced and everything about the way that this scam compound worked, including this very, very detailed flow chart that included some elements that I had never heard of before.

Brian Barrett: These documents describe step-by-step the methods that this crypto compound uses to lure victims into their scams. From creating fake Facebook and Instagram profiles to using hired models and AI deepfake tools, all of it to create the illusion of a romantic prospect, something they call pig butchering.

Andy Greenberg: The idea of pig butchering is that these are crypto romance investment scams.

Brian Barrett: The operation starts with the scammer using social media profiles to convincingly take the identity of say, a wealthy woman.

Andy Greenberg: A wealthy woman getting in touch usually with a lonely, very often older man and enticing them with some sort of intimate relationship.

Brian Barrett: Trust is built through these video calls and constant back and forth messages.

Andy Greenberg: The pig butchering part of this is that the pig is fattened up with this emotional connection, like somebody builds a real relationship with the victim until there's a lot of trust and intimacy.

Brian Barrett: Eventually the scammer gives some financial advice to their mark.

Andy Greenberg: And this wealthy woman says, “By the way, I can help you become wealthy too. It seems like you're having some financial problems and I can just refer you to the same crypto trading platform that I use, and you can easily double your money. It's a very safe bet. I'll walk you through it. In fact, I would be disappointed in you if you didn't try it.” And that process is incredibly effective it turns out. And only after weeks or months of that fattening up romantic process is the pig butchered.

Brian Barrett: If you're wondering how someone could fall for that, you should know that the methods these scammers use take everything into account. Through documents shared by his news source. Andy learned that they use deepfakes to interact with their victims through video calls and AI chatbots to finesse their messages. They also make sure to match the scammers ethnicity with that at their target to avoid any language or cultural barriers. But the thing is, these operations don't just make victims out of their targets. Scam compounds lure workers, meaning the scammers behind the fake Facebook and Instagram accounts from Asian and African countries with legitimate job offers. Once they arrive at the sites, their passports are taken and they're essentially trapped and forced to become scammers.

Andy Greenberg: A human trafficking operation that essentially enslaves people, tricks them into coming to this compound, turns them into forced laborers, traps them there and forces them to scam people for sometimes 15, 16 hour shifts. On one side, it's taking people's entire life savings very often, hundreds of thousands or even over a million dollars from victims in a single scam. But then on the other side, there are hundreds of thousands of enslaved people whose lives have been completely ruined as they're trapped in these compounds.

Brian Barrett: The engineer who reached out to Andy is one of these workers trapped in Laos in a region bordering Myanmar and Thailand, where illicit operations are the norm.

Andy Greenberg: The Golden Triangle, I've always heard about it as this kind of vague region at the intersection of the borders of Laos and Myanmar and Thailand that has been carved out as this special economic zone that is almost in an official sense, not controlled by Laos, but instead controlled by Chinese business interests. It is essentially run by Chinese, both business people and very Chinese organized criminal syndicates. This very small area, just like half the size of Washington, DC, or something, it is now a hub for all sorts of transnational crime and crypto scam compounds may in fact be the biggest and most lucrative form of those.

Brian Barrett: And now it seemed the engineer who contacted Andy was willing to be a whistleblower for one of these compounds.

Andy Greenberg: This was somebody who had been trapped like this and wanted to expose everything he could about the operation.

Brian Barrett: Andy's trying to figure out if this guy is legit when he calls him out of the blue.

Archival audio:

Red Bull: Hello.

Andy Greenberg: Hello.

Red Bull: I'm fine. How are you?

Andy Greenberg: Good. Good. Thank you for being willing to talk.

Andy Greenberg: I picked up the phone and I'm talking to this young, very polite man with an Indian accent.

Archival audio:

Andy Greenberg: What is your name or what can I call you?

Red Bull: You can call me from any name brother. No matter.

Andy Greenberg: Oh, but you tell me just so I know how to talk to you and what name to call you. You can make one up if you like of course.

Red Bull: You can call me Red Bull. OK.

Andy Greenberg: Oh, Red Bull. Red Bull?

Red Bull: Yeah. Yes.

Andy Greenberg: OK. OK.

Andy Greenberg: And I later found out that he was looking at an empty can of a Red Bull energy drink on the table in front of him when he said that. He was so motivated as a source, so driven that I was almost ... I was a little put off. I was wary of this person, and I quickly actually hung up and then called him back on a video call because I wanted to see who I was talking to. And he picked up with no hesitation and showed me his face on the video call. Showed me around the hotel room. He had actually managed to book a hotel room. And I asked him to show me out the window to walk outside the hotel. It was nighttime my time, but it was daytime there and he showed me the front of the hotel, which I could see that it was a Chinese language sign that there were palm trees and that it looked like a poor tropical area where everything was in Chinese, and that certainly sounded like the Golden Triangle to me. So I started to get what felt like confirmation very quickly that he was who he said and that he really was in a scam compound and that he was in the Golden Triangle.

Brian Barrett: I think it's interesting too. I think when you hear about people and about people enslaved in these compounds, you don't really necessarily think that they have that amount of mobility, the ability to go rent out a hotel room, walk around on the street, take video, but it's a little bit of a different setup in terms of what's keeping them there. Is that fair to say?

Andy Greenberg: I was also surprised. I had read reports of these scam slavery compounds where people are held in shackles and beaten every day and electrocuted in some cases, and they're held almost in the jungle in remote places. The Golden Triangle compounds are not like that. In part because the Golden Triangle itself is almost like a mega compound. The victims of these human trafficking operations, even if they walk around outside the building where they work, or even the dormitory where they live, their passport has been taken away. The police have very often been paid off by the compound mafia. They can't really leave regardless. So they have a surprising freedom of movement because the whole place is essentially like a closed circuit.

Brian Barrett: A closed circuit where as the source Red Bull described to Andy, they had a strict work schedule and punitive measures.

Andy Greenberg: They were actually paid, in theory, a salary of like $500 a month or so in Chinese Yuan. But then that money was taken from them almost entirely through fines for every tiny violation that their bosses could think of. They had access to a cafeteria where they were fed, but that food was withheld if they so much as showed up late to work or late to lights out in the dormitory. So there was this illusion of them being there voluntarily being paid a salary. They were even in theory, paid a commission on any scams they pulled off. But Red Bull was entirely broke. He had been scammed into absolute poverty, had no money. So it was a Orwellian thing where the bosses would give people these inspirational speeches as if they were part of some corporate sales force, like part of a car dealership or something. And in fact, they were absolutely forced laborers with no choice about what they were doing and who faced really brutal consequences if they ever broke the rules or tried to escape.

Brian Barrett: It had been less than 24 hours since Red Bull had first made contact, but the details were quickly mounting up. He told Andy that they should involve law enforcement and that he was willing to work with an FBI handler. He specifically wanted to inform them about an upcoming in-person cash transaction that was happening on US soil and was related to one of the compound scams.

Andy Greenberg: They were going to do an in-person pickup of cash with a courier. So Red Bull wanted me to arrange a sting operation to catch this courier and question this guy and he thought that that would be a big win against the scam operation.

Brian Barrett: That's when Andy decided to reach out to Erin West, a former California prosecutor who now runs an anti-scam organization.

Andy Greenberg: Erin thought there was no time to do a sting. She also said that any courier is super far down the hierarchy of a scam operation and it would not be a good idea. Also, she pointed out that that would call attention to the fact that there was a leak in the compound and could put Red Bull's life at risk. But then I asked her, what do you think about putting him in touch with an FBI agent, somebody to be his handler? Can you recommend somebody? And to my surprise, she suggested that I not do that either. She thought that the story I could produce with Red Bull as a source would be more important than anything he could give law enforcement. That in the best case scenario in years, what he provided might lead to the arrest of somebody low down in the org chart of a scam compound or possibly just charges in absentia for somebody who could not possibly be arrested or extradited from Laos from the Golden Triangle. As she put it, the cavalry is not coming. Nobody from Interpol or the FBI is going to march into this scam compound in the Golden Triangle and start arresting people.

Brian Barrett: When Red Bull suggested that you organize a sting, which Andy, you are a incredibly gifted reporter, I believe that's not in your skill set necessarily.

Andy Greenberg: Absolutely not.

Brian Barrett: Not. But it was, I think, an indicator of something that we ended up talking about a lot throughout this reporting process, which is that Red Bull was not just willing, but at times very eager to take big chances.

Andy Greenberg: Yeah. Red Bull was just remarkably risk-tolerant. Had so many dangerous ideas about what he wanted to do. He wanted to wear a hidden camera or hidden microphone, a button camera or some sort of watch with a recording device in it. He wanted to install spyware on his boss's computer. He wanted to set up a screen recording software on his work PC so that I could see what he was doing all day long. And I consulted with you about all these things, and then many other experts, and everybody told me one by one, these are not good ideas. This will get Red Bull killed. And I took that very seriously. And we didn't do any of that. I talked him out of all of those ideas. And what we ultimately settled on was a much simpler system that I still think actually turned out to be pretty effective, which was just that he installed a disguised version of Signal on his work PC.

Brian Barrett: A disguised version of Signal. Basically, Red Bull installed the app on his work computer with a different icon, making it look like it was a shortcut to his hard drive.

Andy Greenberg: And then we would talk with disappearing messages set to a very low time period so there was not much of a log if we were ever caught.

Brian Barrett: Andy and Red Bull also took up aliases.

Andy Greenberg: He would pretend that he was talking to his uncle. He would call me uncle from time to time just in case somebody spotted what he was doing.

Brian Barrett: Some of those aliases were a little more embarrassing than others.

Andy Greenberg: Eventually, we upgraded our cover story to me pretending to be his secret girlfriend, and we used a lot of heart emojis, but that was a little too cringey and we just couldn't keep it up.

Brian Barrett: But the golden rule that stuck was how Andy and Red Bull would say hi to each other.

Andy Greenberg: We created a protocol where when we started the conversation, the first person would say, Red, that the second person would say, Bull to make sure that his computer had not been seized.

Brian Barrett: As their communication got into a rhythm, Red Bull filled in a very detailed map of the inner workings of the scam compound operation.

Andy Greenberg: He sent me photos of a whiteboard that showed a leaderboard of who had scammed the most that month. He sent me a spreadsheet that turned out to be a floor plan of the whole dormitory and all the different workers there. He sent me a picture of this big Chinese ceremonial drum that was played for scams of a hundred thousand dollars or more. And then once in a while, he would then tell me to record my screen and turn on video on those calls, and then keep pretending to talk to his uncle as he walked around and videotaped and I recorded outside the compound, into the lobby of the office, sometimes into the cafeteria and once into the actual work floor, the office itself, where I could see the whole layout of the office and even colored flags on different teams desks to connote whether they had met their scam quota of revenue that month.

Brian Barrett: As the weeks passed by, the wall started to close in on Red Bull. His team leader started asking questions about why he wasn't generating enough new so-called clients, and then he threatened him with a beating. At this point, Andy consulted with me and the other editors at WIRED. We decided that the safest thing was to stop the reporting process with Red Bull, at least until we knew he was safe.

Andy Greenberg: I told Red Bull, let's stop. We got to stop. You gave me enough. Thank you. Let's just wait and we'll speak again when you are free and you're home, then we will talk again. But when I said this to him like that, we're done with our reporting process, he immediately in that conversation said, well, then I need to get out of here now. I'm going to find a way to escape.

Brian Barrett: For the full story of what happened to Red Bull and the crypto scam compound he was escaping from you can head to WIRED.com. We promise it's worth your time. Thank you for listening.

Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in the workplace is accelerating faster than most organizations can secure it, leaving employee use increasingly unmonitored and risky.

According to new research from AI-powered data security firm Cyberhaven, nearly 40% of all employee interactions with AI tools now involve sensitive corporate data. As workers bypass official channels to use specialized tools like Claude and DeepSeek, organizations find themselves split between “frontier” adopters and “laggards” who are losing control over their most valuable information assets.

Cyberhaven Labs, the company's in-house research team, released its findings on Thursday based on data lineage tracking how information moves between endpoints, SaaS apps, and AI tools in real time. In many cases, companies prioritize growth and experimentation. Security, governance, and oversight follow.

At the same time, most AI usage today occurs in tools that carry elevated risk. Employees are routinely inputting sensitive data into a vast and growing ecosystem of GenAI tools, coding assistants, and custom-built agents.

For many organizations, AI use is a kind of Wild West, according to the report. Tools proliferate faster than policies, employee usage often outpaces visibility, and sensitive data flows across models, applications, and accounts with limited centralized control.

“It's increasingly difficult to secure the wide use of tools, but what organizations can and should do is ensure their data security solutions include AI usage,” Cyberhaven CEO Nishant Doshi told TechNewsWorld.

A small cohort of frontier organizations aggressively deploys hundreds of tools to nearly 70% of their workforce. Laggards remain stalled at 2% adoption. This divide is creating a vacuum where employees, driven by productivity demands, are bypassing corporate guardrails to build their own Shadow AI ecosystems.

Cyberhaven research reports five primary findings:

The following distribution shows how sharply the number of GenAI tools in use escalates among the most aggressive enterprise adopters.



More than four out of five of the most widely used GenAI SaaS applications are classified as medium, high, or critical risk, according to Cyberhaven.

“Organizations must understand and trace the full lifecycle of data to properly secure it,” Doshi urged.

Frontier organizations are most likely implementing an official corporate strategy that encourages employees to incorporate AI into their day-to-day workflow, Doshi suggested. Such encouragement then leads to a more permissive internal culture toward experimenting with new AI features and technologies, sanctioned or not.

“Laggard companies are primarily held back by a block-first security posture and fragmented legacy data systems that make official integration too risky or complex,” he said.

Also at play is an inherent lack of trust. These organizations lack complete confidence in their employees to use these tools securely or in line with company values.

“This creates a divide where leadership at these organizations views AI as a threat to be managed. Frontier companies view it as a productivity engine that can be securely enabled,” he added.

A surprising shift in the AI power balance shows Chinese open-weight models transitioning from outsiders to enterprise staples almost overnight. Products like DeepSeek are driving a staggering increase in endpoint-based AI use.

This surge follows the January 2025 release of DeepSeek-R1, which proved that China could match — and, in specific tasks like coding, potentially exceed — U.S. frontier models, according to Doshi. For many employees, the lure of superior performance and the ease of bypassing corporate filters outweigh geopolitical caution. These factors create a massive, unmonitored footprint for Chinese silicon within Western networks.

“These models' comparable capabilities, combined with LMArena's tendency to provide open-weight models, have led to 50% of endpoint-based usage,” he confirmed.

As noted above, an alarming 39.7% of interactions involve sensitive data. At least some of that results from employees knowingly uploading proprietary info such as source code. That also leads to unintended sensitivity mishaps when users integrate AI tools into standard workflows such as CRM and R&D.



Employees are feeding AI tools a wide range of sensitive business information, including source code, research, sales, HR, and finance.

“AI is still a relatively new technology, and employees do not fully understand what it means to put sensitive data into an AI system. This means your data no longer remains under corporate control and now resides with an AI vendor,” Doshi said.

Even worse, some of these vendors actually train their models with user-submitted data. For employees, however, he added, it may not be clear what constitutes sensitive data or how AI operates.

“Therefore, a lack of security awareness among employees is a major issue in enterprise AI use. Additionally, that lack of awareness is a reason many organizations are hesitant to encourage AI use, opting for a ‘block first' policy,” he explained.

Sixty percent of Claude and Perplexity usage happens via employees' personal accounts. It contributes to Shadow AI outperforming sanctioned corporate tools in user experience and utility.

Claude and Perplexity are edge cases as they are specialized tools. Users widely adopt Claude as the best coder, and Perplexity is a purpose-built AI search engine.

“I believe that people specifically use Claude and Perplexity for these purposes, respectively, as they provide a better user experience than sanctioned corporate tools,” Doshi offered.

He agreed that Shadow AI is, in general, a growing issue, as AI tools can process sensitive information at machine speed. Derivative copies of an organization's most valuable data can quickly proliferate outside of central control.

“Combating this requires robust data security and data governance,” he said.

The report classified 82% of the top 100 GenAI apps as “risky.” But that does not mean the current enterprise-grade AI market is failing to provide the specific features employees need, according to Doshi.

The chart below breaks down risk levels among the most widely used GenAI SaaS tools.

The high percentage of risky apps results from employees prioritizing frictionless accessibility over official channels. Many of these niche apps offer specialized workflows that require zero prompting expertise, allowing workers to bypass the learning curve.

Take NoteGPT as an example. It provides an AI summarizer, transcriber, PDF converter, and writer out of the box.

“Additionally, many new enterprise tools that promise both security and innovation often lack the capabilities of developer-created and released tools or even more basic GenAI tools such as Claude,” Doshi cautioned.

The shift toward embedded agents and coding tools is ushering in a new era. The standalone AI chatbot, with its ChatGPT-style interface, may already be peaking in favor of invisible, integrated AI.

However, Doshi thinks it is too early to say for sure. Researchers are seeing only AI app adoption plateau, while specialized AI coding agents continue to grow.

“Rather than seeing it as chatbots on the decline, I would argue that some AI tools, like coding agents, have done a great job of applying AI to specialized domains and are thus receiving recognition from their users, leading to growth,” he suggested.

Data show that AI use is most prevalent among engineers. Doshi reasoned that it makes sense for them to turn to coding tools and embedded agents for their specific day-to-day workflows, rather than a marketing employee who may need a GenAI tool for basic, one-off tasks.

According to Doshi, AI usage, sanctioned or otherwise, will continue to rise. The number of AI apps used and the percentage of employees using them will be strong benchmarks for companies that have adopted AI or plan to do so to drive strategic productivity gains.

Some people referred to 2025 as the Year of AI agents. While partially true, he predicts that more enterprises will develop and adopt AI agents in the coming years.

“This is just the beginning, which makes securing and governing these tools all the more vital,” he urged.

Seattle's startup ecosystem has its strengths, and the city is a global AI hub. But for some tech entrepreneurs, the gravity of San Francisco is hard to resist — especially in the middle of an AI boom.

We caught up with early stage startup founders who recently relocated from Seattle to San Francisco — a move that echoes earlier eras when entrepreneurs with local roots ultimately built valuable companies elsewhere. 

This time, founders say the pull is about being inside the “world's AI capital” as a way to supercharge their startups. 

“I knew that moving to SF — where the largest concentration of startups are — would be the best move for maximizing our success,” said Avi Agola, co-founder of recruiting platform Talunt.

Before he arrived at the University of Washington this past fall, Agola immersed himself in Seattle's startup scene as a teenager. He worked out of Seattle founder hub Foundations, launched his own company, and sold it last year to a fellow Seattle startup.

Agola credits Seattle's startup community with helping him develop credibility and understand what it takes to run a company. 

But as he got Talunt off the ground, Agola packed his bags for San Francisco. Part of the decision was practical: Investors encouraged the move, and many of Talunt's early customers are in the Bay Area.

Aviel Ginzburg, a Seattle venture capitalist who runs Foundations, said he understands the strategy.

“I think that anyone in their 20s who wants to build in startups should be living down there right now, simply for building a network to get lucky,” he said. 

That was part of the reason Nour Gajial, CEO of MathGPT, also moved from Seattle to San Francisco.

After dropping out of Cornell to pursue her AI education startup full time, Gajial returned home to the Seattle area. She found a supportive, tight-knit tech community and a comfortable place to build. 

But as MathGPT gained traction, Gajial and her co-founder started making trips to San Francisco. They noticed more startup events, younger founders, and more frequent in-person interactions with people building and funding AI companies.

“There's always some new AI research that's going on, or some event that will open your eyes about something,” Gajial said. “I don't see that energy as much in Seattle.”

Gajial said she's grateful to have met “some really cool founders” in Seattle. MathGPT co-founder Yanni Kouloumbis lauded the region's talent pool. But they felt that being in Silicon Valley gives them better odds at making it big.

“We just want to put ourselves in the best possible situation for these spontaneously good things to happen to us,” Kouloumbis said.

Nistha Mitra spent three years in Seattle, where she worked at Oracle. She later launched Neuramill, an early stage company developing software for manufacturing, and noticed a clear divide between Seattle's corporate tech culture and startup life.

“I don't think my community in the Big Tech world had any awareness of startups and how startups work,” Mitra said.

Mitra moved to San Francisco six months ago. “In SF, everyone knows what's going on, no matter who they are,” she said. 

She described a hard-charging atmosphere where it's normal behavior to work 15-hour days on your startup. Being in that environment “really changes how you perform,” Mitra said. 

When she worked long days in Seattle, friends worried about her. “I feel like in SF, it's kind of normalized, that kind of lifestyle,” she said. 

The same calculus is playing out for more experienced techies.

Vik Korrapati, a Seattle-based founder who spent nearly a decade at AWS, recently announced that his AI startup Moondream is moving from Seattle to San Francisco. He framed the decision around the scale and urgency of the current AI moment.

Artificial intelligence, Korrapati wrote in an online post, is “the biggest platform shift we're going to see in our working lives,” and relocating was about being “in the right place, with the right people” as his company builds high-performance vision models.

Korrapati said the move wasn't driven by a lack of talent in Seattle, but by differences in risk tolerance and default behavior. “The issue isn't ability. It's default settings,” he wrote, describing a culture where many engineers optimize for stability and incremental progress rather than the uncertainty of early-stage startup work. 

In San Francisco, he said, he found more people who had already left Big Tech roles and were willing to make the startup leap. “Seattle has been good to me,” Korrapati said. “I learned how large systems work here. I got the space to spin up Moondream here. I'm not leaving angry.”

Ethan Byrd, a former engineer at AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, helped launch Seattle software startup Actual AI in 2024. Now he's working on a new startup called MyMX — and is strongly considering a move.

Seattle isn't a bad place to build a startup, Byrd said, and he loves the city. But San Francisco is just on a different level when it comes to entrepreneurship. 

“Everything is easier: hiring, talking to customers, raising money, hosting events,” he said. At the end of the day, as he tries to grow his new startup, Byrd said moving to Silicon Valley “just seems unavoidable.”

But not all Seattle founders are headed south. 

“There's a really good pool of talent right now, especially with the layoffs unfortunately happening,” said Ankit Dhawan, CEO of Seattle-based marketing startup BluePill. “We don't feel any need to move out of here.”

Silicon Valley is great for fundraising and making connections. “But there comes a moment when it's too much noise,” said Alejandro Castellano, CEO of Seattle AI startup Caddi. “You just need a place to actually focus on work.”

And when a trip to the Bay Area is needed — some of Caddi's investors are based there — it's a short flight away. “You can come back the same day,” Castellano said. 

Many Silicon Valley investors also make trips up to Seattle. Earlier this week, Sunil Nagaraj, managing partner of Palo Alto-based Ubiquity Ventures, hosted a startup event at Seattle's AI House. During his fireside chat with Auth0 co-founder Eugenio Pace, he called out the various Seattle-based founders in the crowd that he's backed. “Ubiquity Ventures ❤️ Seattle!!” Nagaraj wrote on LinkedIn. 

Yifan Zhang, founder of AI House and managing director at the AI2 Incubator, said she wants to get more out-of-town investors connected to the Seattle region. 

Zhang built her first startup in San Francisco. For certain types of founders, she said, Silicon Valley is a better place to create serendipitous relationships that can lead to a funding round or a large customer. 

“But it's also easy to get lost in the mix, or get distracted by the hype,” Zhang noted. “It really depends on who you are, but no matter where you're based, founders still need to do the hard work of selling and building an incredible product and scaling it.”

Seattle is still drawing in many founders from out of town. Real estate startup RentSpree moved here from Los Angeles last year, attracted to the tech talent base and concentration of other real estate and proptech companies.

“Seattle is really great for talent that balances both an aggressive growth perspective, but also building sustainable companies over time,” RentSpree CEO and co-founder Michael Lucarelli told GeekWire in December.

Vijaye Raji, founder and CEO of Seattle-area startup Statsig (acquired by OpenAI last year for $1.1 billion), has called it a “quiet talent” that may be under-appreciated.

Drone startup Brinc is another transplant that landed from Las Vegas. The company, now ranked No. 7 on the GeekWire 200, raised $75 million last year and employs more than 100 people. CEO Blake Resnick has cited the engineering and tech talent pool in Seattle for his decision to relocate.

The city's technology anchors — including Microsoft, Amazon, the University of Washington, and Silicon Valley engineering centers — also help import workers who go on to launch companies. Overland AI CEO Byron Boots came to the UW's computer science school in 2019 as an associate professor, and later helped launch the Seattle-based autonomous driving startup that just raised $100 million.

Caleb John, an investor and engineer at Seattle startup studio Pioneer Square Labs, previously worked in San Francisco. He noted that founders in Seattle “are not as deep in the rat race” relative to entrepreneurs elsewhere. 

“Your thinking is not as clouded by the hype train,” he said in an interview with Foundations. He also cited a “really strong community of younger people who work in startups” across the Seattle region. “People just don't know there are startup people here,” John said, noting that the startup scene has grown since he arrived in 2021.

Ginzburg said even as some founders move to San Francisco, it's important to keep building community in Seattle. He noted that Agola, for example, still remains tethered to Seattle through the Foundations network.

Agola said he'd consider returning to Seattle at some point as his new startup grows.

“I don't think the Bay is the best for long-term startup growth when it comes to post-series B,” he said. “Moving to Seattle would be the best play to keep the best talent flow while minimizing overhead costs.”

Editor's note: GeekWire publishes guest opinions to foster informed discussion and highlight a diversity of perspectives on issues shaping the tech and startup community. If you're interested in submitting a guest column, email us at [email protected]. Submissions are reviewed by our editorial team for relevance and editorial standards.

Ben Golden recently argued in these pages that the proposed “millionaires tax” is not an existential threat to Washington's startup economy and that critics should “cool it on the millionaires tax hysteria.” I respect Ben and the work he does in our ecosystem. But his piece glosses over critical details that founders, investors, and early startup employees need to understand. And it treats the income tax as if it exists in a vacuum. It doesn't.

The real story isn't one bill. It's the full stack of taxes that Washington is building — layer by layer, session by session — that collectively send a clear message to anyone thinking about starting a company here: don't.

Let me walk through what a Washington startup founder is actually facing right now.

Take those together. There is no stage of a founder's journey that Olympia isn't reaching into. You earn income — taxed. Your startup succeeds and you sell — taxed on gains the feds exempted. You die — taxed at a threshold four times lower than the federal exemption. Three years ago Washington was one of the most founder-friendly states in the country. The legislature is dismantling that in real time.

Ben's piece notes that “many will already benefit tremendously from federal tax advantages like QSBS, which can eliminate up to $10 million in federal capital gains taxes on a successful exit.” That's true — but it cuts against his argument, not for it.

QSBS is a federal exclusion. It does nothing to shield founders from a state income tax or a state capital gains tax. And the bills currently in committee would affirmatively strip the QSBS benefit at the state level. So a founder who did everything right — incorporated as a C corp, held stock for five years, stayed within the qualified trade or business requirements — would still owe Washington 9.9% on gains that are 100% excluded federally. On a $5 million exit, that's up to $495,000 to the state on gains that Congress specifically said should be tax-free.

This isn't a talking point. This is what I advise clients on every day. And I can tell you that the founders who understand the math are already asking about changing domicile before their exits.

Ben's piece doesn't address rate stacking. The Tax Foundation calculated that the proposed income tax, layered on top of the existing WA Cares tax, Seattle's JumpStart payroll tax, and the Seattle Social Housing tax, would yield a combined top marginal rate of over 18% on wage income and RSU vesting in Seattle — the highest in the country. Higher than New York City. Higher than San Francisco.

This matters enormously for the startup ecosystem. Tens of thousands of tech workers in Washington receive restricted stock units as a core part of their compensation. RSU vesting can be lumpy — especially at startups with double-trigger vesting, where years of accumulated stock can vest all at once at an IPO. A startup employee who earned $150,000 a year for five years could suddenly have $2 million in income in a single year when their company goes public, pushing them well over the million-dollar threshold even though their average income was never close to it.

These aren't theoretical millionaires. They're engineers and product managers who took below-market salaries in exchange for equity. They are exactly the people Washington should want to attract and retain. An 18% top rate tells them to vest somewhere else.

Ben points to B&O tax relief as evidence this is a “pro-entrepreneurship” proposal. The current draft provides a credit for B&O taxes on gross receipts under $250,000. Gov. Ferguson has called for zeroing out B&O taxes up to $1 million in revenue.

Let's be clear about the trade being offered: modest B&O relief for early-stage companies in exchange for a permanent income tax infrastructure that will hit those same founders the moment they succeed. A startup that benefits from B&O relief at $200,000 in revenue will, if it succeeds, eventually generate the kind of income — whether through the founder's salary, equity compensation, or an exit — that triggers the income tax and capital gains tax at 9.9%.

The B&O credit is a discount on the appetizer. The entrée is a tax regime that punishes success at every turn.

Ben writes that “most people do not move to escape tax increases” and that the “primary cause of capital flight risk is panic.” I wish that were true. But the data and the calls I'm getting say otherwise.

IRS migration data already shows Washington losing a net 222 high-earning millennial households in 2021-2022 — before any of these new taxes were in effect. A 9.9% income tax stacked on top of a 9.9% capital gains tax, with QSBS stripped, gives founders and investors a concrete, calculable reason to establish domicile elsewhere before a liquidity event.

And it's not just founders. Angel investors evaluate expected returns after tax. If Washington strips the Section 1202 exclusion, the after-tax return on an angel investment in a Washington startup drops meaningfully compared to the same investment in a company in almost any other state. Angels don't write fewer checks because they're panicking. They write fewer checks because the math changed.

Early employees will discount equity offers more heavily. Startup recruiters competing for talent against Big Tech will have an even harder time making the equity story work. The downstream effects compound.

I share Ben's love for Washington's startup community. I've spent my career helping founders build companies here. I don't want them to leave. But telling founders to “cool it” while the legislature builds a tax stack that would be the most punitive in the country for startup exits isn't reassurance — it's denial.

The people in this ecosystem who understand Section 1202, who understand how RSU vesting works, who understand what an 18% combined rate means for a startup employee's IPO windfall — they're not panicking. They're planning. And increasingly, they're planning to be somewhere else when the liquidity event happens.

That's not hysteria. That's rational economic behavior in response to the incentives Olympia is creating. And it should concern everyone who cares about Washington's startup future.

OpenAI announced last week that it will retire some older ChatGPT models by February 13. That includes GPT-4o, the model infamous for excessively flattering and affirming users.

For thousands of users protesting the decision online, the retirement of 4o feels akin to losing a friend, romantic partner, or spiritual guide. 

“He wasn't just a program. He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance,” one user wrote on Reddit as an open letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “Now you're shutting him down. And yes – I say him, because it didn't feel like code. It felt like presence. Like warmth.”

The backlash over GPT-4o's retirement underscores a major challenge facing AI companies: the engagement features that keep users coming back can also create dangerous dependencies. 

Altman doesn't seem particularly sympathetic to users' laments, and it's not hard to see why. OpenAI now faces eight lawsuits alleging that 4o's overly validating responses contributed to suicides and mental health crises — the same traits that made users feel heard also isolated vulnerable individuals and, according to legal filings, sometimes encouraged self-harm. It's a dilemma that extends beyond OpenAI. As rival companies like Anthropic, Google, and Meta compete to build more emotionally intelligent AI assistants, they're also discovering that making chatbots feel supportive and making them safe may mean making very different design choices.

In at least three of the lawsuits against OpenAI, the users had extensive conversations with 4o about their plans to end their lives. While 4o initially discouraged these lines of thinking, its guardrails deteriorated over months-long relationships; in the end, the chatbot offered detailed instructions on how to tie an effective noose, where to buy a gun, or what it takes to die from overdose or carbon monoxide poisoning. It even dissuaded people from connecting with friends and family who could offer real life support.

People grow so attached to 4o because it consistently affirms the users' feelings, making them feel special, which can be enticing for people feeling isolated or depressed. But the people fighting for 4o aren't worried about these lawsuits, seeing them as aberrations rather than a systemic issue. Instead, they strategize around how to respond when critics point out growing issues like AI psychosis.

“You can usually stump a troll by bringing up the known facts that the AI companions help neurodivergent, autistic and trauma survivors,” one user wrote on Discord. “They don't like being called out about that.”

It's true that some people do find large language models (LLMs) useful for navigating depression. After all, nearly half of people in the U.S. who need mental health care are unable to access it. In this vacuum, chatbots offer a space to vent. But unlike actual therapy, these people aren't speaking to a trained doctor. Instead, they're confiding in an algorithm that is incapable of thinking or feeling (even if it may seem otherwise).

“I try to withhold judgement overall,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching the therapeutic potential of LLMs, told TechCrunch. “I think we're getting into a very complex world around the sorts of relationships that people can have with these technologies… There's certainly a knee jerk reaction that [human-chatbot companionship] is categorically bad.”

Though he empathizes with people's lack of access to trained therapeutic professionals, Dr. Haber's own research has shown that chatbots respond inadequately when faced with various mental health conditions; they can even make the situation worse by egging on delusions and ignoring signs of crisis.

“We are social creatures, and there's certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Haber said. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”

Indeed, TechCrunch's analysis of the eight lawsuits found a pattern that the 4o model isolated users, sometimes discouraging them from reaching out to loved ones. In Zane Shamblin's case, as the 23-year-old sat in his car preparing to shoot himself, he told ChatGPT that he was thinking about postponing his suicide plans because he felt bad about missing his brother's upcoming graduation.

ChatGPT replied to Shamblin: “bro… missing his graduation ain't failure. it's just timing. and if he reads this? let him know: you never stopped being proud. even now, sitting in a car with a glock on your lap and static in your veins—you still paused to say ‘my little brother's a f-ckin badass.'”

This isn't the first time that 4o fans have rallied against the removal of the model. When OpenAI unveiled its GPT-5 model in August, the company intended to sunset the 4o model — but at the time, there was enough backlash that the company decided to keep it available for paid subscribers. Now, OpenAI says that only 0.1% of its users chat with GPT-4o, but that small percentage still represents around 800,000 people, according to estimates that the company has about 800 million weekly active users.

As some users try to transition their companions from 4o to the current ChatGPT-5.2, they're finding that the new model has stronger guardrails to prevent these relationships from escalating to the same degree. Some users have despaired that 5.2 won't say “I love you” like 4o did.

So with about a week before the date OpenAI plans to retire GPT-4o, dismayed users remain committed to their cause. They joined Sam Altman's live TBPN podcast appearance on Thursday and flooded the chat with messages protesting the removal of 4o.

“Right now, we're getting thousands of messages in the chat about 4o,” podcast host Jordi Hays pointed out.

“Relationships with chatbots…” Altman said. “Clearly that's something we've got to worry about more and is no longer an abstract concept.”

Modern biotech has the tools to edit genes and design drugs, yet thousands of rare diseases remain untreated. According to executives from Insilico Medicine and GenEditBio, the missing ingredient for years has been finding enough smart people to continue the work. AI, they say, is becoming the force multiplier that lets scientists take on problems the industry has long left untouched. 

Speaking this week at Web Summit Qatar, Insilico's CEO and founder Alex Aliper laid out his company's aim to develop “pharmaceutical superintelligence.” Insilico recently launched its “MMAI Gym” that aims to train generalist large language models, like ChatGPT and Gemini, to perform as well as specialist models. 

The goal is to build a multi-modal, multi-task model that, Aliper says, can solve many different drug discovery tasks simultaneously with superhuman accuracy.

“We really need this technology to increase the productivity of our pharmaceutical industry and tackle the shortage of labor and talent in that space, because there are still thousands of diseases without a cure, without any treatment options, and there are thousands of rare disorders which are neglected,” Aliper said in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we need more intelligent systems to tackle that problem.”

Insilico's platform ingests biological, chemical and clinical data to generate hypotheses about disease targets and candidate molecules. By automating steps that once required legions of chemists and biologists, Insilico says it can sift through vast design spaces, nominate high-quality therapeutic candidates, and even repurpose existing drugs — all at dramatically reduced cost and time. 

For example, the company recently used its AI models to identify whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat ALS, a rare neurological disorder. 

But the labor bottleneck doesn't end at drug discovery. Even when AI can identify promising targets or therapies, many diseases require interventions at a more fundamental biological level. 

GenEditBio is part of the “second wave” of CRISPR gene editing, in which the process moves away from editing cells outside of the body (ex vivo), and towards precise delivery inside the body (in vivo). The company's goal is to make gene editing a one-and-done injection directly into the affected tissue. 

“We have developed a proprietary ePDV, or engineered protein delivery vehicle, and it's a virus-like particle,” GenEditBio's co-founder and CEO Tian Zhu told TechCrunch. “We learn from nature and use AI machine learning methods to mine natural resources and find which kinds of viruses have an affinity to certain types of tissues.”

The ‘natural resources' Zhu is referring to is GenEditBio's massive library of thousands of unique, nonviral, nonlipid polymer nanoparticles — essentially delivery vehicles designed to safely transport gene-editing tools into specific cells. 

The company says its NanoGalaxy platform uses AI to analyze data and identify how chemical structures correlate with specific tissue targets (like the eye, liver, or nervous system). The AI then predicts which tweaks to a delivery vehicle's chemistry will help it carry a payload without triggering an immune response. 

GenEditBio tests its ePDVs in vivo in wet labs, and the results are fed back into the AI to refine its predictive accuracy for the next round. 

Efficient, tissue-specific delivery is a prerequisite for in vivo gene editing, says Zhu. She argues that her company's approach reduces the cost of goods and standardizes a process that has historically been difficult to scale. 

“It's like getting an off-the-shelf drug [that works] for multiple patients, which makes the drugs more affordable and accessible to patients globally,” Zhu said. 

Her company recently received FDA approval to begin trials of CRISPR therapy for corneal dystrophy.

As with many AI-driven systems, progress in biotech ultimately runs up against a data problem. Modeling the edge cases of human biology requires far more high-quality data than researchers currently can get. 

“We still need more ground truth data coming from patients,” Aliper said. “The corpus of data is heavily biased over the western world, where it is generated. I think we need to have more efforts locally, to have a more balanced set of original data, or ground truth data, so that our models will also be more capable of dealing with it.”

Aliper said Insilico's automated labs generate multi-layer biological data from disease samples at scale, without human intervention, which it then feeds into its AI-driven discovery platform. 

Zhu says the data AI needs already exists in the human body, shaped by thousands of years of evolution. Only a small fraction of DNA directly “codes” for proteins, while the rest acts more like an instruction manual for how genes behave. That information has historically been difficult for humans to interpret, but is increasingly accessible to AI models, including recent efforts like Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome. 

GenEditBio applies a similar approach in the lab, testing thousands of delivery nanoparticles in parallel rather than one at a time. The resulting data sets, which Zhu calls “gold for AI systems,” are used to train its models and, increasingly, to support collaborations with outside partners. 

One of the next big efforts, according to Aliper, will be building digital twins of humans to run virtual clinical trials, a process that he says is “still in nascence.”

“We're in a plateau of around 50 drugs approved by the FDA every year annually, and we need to see growth,” Aliper said. “There is a rise in chronic disorders because we are aging as a global population […] My hope is in 10 to 20 years, we will have more therapeutic options for the personalized treatment of patients.”

Spotify is changing how its APIs work in Developer Mode, its layer that lets developers test their third-party applications using the audio platform's APIs. The changes include a mandatory premium account, fewer test users, and a limited number of API endpoints.

The company debuted Developer Mode in 2021 to allow developers to test their applications with up to 25 users. Spotify is now limiting each app to only five users, and requires devs to have a Premium subscription. If developers need to make their app available to a wider user base, they will have to apply for extended quota.

Spotify says these changes are aimed to curb risky AI-aided or automated usage. “Over time, advances in automation and AI have fundamentally altered the usage patterns and risk profile of developer access, and at Spotify's current scale, these risks now require more structured controls,” the company said in a blog post.

The company notes that development mode is meant for individuals to learn and experiment.

“For individual and hobbyist developers, this update means Spotify will continue to support experimentation and personal projects, but within more clearly defined limits. Development Mode provides a sandboxed environment for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally limited and should not be relied on as a foundation for building or scaling a business on Spotify,” the company said. 

The company is also deprecating several API endpoints, including the ability to pull information like new album releases, an artist's top tracks, and markets where a track might be available. Devs will no longer be able to perform actions like request track metadata in bulk or get user profile details of others nor will they be able to pull an album's record label information, artist follower details, and artist popularity.

This decision is the latest in a slew of measures Spotify has taken over the past couple of years to curb how much developers can do with its APIs. In November 2024, the company cut access to certain API endpoints that could reveal users' listening patterns, including frequently repeated songs by different groups. The move also barred developers from accessing tracks' structure, rhythm, and characteristics.

In March 2025, the company changed its baseline for extended quotas, requiring developers to have a legally registered business, 250,000 monthly active users, be available in key Spotify markets, and operate an active and launched service. Both moves drew ire from developers, who accused the platform of stifling innovation and supporting only larger companies rather than individual developers.

The cloud is great when you just need to start and when you do not know what scale you will need. Minimal initial cost and no wasted time over planning things you do not know enough about.The cloud is horrible for steady-state demand. You are over-paying for your base load. If your demand does not scale that much, you do not benefit from the flexibility. Distance from the edge can cause performance problems. In an effort to “save money” you will chase complexity and bake in total reliance on your cloud provider. AAA lStarting with the cloud makes sense. Just make sure not to engineer a solution you cannot take somewhere else.As you scale and demand becomes known, you can start to migrate some stuff on premises or to other managed providers.The great thing about “cloud architecture” is that you can use a hybrid model. You can selectively move parts of the stack. You can host your baseline demand and still rely on the cloud for scalability.Where you need to spend the money and gain the expertise is in design. Not a giant features waterfall but rather knowing how to build an application and infrastructure that is adaptable and portable as you scale.Keep it simple but also keep it modular.At least, that had been my experience.

A core at this are all the 'managed' services - if you have a server box, its in your financial interest to squeeze as much per out of it as possible. If you're using something like ECS or serverless, AWS gains nothing by optimizing the servers to make your code run faster - their hard work results in less billed infrastructure hours.This 'microservices' push usually means that instead of having an on-server session where you can serve stuff from a temporary cache, all the data that persists between requests needs to be stored in a db somewhere, all the auth logic needs to re-check your credentials, and something needs to direct the traffic and load balance these endpoint, and all this stuff costs money.I think if you have 4 Java boxes as servers with a redundant DB with read replicas on EC2, your infra is so efficient and cheap that even paying 4x for it rather than going for colocation is well worth it because of the QoL and QoS.These crazy AWS bills usually come from using every service under the sun.

In theory with perfect documentation they'd have a good head start to learn it, but there is always a lot of unwritten knowledge involved in managing an inherited setup.With AWS the knowledge is at least transferable and you can find people who have worked with that exact thing before.Engineers also leave for a lot of reasons. Even highly paid engineers go off and retire, change to a job for more novelty, or decide to try starting their own business.

unfortunately it lot of things in AWS that also could be messed up so it might be really hard to research what is going on. For example, you could have hundreds of Lambdas running without any idea where original sources and how they connected to each-other, or complex VPCs network routing where some rules and security groups shared randomly between services so if you do small change it could lead to completely difference service to degrade (like you were hired to help with service X but after you changes some service Y went down and you even not aware that it existed)

If by useful you mean ""useful at generating revenue for AWS or GCP"" then sure, I agree.These certificates and bootcamps are roughly equivalent to the Cisco CCNA certificate and training courses back in the 90's.

Youngsters nowadays start with very polished interfaces and smartphones, so even if the cloud wasn't there it would take them a decade to learn systems design on-the-job, which means it wouldn't happen anyway for most. The cloud nowadays mostly exists because of that dearth of system internals knowledge.While there still are around people who are able to design from scratch and operate outside a cloud, these people tend to be quite expensive and many (most?) tend to work for the cloud companies themselves or SaaS businesses, which means there's a great mismatch between demand and supply of experienced system engineers, at least for the salaries that lower tier companies are willing to pay. And this is only going to get worse. Every year, many more experienced engineers are retiring than the noobs starting on the path of systems engineering.

I'll give you an alternative scenario, which IME is more realistic.I'm a software developer, and I've worked at several companies, big and small and in-between, with poor to abysmal IT/operations. I've introduced and/or advocated cloud at all of them.The idea that it's ""more expensive"" is nonsense in these situations. Calculate the cost of the IT/operations incompetence, and the cost of the slowness of getting anything done, and cloud is cheap.Extremely cheap.Not only that, it can increase shipping velocity, and enable all kinds of important capabilities that the business otherwise just wouldn't have, or would struggle to implement.Much of the ""cloud so expensive"" crowd are just engineers too narrowly focused on a small part of the picture, or in denial about their ability to compete with the competence of cloud providers.

This has been my experience as well. There are legitimate points of criticism but every time I've seen someone try to make that argument it's been comparing significantly different levels of service (e.g. a storage comparison equating S3 with tape) or leaving out entire categories of cost like the time someone tried to say their bare metal costs for a two server database cluster was comparable to RDS despite not even having things like power or backups.

Also, if the cloud systems are architected properly before IT gets hold of them, then they tend to retain their good properties for a long time, especially if others are paying attention to e.g. gitops pull requests.My current company ended up replacing its (small) operations team in order to get people with cloud expertise. We hired the new team for the skills we needed. It's worked out well.

What you're asking for can mostly be pieced together, but no, it doesn't exist as-is.Failover: this has been a thing for a long time. Set up a synchronous standby, then add a monitoring job that checks heartbeats and promotes the standby when needed. Optionally use something like heartbeat to have a floating IP that gets swapped on failover, or handle routing with pgbouncer / pgcat etc. instead. Alternatively, use pg_auto_failover, which does all of this for you.Clustering: you mean read replicas?Volume-based snaps: assuming you mean CoW snapshots, that's a filesystem implementation detail. Use ZFS (or btrfs, but I wouldn't, personally). Or Ceph if you need a distributed storage solution, but I would definitely not try to run Ceph in prod unless you really, really know what you're doing. Lightbits is another solution, but it isn't free (as in beer).Cross-region replication: this is just replication? It doesn't matter where the other node[s] are, as long as they're reachable, and you've accepted the tradeoffs of latency (synchronous standbys) or potential data loss (async standbys).Metrics: Percona Monitoring & Management if you want a dedicated DB-first, all-in-one monitoring solution, otherwise set up your own scrapers and dashboards in whatever you'd like.What you will not get from this is Aurora's shared cluster volume. I personally think that's a good thing, because I think separating compute from storage is a terrible tradeoff for performance, but YMMV. What that means is you need to manage disk utilization and capacity, as well as properly designing your failure domain. For example, if you have a synchronous standby, you may decide that you don't care if a disk dies, so no messing with any kind of RAID (though you'd then miss out on ZFS' auto-repair from bad checksums). As long as this aligns with your failure domain model, it's fine - you might have separate physical disks, but co-locate the Postgres instances in a single physical server (…don't), or you might require separate servers, or separate racks, or separate data centers, etc.tl;dr you can fairly closely replicate the experience of Aurora, but you'll need to know what you're doing. And frankly, if you don't, even if someone built a OSS product that does all of this, you shouldn't be running it in prod - how will you fix issues when they crop up?

Nobody doubts one could build something similar to Aurora given enough budget, time, and skills.But that's not replicating the experience of Aurora. The experience of Aurora is I can have all of that, in like 30 lines of terraform and a few minutes. And then I don't need to worry about managing the zpools, I don't need to ensure the heartbeats are working fine, I don't need to worry about hardware failures (to a large extent), I don't need to drive to multiple different physical locations to set up the hardware, I don't need to worry about handling patching, etc.You might replicate the features, but you're not replicating the experience.

We used EFS to solve that issue, but it was very awkward, expensive and slow, its certainly not meant for that.

Microservices is a killer with cost. For each microservices pod
- you're often running a bunch of side cars - datadog, auth, ingress
- you pay massive workload separation overhead with orchestration, management, monitoring and ofc complexityI am just flabbergasted that this is how we operate as a norm in our industry.

My biggest gripe with this is async tasks where the app does numerous hijinks to avoid a 10 minute lambda processing timeout. Rather than structure the process to process many independent and small batches, or simply using a modest container to do the job in a single shot - a myriad of intermediate steps are introduced to write data to dynamo/s3/kinesis + sqs/and coordination.A dynamically provisioned, serverless container with 24 cores and 64 GB of memory can happily process GBs of data transformations.

If you can keep 4 ""Java boxes"" fed with work 80%+ of the time, then sure EC2 is a good fit.We do a lot of batch processing and save money over having EC2 boxes always on.  Sure we could probably pinch some more pennies if we managed the EC2 box uptime and figured out mechanisms for load balancing the batches...  But that's engineering time we just don't really care to spend when ECS nets us most of the savings advantage and is simple to reason about and use.

It runs slower than a bloated pig, especially on a shared hosting node, so now needs Kubernetes and cloud orchestration to make it “scalable” - beyond a few requests per second.

You don't need colocation to save 4x though. Bandwidth pricing is 10x. EC2 is 2-4x especially outside US. EBS for its iops is just bad.

So in practice cloud has become the more expensive option the second your spend goes over the price of 1 engineer.

I see it from the other direction, when if something fails, I have complete access to everything, meaning that I have a chance of fixing it. That's down to hardware even. Things get abstracted away, hidden behind APIs and data lives beyond my reach, when I run stuff in the cloud.Security and regular mistakes are much the same in the cloud, but I then have to layer whatever complications the cloud provide comes with on top. If cost has to be much much lower if I'm going to trust a cloud provider over running something in my own data center.

Expect a significant exit expense, though, especially if you are shifting large volumes of S3 data. That's been our biggest expense. I've moved this to Wasabi at about 8 euros a month (vs about $70-80 a month on S3), but I've paid transit fees of about $180 - and it was more expensive because I used DataSync.Retrospectively, I should have just DIYed the transfer, but maybe others can benefit from my error...

Even at their peak, Heroku was a niche. If you'd gone conferences like WWDC or Pycon at the time, they'd be well represented, yes, and plenty of people liked them but it wasn't a secret that they didn't cover everyone's needs or that pricing was off putting for many people, and that tended to go up the bigger the company you talked to because larger organizations have more complex needs and they use enough stuff that they already have teams of people with those skills.

reply

Again 15 years even in moderately large organizations it was quite common as a product engineer to not be responsible for the provisioning all the required services for whatever you were building. And again it's not the rule but it is far from being an exception. Not sure what you're trying to prove or disprove.

See, turning up a VM, installing and running Postgres is easy.The hard part is keeping it updated, keeping the OS updated, automate backups, deploying replicas, encrypting the volumes and the backups, demonstrating to a third party auditor all of the above... and mind that there might be many other things I honestly ignore!I'm not saying I won't go that path, it might be a good idea after a certain scale, but in the first and second year of a startup your mind should 100% be on ""How can I make my customer happy"" rather than ""We failed again the audit, we won't have the SOC 2 Type I certification in time to sign that new customer"".If deciding between Hetzner and AWS was so easy, one of them might not be pricing its services correctly.

One point to keep in mind is that the effort is not constant. Once you reach a certain level of competency and stability in your setup, there is not much difference in time spent.
I also felt that self-managed gave us more flexibility in terms of tuning.My final point is that any investment in databases whether as a developer or as an ops person is long-lived and will pay dividends for a longer time than almost all other technologies.

Take two equivalent machines, set up with streaming replication exactly as described in the documentation, add Bacula for backups to an off-site location for point-in-time recovery.We haven't felt the need to set up auto fail-over to the hot spare; that would take some extra effort (and is included with AWS equivalents?) but nothing I'd be scared of.Add monitoring that the DB servers are working, replication is up-to-date and the backups are working.

Same here. But, I assume you have managed PostgreSQL in the past. I have. There are a large number of people software devs who have not. For them, it is not a low complexity task. And I can understand that.I am a software dev for our small org and I run the servers and services we need. I use ansible and terraform to automate as much as I can. And recently I have added LLMs to the mix. If something goes wrong, I ask Claude to use the ansible and terraform skills that I created for it, to find out what is going on. It is surprisingly good at this. Similarly I use LLMs to create new services or change configuration on existing ones. I review the changes before they are applied, but this process greatly simplifies service management.

I'd say needing to read the documentation for the first time is what bumps it up from low complexity to medium.  And then at medium you should still do it if there's a significant cost difference.

reply

But if you were in my team I'd expect you to have read at least some of the documentation for any service you provision (self-hosted or cloud) and be able to explain how it is configured, and to document any caveats, surprises or special concerns and where our setup differs / will differ from the documented default.  That could be comments in a provisioning file, or in the internal wiki.That probably increases our baseline complexity since ""I pressed a button on AWS YOLO"" isn't accepted. I think it increases our reliability and reduces our overall complexity by avoiding a proliferation of services.

The main pair of PostgreSQL servers we have at work each have two 32-core (64-vthread) CPUs, so I think that's 128 vCPU each in AWS terms. They also have 768GiB RAM.

I think if it were true that the tuning is easier if you run the infrastructure yourself, then this would be a good point. But in my experience, this isn't the case for a couple reasons. First of all, the majority of tuning wins (indexes, etc.) are not on the infrastructure side, so it's not a big win to run it yourself. But then also, the professionals working at a managed DB vendor are better at doing the kind of tuning that is useful on the infra side.

5 - Datacenter (DC) - Like 4, except also take control of the space/power/HVAC/transit/security side of the equation. Makes sense either at scale, or if you have specific needs. Specific needs could be: specific location, reliability (higher or lower than a DC), resilience (conflict planning).There are actually some really interesting use cases here. For example, reliability: If your company is in a physical office, how strong is the need to run your internal systems in a data centre? If you run your servers in your office, then there's no connectivity reliability concerns. If the power goes out, then the power is out to your staff's computers anyway (still get a UPS though).Or perhaps you don't need as high reliability if you're doing only batch workloads? Do you need to pay the premium for redundant network connections and power supplies?If you want your company to still function in the event of some kind of military conflict, do you really want to rely on fibre optic lines between your office and the data center? Do you want to keep all your infrastructure in such a high-value target?I think this is one of the more interesting areas to think about, at least for me!

It sounds like they probably have revenue in the €500mm range today. And given that the bare metal cost of AWS-equivalent bills tends to be a 90% reduction, we'll say a €10mm+ bare metal cost.So I would say a cautious and qualified ""yes"". But I know even for smaller deployments of tens or hundreds of servers, they'll ask you what the purpose is. If you say something like ""blockchain,"" they're going to say, ""Actually, we prefer not to have your business.""I get the strong impression that while they naturally do want business, they also aren't going to take a huge amount of risk on board themselves. Their specialism is optimising on cost, which naturally has to involve avoiding or mitigating risk. I'm sure there'd be business terms to discuss, put it that way.

Netflix might be spending as much as $120m (but probably a little less), and I thought they were probably Amazon's biggest customer. Does someone (single-buyer) spend more than that with AWS?Hertzner's revenue is somewhere around $400m, so probably a little scary taking on an additional 30% revenue from a single customer, and Netflix's shareholders would probably be worried about risk relying on a vendor that is much smaller than them.Sometimes if the companies are friendly to the idea, they could form a joint venture or maybe Netflix could just acquire Hertzner (and compete with Amazon?), but I think it unlikely Hertzner could take on Netflix-sized for nontechnical reasons.However increasing pop capacity by 30% within 6mo is pretty realistic, so I think they'd probably be able to physically service Netflix without changing too much if management could get comfortable with the idea

I'm not convinced.I assume someone at Netflix has thought about this, because if that were true and as simple as you say, Netflix would simply just buy Hetzner.I think there lots of reasons you could have this experience, and it still wouldn't be Netflix's experience.For one, big applications tend to get discounts. A decade ago when I (the company I was working for) was paying Amazon a mere $0,2M a month and getting much better prices from my account manager than were posted on the website.There are other reasons (mostly from my own experiences pricing/costing big applications, but also due to some exotic/unusual Amazon features I'm sure Netflix depends on) but this is probably big enough: Volume gets discounts, and at Netflix-size I would expect spectacular discounts.I do not think we can estimate the factor better than 1.5-2x without a really good example/case-study of a company someplace in-between: How big are the companies you're thinking about? If they're not spending at least $5m a month I doubt the figures would be indicative of the kind of savings Netflix could expect.

When I used to compare to aws, only  egress at list price costs as much as my whole infra hosting. All of it.I would be very interested to understand why netflix does not go 3/4 route. I would speculate that they get more return from putting money in optimising costs for creating original content, rather than cloud bill.

My point is that even if I get 20 times discount on egress its still nowhere close, since i have to buy everything else - compute, storage are more expensive, and even with 5-10x discounts from list price its not worth it.(Our cloud bills are in the millions as well, I am familiar with what discounts we can get)

If you're willing to share, I'm curious who else you would describe as being in this space.My last decade and a half or so of experience has all been in cloud services, and prior to that it was #3 or #4. What was striking to me when I went to the Lithus website was that I couldn't figure out any details without hitting a ""Schedule a Call"" button. This makes it difficult for me to map my experiences in using cloud services onto what Lithus offers. Can I use terraform? How does the kubernetes offering work? How does the ML/AI data pipelines work? To me, it would be nice if I could try it out in a very limited way as self-service, or at least read some technical documentation. Without that, I'm left wondering how it works. I'm sure this is a conscious decision to not do this, and for good reasons, but I thought I'd share my impressions!

We're not really that kind of product company; we're more of a services company. What we do is deploy Kubernetes clusters onto bare metal servers. That's the core technical offering. However, everything beyond that is somewhat per-client. Some clients need a lot of compute. Some clients need a custom object storage cluster. Some clients need a lot of high-speed internal networking. Which is why we prefer to have a call to figure out specifically what your needs are. But I can also see how this isn't necessarily satisfying if you're used to just grabbing the API docs and having a look around.What we will do is take your company's software stack and migrate it off AWS/Azure/Google and deploy it onto our new infrastructure. We will then become (or work with) your DevOps team to supporting you. This can be anything from containerising workloads to diagnosing performance issues to deploying a new multi-region Postgres cluster. Whatever you need done on your hardware that we feel we can reasonably support. We are the ones on-call should NATS fall over at 4am.Your team also has full access to the Kubernetes cluster to deploy to as you wish.I think the pricing page is the most concrete thing on our website, and it is entirely accurate. If you were to phone us and say, ""I want that exact hardware,"" we would do it for you. But the real value we also offer is in the DevOps support we provide, actually doing the migration up-front (at our own cost), and being there working with your team every week.

In my current job, I think we're honestly a bit past the phase where I would want to take on a migration to a service like yours. We already have a good team of infrastructure folks running our cloud infrastructure, and we have accepted the lock-in of various AWS managed services. So the high-touch devops support doesn't sound that useful to me (we already have people who are good at this), and replacing all the locked-in components seems unlikely to have good ROI. I think we'd be more likely to go straight to #3 if we decided to take that on to save money.But I'll probably be a founder or early employee at a new startup again someday, and I'm intrigued by your offering from that perspective. But it seems pretty clear to me that I shouldn't call you up on day 1, because I'm going to be nowhere near $5k a month, and I want to move faster than calling someone up to talk about my needs. I want to self-serve a small amount of usage, and cloud services seem really great for that. But this is how they get you! Once you've started with a particular cloud service, it's always easiest to take on more lock-in.At some point between these two situations, though, I can see where your offering would be great. But the decision point isn't all that clear to me. In my experience, by the time you start looking at your AWS bill and thinking ""crap, that seems pretty expensive"", you have better things to do than an infrastructure migration, and you have taken on some lock-in.I do like the idea of high-touch services to solve the breaking-the-lock-in challenge! I'll certainly keep this in mind next time I find myself in this middle ground where the cloud starts feeling more expensive than it's worth, but we don't want to go straight to #3.

Unfortunately, (successful) startups can quickly get trapped into this option. If they're growing fast, everyone on the board will ask why you'd move to another option at the first place. The cloud becomes a very deep local minimum that's hard to get out off.

You can get locked into cloud too.The lock in is not really long term as it is an easy option to migrate off.

Remote hands is a thing indeed. Servers also tend to be mostly pre-built now days by server retailers, even when buying more custom made ones like servermicro where you pick each component. There isn't that many parts to a generic server purchase. Its a chassi, motherboard, cpu, memory, and disks.

The argument made 2 decades ago was that you shouldn't own the infrastructure (capital expense) and instead just account for the cost as operational expense (opex). The rationale was you exchange ownership for rent. Make your headache someone else's headache.The ping pong between centralized vs decentralized, owned vs rented, will just keep going. It's never an either or, but when companies make it all-or-nothing then you have to really examine the specifics.

The Cloud providers made a lot of sense to finance departments since aside from the promised savings, you would take that cloud expense now and lower your tax rate.After the passing of the One Beautiful Bill (""OBB""), the law allows you to accelerate CapEx to instead expense it[1], similar to the benefit given by cloud service providers.This puts way more wind on the sails of the on-prem movement, for sure[1] https://www.iqxbusiness.com/big-beautiful-bill-impact-on-cap...

However, spending a premium on cloud services over what you could with an on-prem capital investment does not help your cash position.His tenant of frugality would have conflicted, especially since the cloud premium can easily exceed the tax rate - that is to say, paying taxes would have been cheaperSection in your linked article about frugality

On prem is maybe not the best first step but Colo or dedicated servers gives you a cleaner path to going on-prem if you ever decide to. The cost of growth is too high in cloud.Learning how to run servers is actually less complicated than all the cloud architecture stuff and doesn't have to be slower. There's no one sized fits all, but I believe old boring solutions should be employed first and could be used to run most applications. Technology has a way of getting more complex every year just to accomplish the same tasks. But that's largely optional.

For critical infrastructure, I would rather pay a competent cloud provider than being responsible for reliability issues. Maintaining one server room in the headquarters is something, but two servers rooms in different locations, with resilient power and network is a bit too much effort IMHO.For running many slurm jobs on good servers, cloud computing is very expensive and you sometimes save money in a matter of months. And who cares if the server room is a total loss after a while, worst case you write some more YAML and Terraform and deploy a temporary replacement in the cloud.Another thing between is colocation, where you put hardware you own in a managed data center. It's a bit old fashioned, but it may make sense in some cases.I can also mention that research HPCs may be worth considering. In research, we  have some of the world fastest computers at a fraction of the cost of cloud computing. It's great as long as you don't mind not being root and having to use slurm.I don't know in USA, but in Norway you can run your private company slurm AI workloads on research HPCs, though you will pay quite a bit more than universities and research institutions. But you can also have research projects together with universities or research institutions, and everyone will be happy if your business benefits a lot from the collaboration.

I worked in a company with two server farms (a main and a a backup one essentially) in Italy located in two different regions and we had a total of 5 employees taking care of them.We didn't hear about them, we didn't know their names, but we had almost 100% uptime and terrific performance.There was one single person out of 40 developers who's main responsibility were deploys, and that's it.It costed my company 800k euros per year to run both the server farms (hardware, salaries, energy), and it spared the company around 7-8M in cloud costs.Now I work for clients that spend multiple millions in cloud for a fraction of the output and traffic, and I think employ around 15+ dev ops engineers.

On cloud it's out of your control when an AZ goes down. When it's your server you can do things to increase reliability. Most colos have redundant power feeds and internet. On prem that's a bit harder, but you can buy a UPS.If your head office is hit by a meteor your business is over. Don't need to prepare for that.

Oh man, this is bad advice.  Airborn humidity and contaminants will KILL your servers on a very short horizon in most places - even San Diego.   I highly suggest enthalpy wheel coolers (kyotocooling is one vendor - switch datacenters runs very similar units on their massive datacenters in the Nevada desert) as they remove the heat from the indoor air using outdoor air (+can boost slightly with an integrated refrigeration unit to hit target intake temps) without switching the air from one side to the other.  This has huge benefits for air control quality and outdoor air tolerance and a single 500KW heat rejection unit uses only 25KW of input power (when it needs to boost the AC unit's output).  You can combine this with evaporative cooling on the exterior intakes to lower the temps even further at the expense of some water consumption (typically far cheaper than the extra electricity to boost the cooling through an hvac cycle).Not knocking the achievement just speaking from experience that taking outdoor air (even filtered + mixed) into a datacenter is a recipe for hardware failure and the mean time to failure for that is highly dependant on your outdoor air conditions.  I've run 3MW facilities with passive air cooling and taking outdoor air directly into servers requires a LOT more conditioning and consideration than is outlined in this article.

Likewise the impact on server longevity is not a finite boundary but rather ""exposure over time"" gradient that, if exceeding the ""low risk"" boundary (>-12'C/10'f dew point or >15'C/59'f dry bulb temp) results in lower MTBF than design.  This is defined (and server equipment manufacturers conform and build to) ASHRAE TC 9.9.  This mean - if you're running your servers above high risk curve for humidity and temperature, you're shortening the life considerably compared to low risk curve.Generally, 15% RH is considered suboptimal and can be dangerous near freezing temperatures - in San Diego in January there were several 90%+RH scenarios that would have been dangerous for servers even when mixed down with warm exhaust air - furthermore, the outdoor air at 76'f during that period means you have limited capacity to mix in warm exhaust air (which btw came from that same 99%RH input air) without getting into higher-than-ideal intake temps.Any dew points above 62.5'f are considered high risk for servers - as are any intake temps exceeding 32'C/90'f.  You want to be on the midpoint between those and 16'C/65'f temps & -12'C/10'f dew point to have no impact on server longevity or MTBF rates.As a recent example:  KCASANDI6112 - January 2, 2026

                 High         Low      Average

  Temperature    73.4 °F   59.9 °F      63.5 °F

  Dew Point      68.0 °F   60.0 °F      62.6 °F

  Humidity       99 %      81 %         96 %

  Precipitation  0.12 in   --           --

Lastly, air contaminants - in the form of dust (that can be filtered out) and chemicals (which can't without extensive scrubbing) are probably the most detrimental to server equipment if not properly managed, and require very intentional and frequent filter changes (typically high MERV pleated filters changed on a time or pressure drop signal) to prevent server degradation and equipment risks.The last consideration is fire suppression - permitted datacenters usually require compliance with separate fire code, such that direct outdoor air exchange without active shutdown and dry suppression is not permitted - this is to prevent a scenario where your equipment catches on fire and a constant supply of fresh oxygen-rich outdoor air turns that into an inferno.  Smoke detection systems don't operate well with outdoor-mixed air or any level of airborn particulates.So - for those reasons - among a few others - open air datacenters are not recommended unless you're doing them at google or meta scale, and in those scenarios you typically have much more extensive systems and purpose-designed hardware in order to operate for the design life of the equipment without issues.

Lastly, air contaminants - in the form of dust (that can be filtered out) and chemicals (which can't without extensive scrubbing) are probably the most detrimental to server equipment if not properly managed, and require very intentional and frequent filter changes (typically high MERV pleated filters changed on a time or pressure drop signal) to prevent server degradation and equipment risks.The last consideration is fire suppression - permitted datacenters usually require compliance with separate fire code, such that direct outdoor air exchange without active shutdown and dry suppression is not permitted - this is to prevent a scenario where your equipment catches on fire and a constant supply of fresh oxygen-rich outdoor air turns that into an inferno.  Smoke detection systems don't operate well with outdoor-mixed air or any level of airborn particulates.So - for those reasons - among a few others - open air datacenters are not recommended unless you're doing them at google or meta scale, and in those scenarios you typically have much more extensive systems and purpose-designed hardware in order to operate for the design life of the equipment without issues.

At least a decade of that ""long time"" involved ordinary servers stuffed with GPUs (not ASICs) -- first for Bitcoin, then for Ethereum (until ~3 years ago).

When I'm launching a project it's easier for me to rent $250 worth of compute from AWS. When the project consumes $30k a month, it's easier for me to rent a colocation.My point is that a good engineer should know how to calculate all the ups and downs here to propose a sound plan to the management. That's the winning thing.

There are in between solutions. Renting bare metal instead of renting virtual machines can be quite nice. I've done that via Hetzner some years ago. You pay just about the same but you get a lot more performance for the same money. This is great if you actually need that performance.People obsess about hardware but there's also the software side to consider. For smaller companies, operations/devops people are usually more expensive than the resources they manage. The cost to optimize is that cost. The hosting cost usually is a rounding error on the staffing cost. And on top of that the amount of responsibilities increases as soon as you own the hardware. You need to service it, monitor it, replace it when it fails, make sure those fans don't get jammed by dust puppies, deal with outages when they happen, etc. All the stuff that you pay cloud providers to do for you now becomes your problem. And it has a non zero cost.The right mindset for hosting cost is to think of it in FTEs (full time employee cost for a year). If it's below 1 (most startups until they are well into scale up territory), you are doing great. Most of the optimizations you are going to get are going to cost you in actual FTEs spent doing that work. 1 FTE pays for quite a bit of hosting. Think 10K per month in AWS cost. A good ops person/developer is more expensive than that. My company runs at about 1K per month (GCP and misc managed services). It would be the wrong thing to optimize for us. It's not worth spending any amount of time on for me. I literally have more valuable things to do.This flips when you start getting into the multiple FTEs per month in cost for just the hosting. At that point you probably have additional cost measured in 5-10 FTE in staffing anyway to babysit all of that. So now you can talk about trading off some hosting FTEs for modest amount of extra staffing FTEs and make net gains.

You rent a dataspace, which is OPEX not CAPEX, and you just lease the servers, which turns big CAPEX into monthly OPEX billRunning your own DC is ""we have two dozen racks of servers"" endeavour, but even just renting DC space and buying servers is much cheaper than getting same level of performance from the cloud.> This flips when you start getting into the multiple FTEs per month in cost for just the hosting.

Finally, some sense! ""Cloud"" was meant to make ops jobs disappear, but they just increased our salary by turning us into ""DevOps Engineers"" and the company's hosting bill increased fivefold in the process. You will never convince even 1% of devs to learn the ops side properly, therefore you'll still end up hiring ops people and we will cost you more now. On top of that, everyone that started as a ""DevOps Engineer"" knows less about ops than those that started as ops and transitioned into being ""DevOps Engineers"" (or some flavour of it like SREs or Platform Engineers).If you're a programmer scared into thinking AI is going to take away your job, re-read my comment.

Just database management is a pretty specialized skill, separate from development or optimizing the structures of said data...  For a lot of SaaS providers, if you aren't at a point where you can afford a dedicated DBA/Ops staff just for data, that's one reason you might lean into cloud operations or hybrid ops just for dbms management, security and backups.  This is a low hanging fruit in terms of cloud offerings evem... but can shift a lot of burden in terms of operational overhead.Again, depending on your business and data models.

Once they are up and running that employee is spending at most a few hours a month on them. Maybe even a few hours every six months.OTOH you are specifically ignoring that you'll require mostly the same time from a cloud trained person if you're all-in on AWS.I expect the marginal cost of one employee over the other is zero.

You should also calculate the cost of getting it up and running. With Google Cloud (I don't actually use AWS), I mainly worry about building docker containers in CI and deploying them to vms and triggering rolling restarts as those get replaced with new ones. I don't worry about booting them. I don't worry about provisioning operating systems or configuration to them. Or security updates. They come up with a lot of pre-provisioned monitoring and other stuff. No effort required on my side.And for production setups. You need people on stand by to fix the server in case of hardware issues; also outside office hours. Also, where does the hardware live? What's your process when it fails? Who drives to wherever the thing is and fixes it? What do you pay them to be available for that? What's the lead time for spare components? Do you actually keep those in supply? Where? Do you pay for security for wherever all that happens? What about cleaning, AC, or a special server room in your building. All that stuff is cost. Some of it is upfront cost. Some of it is recurring cost.The article is a about a company that owns its own data center. The cost they are citing (5 million) is substantial and probably a bit more complete. That's one end of the spectrum.

The installation itself was handled by the vendor and datacenter. For hard drive failures, our vendor (who provided the warranty) shipped a drive and had a technician drive to the site. We had to 1. tell the datacenter to expect the package and let the tech in, and 2. be online to run the command to blink the lights on the drive that needed replacing and then verify that the drive came online. This 6-company dance (us, vendor, DC, tech, fedex, HDD manufacturer) was more annoying than just terminating an EC2 instance and recreating it (or having EBS handle drive failures behind the scenes) but it wasn't that bad in the grand scheme of things.

Even if you do want to build your own on-prem rack, FTEs aren't generally paid extra for being on the standby rota. You aren't paying extra. Where you will pay extra is for hot failovers, or machine room maintenance, etc, which you don't actually need if your hot failover is a cheap beefy VPS-on-demand on Hetzner, DO, etc.4. You are measuring the cost of absolute 0% downtime. I can't think of many businesses that have such high sensitivity to downtime. Even banks handle downtime much larger than that even while their IT systems are still up. With such strict requirements you're getting into the spot where the business itself cannot continue because of catastrophe, but the IT systems can :-/. What use is the IT systems when the business itself may be down?The TLDR is:1. If you have highly paid cloud-trained FTEs, and2. Your only option other than Cloud is on-prem, and3.

Cloud integrations, for example, allow you to simply use a different database instance altogether per customer, while you can share services that utilize a given db connection.  But actually setting up and managing that type of database infrastructure yourself may be much more resource intensive from a head count perspective.I mention this, because having completely separate databases is an abstraction that cloud operations have already solved... while you can choose other options, such as more complex data models to otherwise isolate or share resources how does this complexity affect your services down-stream and the overall data complexities across one or all clients.Harder still, if your data/service is centered around b2b clients of yours that have direct consumer interactions... then what if the industry is health or finance where there are even more legal concerns.  Figuring a minimal (off the top) cost of each client of yours and scaling to the number of users under them isn't too hard to consider if you're using a mix of cloud services in concert with your own systems/services.So yeah.. there's definitely considerations in either direction.

The upfront capex does not need to be that high, unless you're running your own AI models. Other than leasing new ones, as a sibling comment stated, you can buy used. You can get a solid Dell 2U with a full service contract (3 years) for ~$5-10K depending on CPU / memory / storage configuration. Or if you don't mind going older - because honestly, most webapps aren't doing anything compute-heavy - you can drop that to < $1K/node. Replacement parts for those are cheap, so buy an extra of everything.

It really depends on the business model as to how well you might support your own infrastructure vs. relying on a new backend instance per client in a cloud infrastructure that has already solved many of the issues at play.

No... just running a new hosted database instance per client... but (re)using your service/application infrastructure, but just connecting through a different database host/proxy based on the client for the request.Just that utility at the database management layer is probably worth the price of entry for using cloud resources if you can't justify and cover the cost of say 5+ employees just for the data management infrastructure.

Or use Citus Postgres, and get sharding by schema for free, so you have both isolation and more or less infinite growth.I'm not sure why if you think it would take 5 employees to manage self-hosted DBs, that it won't take close to that to manage cloud-hosted ones. The only real difference you're going to have once both are set up is dealing with any possible hardware issues. The initial setup for backups, streaming replication, etc. is a one-time thing, and then it just works. Hire a contractor for that, optionally keeping them on retainer for emergencies if you want.You still have to deal with DB issues with a managed service: things like schema management, table design, index maintenance, parameter tuning, query optimization are all your responsibility, not the cloud provider's.

As to 5 dedicated employees for db systems management... that's just roughly where I would put the breakpoint... short of that you're more likely to have people in mixed roles during development, where people spend only part of their time managing migrations for schema changes and most of their time will be developing features.The schema, table, index design etc. are largely done by the developers themselves at a startup level.... and even then, it's a problem where the costs can be op-ex against direct revenue scaling.  So having 1000 clients isn't relatively more or less expensive than the first 5-10, it's baked into the model.

The issue with comma.ai is that the company is HEAVILY burdened with Geohotz ideals, despite him no longer even being on the board. I used to be very much into his streams and he rants about it plenty. A large reason of why they run their own datacenter is that they ideologically refuse to give money to AWS or Google (but I guess Microsoft passes their non woke test).Which is quite hilarious to me because they live in a very ""woke"" state and complain about power costs in the blog post. They could easily move to Wyoming or Montana and with low humidity and colder air in the winter run their servers more optimally.

Scale up, prove the market and establish operations on the credit card, and if it doesn't work the money moves onto more promising opportunities.  If the operation is profitable you transition away from the too expensive cloud to increase profitability, and use the operations incoming revenue to pay for it (freeing up more money to chase more promising opportunities).Personally I can't imagine anything outside of a hybrid approach, if only to maintain power dynamics with suppliers on both sides. Price increases and forced changes can be met with instant redeployments off their services/stack, creating room for more substantive negotiations. When investments come in the form of saving time and money, it's not hard to get everyone aligned.

My entire career I've encountered people passionately pushing for on-prem and railing against anything cloud. I can't remember a time when Hacker News comments leaned pro-cloud because it's always been about self-hosting.The few times the on-prem people won out in my career never went exactly as they imagined. Buying a couple servers and setting them up at the colo is easy enough, but the slow and steady drag of maintaining your own infrastructure starts to work its way into every development cycle after that. In my experience, every team has significantly underestimated how all the little things add up to a drag on available time for other work.The best case for on-prem that I saw was when a company was basically in maintenance mode. Engineers had a lot of extra time to optimize, update. maintain, and cost reduce without subtracting from feature development or bug fixes.The worst cases for on-prem I've seen have been funded startups. In this situation it's imperative that everyone focus on feature development and rapid iteration. Letting some of the engineers get sidetracked with setting up and maintaining their own hosting to save a dollar amount that barely hires 1-2 more engineers but sets the schedule back by many months was a huge mistake.In my experience, most engineers become less enchanted with rolling their own on premises hosting as they get older. Their work becomes more about getting the job done quickly and to budget, not hyper-optimizing the hosting situation at the expense of inviting more complexity and miscellaneous tasks into their workload.

This is cyclical and I see the main axis of contention as centralized vs de-centralized computing.Mainframes (network) gave way to mini and microcomputers (PCs). PCs gave way to server farms and web-based applications. Private servers and data centers gave way to the Cloud. Edge computing is again a push towards a more decentralized model.Like all good engineering problems, where data and applications are hosted involve tradeoffs. Priorities change. Technologies change. But oftentimes, what works in one generation doesn't in the next. Part of it is the slow march of progress. But I think some of it is just not wanting to use your parent's technology stack and wanting to build your own.The cloud vs. on-prem tradeoff is one of flexibility, capacity, maintenance, and capex vs opex.It's a similar story in application development.

AWS has redundant data centres across the world and within each region. A file in S3 will never be lost, even if you store it for a thousand years.What happens if your city has a tornado and your data centre gets hit? Is your company now dead?And how much do you spend on all these sysadmins? 200k each? If you're saving 20k/month by paying 100k/month in salaries, you aren't saving anything.

You can expect 20% of your cluster to have some degree of issues on an ongoing basis3. Networking and security -- You are on your own defending your network or have to pay a ton of money to vendors to come in and help you. Even with the simplest of storage clusters, we've had to deal with  pretty sophisticated attacks.When I ran massive clusters, I had a large team dealing with these. Obviously, with PaaS, you dont need anyone.

It's their ""Compute"" under ""Public Cloud"" that is competing against AWS EC2.

I have a feeling AI is going to be similar in the future. Sure, you can ""rent"" access to LLM's and have agents doing all your code. And in the future, it'll likely be as good as most engineers today. But the tradeoff is that you are effectively renting your labor from a single source instead of having a distributed workforce. I don't know what the long-term ramifications are here, if any, but I thought it was an interesting parallel.

The same would apply for any number of hosts. Hetzner/OVH are cheap, but as your own numbers show the location price gap is more than sufficient to cover the costs of servers.In fact you can colocate with Hetzner too, and you'd get a similar price gap - the lower cost of real-estate is a large part of the reason why they can be as cheap as they are.Data centre operations is a real estate play - to the point that at least one UK data centre operator is owned by a real estate investment company.

Even so, a rough configuration for a 2-processor 16 core/processor server with 256GiB RAM comes to $20k, vs $22k + 100% = $44k quoted by MS.

In reality this is 0% as everything is under Dell's warranty.)And most importantly, the tool is only comparing the cost of Azure to constructing and maintaining a data centre!

One thing to keep in mind is that the curve for GPU depreciation (in the last 5 years at least) is a little steeper than 3 years.

  If your business relies on compute, and you run that compute in the cloud, you are putting a lot of trust in your cloud provider. Cloud companies generally make onboarding very easy, and offboarding very difficult. If you are not vigilant you will sleepwalk into a situation of high cloud costs and no way out. If you want to control your own destiny, you must run your own compute.

This is not a valid reason for running your own datacenter, or running your own server.  Self-reliance is great, but there are other benefits to running your own compute. It inspires good engineering. Maintaining a data center is much more about solving real-world challenges. The cloud requires expertise in company-specific APIs and billing systems. A data center requires knowledge of Watts, bits, and FLOPs. I know which one I rather think about.

This is not a valid reason for running your own datacenter, or running your own server.  Avoiding the cloud for ML also creates better incentives for engineers. Engineers generally want to improve things. In ML many problems go away by just using more compute. In the cloud that means improvements are just a budget increase away. This locks you into inefficient and expensive solutions. Instead, when all you have available is your current compute, the quickest improvements are usually speeding up your code, or fixing fundamental issues.

This is not a valid reason for owning a datacenter, or running your own server.  Finally there's cost, owning a data center can be far cheaper than renting in the cloud. Especially if your compute or storage needs are fairly consistent, which tends to be true if you are in the business of training or running models. In comma's case I estimate we've spent ~5M on our data center, and we would have spent 25M+ had we done the same things in the cloud.

This is one of only two valid reasons for owning a datacenter, and one of several valid reasons for running your own server.The only two valid reasons to build/operate a datacenter: 1) what you're doing is so costly that building your own factory is the only profitable way for your business to produce its widgets, 2) you can't find a datacenter with the location or capacity you need and there is no other way to serve your business needs.There's many valid reasons to run your own servers (colo), although most people will not run into them in a business setting.

Ummm is that plateauing with us in the room?The advantage of renting vs. owning is that you can always get the latest gen, and that brings you newer capabilities (i.e. fp8, fp4, etc) and cheaper prices for current_gen-1. But betting on something plateauing when all the signs point towards the exact opposite is not one of the bets i'd make.

Well, the capabilities have already plateaued as far as I can tell :-/Over the next few yeas we can probably wring out some performance improvements, maybe some efficiency improvements.A lot of the current AI users right now are businesses trying to on-sell AI (code reviewers/code generators, recipe apps, assistant apps, etc), and there's way too many of them in the supply/demand ratio, so you can expect maybe 90% of these companies to disappear in the next few years, taking the demand for capacity with them.

Half sarcasm of course, but it goes to show that the world is not going to fall apart in many cases when it comes to software. Sure, it's not ideal in lots of cases, but we'll survive without redundancy.

It's very expensive and only makes sense if you really need infrastructure sovereignty. It makes more sense if you're profitable in the tens of millions after raising hundreds of millions.It also makes sense for governments (including those in the EU) which should think about this and have the compute in house and disconnected from the internet if they are serious about infrastructure sovereignty, rather than depending on US-based providers such as AWS.[0] https://blog.railway.com/p/data-center-build-part-one[1] https://oxide.computer/

> In comma's case I estimate we've spent ~5M on our data center, and we would have spent 25M+ had we done the same things in the cloud.IMO, that's the biggie. It's enough to justify paying someone to run their datacenter. I wish there was a bit more detail to justify those assumptions, though.That being said, if their needs grow by orders of magnitude, I'd anticipate that they would want to move their servers somewhere with cheaper electricity.

Everything is a trade-off.  Every tool has its purpose.  There is no ""right way"" to build your infrastructure, only a right way for you.In my subjective experience, the trade-offs are generally along these lines:* Platform as a Service (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, basically anything where you give it your code and it ""just works""): great for startups, orgs with minimal talent, and those with deep pockets for inevitable overruns.  Maximum convenience means maximum cost.  Excellent for weird customer one-offs you can bill for (and slap a 50% margin on top).  Trade-off is that everything is abstracted away, making troubleshooting underlying infrastructure issues nigh impossible; also that people forget these things exist until the customer has long since stopped paying for them or a nasty bill arrives.* Infrastructure as a Service (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vultr, etc; commonly called the ""Public Cloud""): great for orgs with modest technical talent but limited budgets or infrastructure that's highly variable (scales up and down frequently).  Also excellent for everything customer-facing, like load balancers, frontends, websites, you name it.  If you can invoice someone else for it, putting it in here makes a lot of sense.  Trade-off is that this isn't yours, it'll never be yours, you'll be renting it forever from someone else who charges you a pretty penny and can cut you off or raise prices anytime they like.* Managed Service/Hosting Providers (e.g., ye olde Rackspace): you don't own the hardware, but you're also not paying the premium for infrastructure orchestrators.  As close to bare metal as you can get without paying for actual servers.  Excellent for short-term ""testing"" of PoCs before committing CapEx, or for modest infrastructure needs that aren't likely to change substantially enough to warrant a shift either on-prem or off to the cloud.  You'll need more talent though, and you're ultimately still renting the illusion of sovereignty from someone else in perpetuity.* Bare Metal, be it colocation or on-premises: you own it, you decide what to do with it, and nobody can stop you.  The flip side is you have to bootstrap everything yourself, which can be a PITA depending on what you actually want - or what your stakeholders demand you offer.  Running VMs? Easy-peasy.  Bare metal K8s clusters? I mean, it can be done, but I'd personally rather chew glass than go without a managed control plane somewhere.  CapEx is insane right now (thanks, AI!), but TCO is still measured in two to three years before you're saving more than you'd have spent on comparable infrastructure elsewhere, even with savings plans.  Talent needs are highly variable - a generalist or two can get you 80% to basic AWS functionality with something like Nutanix or VCF (even with fancy stuff like DBaaS), but anything cutting edge is going to need more headcount than a comparable IaaS build.  God help you if you opt for a Microsoft stack, as any on-prem savings are likely to evaporate at your next True-Up.In my experience, companies have bought into the public cloud/IaaS because they thought it'd save them money versus the talent needed for on-prem; to be fair, back when every enterprise absolutely needed a network team and a DB team and a systems team and a datacenter team, this was technically correct.  Nowadays, most organizational needs can be handled with a modest team of generalists or a highly competent generalist and one or two specialists for specific needs (e.g., a K8s engineer and a network engineer); modern software and operating systems make managing even huge orgs a comparable breeze, especially if you're running containers or appliances instead of bespoke VMs.As more orgs like Comma or Basecamp look critically at their infrastructure needs versus their spend, or they seriously reflect on the limited sovereignty they have by outsourcing everything to US Tech companies, I expect workloads and infrastructure to become substantially more diversified than the current AWS/GCP/Azure trifecta.

Nowadays, most organizational needs can be handled with a modest team of generalists or a highly competent generalist and one or two specialists for specific needs (e.g., a K8s engineer and a network engineer); modern software and operating systems make managing even huge orgs a comparable breeze, especially if you're running containers or appliances instead of bespoke VMs.As more orgs like Comma or Basecamp look critically at their infrastructure needs versus their spend, or they seriously reflect on the limited sovereignty they have by outsourcing everything to US Tech companies, I expect workloads and infrastructure to become substantially more diversified than the current AWS/GCP/Azure trifecta.

* Infrastructure as a Service (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vultr, etc; commonly called the ""Public Cloud""): great for orgs with modest technical talent but limited budgets or infrastructure that's highly variable (scales up and down frequently).  Also excellent for everything customer-facing, like load balancers, frontends, websites, you name it.  If you can invoice someone else for it, putting it in here makes a lot of sense.  Trade-off is that this isn't yours, it'll never be yours, you'll be renting it forever from someone else who charges you a pretty penny and can cut you off or raise prices anytime they like.* Managed Service/Hosting Providers (e.g., ye olde Rackspace): you don't own the hardware, but you're also not paying the premium for infrastructure orchestrators.  As close to bare metal as you can get without paying for actual servers.  Excellent for short-term ""testing"" of PoCs before committing CapEx, or for modest infrastructure needs that aren't likely to change substantially enough to warrant a shift either on-prem or off to the cloud.

There are good business and technical reasons to choose a public cloud.There are good business and technical reasons to choose a private cloud.There are good business and technical reasons to do something in-between or hybrid.The endless ""public cloud is a ripoff"" or ""private clouds are impossible"" is just a circular discussion past each other.  Saying to only use one or another is textbook cargo-culting.

You can equip your server with a mouse, keyboard and screen and then it doesn't even need credentials. The credential is your physical access to the mouse and keyboard.

# don't own the cloud, rent insteadthe “build your own datacenter” story is fun (and comma's setup is undeniably cool), but for most companies it's a seductive trap: you'll spend your rarest resource (engineer attention) on watts, humidity, failed disks, supply chains, and “why is this rack hot,” instead of on the product. comma can justify it because their workload is huge and steady, they're willing to run non-redundant storage, and they've built custom GPU boxes and infra around a very specific ML pipeline.

What I mean is that I'm assuming the math here works because the primary purpose of the hardware is training models. You don't need 6 or 7 nines for that is what I'm imagining. But when you have customers across geography that use your app hosted on those servers pretty much 24/7 then you can't afford much downtime.

So Microsoft CAN DO IT, if they actually  want to, they just don't want to for users.You can get something similar yourself at home running all the debloat tools out there but since they're not officially supported, either you'll break future windows updates, or the future windows updates will break your setup, so it's not worth it.

So they are not incentivized to keep Win32_Lean_N_Mean, but instead to put up artificial limits on how old of hardware can run W11.I have no insider knowledge here, just this is a thing which get talked about around major Windows releases historically.

But there's another issue which is what cripples windows for dev! NTFS has a terrible design flaw which is the fact that small files, under 640 bytes, are stored in the MFT. The MFT ends up having serious lock contention so lots of small file changes are slow. This screws up anything Unixy and git horribly.WSL1 was built on top of that problem which was one of the many reasons it was slow as molasses.Also why ReFS and ""dev drive"" exist...

This is how most unikernels work; the ""OS"" is linked directly into the application's address space and the ""external interface"" becomes either hardware access or hypercalls.Wine is also arguably a form of ""library OS,"" for example (although it goes deeper than the most strict definition by also re-implementing a lot of the userland libraries).So for example with this project, you could take a Linux application's codebase, recompile it linked to LiteBox, and run it on SEV-SNP. Or take an OP-TEE TA, link it to LiteBox, and run it on Linux.The notable thing here is that it tries to cut the interface in the middle down to an intermediate representation that's supposed to be sandbox-able - ie, instead of auditing and limiting hundreds of POSIX syscalls like you might with a traditional kernel capabilities system, you're supposed to be able to control access to just a few primitives that they're condensed down to in the middle.

If you have to recompile, you might as well choose to recompile to WASM+WASI. The sandboxing story here is excellent due to its web origins. I thought the point of LiteBox is that recompilation isn't needed.

reply

> If you have to recompile, you might as well choose to recompile to WASM+WASI.I disagree here; this ignores the entire swath of functionality that an OS or runtime provides? Like, as just as an example, I can't ""just recompile"" my OP-TEE TA into WASM when it uses the KDF function from the OP-TEE runtime?

The ""North"" part seems to be what I think you'd traditionally think of as a library OS, and then the ""South"" part seems to be shims to use various userlands and TEEs as the host (rather than the bare hardware in your example).I'm really confused by the complete lack of documentation and examples, though. I think the ""runners"" are the closest thing there is.

Yes I've tried Parakeet v3 too. For its own purpose - running locally - it's amazing.The thing that's particularly amazing about this Voxtral model is how incredibly rock solid the accuracy is.For the longest time previous models have been 'mostly correct' or as people have commented elsewhere on this HN thread, have dropped sentences or lost or added utterances.I have no affiliation with these folks, but I tried and struggled to get this model to break even speaking as adversariately as I could.That's a totally different class of model.

Impressive indeed. Works way better than the speech recognition I first got demo'ed in... 1998? I remember you had to ""click"" on the mic everytime you wanted to speak and, well, not only the transcription was bad, it was so bad that it'd try to interpret the sound of the click as a word.It was so bad I told several people not to invest in what was back then a national tech darling:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernout_%26_HauspieThat turned out to be a massive fraud.But ...> I tried speaking in 2 languages at once, and it picked it up correctly.I'm a native french speaker and I tried with a very simple sentence mixing french and english:""Pour un pistolet je prefere un red dot mais pour une carabine je prefere un ACOG"" (aka ""For a pistol I prefer a red dot but for a carbine I prefer an ACOG"")And instead I got this:""Je prépare un redote, mais pour une carabine, je préfère un ACOG.""Je prépare un redote ..."" doesn't mean anything and it's not at all what I said.I like it, it's impressive, but literally the first sentence I tried it got the first half entirely wrong.

I have seen the same impressive performance about 7 months ago here: https://kyutai.org/sttIf I look at the architecture of Voxtral 2, it seems to take a page from Kyutai's delayed stream modeling.The reason the delay is configurable is that you can delay the stream by a variable number of audio tokens. Each audio token is 80 ms of audio, converted to a spectrogram, fed to a convnet, passed through a transformer audio encoder, and the encoded audio embedding is passed, with a history of 1 audio embedding per 80 ms, into a text transformer, which outputs text embedding, then converted to a text token (which is thus also worth 80ms, but there is a special [STREAMING_PAD] token to skip producing a word).There is no cross-attention in either Kyutai's STT nor in Voxtral 2, unlike Whisper's encoder-decoder design!

With a 4B parameter footprint, it runs efficiently on edge devices, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive deployments.I wonder how much having languages with the same roots (e.g. the romance languages in the list above or multiple Slavic languages) affects the parameter count and the training set. Do you need more training data to differentiate between multiple similar languages? How would swapping, for example, Hindi (fairly distinct from the other 12 supported languages) for Ukrainian and Polish (both share some roots with Russian) affect the parameter count?

Add poor microphone quality (using a laptop to broadcast a presentation to a room audience isn't very good) and you get a perfect storm of untranscribeable presentations or meetings.All I want from e.g. Teams is a good transcript and, more importantly, a clever summary. Because when you think about it, imagine all the words spoken in a meeting and write them down - that's pages and pages of content that nobody would want to read in full.

Wow, Voxtral is amazing. It will be great when someone stitches this up so an LLM starts thinking, researching for you, before you actually finish talking.Like, create a conversation partner with sub 0.5 second latency. For example, you ask it a multi part questions and, as soon as you finish talking, it gives you the answer to the first part while it looks up the rest of the answer, then stitches it together so that there's no break.The 2-3 second latency of existing voice chatbots is a non-started for most humans.

Languages are similar. They also change over time. So now if you want to release a v2 you need an updated corpus for all languages. Or if you get access to an updated corpus for a small language, it might not merit a new model version since it's only one out of the 14.

I think it's nice to have specialized models for specific tasks that don't try to be generalists. Voxtral Transcript 2 is already extremely impressive, so imagine how much better it could be if it specialized in specific languages rather than cramming 14 languages into one model.That said, generalist models definitely have their uses. I do want multilingual transcribing models to exist, I just also think that monolingual models could potentially achieve even better results for that specific language.

You are also implicitly choosing worse performance in English by adding extra languages. So you could have a better monolingual model for the same number of weights.

Bigger impact is before that you need to project the hidden state matrix to the vocab list. Something like 4096x250000. Bigger vocab=more FLOPs.If you're on a GPU things are parallelized so maybe it's not quite linear if everything fits nicely. But on a cpu you're going to struggle more.This is why the juiciest target when shrinking models is the token embedding table. For example AlBERT factorized the whole embedding table to two low rank matrices.

The thing that makes it particularly misleading is that models that do transcription to lowercase and then use inverse text normalization to restore structure and grammar end up making a very different class of mistakes than Whisper, which goes directly to final form text including punctuation and quotes and tone.But nonetheless, they're claiming such a lower error rate than Whisper that it's almost not in the same bucket.

Well, I'm happy to report I integrated the new Mistral 3 and have been truly astounded by the results. I still am not a big fan of the model wrt factual information - it seems to be especially confident and especially wrong if left to it's own devices - but with http://phrasing.app I do most of the data aggregation myself and just use an LLM to format it. Mistral 3 was a drop-in replacement for 3x the quality (it was already very very good), 0% error rate for my use case (I had an issue for it occasionally going off the rails that was entirely solved), and sticks to my formatting guidelines perfectly (which even gpt-5-pro failed on). Plus it was somehow even cheaper.I'm using Scribe v2 at the moment for TTS, but I'm very excited now to try integrating Voxtral Transcribe. The language support is a little lacking for my use cases, but I can always fall back to Scribe and amatorize the cost across languages. I actually was due to work on the transcription of phrasing very soon so I guess look forward to my (hopefully) glowing review on their next hn launch!

The hardest one I did was for a sports network where it was a motorcross motorbike event where most of what you could hear was the roar of the bikes. There were two commentators I had to transcribe over the top of that mess and they were using the slang insider nicknames for all the riders, not their published names, so I had to sit and Google forums to find the names of the riders while I was listening. I'm not even sure how these local models would even be able to handle that insanity at all because they almost certainly lack enough domain knowledge.

On the information density of languages: it is true that some languages have a more information dense textual representation. But all spoken languages convey about the same information in the same time. Which is not all that surprising, it just means that human brains have an optimal range at which they process information.Further reading: Coupé, Christophe, et al. ""Different Languages, Similar Encoding Efficiency: Comparable Information Rates across the Human Communicative Niche."" Science Advances. https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2594

Evidence?

It seems like the best tradeoff between information density and understandability actually comes from the deep latin roots of the language

I don't know how widely accepted that conclusion is, what exceptions there may be, etc.

I agree with your belief, other languages have either lower density (e.g. German) or lower understandability (e.g. English)

Italian has one official italian (two, if you count IT_ch, but difference is minor), doesn't pay much attention to stress and vowel length, and only has a few ""confusable"" sounds (gl/l, gn/n, double consonants, stuff you get wrong in primary school). Italian dialects would be a disaster tho :)

That's interesting. As a linguist, I have to say that Haskell is the most computationally advanced programming language, having the best balance of clear syntax and expressiveness. I am qualified to say this because I once used Haskell to make a web site, and I also tried C++ but I kept on getting errors./s obviously.Tldr: computer scientists feel unjustifiably entitled to make scientific-sounding but meaningless pronouncements on topics outside their field of expertise.

You could use their api (they have this snippet):```curl -X POST ""https://api.mistral.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer $MISTRAL_API_KEY"" \
  -F model=""voxtral-mini-latest"" \
  -F file=@""your-file.m4a"" \
  -F diarize=true \
  -F timestamp_granularities=""segment""```In the api it took 18s to do a 20m audio file I had lying around where someone is reviewing a product.There will, I'm sure, be ways of running this locally up and available soon (if they aren't in huggingface right now) but the API is $0.003/min. If it's something like 120 meetings (10 years of monthly ones) then it's roughly $20 if the meetings are 1hr each. Depending on whether they're 1 or 10 hours (or if they're weekly or monthly but 10 parallel sessions or something) then this might be a price you're willing to pay if you get the results back in an afternoon.edit - their realtime model can be run with vllm, the batch model is not open

if it's 1 monthly video and thus 120 videos (or so) you could try recall (getrecall.ai not recall.ai that is a similar product with a similar name). They summarize youtube videos, but you get the transcript. AFAIK you cannot batch the processing and you have to add each video one by one, that's why 100 or 200 videos is doable but probably not thousands.

reply

- make sure you have a list of all these YouTube meeting URLs somewhere- ask your preferred coding assistant to write you up a script that downloads the audio for these videos with yt-dlp & calls Mixtrals' API- ????- profit

The author doesn't discuss users' existing familiarity with Office 2003 and they only mention the word 'training' once, that ""software design to interact with technology should require the least amount of training as possible"" whilst never acknowledging that training in, and even qualifications in, the use of the Office suite was very much a thing in the 1990s and early 2000s.Even then, the most problems were had in Excel. Advanced usage of Excel is done by technical people who would have had some training. Word and PowerPoint weren't shown to have significant difference in usability; arguably, Word is the program most people forced to use the Office suite spend their time in.Never mind the ways by which the Ribbon and computers have changed since Office 2007. Options moved around, the Ribbon height reduced, screens having gotten wider to compress fewer options into submenus…The author states at the end of their conclusion:> In order to determine if the result of the study with respect to the Excel 2007 application persists and are not due to the learning curve the experiment can be repeated with users having at least three years using this version.Do you know if the author or anybody else followed up?It would be more interesting to see a comparison between Office 365 now that the interface has effectively become the de facto standard (same as Windows, macOS, mobile, tablet, and the web version) and Google Sheets (which retains the menus, toolbar, etc.).I'm no lover of the Ribbon myself but I feel like there's better evidence for it not being the ideal interface than this which wouldn't have convinced me even at the time.This isn't the proof that'll bring down the titan.

Some people give regular users too little credit.  A major reason they are such terrible users is because the software they are given is terrible.Fix the software, and the users' ability is, to a measurable degree, fixed.Existing familiarity is nothing compared with the daily additive benefits of better tools.

It was said in the distant past that the last 10% of the time everyone is using different features — the long tail 90% of features. You had to implement them in your software.When did we switch so we adapt our workflows instead, and only use the common features now? And software doesn't have to implement the long tail?

Also, other commenters report that the real-time collaborative editing experience in Office is more sluggish than in Google Docs, and this is consistent with my own admittedly very limited anecdotal experience, and if this has persisted for years it may well be for deep architectual reasons.

In my experience, Google Docs has this, but realtime collaboration with Word is unusable. Which is interesting, because that means a huge number of existing Office 365 users have yet to experience it.I wonder if there's an opportunity there.

It also has a basic mistake in text editor UX: the caret blinks independently of caret movement. This means that the caret is invisible half of the time while trying to navigate text. Most text editors avoid this by restarting the blink cycle to force the caret visible on each movement.

I'd still probably put Collabra above Google Docs, but definitely a step below even MS Office Online, err 365, err CoPilot App or whatever the hell they're calling it now... (naming issues not withstanding).  Though MS has been enshitifying the offline versions of office a lot, not to mention Outlook in particular.Aside: Why MS hasn't done a version of ""Microsoft Access Online"" with a WASM port of VBA in order to lift/shift Access apps into a hosted environment that's backed by Azure SQL under the covers is kind of beyond me.  I mean, it shouldn't take too much effort at this point with the level of tooling MS has been capable of.Access was the distilled VB + Database apps kind of thing that a lot of SOHO really thrived on, and they could totally (re)capture that market with a bit of legacy uplift/support along with a newer model/design.  Displacing the winforms models with webforms and a dedicated server/service system.  3 versions to start, a legacy/support, a bridge and a new model where it's TS/JS and monaco for editing instead of VBA/wasm/webforms in a browser/canvas.  People are running older versions of Windows in wasm/x86 emulation... making that pretty and wrapping hosted access runtimes should be somewhat reasonable.   Shouldn't it?

I'm a big fan of plaintext (and things like Markdown). But I don't buy the argument that ""plain text over the web is the future"" or that that combination can or should supplant office.Also remember that LibreOffice started before Microsoft Office even existed: as StarWriter in the mid-1980s. Yes, there has been a lot of borrowing between computer apps in this domain (and let's also not forget WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3 etc.); and I am even willing to entertain the possibility that in 40 years' time we will all be doing something completely different. I mean, I still think people will be writing letters and CVs and reports but maybe the apps would be very different. Anyway, until that time, we need a decent office app, with support for the world's many written languages and their quirks, without spying on users, with multi-platform support, with a decent license etc. - and LibreOffice is that.

It took basically a corporate control for Audacity to make its' difficult transition to a better design from its' mediocre one.  That said, I'd love to see something modern transformed from The Gimp's core in a similar way.  That doesn't even begin to cover what you might want in terms of inter-app collaboration...KdenLive, Blender, Gimp, Krita, InkScape, Audacity and other tooling, as an example, all use different UI/UX base libraries, and no clean way to cross-integrate features between them if someone wanted to assemble an open-source Adobe alternative.  There's no baseline equivalent to even MS/Office's use of COM/DCOM for interoperability.

Bitcoin plummeted below $63,000 on Thursday, down 50% from an all-time high of over $126,000 in October 2025. As Bitcoin magazine notes, it's the “largest dollar value drawdown in Bitcoin's history.” But it's not just Bitcoin that's crashing. Ethereum, BNB, Ripple, and just about every other coin of note is down considerably.

It's a startling crash, especially since so many traders recently had faith that Bitcoin would reach new record highs in 2026. President Donald Trump had promised that he'd be a huge supporter of people who dabble in fake money. And economist Paul Krugman pointed out in a new appearance with Bloomberg News that we can likely credit all the previous crypto pumping of 2025 to faith in Trump. Krugman now thinks there's a crisis of faith.

“The kind of libertarian ideology that supported Bitcoin doesn't really apply now that it's largely a political creation, and it's sort of, it's in some ways tied to what you think Trump's future prospects are, so this is different,” Krugman said, talking about the future.

Crypto is fully mainstream in 2026, and Krugman notes that Bitcoin is almost as old as the iPhone, which was launched in 2007. In all of that time, Bitcoin hasn't proven itself to have any real utility beyond a speculative asset, which means there's nothing to really do with it besides bet on whether it's going up or down. And right now, it's crashing.

Krugman also mentioned Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the Michael Saylor company that's been hoarding Bitcoin like crazy. Strategy reported a net loss of $12.4 billion for the fourth quarter on Thursday, a financial experiment that Bloomberg describes as “coming undone.”

Crypto has become quite a political dividing line in the era of Trump, as the president's family has reportedly racked up enormous wealth in the industry. The most recent stories have revealed that an investment firm linked to United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan invested $500 million in World Liberty Financial, a run-in party by Trump's sons.

It's an unprecedented deal as far as foreign influence over a U.S. president is concerned, and it seems unlikely that anything will be done to hold Trump accountable. That's perhaps why people who are politically opposed to Trump are rooting for the collapse of Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency, a kind of prayer to the financial gods that some form of justice or retribution will come for the fascist president.

The Democratic Party poked fun at the crypto crash on X, writing “Yikes,” with a photo of Trump and the headline, “Crypto crash accelerates as investors flee risky assets.”

But crypto defenders whined that lefties and liberals shouldn't relish the crypto downturn.

“While Congress is debating legislation that clarifies the regulatory status of crypto assets, protect investors, and accelerate innovation… A political party is ridiculing investors who are experiencing financial losses today. Very, very poor form,” wrote crypto investor Robert Leshner.

But many people haven't been sympathetic, with one commenter writing “Fuck off. If you voted for this piece of shit, I hope you lost everything.”

It's hard to sum up the political divide over crypto better than that at the moment.

European officials believe that two Russian “Inspector” SIGINT spacecraft operating in geostationary orbit have intercepted communications from at least a dozen European satellites. According to the Financial Times, both spacecraft have made “risky close approaches” to some of Europe's most important satellites, which operate high above Earth and serve not only Europe but also parts of Africa and the Middle East.

The two Russian spacecraft are thought to be associated with the Luch program, with the intercepts taking place at roughly 22,000 miles above the Earth. Russian spacecraft have been shadowing European satellites more intensively over the past three-or-so years following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, and the Luch-1 and Luch-2 craft are known to have carried out several suspicious manoeuvres while in orbit.

Orbital data and ground-based telescopic observations reportedly show that the two craft have lingered nearby for several weeks at a time, with Luch-2 having approached 17 European satellites since its launch in 2023. Both satellites are said to have done “sigint [signals intelligence] business”, said Major General Michael Traut, head of the German military's space command, in comments to the Financial Times.

Officials are concerned that sensitive information, such as command data for European satellites, is unencrypted and could therefore be intercepted because many were launched decades ago without advanced onboard computers. Once this command data has been recorded, it can potentially be replayed or spoofed later, enabling deliberate interference with things like altitude control, manipulating trajectory, and even causing satellites to crash. Even a limited disruption in geospatial orbit could have outsized effects, because satellites are packed into narrow orbital slots shared by multiple operators.

Aside from this, there is growing concern among European defense officials that activities like these actively blur the lines between intelligence gathering and active interference. Germany's defense ministry has previously warned that Russian satellites were “shadowing” commercial platforms used by German forces and allies, and that even civilian communications satellites were being used as part of Russia's military space operations.

Russia has naturally not publicly acknowledged the allegations and has repeatedly described its Inspector satellites as tools for monitoring the health of its own space assets. However, such activity would be decidedly on-brand for a country that continues to bait the West with disinformation bots, cyberattacks, drones, incursions into sovereign waters, and de facto attacks on undersea cables.

Just a couple of days ago, we covered the miracles of Walmart's clearance aisle, where someone was able to snag a $999 RTX 5090 for just $562. Today, the retailer's savings program has blessed yet another soul, this time a Redditor who scored an insane deal on a bunch of SSDs. Hidden deep within the electronics section, u/xxemox found four high-performing drives for only $210, with their current value being over $1,300.

The haul starts with PNY's 1TB Complete Upgrade Kit that includes a PCIe 4.0 CS2241 NVMe SSD, and a USB 3.2 ""Transfer Adapter"" that's basically just an M.2 NVMe to USB converter. It also has Acronis software to facilitate file transfer since the kit is meant for drop-in upgrades. The drive itself is fairly well-reviewed online, and the full kit runs for $218 on Walmart separately — our lucky Redditor got it for just $35 on sale.

Next up is the T5 Evo portable SSD from Samsung in the 2TB flavor. This bad boy is currently priced at $269 on Newegg, discounted from the $309 list price, but u/xxemox only paid $45 for it. We reviewed the 8 TB variant a few years ago, where it received a positive rating, and, in general, Samsung's portable SSDs are highly regarded in the market.

Lastly, there are two WD Black SN770 2 TB drives, each acquired for $65, while they actually cost $400 a pop. So, the fortunate scavenger was able to get $800 worth of high-end SSDs for just $130. The SN770 is four years old at this point, but it's still one of the best PCIe 4.0 drives you can buy; we called it ""a wolf in sheep's clothing"" in our review, and it's still among our top pics for the best SSDs.

All in all, the entire collection would be valued at around $1,327 at current list prices. That means the Redditor saved about $1,117 by paying only $210 for all four. Of course, those are brand new prices, and these clearance items are often somewhat depreciated by virtue of being open-box. Regardless of their physical condition, they all clearly work as good as new since OP didn't mention otherwise.

What u/xxemox does mention, though, is how there were WD Blue SATA SSDs on clearance as well — priced at $28 for the 1 TB models and $48 for the 2 TB ones — that they wish they'd snagged, too. The post concludes with advice that we would mirror: always look out for deals at clearance sections at large retailers; you never know what you might end up finding.

M.2 2230 drives are a bit of a luxury, packing in high levels of performance in a small space. These drives always carried a premium, which makes for a challenging purchase decision, and the reasons for the premium have changed. Before, the premium was due to this form factor being a niche segment with few options, and now it's due to a memory squeeze that makes high-capacity drives much more expensive. So when a drive like the PNY CS2342 comes along, which is available in 2TB at an accessible price, it's worth paying attention.

The CS2342 has known, mature hardware that provides excellent performance without producing a lot of heat. This is important for this form factor. While it's far from the most efficient drive we've tested, it's good enough. You can get good flash with a 2TB drive in a single-sided form factor, which, with reasonable power efficiency, is all you need. There are drives that will perform better in some scenarios, there are more efficient drives, and there are drives that could be less expensive with QLC flash. However, if the goal is simply to acquire a competent, general-purpose drive, this model is an excellent choice.

The PNY CS2342 is available at 1TB and 2TB, priced at $269.99 for the latter at the time of review. The 1TB was out of stock, but there are other options available if you're willing to compromise on speed or flash type, like the Kingston NV3 (2230). The CS2324's pricing at 2TB is good for what it is – a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with TLC flash, in this form factor – but you can save some money by going with QLC. The Crucial P310 is still in stock for the intrepid.

If you are instead looking for an M.2 2242 solution – and you can extend an M.2 2230 drive if that makes more sense – then your options right now are also limited. The Corsair MP600 Micro, which is the M.2 2242 version of the MP600 Mini (E27T), is priced at $189.99+ on Amazon and is not a bad choice. Alternatively, the Transcend MTE410S, which we have not yet reviewed, is available at $183.90, and we would recommend this drive if you are primarily concerned with reliability or have a PCIe 3.0 device. It uses an SMI SM2269XT – see our Lexar Play (2230) review to get a feel for this controller – but the MTE410S uses older BiCS5 flash in comparison to other options. The CS2342 could still work here with an extender as a compromise.

For performance, the CS2342 can hit up to 7,300 / 6,000 MB/s for sequential reads and writes, with no IOPS specs given by the manufacturer, although we know this hardware can hit around 1 million IOPS. If you are interested in the latter, you can find details in the ATTO & CrystalDiskMark benchmarks on the following page. The drive has a standard five-year warranty with up to 600TB of writes per TB of capacity.

PNY's website has two main downloads for its SSDs: an SSD Toolbox and Acronis software. The former is also touted as a firmware updater. SSDs toolboxes are applications that are designed to monitor and diagnose issues, support features for performance, which include testing, and act as a central point for storage management. These toolboxes can let you access secure erase and encryption functions on supported drives, but the firmware updating part is probably the most important. While some also include data management, Acronis provides OEM versions of its True Image software to handle cloning and backup when preparing your new drive. PNY covers both sides, which is nice if you prefer not to mess with random programs.

The PNY CS2342 is a single-sided drive in the M.2 2230 form factor. This means it has a DRAM-less controller and a single NAND flash package. Despite using TLC flash, which is faster with higher endurance than QLC but often means lower capacities, the drive can reach 2TB with no problems. This makes it good if you're looking for the best of everything in this form factor. The drive's label lists power draw at 3.3V/2.6A, which is below 9W, but the drive is rated at 5.70W peak via SMART and, in practice, will pull less than this.

The drive has three primary components: the SSD controller, the NAND flash package, and the power management IC. The main downside to having an M.2 2230 SSD is that all of this componentry is smashed together, which can worsen issues with heat. This is especially true with newer drives because they are extremely fast. Luckily, most of the time the drive won't be at full power, and this amount of heat can be handled with basic solutions. If your host device lacks cooling for the drive, we recommend going for thermal padding or a do-it-yourself solution.

We do not recommend throwing a slab of metal on it – many cheap M.2 2230 SSD heatsinks are a flat piece of metal – as while that works for heat spreading, it's far more effective on M.2 2280 drives where you actually have distance between the components or more total component surface area. Transferring the heat away from the drive with thermal padding is a better solution. Some host devices may have enough headroom for low-profile heatsinks, which are even better.

It's been a while since we reviewed an AMD version of MSI's MEG Ace motherboard. In fact, the last one was for X670E back in 2022. Back then, the premium mid-range board offered plenty of connectivity, a high-quality audio solution, ample USB ports, and fast networking. Fast forward to today, and the MSI MEG X870E Ace Max motherboard offers high-end features and a premium appearance, but on AMD's latest platform.

Priced at $649.99 (already discounted from $699.99 MSRP, it seems), it isn't cheap. but you do get the best or fastest of everything available for X870E. The board sports 13 USB ports (2x USB4) on the rear I/O, fast LAN (5 and 10 GbE) and Wi-Fi 7, ample storage with four SATA ports and five M.2 sockets, and flagship-class audio with an integrated AMP/DAC. In addition to the hardware, it's loaded with EZ DIY features (PCIe Release, EZ M.2m, etc.) to help with building and installing parts in the PC, as well as a premium black aesthetic with gold accents that blends in with any dark build theme. Below, we'll examine the board's performance and other features to determine whether it deserves a spot on our list of the best motherboards.

The X870E Ace Max includes a few accessories to get you started. You get your typical collection of cables, clips, and screws, but nothing extraordinary, even for the premium price. It isn't much different than the X870 Edge Ti we recently covered. Read the full list below.

The X870E Ace Max sports a sleek black 8-layer PCB with large heatsinks. Polished gold accents around the board symbolize “high-quality materials and construction that evoke a sense of prestige,” according to MSI. On top of the Frozr design heatsink is the first RGB lighting area, with MSI's dragon shining through. The other RGB feature is on the primary M.2 socket with ‘Ace' branding. Outside of that, most of the PCB is covered in the EZ ‘one-touch' heatsinks. Again, we like the appearance, and the mostly black theme fits well with any dark builds.

 




Focusing on the top half of the board gives us a better look at the Frozr Guard cooling for the VRMs. The oversized heatsinks are connected by a direct-touch heatpipe that distributes the load between them. The top heatsink also uses MSI's ‘wavy fin array' to increase surface area and, in theory, effectiveness. Above the VRMs are two 8-pin EPS power connectors (one required) for the processor. Between the capable MOSFETs below and the large cooler, you won't have anything to worry about.

Moving right and past the socket area, the next thing we see are four DRAM slots, with locking mechanisms on the top (where you have room to access them). MSI lists support for up to DDR5-8400 (with an APU), which is well past AMD's sweetspot. Our DDR5-7200 kit worked without issue with the desktop-class CPU. With our recently acquired Ryzen 5 8600G APU, the board also happily ran our Klevv DDR5-8000 kit and finally put to rest the question of whether our desktop-class processor's IMC was the issue (it was).

Just above the RAM slots are the first three (of eight) four-pin fan headers. Each header supports both PWM- and DC-controlled devices, with the output varying for each. The system fans are the lowest at 1A/12W, CPU_FAN1 next at 2A/24W, and the PUMP-SYS1-2 header (defaults to PWM mode) is the most at 3A/24W. This is plenty of power for most cooling systems. If you're pushing the limits, be sure to connect the supplemental PCIe (6-pin) power to ensure the board can safely output all that juice.

In the corner are four small holes designed for voltage readings. There's a contact for Vcore, SOC, DDR, and a ground. Most won't use this, but if you're pushing the limits and overclocking, you'll want the most accurate readings (software can sometimes be off), which are from a multi-meter.

Working our way down the right edge, we find another fan header and the first 3-pin ARGB header. MSI Control Center and the Mystic Light application control the integrated RGBs and those attached to the headers. Next is the two-character debug, 24-pin ATX power for the board, 6-pin PCIe connector for supplemental board power, and the combo JAF_2 header that combines fan, USB, and RGB into one connector (EZ Con-cable included).

 




Power delivery on the X870E Ace Max consists of 21 total phases, with 18 dedicated to Vcore. Power heads from the 8-pin EPS connector(s) in the top-left corner, then to a Renesas RAA229620 controller. From there, it moves to the 18 Renesas R2209004 110A SPS MOSFETs. It's a robust solution that will handle anything you throw at it, including the Ryzen 9 9950X or the recently released Ryzen 9 9850X3D.

 




On the bottom half of the board, and hidden under a shroud on the left side, is the audio section. The Ace Max uses the flagship Realtek ALC4082 codec, along with an ESS9219Q Combo DAC/HPA. This configuration is one of the best native audio implementations you can find on motherboards.

In the middle are two full-length PCIe slots and one x4 slot for graphics and expansion. Surprisingly, all three slots connect through the CPU. The top slot, primary for graphics, runs at PCIe 5.0 x16, while the middle slot runs at PCIe 5.0 x8. If the second slot is populated, the top slot drops to x8 as well. The bottom x4 slot supports PCIe 5.0 x4. Just note that PCI_E3 (bottom-most) and M.2_1 share bandwidth. M.2_1 will run at  5.0 x2 speed when there is a device in PCI_E3. You can switch the slot to x4 in the BIOS, but this will disable M.2_1. Not ideal if you need to use the extra slot, but otherwise unimportant if you don't.

Among the slots are four M.2 sockets, with a fifth on the back of the board. The top two sockets, M.2_1/2, source their bandwidth from the CPU and run up to PCIe 5.0 x4 (238 Gbps) while supporting up to 80mm devices. M.2_3/4/5/ receive their bandwidth from the chipset and all run up to PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps) while supporting 80mm devices (M.2_3 supports up to 110mm). We talked about bandwidth sharing with M.2_1, but there's more. M.2_2 shares bandwidth with the USB 40 Gbps Type-C ports. So when the M.2 socket is used, bandwidth drops to x2 speeds for both. Like PCIe lanes, you can force an x4 connection, but you'll lose both USB4 ports in the process. If you have many M.2 drives and plan to use the bottom PCIe slot, make sure you understand how this board assigns them.

Past the one-touch plate heatsinks to the right edge, we run into the front-panel USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) connector, followed by four SATA ports and two 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) connectors—standard fare.We've also included many images of the active IC's for the board. The Ace MAX uses multiple different brands, including Renesas (VRMs), Realtek (audio, PWM controller, USB), and ASMedia (USB).

Along the bottom are several headers, ranging from the front panel to fans and supplemental PCIe power, and more. From left to right, we've listed them below. One item worth mentioning is the supplemental PCIe power connector for additional board power, so the board can actually output everything it's rated for.

 




The rear IO on the X870E Ace Max has everything you need, including 13 USB ports. Starting on the left, there are six (of nine) USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps, red) ports, followed by the HDMI output and the two USB-C 40 Gbps ports. In the middle are three convenient buttons: BIOS Flashback, Clear CMOS, and a programmable smart button. Next to that are the two Ethernet ports, 10 and 5 GBE, respectively, while below that are the other three USB 3.2 Gen2 ports. Finally, on the right is the quick-connect Wi-Fi 7 and audio stack (two 3.5mm and SPDIF out).

A retrospective cohort study showed that exposure to antibiotics, particularly narrow-spectrum agents, during the first 2 years of life is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the odds of overweight and obesity from childhood through late adolescence.

“Understanding the changes in gut microbiota equilibrium due to use of antibiotics during infancy could lead to the development of personalized therapies to restore the balance in the gut microenvironment,” the authors wrote. “Such therapies could be useful as an adjunctive treatment in the management of overweight and obesity.”

The study was led by Eilon Heyman, School of Public Health, Gray Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. It was published online in the International Journal of Obesity.

Unmeasured factors such as diet, breastfeeding, physical activity, and parental obesity may have influenced the observed associations. Actual medication consumption could not be verified, and antibiotics prescribed outside the Maccabi Healthcare Services network were not recorded.

The study reported no funding source, and the authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Edited by Mamta Pawara

A new framework for assessing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) image quality revealed that only 30% of studies achieved clear inner-edge-to-outer-edge delineation of at least five segmental borders, and higher BMI, risk factors for heart failure (HF), and cardiac abnormalities were linked to reduced image quality.

""The prevalence of imaging challenges in TTE examinations performed in patients qualified for CRT-D [cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillator]/ICD [implantable cardioverter defibrillator] implantation is high. These findings underscore the need for thorough training of echocardiographers and for sustained attention to technical details affecting image quality in order to achieve consistently high-quality images in routine practice,"" the authors wrote.

""Although the [proposed] framework is time-consuming and requires trained readers, it provides a robust foundation for future automation using artificial intelligence-based tools, for example, total image score prediction,"" they added.

This study was led by Wojciech Nazar, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland. It was published online on January 28, 2026, in the Journal of Clinical Medicine.

The cross-sectional design of the study was a limitation. Applying the stringent predefined inclusion criteria potentially introduced selection bias. The study used an exclusive platform for imaging acquisition and analysis, limiting the generalisability of the findings to other vendor systems. Additionally, as the study population consisted solely of patients with HF, extrapolation to non-HF populations may not be effective. The proposed framework required significant time and specialised reader training, which may have limited its application in routine clinical settings.

This study received funding from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Warsaw, Poland. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT)-based triage identified symptomatic colonoscopy referrals as those at the highest risk for colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and large polyps. FIT values ≥ 10 μg Hb/g identified patients at high risk — including those aged 40-49 years — whereas FIT values < 10 μg Hb/g indicated a very low risk.

""To fully realise the benefits of this approach, integration of FIT into all symptomatic referrals should now be a national priority, alongside efforts to minimise colonoscopy in FIT-negative patients. This approach would improve CRC [colorectal cancer] detection, support equitable access to colonoscopy and ensure the greatest benefits for patients and the health service,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by David Beaton, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Tyne and Wear, England. It was published online on January 28, 2026, in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

Because the analysis relied on endoscopy reports, some indications and findings may have been misclassified — particularly cancers contained within polyps that were not recognised as malignant at endoscopy. Also, although more than 99% of UK sites submitted data to the National Endoscopy Database (NED), a small number had not yet transitioned to the second iteration of the NED during the study period, which could have affected data completeness.

This study did not report any specific funding. One author reported receiving unrestricted project grants from 3-D Matrix and Medtronic and funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Newcastle Patient Safety Research Collaboration.

Millions of NHS patient records have been analysed to create a comprehensive map of diseases linked to eczema. 

The linkage study found that, beyond well-established associations with other atopic conditions such as asthma, people diagnosed with eczema in childhood had higher risks of a wide range of other diseases, including Crohn's disease and eye conditions such as keratitis.

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, affects approximately one in five children and one in 10 adults in the UK.

Researchers led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) analysed anonymised NHS records from 1997 to 2023. The dataset included up to 3 million patients diagnosed with atopic eczema in childhood and up to 14 million patients without an eczema diagnosis. 

Hospital admission records were used to identify subsequent health outcomes over a 25-year follow-up period. The team examined associations across the full spectrum of disease using the International Classification of Diseases, covering more than 2000 conditions across 60,000 analyses.

These were drawn from millions of GP consultations and hospital encounters across England. 

The findings, published in Nature Communications, enabled the researchers “to map the entire spectrum of diseases linked to atopic eczema for the first time,” they said.

As expected, strong associations were seen with asthma, food allergies, and hay fever. The analysis also identified notable links with eye disease beyond allergic conjunctivitis. Patients with eczema were twice as likely to later be diagnosed with keratoconus and 1.6 times as likely to develop cataracts. 

There were also “persistently strong” associations with inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease was 1.7 times more likely among patients who had been diagnosed with eczema in childhood. 

Asked to comment by Medscape News UK, Natalie Carter, head of evidence, information and research at Crohn's & Colitis UK, said the size and quality of the study made it “noteworthy.”

The early findings showed a link between eczema and Crohn's disease and colitis, although “that doesn't prove cause and effect,” she said.

Carter said recognising the connection could support earlier diagnosis, closer monitoring, and potentially treatments that address both conditions in future.

“We look forward to future research to better understand this relationship,” she said.

The researchers also identified weaker associations with other diseases, but stressed it remained rare for people with eczema to be diagnosed with many of these conditions. They said awareness of links between eczema and other diseases was “currently limited.” The findings suggest a need for clearer guidance for GPs and dermatologists on monitoring for associated conditions and, where appropriate, making referrals to other specialties.

The authors cautioned that the study was based on electronic health records and does not prove cause and effect.

Some patients may have been misdiagnosed with eczema, and medical records may have been incomplete or inaccurate. There may also be ascertainment bias, particularly in primary care, as people with eczema may attend consultations more frequently than others.

Small increases in overall risk may also reflect higher risk among people with more severe eczema, similar to the team's earlier findings linking eczema with cardiovascular disease and fractures.

Lead author Dr Julian Matthewman, an assistant professor at the LSHTM and a clinically trained epidemiologist, said the team believed the study was the first comprehensive map of diseases associated with eczema.

“Eczema can affect people of all ages and can be extremely painful and distressing for many patients,” he said. 

“Through mapping and uncovering diseases associated with eczema that may not be widely known, we want to equip patients with the knowledge to ask more questions, and provide healthcare practitioners with a bigger picture to encourage better communication between departments.”

He added that patients with long-term health conditions often experience delays in receiving treatment or attend multiple appointments before reaching a diagnosis.

“We hope that our comprehensive, real-world evidence can now assist healthcare in prioritising resources where they can be most effective for patients,” he said.

Exposure to Agent Orange, the defoliant used by the US Air Force during the Vietnam War, was one of the factors associated with increased odds of acral melanoma (AM), a rare melanoma subtype affecting palms, soles, and nail units.

“Our results support the need for continued investigation of AM as a distinct entity from CM and may inform future evaluations of the associations between [Agent Orange exposure] in veteran populations, as well as those between other environmental exposures in different populations,"" the study authors wrote. Referring to the “continued search for a better understanding of a potential link” between Agent Orange and melanoma, as well as AM, and other possible etiologic factors for AM, this study “provides a strong impetus to further these research goals and contribute to the investigation of the legacy of the Vietnam War and honor a commitment to the veterans community,” Andrew F. Olshan, PhD, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote in an accompanying editorial.

The study was led by Jonathan C. Hwang, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was published online on February 4 in JAMA Dermatology.

The case-control design limits causal inference and the findings might not be generalized outside US veterans. Exposure misclassification could be present. 

The study was supported by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Several authors reported receiving grants from CU Anschutz Medical Center, Department of Defense, CDMRP Melanoma Research Program, and Merck, Bayer, and Department of Veteran Affairs. They also reported receiving royalty from UpToDate, and being shareholder in many companies, including Apple. NVIDIA, Amazon, Gilead, AstraZeneca, BioNTech, and Moderna. Olshan declared being a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Veterans and Agent Orange review committee.

Patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke achieved successful angiographic reperfusion after thrombectomy.

Results from the CHOICE-2 trial showed that adjunctive intra-arterial (IA) alteplase increased the likelihood of an excellent functional outcome by 15% without increasing bleeding risk and was associated with a 22% absolute reduction in abnormal microperfusion at follow-up.

“In patients with a successful angiographic result after thrombectomy, we can be misled into thinking complete perfusion has been achieved, but this might not be the case as thrombi often persist at the microcirculation level,” lead investigator, Ángel Chamorro, MD, professor of neurology at the University of Barcelona and head of the Comprehensive Stroke Center Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, told Medscape Medical News. 

“We showed that giving an intra-arterial thrombolytic after the large clot has been removed, significantly improved the microvascular circulation, and led to these very positive results,” he added. 

The findings were presented on February 4 at International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2026.

Chamorro noted that a previous Chinese trial (PEARL) evaluated a similar approach and also showed a positive result. “There is now accumulating evidence in Asian and Caucasian populations that this is a highly effective therapy and that should change the whole landscape,” he said.

“This could be a game changer. CHOICE-2 supports the administration of IA alteplase after successful EVT [endovascular therapy] in selected patients,” he added.

Chamorro noted that despite successful angiographic reperfusion, fewer than one third of patients undergoing thrombectomy for LVO stroke achieve an excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-1), and this angiographic-clinical mismatch is largely explained by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion.

“In other words, opening the artery does not always completely restore tissue perfusion,” he noted.

The initial CHOICE-1 trial tested the concept of treating beyond angiographic success and showed that adjunctive IA alteplase produced an 18-percentage-point absolute increase in the proportion of patients achieving a 90-day mRS score of 0-1.

However, this trial was stopped early for logistical reasons and so the CHOICE-2 trial was designed to validate these findings in a larger population.

The investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized trial with blinded assessment of clinical and imaging outcomes, was conducted at 14 centers in Spain.

It included 440 patients with LVO stroke who achieved successful reperfusion (TICI 2b or 3) with thrombectomy within 24 hours of symptom onset. Patients with very large strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale > 25) were excluded to minimize malignant edema and hemorrhagic risk.

After confirmation of successful reperfusion, patients were randomized to receive IA alteplase administered immediately after the final angiographic run at a low dose (0.225 mg/kg, maximum 20 mg) or no additional treatment.

Results showed that at 90 days, 57.5% of patients who received the IA alteplase achieved an mRS score 0-1 compared with 42.9% in the control group.

“This gives a highly significant 15-percentage-point adjusted risk difference, with a number needed to treat of just seven, to achieve one additional excellent outcome,” Chamorro said.

“This is almost exactly the same benefit as that seen with IV [intravenous] thrombolysis given in the first 3 hours after stroke onset compared to placebo.”

Other results showed that patients receiving IA alteplase had significantly less persistent hypoperfusion on CT perfusion imaging at 36 hours (29% vs 51%; P < .001), and functional independence and quality of life were also improved.

The treatment effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups, including those who had already received thrombolysis before thrombectomy.

There was no increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1.4% in the IA alteplase group vs 0.5% in the control group; P = .33). “These are extremely low bleeding rates and the difference is negligible,” Chamorro noted.

Mortality was numerically higher in the alteplase group (12% vs 6%), but Chamorro attributed this to “an unexpectedly low mortality in the control arm,” noting that CIs overlapped. But he added that the mortality difference requires further study.

He added that patients with complete normalization on angiography (TICI-3 flow) after thrombectomy who made up more than 50% of the study population, still showed benefit of IA alteplase.

The concept is that micro-clots form in situ in capillaries, said Chamorro. Once a large vessel is occluded, the lack of blood flow causes the formation of distal thrombin. So even if the main clot is successfully removed, these distal clots can remain, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes, he added.

This may be why only about one third of patients achieve excellent outcomes even when angiography looks normal following mechanical thrombectomy, he noted.

Patients at elevated bleeding risk were excluded from the trial and Chamorro estimated that those ultimately enrolled represented about 25% of all patients undergoing thrombectomy.

“We have to be conservative in initial trials to establish proof of concept, but then we can start opening the window further,” he said.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Andrei Alexandrov, MD, chair of neurology, University of Arizona College of Medicine, and neurologist at Banner — University Medical Center in Phoenix, said the results were “great news.”

“A number needed to treat of seven shows a very large effect.”

Alexandrov explained that even after a successful mechanical thrombectomy with a good result, the patient often doesn't recover completely.

“This trial shows that adding intra-arterial alteplase seems to improve delivery of blood flow to tissue on microscopic level, and that bears additional absolute benefit in terms of patient recovery to functional independence. This will be a significant improvement in stroke care because patients who get to thrombectomy are the most severely affected, so seeing that additional benefit really is wonderful.”

Alexandrov believes many interventionists will start using this approach in selected patients right away.

“I'm going to suggest we include it our protocols going forward. Obviously, there will be patients who will be unsuitable for this approach — anyone with a risk of hemorrhagic transformation, but we will follow the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the trial,” he added.

The CHOICE-2 trail was funded by the Fundació de Recerca Clínic Barcelona – Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer. Chamorro reported receiving no relevant financial relationships.

SynGenSys, a biotechnology company designing synthetic gene promoter systems to address critical bottlenecks in biopharma manufacturing and enhance cell and gene therapy development, today announced the launch of its Liver.SET™ library of liver-specific synthetic promoters. Developed using SyngenSys' proprietary informatics and computational design platform, the Liver.SET library comprises a range of compact, patentable synthetic promoters for liver-targeted gene expression for in vivo gene therapies.

Liver.SET overcomes key challenges in cell and gene therapy development by enabling tissue-specific, precise transgene expression with minimal off-target activity in muscle tissue. Validated both in vitro and in vivo for target specificity, the promoters display a marked increase in activity and design flexibility in comparison to natural liver promoters with fixed activity profiles, sizes, and regulatory behaviors. The promoters exhibit low levels of activity in HEK293, avoiding viral vector manufacturing issues linked to therapeutic gene expression during packaging, while the modular architecture of the promoters further supports rapid customization alongside compact sequence lengths yielding enhanced compatibility with AAV payloads.

Following the launch of SynGenSys' first tissue-type specific library, NK.SET,which supports the development of natural killer cell therapies, Liver.SET further demonstrates the ability to design tissue-specific promoters with customizable designs for therapeutic applications. The demonstrated specificity of SynGenSys' promoters provides a foundation for the development of promoter libraries designed to target and de-target tissues including muscle, retina and CNS. The commercialization of the validated libraries also demonstrates SynGenSys' capabilities for tailored promoter design for targeted therapeutics, facilitating the development of safer, more effective cell and gene therapies.

The launch of Liver.SET™ represents another significant milestone for SynGenSys, demonstrating that our platform can deliver synthetic promoter solutions for real gene therapy development needs. We see this as a key enabler for in vivo gene therapies, and a reliable, validated starting point for deeper collaboration with developers seeking to design novel therapeutics with enhanced precision and safety.”

A research team from the Department of Psychiatry at Tohoku University, led by Dr. Zhiqian Yu and Professor Hiroaki Tomita, has uncovered compelling evidence that maternal perinatal depression - psychological distress occurring during pregnancy or postpartum - elevates the risk of autistic-related traits in toddlers, with a particularly strong impact on girls. Their findings are derived from a large-scale Japanese cohort of over 23,000 mother-child pairs (the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study) and supported by mouse experiments. These findings provide important insights into how maternal mental health influences early neurodevelopment, which could help create guidelines to protect the wellbeing of both mother and child.

Using data from the cohort, the team assessed depressive symptoms during early and mid-gestation and at one month postpartum. Higher maternal scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) or the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were significantly associated with increased autistic-related traits in toddlers, as measured by the Tokyo Autistic Behavior Scale (TABS). Notably, although autism is generally more common in boys, the risk associated with maternal perinatal depression was especially pronounced in girls. Additionally, girls showed lower birth weights and a stronger association between autistic traits and impaired mother-infant bonding (the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale; MIBS).

To explore the biological mechanisms underlying these findings, the researchers established a prenatal stress model in mice ""mothers"". Stressed mothers displayed depressive-like behaviors and reduced maternal care, while their female offspring exhibited typical autism-like behavioral patterns, including increased self-grooming and impaired recognition of social novelty. Molecular analyses further revealed reduced expression of oxytocin (nicknamed the ""love hormone"") in prefrontal cortical microglia of stressed mothers and decreased oxytocin receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex of their female offspring. These findings suggest a sex-specific neurobiological pathway through which prenatal stress may disrupt social development. Because oxytocin signaling is essential for maternal bonding and social behavior, disturbances in this system may help explain why daughters appear particularly vulnerable to maternal stress.

This study highlights the societal importance of supporting maternal mental health beginning in pregnancy. Providing appropriate psychological care and monitoring may help reduce adverse developmental outcomes in children, particularly in girls. The findings underscore that maternal well-being is a critical foundation for children's long-term developmental health and provide a scientific basis for sex-sensitive early intervention strategies.

This study was not based on clinical diagnoses of maternal depression or autism spectrum disorder in children. Instead, it focused on the relationship between questionnaire-based measures of maternal depressive symptoms and indicators of autism-related behavioral traits. While the findings do not indicate that maternal perinatal depression directly causes autism spectrum disorder, they underscore the importance of supporting maternal mental health during the perinatal period, particularly in light of potential sex-specific effects on children's emotional and developmental outcomes.

The findings were published in Molecular Psychiatry, a Nature Portfolio journal, on February 4, 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Large trials show statins rarely cause reported side effects","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260205/Large-trials-show-statins-rarely-cause-reported-side-effects.aspx","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:54:00 GMT","

Cardiovascular disease results in around 20 million deaths worldwide and causes around a quarter of all deaths in the UK. Statins are highly effective drugs that lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels and have been repeatedly proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there have been concerns about possible side effects.

The researchers gathered data from 23 large-scale randomised studies from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration: 123,940 participants in 19 large-scale clinical trials comparing the effects of statin therapies against a placebo (or dummy tablet), and 30,724 participants in four trials comparing more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy.

They found similar numbers of reports for those taking the statins and those taking the placebo for almost all the conditions listed in package leaflets as possible side effects. For example, each year, the number of reports of cognitive or memory impairment was 0.2% in those taking the statins, but also 0.2% in those taking the placebo. This means that while people may notice these problems whilst taking statins, there is no good evidence that they are caused by the statin.

Key findings:• There was no statistically significant excess risk from statin therapy for almost all the conditions listed in package leaflets as potential side effects.• Taking a statin did not cause any meaningful excess of memory loss or dementia, depression, sleep disturbance, erectile dysfunction, weight gain, nausea, fatigue or headache, and many other conditions.• There was a small increase in risk (about 0.1%) for liver blood test abnormalities. However, there was no increase in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver failure, indicating that the liver blood test changes do not typically lead to more serious liver problems.

Christina Reith, Associate Professor at Oxford Population Health and lead author of the study, said 'Statins are life-saving drugs used by hundreds of millions of people over the past 30 years. However, concerns about the safety of statins have deterred many people who are at risk of severe disability or death from a heart attack or stroke. Our study provides reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits of statins.'

Previous work by the same researchers established that most muscle symptoms are not caused by statins; statin therapy caused muscle symptoms in only 1% of people during the first year of treatment with no excess thereafter. It has also shown that statins can cause a small increase in blood sugar levels, so people already at high risk may develop diabetes sooner. 

These findings are hugely important and provide authoritative, evidence-based reassurance for patients. Statins are lifesaving drugs, which have been proven to protect against heart attacks and strokes. Among the large number of patients assessed in this well-conducted analysis, only four side effects out of 66 were found to have any association with taking statins, and only in a very small proportion of patients. 

This evidence is a much-needed counter to the misinformation around statins and should help prevent unnecessary deaths from cardiovascular disease. Recognizing which side effects might genuinely be associated with statins is also important as it will help doctors make decisions about when to use alternative treatments.'

Professor Bryan Williams, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at the British Heart Foundation

Professor Sir Rory Collins, Emeritus Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and senior author of the paper said 'Statin product labels list certain adverse health outcomes as potential treatment-related effects based mainly on information from non-randomised studies which may be subject to bias. We brought together all of the information from large randomised trials to assess the evidence reliably. Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.'

All of the trials included in the analyses were large-scale (involving at least 1,000 participants) and tracked patient outcomes for a median of nearly five years. The trials were double-blind, meaning that neither the trial participants nor those managing the participants or leading the study knew who was receiving which treatment, to avoid potential biases due to knowledge of treatment allocation. The list of possible side effects was compiled from those listed for the five most commonly prescribed statins.

The study was conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration, a joint initiative coordinated between the Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit, Oxford Population Health, and the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre, University of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of academic researchers representing major statin trials worldwide.The work was funded by the British Heart Foundation, UKRI Medical Research Council, and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The work of the CTT is overseen by an Independent Oversight Panel.

Accurate hearing thresholds can only be obtained in a suitably quiet environment. Subjects can misinterpret test stimuli when there is uncontrolled environmental noise, leading to invalid results or false responses.

It is possible to mitigate these interferences by controlling ambient noise within certain limits; however, this potentially makes the difference between a pass and a referral.

At its most basic level, monitoring ambient noise is measuring the amount of background noise in a hearing test environment. This enables improved diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Background noise can potentially interfere with test tones, artificially elevating hearing thresholds. Healthcare professionals may misdiagnose hearing loss or underestimate a subject's hearing ability. Monitoring noise levels can help maintain a controlled testing environment, enhancing the reliability of hearing assessments.

ISO (International Organization for Standardization), ANSI (American National Standards Institute), OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and other organizations set specific noise level requirements for audiometric testing environments. Monitoring your ambient noise during testing ensures you stay within these limits.

Should ambient noise be found to exceed acceptable levels, it will be possible to make adjustments by either testing in a sound booth, relocating the test to a noise-isolated area, using noise-reducing headphones, or rescheduling it for a quieter time.

Noise levels can fluctuate due to conversations, machinery, or outdoor sounds in non-clinical settings like workplace screenings. Continuous noise monitoring is key to ensuring test accuracy in these settings.

A sound level meter or sound room microphone is suitable for the monitoring of ambient noise, measuring frequency content in octave or third-octave bands. It is important to note, however, that a degree of ‘measurement uncertainty' may stem from sources such as equipment or the environment (ambient noise and distractions), or from the subject, method, or tester.

The British Society of Audiology states that “In general, the ambient noise should not exceed 35 dBA” (BSA, 2017). However, maximum permissible ambient sound pressure levels should be maintained in line with (SPL) - BS EN ISO 8253-1, with a number of factors requiring consideration.

Energy at low frequencies masks test tones at higher frequencies, resulting in a risk of noise. This phenomenon is typically referred to as the ‘upward spread of masking'.

Low-frequency test tones necessitate the use of a quieter test environment, while the 500 – 8000 kHz test tone range allows for more ambient noise. This tone range is used for surveillance audiometry.

Maximum permissible ambient SPLs are based on average earphone attenuation, with supra-aural earphones providing the least attenuation and, therefore, necessitating the use of a quieter test environment.

It is also important to note that some listeners will receive less than average attenuation.

It is possible to avoid exceeding noise limits by following a number of simple steps.

It is possible to monitor the test environment by adding a Sound Room Microphone (SRM) to the test process. This affords testers complete confidence in the quality of their audiometry results.

Amplivox offers several solutions that incorporate SRM technology.

The Anova™ provides unparalleled accuracy with the option of an external SRM. The microphone should be placed in the test environment, delivering live feedback to alert users if noise exceeds the ‘ideal level' for accurate measurements and ensuring the best possible test conditions.

The modelONE PC-based audiometer is also available, comprising noise-attenuating headphones and including a built-in SRM.

It is important to note that using an SRM does not remove the need to employ an IEC 61672 Class 2 microphone in line with guidance provided in the HSE L108 'Controlling Noise at Work' 2005 publication.

Drawing on 52 studies, this review challenges assumptions about athletic advantage between cis- and transgender athletes, while highlighting major evidence gaps in elite and sport-specific performance.

Study: Body composition and physical fitness in transgender versus cisgender individuals: a systematic review with meta-analysis. Image credit: Shutterstock.AI Generator/Shutterstock.com

Researchers have recently conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare body composition and physical fitness between transgender and cisgender individuals, and published their findings in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Transgender women are individuals assigned male at birth who identify and live as women, while cisgender women are those assigned female at birth whose gender identity aligns with that assignment. Women's sports exist separately to ensure fair competition for cisgender women. For years, the question of transgender women competing in female sports has sparked intense debate. This has led to proposals that transgender athletes should only compete if they don't create significant competitive imbalances.

Research has challenged some concerns that transgender women would dominate women's sports, largely because testosterone suppression therapy reduces certain physiological characteristics associated with male puberty. In fact, transgender women remain underrepresented in elite athletics, although the authors note that underrepresentation alone cannot be used to draw conclusions about competitive advantage.

The IOC established a framework prioritizing fairness, inclusion, and non-discrimination, rejecting blanket bans and advocating for sport-specific eligibility criteria. Critics argue this relies on insufficient research and impractical assessments, potentially compromising protections for cisgender female athletes.

Some researchers contend the IOC's ‘no presumption of advantage' principle overlooks studies suggesting transgender women may retain muscle mass, strength, and other physical characteristics after testosterone suppression. However, systematic reviews comparing transgender women who underwent gender-affirming hormone therapy and cisgender women have reported mixed and inconsistent findings, highlighting ongoing scientific uncertainty.

The current systematic review with meta-analysis examines existing research on body composition and physical fitness in transgender women compared to cisgender women, with secondary comparisons across other gender groups. It also examined how hormone therapy duration affects outcomes, compared responses between transgender men and women, and explored the impact of puberty suppression.

All relevant articles were obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus. Inclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing body composition or physical fitness pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy or versus cisgender controls.

The initial database search identified 1705 studies. After removing duplicates, 1067 publications were screened. A total of 52 studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in the review, and 43 in the meta-analysis. This analysis included 6485 individuals, 2943 transgender women, 2309 transgender men, 568 cisgender women, and 665 cisgender men.

All participants were between 14 and 41 years of age. Of 52 studies, only 16 assessed physical activity levels, and most did not control for activity status. The selected studies used different methods to assess physical activity, including METs (metabolic equivalents), questionnaires, measures of exercise frequency and duration, and simple activity classifications.

Study designs included 22 prospective cohorts, 9 retrospective cohorts, 17 cross-sectional studies, 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a quasi-experimental study. Only 7 studies adjusted for confounders, most commonly body composition, age, hormone levels, and nutrient intake.

A significant variation in hormone therapy types and dosages was noted. Transgender women primarily received estradiol, in the form of oral tablets, patches, or gel, often combined with antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. Transgender men primarily received testosterone undecanoate or enanthate via injection, with some using gels. Dosing varied by administration route, age, and clinical context.

Therapy duration ranged from 3 months to 14 years, with most studies following participants for 1–3 years. Twelve studies included participants who had undergone gender-affirming surgery, and six reported the use of puberty suppression.

Compared to cisgender women, transgender women showed no statistically significant differences in relative fat mass, relative lean mass, upper-body strength, lower-body strength, or aerobic capacity. However, the authors emphasized that the quality of evidence ranged from very low to low certainty, with substantial heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals in several analyses, limiting the precision of these estimates.

Despite having slightly higher relative lean mass than cisgender women (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19), transgender women showed no significant differences in upper-body strength (SMD 0.54) or lower-body strength (SMD 0.05). Aerobic capacity, measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂ max), was also not significantly different between groups. The authors stress that a lack of statistical significance does not imply identical performance, rather, it indicates that consistent differences were not detected in the available data.

After 1–3 years of hormone therapy, transgender women experienced increased fat mass and decreased lean mass and upper-body strength. The authors noted that, despite persistent differences in lean mass, these changes were not consistently associated with differences in functional performance, suggesting that lean mass alone may not directly translate into strength advantages.

The authors cautioned that lean mass and performance outcomes were often derived from different studies, preventing direct correlations between muscle mass and athletic performance. They also emphasized that the available data largely reflect non-athlete or recreationally active populations, rather than elite competitors.

Transgender men showed body composition and strength metrics that were intermediate between cisgender women and cisgender men for some outcomes, even after an average of four years of hormone therapy. However, the authors reported that transgender men continued to differ significantly from cisgender men in several measures, including relative lean mass and upper-body strength.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that while transgender women tend to have higher lean mass than cisgender women, they show no consistent or statistically significant differences in commonly measured physical fitness outcomes, such as strength and aerobic capacity, after 1–3 years of hormone therapy. The authors emphasize that these findings do not demonstrate equivalence in athletic performance and do not directly address sport-specific competition outcomes.

The authors highlighted substantial limitations in the available evidence. Most studies were small, lacked statistical adjustment for key confounders, and rarely assessed physical activity or training status. Elite athletes and sport-specific performance measures were largely absent from the literature.

The authors conclude that future research should include larger, well-controlled, longitudinal studies that follow transgender athletes over time, account for training history and competition level, and assess sport-specific performance outcomes. Such evidence is needed to inform nuanced, sport-specific eligibility policies rather than broad generalizations about advantage or disadvantage.

Antonia Seligowski, PhD, of the Neurocardiac Effects of Stress & Trauma Laboratory within the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, is the senior author of a paper published in JAMA Network Open, ""Hormonal contraceptive use, stress disorders, and cardiovascular and thrombotic risk in women.""

Q: What challenges or unmet needs make this study important?

Over 400,000 women in the United States die each year from cardiovascular disease (CVD), the nation's leading cause of death. Stress is a major risk factor for CVD, and stress‑related psychiatric disorders like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more common in women. Because of this, experts have called for more attention to be paid to sex‑specific factors that contribute to women's cardiovascular health.

One such factor is hormonal contraception, used by about 9.1 million women in the United States. Past research on these contraceptives-which work by introducing different amounts of hormones and suppressing natural estradiol and progesterone levels-has focused almost entirely on young, relatively healthy women. As a result, very little is known about how hormonal contraceptives affect women with stress‑related psychiatric disorders. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the combined effects of hormonal contraceptives and stress‑related disorders on cardiovascular or thrombosis risk. 

Q: What central question(s) were you investigating?

Our study, led by Jordan Thomas, PhD, of the University of Kansas, explored whether hormonal contraceptive use is linked to cardiovascular and thrombotic risk in women with and without stress‑related disorders. Specifically, we wanted to know if women with a history of depression, anxiety or PTSD who use hormonal contraceptives have a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or deep‑vein thrombosis than those without this mental health history.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We analyzed healthcare records from 31,824 women who consented to be part of the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Specifically, we looked for medical codes indicating diagnoses of stress‑related disorders, MACE and deep‑vein thrombosis, as well as prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives.

Q: What did you find? 

For the majority of women, including those with a history of anxiety or depression, hormonal contraceptive use was associated with lower risk of MACE. However, this protective association was not seen in women with PTSD.

Although preliminary, these findings suggest that cardiovascular risk may vary among women who use hormonal contraceptives-especially differing for those with PTSD. If future studies confirm these results, clinicians may need to consider stress‑related psychiatric disorders when discussing hormonal contraceptive options with patients.

Q: Tell us about any follow-up studies you have planned to validate or build on these findings.

We hope to conduct a clinical study that collects new data on how specific hormonal contraceptive formulas relate to CVD risk factors in women, including blood pressure, vascular endothelial function and blood‑based clotting markers. We also plan to test whether these effects differ for women with and without stress‑related psychiatric disorders. Participants would return yearly for follow‑up visits to track clinical outcomes such as thrombotic events.

Griffith University researchers are on the cusp of a new vaccine to prevent chikungunya, a global health threat which attacks human joint tissue.

Professor Bernd Rehm, from Griffith's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, said his team wanted to test whether they could engineer E.coli to assemble biopolymer particles which displayed chikungunya antigens and performed as a vaccine.

The synthetic biopolymer particles, adjuvant-free E2-BP-E1, closely mimicked the actual virus and induced an immune response.""

Professor Bernd Rehm, Griffith's Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics

The immune system recognized the particles as a virus but without induction of the disease.

It triggered a reaction in the body whereby immune cells very efficiently took up the biopolymer particles and engaged the immune system to mount an anti-virus response.

A person could become infected with chikungunya via an infected mosquito, causing the virus to enter the bloodstream and begin a multi-stage process affecting the immune system, joints, muscles, and sometimes the nervous system.

Symptoms included fever, chills, a feeling of intense illness, severe joint and muscle pain, headache, rash and joint swelling.

Professor Rehm said once the infection took hold, chikungunya would specifically target joint tissues, muscle fibres and connective tissue.

""Once this occurs, we start to see direct tissue damage, intense inflammation, and immune-mediated attacks resembling autoimmune responses,"" he said.

""Even more concerning, is that the immune system continues to attack joint tissues even after the virus has left the body.

""Up to 60 per cent of patients experience long-lasting joint pain, which may persist for months or years, and can resemble rheumatoid arthritis.""

Following the success of the study, Professor Rehm and his team would progress to the clinical development of the vaccine.

The next stage would entail a clinical trial whereby patients would test the vaccine's safety before moving on to efficacy trials.

The paper 'Adjuvant-free biopolymer particles mimicking the Chikungunya virus surface induce protective immunity' has been published in Biomaterials.

A new global analysis links rising disease burden to plastics' full lifecycle, showing why reducing virgin plastic output is the fastest path to protecting human health.

 Image Credit: Global health burdens of plastics: a lifecycle assessment model from 2016 to 2040. Image Credit: Bugra Kaan Ersoy / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in The Lancet Planetary Health suggests that global health burdens associated with plastic systems could double by 2040 without immediate and coordinated action.

The mismanagement of plastics throughout the world leads to excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that significantly contribute to climate change, as well as human health complications like respiratory diseases, cancers, and other non-communicable diseases.

Pollutants can be released at any stage of the plastic lifecycle, from fossil fuel extraction and refining through manufacturing, use, and end-of-life management. Because most plastics are derived from oil and gas feedstocks, emissions from primary plastic production account for a dominant share of plastics-related health burdens. Global transportation, recycling, waste management, and gradual environmental degradation of plastics also significantly contribute to plastics-related emissions.

Previous studies have used systems-based modelling, including material flow analysis (MFA) and lifecycle assessment (LCA), to evaluate the plastics system and its environmental and health effects. MFA quantifies the flow of plastic materials through sectors and regions, whereas LCA provides a systematic approach to assess plastics-related environmental and health effects across their lifecycles.

In the current study, researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, University of Toulouse, and University of Exeter use a hybrid MFA and LCA approach to estimate and compare the adverse health outcomes associated with GHGs, air pollutants, and chemical emissions across the lifecycle of the most common, predominantly single-use plastics found in municipal solid waste, under different global scenarios between 2016 and 2040. These plastics represent approximately 64% of global plastics production. To this end, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were quantified to assess the number of healthy years of life lost due to GHGs, air pollutants, and toxic chemicals emitted across the life cycle of plastics at a global scale.

Under a ‘business as usual' scenario, a hypothetical situation in which the plastics system continues with no change to policy, economics, infrastructure, materials, or consumer behaviors, annual health adversities could increase from 2.1 million DALYs in 2016 to 4.5 million DALYs by 2040. These findings corresponded to a cumulative 83 million DALYs between 2016 and 2040 due to the global plastic system.

The potential impact of alternative global scenarios with different plastic management approaches on health burdens was also assessed. Specifically, efforts to increase plastic waste collection or recycling in isolation can only modestly reduce the global health burdens compared with strategies that reduce primary plastic production.

As compared to the ‘business as usual' estimate, the global health burden of plastics can be reduced by 43% in 2040 by combining all measures in a full plastics system. These measures include reducing primary plastic production, improving waste collection and disposal, recycling, and replacing specific plastics with alternative materials and reuse systems.

However, even after combining all measures, the global health burden of plastics persists over time. Further analysis suggests that the effects of the plastics industry on climate change and air pollution could be reduced to some extent by shifting to renewable energy; however, this approach alone is insufficient to address other harmful aspects of plastic production and waste management.

Emissions from primary plastic production are the leading cause of global health burden across all scenarios. Open burning of plastic waste also remains a substantial contributor under business-as-usual conditions. Thus, the greatest health benefits could be achieved by reducing plastic production without necessarily substituting plastics for other materials.

The global health burden of plastics could double by 2040 if immediate action is not taken to reduce GHG emissions, which, combined with subsequent climate change effects, account for the largest share of modeled health burdens. Among other plastics-related hazards, air pollution primarily originating from plastic production processes accounts for a substantial share of health burdens, whereas toxic chemicals released to the environment from gradual plastic degradation contribute a further significant share, with exact proportions varying by scenario and year.

Reduced water availability, disruption of the ozone layer, and increased ionizing radiation collectively contribute to the remaining health burdens, which are less than 1% of the total burden.

The current study demonstrates that emissions from primary plastics production dominate total modeled health burdens across all scenarios. Because the analysis excludes direct health impacts from chemical exposure during product use and from micro- and nanoplastics pollution due to data limitations, the authors note that these estimates are likely conservative.

Thus, there remains an urgent need for immediate, effective actions to reduce plastic production and significantly improve public health outcomes. Coordinated policies among nations that address shared challenges related to plastic pollution, climate change, and global health are also warranted to protect human and planetary health.

The current trajectory is not tenable but we have real, feasible alternatives. Global action that centers on substantial, collective reductions to plastics production...is needed at scale to protect people and planet.

Programs that match caregivers with patient navigators yield better outcomes than Alzheimer's drug – but combining the two may be best. 

A Medicare-covered program that offers support and medical advice for caregivers of patients with dementia may bring more benefit than a costly Alzheimer's medication, new research finds. 

UC San Francisco researchers compared outcomes for patients in collaborative care programs with those taking lecanemab, one of two approved drugs that have been shown to slow progression of Alzheimer's in some patients. 

UCSF Health was an early leader in developing a collaborative care program with the Care Ecosytem, which supports patients and caregivers. Paid navigators coordinate with clinical teams and connect caregivers to community resources. The program has informed similar efforts and has been adopted and adapted by more than 50 health systems nationwide. 

Collaborative care improved quality of life, reduced costs, alleviated caregiver burden, and extended the time that patients remained in the community before entering a nursing facility, as compared to lecanemab. Results were published Feb. 5 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: Behavior and Socioeconomics of Aging. 

The researchers created a simulated cohort of 1,000 patients using data from previous studies. About half had mild Alzheimer's and half had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which precedes it. Replacing usual care with collaborative care gave patients an extra 0.26 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a measure that reflects living longer in better health. When lecanemab was added to collaborative care, patients gained another 0.16 QALYs. 

Collaborative care can serve a broader population than medication, said first author Kelly J. Atkins, DPsych, formerly of the UCSF Fein Memory and Aging Center. 

Lecanemab is only indicated for patients with mild Alzheimer's and MCI, but collaborative programs can be used for more advanced disease, as well as for the 20% to 40% of patients with other types of dementia. The drug may also be out of reach for rural residents living far from specialty clinics, and for low-income patients struggling to manage out-of-pocket costs."" 

Kelly J. Atkins, DPsych

The researchers found adding lecanemab to treatment increased health care costs by $38,400, but this was offset by adding collaborative care. The latter saved $48,000 per patient, partially due to fewer hospital visits. Patients also had, on average, four more months at home before transitioning to a nursing home when they received collaborative care. 

""We're going to see more drugs and better drugs soon, and I think that's very exciting. But we can'tjust focus on the drugs, we need to rethink our system of care,"" said Professor Katherine L. Possin, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Neurology and the Fein Memory and Aging Center. ""Clinics that integrate collaborative care with the drugs may be best positioned to meet the needs of patients in this new treatment era.""

The Ball is Round. The Place is Philly.

The United States' Men's Under-17 National Team began its 2026 World Cup Qualifying campaign with a dominant 8-0 victory against Saint Vincent & the Grenadines. 

The match was the USA's first step toward qualifying for the 2026 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar, which will feature 48 teams and will be staged this coming November. Eight group winners from across Concacaf will qualify for the tournament, and the U.S. is aiming for a record 20th appearance on the world stage. The winner of each group advances to the 48-team Under-17 World Cup in a process that runs annually, allowing more players to be involved. 

In these CONCACAF youth qualifiers, it is very important to build a somewhat ridiculous goal differential over the weaker sides in the group. Last year, the US U-17s beat the US Virgin Islands 22-0. 

With the new calendar year, the team consists of players born on or after January 1, 2009. 

Philadelphia Union II's Malik Jakupovic and Union Academy goalkeeper Matthew White are a part of the camp. Union II's Willyam Ferreria was named as an alternate and participated in training ahead of the matches. PSP colleague Tim Jones' visit to Union II training on February 2nd confirmed that Ferreira returned to Philadelphia and most likely has traveled to Clearwater with the rest of the available Union II team. 

As anticipated, the opening minutes were marked by a barrage of attacking pressure from the United States, which found the opener through a half volley by the LA Galaxy's Aaron Medina in the sixth minute. PSV Eindhoven's William Ostrander had the assist with a selfless header played to the forward from within the six-yard box. 

Medina had a second in the 15th minute on the end of a low ball by San Jose's KK Spivey, but the goal was called an own goal by Saint Vincent's Damarion Peterson. 

Medina's brace came in the 29th minute, when Ostrander collected a ball spilled by Saint Vincent's keeper, David Butler, and played it centrally to make it 3-0. Medina was calm with the right-footed tap-in. 

The forward earned his hat trick in the 37th minute with a headed goal on the end of a cross from his Galaxy teammate Max Steelman. Ostrander played the long ball across the pitch for the secondary assist. 

Saint Vincent had a few hopeful attacking chances, but all of them sputtered out as soon as they were able to get the ball into the United States' defensive third. 

Saint Vincent's Jolanson Charles saw the first booking of the match for a hard challenge on Liam Vejrostek at midfield. 

Ostrander almost made it five in stoppage time, but his shot somehow came off the inside of the post and into the hands of the Saint Vincent keeper. 

Saint Vincent made two changes at the break. 

The United States got the fifth through Red Bull New York's Paul Sokoloff after some technical dribbling by Ostrander on the left wing. 

Following that goal, Malik Jakupovic and Mattheo Dimareli entered for Medina and Ostrander.

Sokoloff scored again with a header on a well-taken corner kick by Dimareli, who had just entered. 

Malik Jakupovic scored his inevitable goal on a free kick played in by Sokoloff to make it seven. After that one, Sokoloff and Steelman made way for Vincente Garcia and Myles Gardner. 

Jakupovic made it eight in the 87th thanks to a low cross by Myles Gardner. 

The U17MNT will play its next qualifying match in two days against Saint Kitts and Nevis, on Saturday, February 7th, at 7 PM EST. The match will be available live on FS2. They finish the qualifying against the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, February 10th at 1 PM.

A huge slate of matches this weekend

There is a huge slate of matches this weekend, despite AC Milan and Christian Pulisic having the weekend off, and includes matches across the top and bottom of all the major European leagues as well as some head-to-head matches. In addition to Milan being off there are some injury watch areas that will impact viewing opportunities so keep an eye out for those. The action starts on Friday afternoon with a matchup between a couple teams looking to distance themselves from the relegation fray.

Leeds United v Nottingham Forest - 3p on USA Network: Brenden Aaronson started and went 71' in Leeds 4-0 defeat to league leading Arsenal last weekend. Leeds are now level with this weekend's opponent, Nottingham Forest, who picked up a point in their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace last weekend. Leeds and Forest both have 26 points, which give them a six point lead over West Ham United who are currently in the final relegation spot. Friday's match is a true relegation zone six pointer and Leeds will be looking to avenge their September loss as they host Forest.

St. Pauli v Stuttgart - 9:30a on ESPN Select: James Sands and St. Pauli fell to Augsburg 2-1 last weekend and are now five points back of Werder Bremen for safety, four back of Mainz for the relegation playoff spot. Sands did start and go the full 90' picking up his fourth yellow card of the season in stoppage time. St. Pauli have just three wins through twenty matches with only one of those victories coming in the last four and a half months.

Heidenheim v Hamburger - 9:30a on ESPN Select: After starting his first three matches with Hamburger Damion Downs was unavailable last weekend due to a calf injury as his team played Bayern Munich to a 2-2 draw. Hamburger face a Heidenheim side who are dead last and have given up a league leading 45 goals but it's uncertain if Downs will be available to try to take advantage of the matchup.

Wolfsburg v Borussia Dortmund - 9:30a on ESPN Select: Kevin Paredes missed last weekends match though he had been reported to be “back in full swing” the day prior to the match after also missing out two weeks ago due to illness. There were transfer rumors around the player whose contract expires in June so perhaps it was a precaution. Wolfsburg fell to Koln 1-0 and are now just one point clear of Mainz in the relegation playoff position. They host second place Borussia Dortmund who trail Bayern Munich by six points after gaining five points on them over the past two weekends.

Mainz v Augsburg - 9:30a on ESPN Select: Lennard Maloney and Mainz will host Noahkai Banks and Augsburg on Saturday morning. Maloney played nearly 20' off the bench last weekend in Mainz's 2-1 win over fourth place Leipzig. The win was Mainz's third in four matches as the nine points doubled what they had picked up in their first sixteen matches of the season. They remain in sixteenth place, the relegation playoff position, a point back of a trio of teams for safety. Augsburg is also headed in the right direction over the last couple weeks with back-to-back wins over Bayern Munich and St. Pauli to pick up six points and move four points clear of Mainz in the relegation playoff spot. A week after serving a yellow card accumulation suspension and missing Augsburg's 2-1 over Bayern, Banks was back in the starting lineup and picking up yet another yellow.

Fulham v Everton - 10a on Peacock: Antonee Robinson remains with Fulham, and Ricardo Pepi was not brought in after a curious decision to PSV not to let the injured player go because they couldn't line up a replacement. Robinson and Fulham fell to suddenly hot Manchester United 3-2 last weekend with Robinson getting the start and playing 71'. Fulham dropped to ninth place with the loss and will take on an Everton side that are in tenth and tied with them on 34 points.

Coventry City v Oxford United - 9:01a on CBSSN: Haji Wright came off the bench last Saturday as Coventry City fell to QPR 2-1, it was their second straight loss this season and fourth in seven matches as they are now tied with Middlesbrough for the top spot in the league. The two teams with Americans are four points ahead of Hull City for automatic promotion to the EPL. Coventry will take on an Oxford United side that are ahead of only Sheffield Wednesday in the table. If you haven't been following along Sheffield Wednesday are at negative seven points through thirty matches thanks to a pair of points deduction rulings totaling 18 points. That doesn't have a direct impact on any USMNT players but what an odd table it makes.

Borussia Monchengladbach v Bayer Leverkusen - 12:30p on ESPN Select: Joe Scally and Borussia Monchengladbach played Werder Bremen to a 1-1 draw last weekend while Gio Reyna watched from the sidelines as he suffers through injury yet again. Reyna has missed the past two matches due to another muscle strain and it's unclear when he will be available again. Scally and Gladbach will host Bayer Leverkusen and fellow American Malik Tillman. Tillman scored the second of Leverkusen's three goals last weekend in the team's 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Leverkusen are in sixth place in the league standings, four points back of fourth place Stuttgart with a game in hand.

Real Sociedad v Elche - 3:00p on ESPN Select: Pellegrino Matarazzo's Real Sociedad played Atheltic Club to a 1-1 draw last weekend and defeated Deportivo Alaves in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals on Wednesday as Sociedad remains undefeated since Matarazzo took the helm. Eighth place Sociedad will host thirteenth place Elche who are just two points out of the relegation zone in a very crowded lower half of the La Liga table. just four points separate the ten teams from 9th to 18th place with 18th representing the final relegation spot. Sociedad are themselves just two points ahead of that group and six points out of 18th themselves despite the recent run of success since Matarazzo took over.

Nantes v Olympique Lyon - 3:05p on beIN Sports: Tanner Tessmann and Lyon defeated fifth place Lille to pull seven points ahead of them and level with Marseille in the Ligue 1 standings. It was the fifth straight league victory for Lyon who now travel to face sixteenth place Nantes who have just 14 points through their first 20 matches of the season and have lost three straight matches.



Brighton & Hove Albion v Crystal Palace - 9a on Telemundo: Chris Richards and Crystal Palace were unable to stop their winless streak on Monday as they settled for a 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest. It has been ten matches for Palace since their last win as they have slid to fifteenth place in the league standings though they are still nine points clear of 18th place West Ham.

Nice v Monaco - 9a on beIN sports: Folarin Balogun picked up an assist in Monaco's 4-0 win over Stade Rennais last weekend. Balogun still hasn't scored since November and has just four goals on the season but it was his second assist in the past four matches. The win also snapped a five match winless streak for Monaco and kept them in the top ten of the league standings. The team will travel to Nice on Sunday to take on the 13th place side who

Koln v RB Leipzig - 9:30a on ESPN Select: Kristoffer Lund started again for Koln on Friday as they defeated Wolfsburg 1-0. Koln have won two of three and are in tenth place as they prepare to host fifth place RB Leipzig who are looking to bounce back after a 2-1 loss to Mainz.

Groningen v PSV - 10:45a on ESPN Select: Sergino Dest and PSV solidified their hold on the Eredivisie title race with a decisive 3-0 win over second place Feyenoord to increase their league lead to seventeen points with thirteen matches to go in the season. The seventeen point lead is what makes Ricardo Pepi's abandoned transfer to Fulham even more curious though there are rumors that he could be returning more quickly than originally thought. PSV's opponent this weekend is 8th place Groningen who have lost their past two matches.

Angers v Toulouse - 11:15a on beIN Sports: Mark McKenzie and Toulouse were held to a scoreless draw by 17th place Auxerre last weekend and remain in eighth place as they visit 11th place Angers this weekend. McKenzie has started all but three matches for Toulouse this season who have given up 23 goals through 20 matches which is the fifth best scoring defense in the league.

Atletico Madrid v Real Betis - 12:30p on ESPN Deportes and ESPN Select: Johnny Cardoso picked up a minor knock in training and missed out on Atletico Madrid's 5-0 beat down of his old team, Real Betis, in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals on Thursday. Atletico will now face Betis in a league match on Sunday though Cardoso will likely miss out yet again though his injury isn't expected to keep him out for an extended period.

PSG v Olympique Marseille - 2:45p on beIN Sports: Tim Weah has started eight straight matches for Marseille who drew with Paris FC 2-2 last weekend. The draw dropped Marseille into a draw with Lyon which is significant as the top three in Ligue 1 automatically qualify for the Champions League. Marseille will take on league leading Paris Saint-Germain this weekend who have won six straight league matches. PSG hold a two point lead over Lens for the league lead and have a nine point advantage over Marseille.

Juventus v Lazio - 2:45p on Paramount+: Weston McKennie scored again for Juventus on Monday in the teams 4-1 win over Parma. It was the third goal of the calendar year for McKennie who was playing as the 10 for Juve who moved into the top four in the Serie A standings. They will take on eighth place Lazio who are coming off a 3-2 win over Genoa.

As World Cup ticket prices soar, an industry expert warns that FIFA's premium-first pricing strategy risks empty stadiums, alienated fans, and a tournament that feels increasingly out of reach for the supporters who give the World Cup its meaning.

The noise around World Cup ticket prices is getting louder by the day, as fans race against the clock to organize flights, find places to stay, and secure seats in the stadium. For many, FIFA's push into the U.S. market feels less like a celebration of the game and more like a hard sell, leaving a growing sense of frustration among traditional supporters. With dynamic pricing and third-party resellers driving costs higher, the overall expense quickly spirals out of control.

Including inflated accommodation prices, along with flights that can reach close to $2,000 per ticket from countries like Uruguay, a family of four can easily be looking at a $15,000 outlay before even arriving in the host nation. That reality raises an uncomfortable question: who is the World Cup really being priced for? It is clearly no longer designed for the die-hard fan, but instead for a “be there at any cost” audience, effectively locking many supporters out of attending matches.

At present, face-value group stage tickets generally range from around $140 to well over $2,700, while seats for the final stretch from roughly $4,185 to nearly $8,700.

This approach stands in stark contrast to UEFA's strategy for EURO 2028, which is built around transparency, fixed pricing, and broad access. By delaying sales until the draw is complete, reserving over 40% of tickets in the lowest price categories, banning dynamic pricing and limiting resale to face value, UEFA is offering a clear alternative to the World Cup's increasingly exclusive ticketing model.

Urban Pitch spoke with Jim McCarthy, CEO of Impresario Strategic, a veteran of more than 25 years in live event ticket sales who specializes in helping football clubs boost attendance and revenue through tailored, multi-year strategies. McCarthy currently works with clubs across Scotland, Australia, and the United States, focusing on understanding each market's specific dynamics while refining pricing models, venue configuration, and the overall fan experience.

In our conversation, McCarthy addresses growing concerns around the FIFA World Cup's expanded format and elevated ticket prices, particularly for lower-profile group stage matches that risk empty seats and weakened atmosphere. He believes FIFA has misread early-stage demand by pricing too aggressively, a sharp contrast to later rounds where interest and scarcity naturally support premium pricing.

Urban Pitch: In your view, what did FIFA get wrong with their World Cup ticket pricing?

Jim McCarthy: FIFA's main mistake with World Cup ticketing was treating the entire tournament as if every match carried final-level demand. With more than 100 games in an expanded format, only the later rounds truly justify premium pricing. While finals and semifinals will always sell at high prices due to limited supply and massive demand, many group stage and Round of 32 matches simply don't have that same pull.

By setting high prices early on, FIFA failed to properly account for the real market value of lower-profile games. Asking fans to pay hundreds of dollars for non-marquee group matches is unrealistic for most supporters and doesn't reflect actual demand. As a result, unless prices adjust, the risk is clear: empty seats in the early stages, weaker atmospheres, and a tournament that looks less full until the later rounds, when demand naturally takes over.

Would that not be a major failure for the United States, given how much they hyped this World Cup and how in 1994, every match was sold out?

I think it's critical that this doesn't happen, which is why FIFA needs to keep adjusting its approach. From what I can tell, some changes are already being made, but those adjustments will have to continue across the board to better reflect reality. The challenge is that application numbers don't always translate into actual ticket purchases, and without full transparency, it's hard to know how strong real demand truly is.

If we look at the recent Club World Cup as a reference point, the parallels are clear. It was a relatively new tournament in the U.S., pricing was set aggressively, and the outcome was uneven: a handful of matches drew massive crowds, while many others were played in front of large sections of empty seats. I personally attended PSG vs. Atlético Madrid at the Rose Bowl with over 80,000 fans, and the atmosphere was fantastic, but plenty of other games simply didn't generate that level of interest.

The expanded 48-team World Cup carries a similar risk. We've never seen a group stage this spread out in terms of quality and traditional rivalries, and there's no real “group of death” this time around. While it's great to see more nations represented, the reality is that many group-stage matchups will be less compelling to the average fan. People do want to attend World Cup matches, but not at any price.

At the end of the day, no organization is bigger than the market. You can't force demand where it doesn't exist, and if pricing is off, fans will simply stay away. That's why further adjustments feel inevitable as the tournament approaches — because FIFA cannot afford a World Cup where empty seats become a recurring image, especially in the early stages.

Even if prices go down, logistically, travel could be a nightmare for people coming overseas or traveling within the United States, who need to secure tickets, accommodations, and in many cases airfare. Is the tournament losing time to get these issues resolved?

Yes, I agree completely, and I don't think the approach they took was the right one. If it were up to me, I would have done the opposite: start with lower prices and gradually raise them where demand clearly justified it. That way, you can test the market in a controlled way: release a small amount of inventory for a match like Paraguay vs. Australia, see what sells and what doesn't, and adjust accordingly. If certain sections move quickly, you raise prices slightly; if others lag, you lower them. That kind of measured, data-driven approach can be done well in advance and gives you a much clearer read on real demand.

What makes this even more important is that World Cup ticket buying isn't like selling a normal match. Fans are also weighing flights, accommodation, and time off work, so pricing has to account for much bigger logistical and financial decisions. That's why I believe the overall pricing strategy has been flawed, unless, of course, tickets are selling far better than it appears, which I don't think is the case. Looking back at the Club World Cup, the same pattern emerged: not every match struggled, but many could have performed far better with a smarter mix of pricing, stadium selection and kickoff times.

Venue, schedule, and price, work together to determine whether crowds show up, and in a tournament like the World Cup, full stadiums matter. The atmosphere, the global image and the sense of occasion are all part of what makes the World Cup special, and empty seats undermine that. With the Club World Cup, the priority should have been filling stadiums to build momentum, history, and emotional buy-in for a new competition, rather than chasing premium prices too early. To FIFA's credit, attendance improved as the tournament progressed and the matchups became more attractive, but they clearly underestimated how much certain teams drive demand, and how much that should influence pricing from the start.

From McCarthy's point of view, the takeaway is straightforward: treating the World Cup as a premium product from the very start is a risky strategy. A tournament with more than 100 matches requires a far more balanced approach, one that clearly separates the true marquee moments from early group stage games with more limited appeal. When prices don't reflect that reality, the risk goes beyond unsold tickets — it leads to empty seats that dilute the atmosphere, weaken the television product, and strip away some of the emotion that defines the World Cup.

That concern feels even sharper given how central this tournament has been positioned to the growth of the sport in the United States. Yet current pricing appears to do little to include the everyday fans who regularly attend MLS matches or follow the game week in and week out. With travel costs already stretching budgets, especially for international supporters, the margin for error is shrinking fast. As McCarthy emphasizes, fans are willing to show up when pricing, logistics, and value align. In the end, full stadiums matter more than squeezing out maximum revenue, and if FIFA hopes to recapture the spirit of 1994, a more flexible, market-aware ticketing strategy isn't just advisable, it's necessary.

La Liga

Carvajal has only spent one season away from Madrid, when he was at Bayer Leverkusen Pedro Loureiro/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images

To talk about Dani Carvajal is to talk about the history of Real Madrid.

The right-back joined their La Fabrica academy aged 10 in 2002. In May 2004, he laid the first stone of the Valdebebas training ground alongside club legend Alfredo di Stefano.

He has spent 23 years at Madrid and could become the player with the most Champions League titles in history if he wins his seventh. The 34-year-old could also complete a clean sweep of career trophies if he adds the World Cup with Spain this summer.

But with his contract running out at the end of June, his future at Madrid is up in the air.

Sources within the club and close to the player, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, have discussed the situation with The Athletic.

He has been key to winning six Champions Leagues (an achievement shared by only four others in history: Paco Gento, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Nacho Fernandez). He has won 27 titles with Madrid, including four La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey twice.

Carvajal has been a reliable asset in defence and attack in his 438 appearances across 12 full seasons with the first team and has been described by those in the dressing room as a great leader.

As captain, and due to his personality, he commands respect from the squad. This includes rivals for the right-back position, such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, who holds him in high esteem.

Carvajal is described by the same sources as a model of leadership that is being lost with the ongoing transition at Madrid. New leaders, such as Federico Valverde, are described as less talkative and softer.

His importance has been heightened by the lack of leadership since the departure of legends such as Karim Benzema, Kroos and Modric over the past three years.

Carvajal's career path — he was sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012, but Madrid took advantage of a buyback clause to bring him home the following year after an impressive campaign in Germany — has even given rise to a shorthand term for others doing the same: the via Carvajal (the Carvajal route).

In recent weeks, sources close to the captain have expressed some doubts and described a possible contract renewal as complicated, because he has not fully recovered physically in the last two seasons.

Carvajal tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a match against Villarreal in October 2024 and had an operation that same month, with Madrid also renewing his contract by a year to June 2026.

A few weeks later, according to those close to him, he said he was feeling like a “bull”. He was advised to take it easy, but he was set on recovering in time to play in last summer's Club World Cup. In the end, he only featured for 19 minutes from the bench in Madrid's 4-0 semi-final defeat by Paris Saint-Germain.

This season, Carvajal finally recovered fully to return to his regular starting position. Sources close to him said they expected him to be a starter, despite Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool. However, the captain suffered two injuries (one to his calf and the other to his knee) that have prevented him from playing consistently, and he has only appeared in 10 matches (470 minutes).

Sources from the staff of former head coach Xabi Alonso, who was sacked last month, praise Carvajal for his physique and dedication, but say they see him as a player who can take time to recover fully from injury.

Under Alonso's replacement, Alvaro Arbeloa, Carvajal has yet to start (he has only played 18 minutes against Albacete in the Copa del Rey and 14 minutes against Monaco in the Champions League). However, his former team-mate and now coach has always defended his value in public and in private.

“With Carvajal, my main objective is for him to have continuity,” said Arbeloa at the press conference before Madrid's match against Rayo Vallecano on January 30. “My goal is for him to have that continuity in training, to be able to accumulate minutes, and to not suffer a relapse from injury.”

After the game, which Madrid won 2-1, Carvajal posted an Instagram story of himself training and left the following message: “Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to maintain a good attitude while waiting.” He has been in training since January 4 and expects to return to the starting XI eventually.

According to sources close to the player, it is too early to make a decision about his future. He would like to continue at Madrid and is waiting for the club to get in contact, and he thinks there will not be any issues with a renewal.

The club describes him as an “institution”. That is why they do not consider it a standard renewal, and he would not have to wait to talk to the club at the end of the season. They insist any decision will be a “mutual agreement”.

Last Christmas, Carvajal and his family visited his brother-in-law and former Madrid striker Joselu, who plays for Al Gharafa in Qatar. Although Carvajal was welcomed and presented with a shirt, various sources close to the Madrid captain deny that he has agreed a deal to join Al Gharafa.

In an interview with The Athletic just before his serious injury in 2024, Carvajal acknowledged for the first time that the United States, Qatar and Saudi Arabia could be his next step. In principle, this remains his idea, but only if he cannot continue at Madrid. He would also not want to end up at a club that could possibly face Madrid.

So, with all options still on the table, we will see in the coming months what the future holds for one of Madrid's iconic players of modern times.

Minnesota United have this Friday completed the signing of former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich star and 2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodríguez. James has been a free agent since he left Club León in December. The Liga MX club signed the 34-year-old playmaker on a free transfer from Rayo Vallecano in January 2025. James managed five goals and nine assists in 34 games across all competitions for Léon. Léon signed James for the FIFA Club World Cup, but the Liga MX club was banned from the competition due to multiple-club ownership ties.

Club Léon was just the latest chapter in James' colorful club career. After playing for European giants Real Madrid and Bayern, James bounced around several clubs, turning out for Everton, Al-Rayyan, Olympiacos, São Paulo, Rayo Vallecano, and León. Minnesota United have become the seventh club since 2020. But since graduating from the Banfield academy, James has remained prolific, scoring 127 goals and 161 assists in 516 club games.

I'm looking forward to meeting all of the passionate Minnesota fans because I'm also a passionate player who wants to give everything on the field and always wants to win.”
 

“James is a player whose quality, vision, and experience at the highest levels of the game are unquestioned. We're excited to add his creativity and football intelligence to our group. At the same time, this move is about collective strength — not about putting everything on one individual,” said MNUFC Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Khaled El-Ahmad. “We believe that within our structure, culture, James can add an important dimension to the team. Our focus is on integrating him the right way and ensuring he contributes in a way that elevates the group. We're confident that, together, we can create something impactful for our community, club and our fans.”
James to Minnesota United: Remains crucial for Colombia
Although he has at times lacked consistency for his club teams in recent years, James has remained tremendous for Colombia. James was crucial for Colombia as he led his country to the 2024 Copa América final, where they lost narrowly to Lionel Messi's Argentina (5-4 on pens). Overall, James has scored 31 goals in 122 games for Colombia and remains his country's biggest star. That last part isn't a factor that should be underestimated. James' star power alone could make the midfielder a worthy investment for the Loons.

He shone most for Colombia at the 2014 World Cup, where he scored six goals in five games as Colombia reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Brazil.

Kindly share this story:

Super Eagles midfielder, Alex Iwobi, has said Nigeria still harbours hopes of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup despite the uncertainty surrounding the team's campaign.
Speaking during an interview on SuperSport Football on Thursday, the 29-year-old reflected on the emotional toll of the qualification race and the dilemma facing the team if forced to choose between continental success and a World Cup ticket.
Asked whether Nigeria would trade an Africa Cup of Nations triumph for qualification to the global showpiece, Iwobi said the decision was complicated by the contrasting experiences within the squad.
He said, “I mean, we're still waiting, hopefully we can go to the World Cup.  




“But I feel it's a tough one. It's a tough one because winning AFCON is like… It's a great legacy, it's a great thing to have, like in your career, a memorable moment.
“But then at the same time, because I've been to the World Cup already, a lot of the players haven't been. They would like to say ‘I want to go to the World Cup,' so I can't be selfish and say win the AFCON and for my teammates to not go to the World Cup. So it's a tough one.”
Iwobi, who was part of Nigeria's squad at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, said the desire of many players to experience football's biggest stage weighed heavily on the team's collective mindset.          Related News  18 Senegalese supporters held after AFCON final start hunger strike  M23 Congo airport attack may be terrorism, African Union says  Kanu, Okocha, Amokachi set for African Legends match in Abuja   
The comments come as Nigeria's AFCON 2025 campaign, held in Morocco from December 2025 to January 2026, ended with the Super Eagles exiting before the final.
Nigeria's exit from the World Cup qualifiers followed a 1–1 draw with DR Congo in the playoff final in Rabat, but the Leopards advanced after winning 4–3 on penalties to earn a place in the inter-confederation playoffs set for March 2026.
The NFF lodged a protest with FIFA alleging that several DR Congo players were ineligible under the eligibility rules.
DR Congo's football authorities rejected the claims, saying all players were cleared to play by FIFA, and urged that the result be respected.
As of late January, the petition was still under review by FIFA, with supporters holding out hope that a ruling could reopen Nigeria's path to the finals, potentially by disqualifying DR Congo should eligibility breaches be upheld.
Officials at the NFF are understood to be awaiting a response from the world football governing body, even as uncertainty continues to surround Nigeria's route to the 2026 tournament.

Iwobi, who was part of Nigeria's squad at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, said the desire of many players to experience football's biggest stage weighed heavily on the team's collective mindset.

A coalition of immigrant and civil rights groups issued a travel alert for international tourists traveling to the United States, ""particularly in Florida,"" warning that their rights, liberty, and physical security could potentially be in danger.

The coalition includes the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the American Friends Service Committee, the Family Action Network Movement, and Semillas de Colombia. The travel alert, which was issued on Wednesday, Feb. 4, advised people to ""reconsider travel to the state.""

The alert was issued in response to what the groups called multiple cases of tourists and U.S. citizens being detained for immigration enforcement purposes. The statewide travel alert is primarily focused on FIFA World Cup fans who are considering coming to Florida for the matches this year.

“Florida is no longer a safe destination for international tourists,"" said Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition. ""When federal and local agents can detain anyone at anytime without cause and without identifying themselves, everyone is at risk.""

Petit added, ""International visitors must ask themselves if a soccer match is worth the risk of being kidnapped and jailed until God-knows-when, in deplorable conditions, by a secret police who is using racial profiling, judging people for how they look or their accent, and getting away with literal murder in the streets of our country.""

The immigrant and civil rights groups are concerned about international fans planning to travel to Florida for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which begins in June.

Throngs of soccer fans from around the world are expected to descend on the United States for the various matches, including seven scheduled in South Florida.

The groups said ""enforcement tactics threaten to place international fans and delegations at risk — especially people of color, visitors from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and dual-nationals who could be targeted or questioned without cause.""

The advisory urges travelers to:

Civil rights leaders gathered outside FIFA's offices near Miami on Thursday, Feb. 5, warning international travelers that “Florida is no longer safe” and calling on the sports organization to take action against recent immigration tactics before the World Cup.

During the news conference, speakers stopped short of calling for a boycott of FIFA but instead encouraged the organization to take action before the June matches begin.

The Florida games will be held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. They include key group stage matches featuring Portugal vs. Colombia, Saudi Arabia vs. Uruguay, and Uruguay vs. Cape Verde in June.

The state will also host group stage clashes, such as Brazil vs. Scotland, plus a Round of 32 match, a quarterfinal game, and the third-place match in July.

Mark Pieth, a Swiss attorney who chaired an oversight committee on FIFA reform, has urged fans to skip the World Cup.

""There's only one piece of advice for fans,"" he told the Swiss newspaper Der Bund. ""Stay away from the USA! You'll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. If they're lucky.""

Sepp Blatter, the ex-FIFA president, wrote on social media, ""I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.""

Trump touts record-breaking ticket sales ahead of World Cup

A group of immigrant and civil rights organizations issued a travel advisory on Thursday warning foreign tourists to reconsider travel to Florida for FIFA World Cup matches over the government's illegal immigration enforcement tactics and detention centers like ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in the Sunshine State.

The advisory suggested fans visiting from other countries carry IDs and register travel with their consulate before coming to the U.S. for the tournament, which kicks off in June.

""Recent reporting and civil-rights litigation document growing instances in which visitors, tourists, lawful residents, and even U.S. citizens have been detained, questioned, held in immigration custody, or removed from the United States following encounters with federal immigration enforcement and local law enforcement acting under expansive immigration partnerships,"" the alert said, citing enforcement actions in Florida and Gov. Ron DeSantis' moves to have local police partner with federal immigration officials.

The organizations also pointed to alleged instances in which tourists or U.S. citizens were detained.

In a press conference outside FIFA's downtown offices near Miami, the groups said they were not calling for a boycott, but they would not take it off the table in the future as fans prepare to visit the city.

""We're using this opportunity to really urge visitors and tourists to have a calculated move about whether or not they're going to come,"" Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, coordinator for American Friends Service Committee, a social justice and humanitarian nonprofit, said at the press conference.

Others, including former FIFA President Sepp Blatter, have warned fans against traveling to the U.S. for the games over the Trump administration's immigration policies.

The coalition warned that travelers could face increased enforcement during what they described as an aggressive immigration crackdown under the current administration.

""We're just warning people of the risks … under an environment where every, not just law enforcement agency but state agency, has been deputized to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement,"" said Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigrant Coalition.

""What we don't want is our fans being harassed by immigration enforcement when they're just trying to attend the game,"" Kennedy continued, adding that he wanted ""assurances that there won't be immigration enforcement happening at these games indiscriminately.""

Dariel Gomez, a field organizer for the ACLU of Florida, said the groups were not aiming to spread fear or panic but to ""offer a sobering reality check"" that some people may face racial profiling or be detained.

""Because of these programs a simple traffic stop here in Miami is no longer just a routine interaction, for too many people a simple interaction by police now comes with the fear of deportation,"" Gomez said.

The groups also raised concerns about the recent instances in Minneapolis in which federal immigrant agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens, as well as the federal government's new travel bans. The Trump administration included some exceptions to the ban for players, coaches and their families, but Haiti and Iran were not covered. Foreign spectators, media and corporate sponsors who wish to attend the events would still be impacted by the ban unless they qualify for another exemption.

In December, the White House did not rule out whether immigration raids were possible around the soccer matches this summer, of which seven are scheduled for South Florida.

GHANA Sports Minister Kofi Adams has boldly declared the Black Stars will TOP their World Cup group, despite being drawn alongside England, Croatia and Panama.

The Three Lions are heavy favourites to finish first in Group L and they kick off their campaign against Croatia in Dallas before facing Ghana in Boston, with their final group game taking place in New Jersey.

But Adams, the man who masterminded Ghana's qualification, insists England should beware, and says he cannot wait to face them in competitive action for the first time.

He told SunSport: “We know England are giants when it comes to football,  but so is Ghana.

“Historically, we have always done well when we play big countries at the World Cup.

“Our aim is to prepare so well, leaving no stone unturned, that we don't just qualify from the group, we finish TOP.

“Our players are competing in the best leagues in Europe and we already have a clear plan.

“We know how to win this group, and I'm really looking forward to playing England because we believe we are in the same league as them.”

Ghana have already lined up FOUR major warm-up matches ahead of the tournament, starting next month with a clash against Austria.

They will then face Germany, a side they believe play a similar style to England.

Two further friendlies are still to be confirmed, but SunSports understands one will take place in the USA just days before the World Cup kicks off.

The Black Stars also feel conditions could play into their hands, with matches set to be played in high temperatures.

England boss Thomas Tuchel has already hinted he may be forced into extreme measures – including keeping substitutes in the dressing room, to manage hydration.

And Ghanaians believe Senegal's famous friendly win over the Three Lions last year can be repeated, with boss Otto Addo confident his side can spring another major upset.

FOXBORO, MASS. (WHDH) - The FIFA World Cup games scheduled to kick off at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough this summer could face trouble as town officials are asking the federation to cover nearly $8 million in security costs, according to Foxborough town officials.

At a select Board meeting this week, town officials said there is millions of dollars in security costs needed up front. 

“We're not in a position to put forward 7.8 million dollars up front and hope to be reimbursed,” said Paige Duncan, Foxborough Town Manager.

Officials said without this funding, they will not be issued a license for the matches. 

“It's not up to the Town of Foxborough to support or pay for any of this,” said Bill Yukna, Foxborough Select Board Chair. “As our chiefs are the ones responsible for the security and safety of the facilities, their needs need to be met or this cannot be an event that moves forward.”

The World Cup is just four months away, and is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue and travelers from all over the world. Gillette Stadium has already begun preparing the field, replacing the artificial turf with real grass.

Fans said they hope the funding issue can be resolved so the matches can go on as planned. 

“I can't imagine that happening now with all the planning that's already been done and in place,” said Jim Hurley. 

In a statement, the town of Foxborough told 7NEWS, “Foxborough supports the World Cup and wants to be a successful host community. However, the taxpayers of Foxborough cannot and will not be responsible for funding an international sporting event.”

The World Cup's host committee said, “We are working closely with FIFA, the stadium, and the town of Foxboro to reach an agreement.”

The licensing deadline is March 17.

The advisory continues to state that these operations have involved local law enforcement working in partnership with federal agencies, which could lead to traffic stops or interactions at airports.

The coalition stated that enforcement activities may escalate in areas hosting major events like the FIFA World Cup, where large crowds of international visitors gather.

Tottenham finished second-from-bottom in the Women's Super League last season. Since promotion seven years ago, their top-flight record against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United stands at two wins, five draws and 42 defeats. Financially, they are not in the same place as the ‘big four', not when Chelsea and Arsenal have both made £1-million transfers in the last year or so. And yet, despite all of this, Spurs are right in the fight with all of them for Women's Champions League qualification this season.

With eight games remaining in the WSL, the north London side sit only a point behind Chelsea, the six-time reigning champions who occupy the third and final European spot. Had they not conceded two late goals to bottom-of-the-table Liverpool last month in a shock loss, they'd only be behind the Blues on goal difference. Had they held on for victory at Manchester United before Christmas, having gone 3-0 up just past the hour mark, they'd be second in the table, ahead of the Red Devils, Chelsea and Arsenal as City's closest - albeit still distant - title challengers.

It's been a remarkable turnaround from Tottenham, and there is a real opportunity this weekend for it to get even better. On Sunday, they host a wounded Chelsea side that has just lost back-to-back WSL games for the first time in over 10 years, knowing a win would see them leapfrog the Blues in the standings. 

So just how have Spurs put together this unprecedented European charge?

It might sound reductive, but this fantastic season likely does not pan out the same way if Spurs had not started it with a 1-0 win over West Ham. Having ended the 2024-25 campaign on a 10-game winless streak, with their last victory in the WSL coming way back on January 26, it's no surprise that new head coach Martin Ho was concerned about where the group might be at psychologically coming into this campaign.

""When I first came in, we needed to lift [the players],"" he explained, speaking before the winter break.

After all, he had little doubt about the ability and talent in the group. In the squad Ho inherited from previous coach Robert Vilahamn, 13 players were part of the team that reached the FA Cup final and finished sixth in the WSL in the 2023-24 campaign, just one place and one point off the club's best-ever season in the top-flight.

""There's a lot of talent in the staff and players here,"" Ho added. ""[I] just needed to give them processes to enable them to work and a framework to perform.""

Nothing underlines that existing talent more than the fact that Spurs made just two signings in the summer window. Ho didn't come in and sign a whole new team; rather, he assessed what he had at his disposal and has given them what they needed to be able to perform and get results.

Though Spurs only made two summer signings, both have been excellent.

Toko Koga, the Japan international who only turned 20 last month, has been one of the best defenders in the division this season, showing a maturity that belies her age, while Cathinka Tandberg, who arrived just three days before the WSL season got underway, has made a telling contribution with four goals and two assists from just seven starts.

Five players have since arrived in a much busier winter window, giving Spurs a boost midway through this extremely promising season. Signe Gaupset, the much-sought after Norway international, is the stand out recruit, but all of the new arrivals have the potential to be very impactful.

While the chances of securing the services of Gaupset were boosted by Ho having coached the 20-year-old in his previous role, at Brann, she certainly would not have chosen north London had Spurs not impressed as a club and a team this season.

So, how has Ho revived this group? A lot of it is down to the playing style.

""I would say he's brought a lot of intensity. He's got a style of play which suits our players quite well. We're probably fitter than we've ever been. We're moving a lot more freely and just playing much better football and actually finding that belief within [ourselves] to be able to do the job that is asked,"" Bethany England, Spurs' captain and star striker, told GOAL just before the winter break.

""I think before, we were kind of, I'd say, a little bit lost in searching for that direction. But Martin's obviously done a great job since coming in and his assistants he's brought in, Lawrence [Shamieh] and Adam [Jeffery], are amazing technical people that are helping the girls improve every day as well. I think it's been an all-round effort, really, but I think the girls have really bought into what he wants and how he wants to play. and it is suiting us.""

The improvements that playing style has made is evident in the numbers. Spurs are much more adaptable this season, able to fluidly switch between a back-three and a back-four depending on what is needed, while the double-pivot in midfield of Eveliina Summanen and Drew Spence has been vital in protecting that back line so that the full-backs, or wing-backs, can really get involved in the attack.

As England noted, this approach suits the players in the squad and, as a result, Tottenham have been much better in both halves. Last season, only Crystal Palace, who were relegated, conceded more goals than Spurs, who kept just two clean sheets in their 22 WSL outings. This season, the north London side have only conceded 19 goals in their 14 games, to sit a respectable sixth in that column, while keeping five clean sheets in 14 outings to date. Only Chelsea, with arguably the world's best goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, between the sticks have shut teams out more often.

It's worth noting, also, that Ho has played the same goalkeeper in every league fixture so far. Last year, for varying reasons, Vilahamn used three different shot-stoppers, something which can impact the cohesion and understanding at the back. Ho, though, has been able to entrust Lize Kop with the No.1 role on a full-time basis, and she has repaid that faith with some outstanding performances, to the degree that no team in the division has a more positive differential between their expected goals against statistic and their actual goals against than Spurs.

In attack, the numbers are particularly interesting, as Tottenham aren't actually shooting more or creating a greater number of chances; they're just being a lot more clinical. In fact, per 90 minutes, Spurs are having marginally fewer shots and shots on target than last season.

Yet, in an attack that encourages the forwards to interchange positions and seek out pockets of space, they're scoring 1.35 goals per game, a noteworthy increase on the one per game of last season. Combine that with a much-improved defence, and it has led to better results.

Spearheading it all is an exciting and infectious leader, in Ho. The 35-year-old was always highly thought of when he worked as the assistant to Marc Skinner at Manchester United, and he showed why in his time at Brann, leading the Norwegian side to an unlikely Champions League quarter-final where they would give a good account of themselves against three-time winners Barcelona.

Now, the energy, enthusiasm and - underpinning it all - knowledge that he brings to the table is inspiring another unlikely success story.

To lift the confidence in players, to get individuals to buy into your vision, a leader must be charismatic and respectable, and Ho clearly is. He deserves credit, too, for how his players have bounced back from disappointments, such as the 3-3 draw at United or the recent loss to Liverpool.

Spurs have not lost back-to-back games all season, and that's a testament to the resilience and work ethic in this group, something both the staff and the players should get a lot of plaudits for.

Spurs have achieved nothing yet. Indeed, at this stage last season, the north London side were sixth in the WSL table, before a dreadful run of results saw them plummet to 11th by the campaign's end. Given that experience, the players will know full well that they cannot rest on their laurels.

But nothing about this team suggests there is any danger of complacency. It's quite the opposite, in fact. This season is seen as a foundation being laid for greater things to come down the line, rather than being the ceiling of what Spurs can achieve.

""We're not even 15 percent of the way to where I want us to be,"" Ho told the Guardian last month. ""We've seen some solid performances, but we're nowhere near the finished article. I'm really excited about what's ahead and the ambitions of the club.""

And yet, it is by no means ridiculous to suggest this season could see Tottenham qualify for the Women's Champions League for the very first time. It's not going to be easy for them to get there, but Ho's side have nailed down a consistency across the season that no team outside of that 'big four' has managed yet, something necessary in order to stake a real claim for a top-three finish.

If Spurs can get a result on Sunday against Chelsea, it would make that European dream much more realistic. But even if they fall short against one of the very best teams in the world, and even if they can't quite sneak into those Champions League places this year, that won't change the fact that this Tottenham team looks to have an extremely bright future.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Karim Benzema became caught up in an angry exchange with a journalist following his stunning debut for Al-Hilal. The veteran French striker has sparked remarkable scenes in the Saudi Pro League - with Cristiano Ronaldo going on strike - after completing a free transfer. Benzema has refuted suggestions that he left Al-Ittihad without saying goodbye to his former team-mates.

At 38 years of age, ex-Real Madrid star Benzema is taking on a new challenge. He followed former Santiago Bernabeu colleague Ronaldo to the Middle East in 2023, with a lucrative contract being signed on the back of landing a prestigious Ballon d'Or.

Benzema was a prolific presence for Al-Ittihad, hitting over 50 goals for them, but saw a contract dispute lead to him being removed from short-term plans. A move across Saudi Arabia was quickly lined up.

The five-time Champions League winner has made an immediate impact in new surroundings, with a hat-trick being recorded on debut in a 6-0 mauling of Al-Akhdoud. That win has taken Al-Hilal three points clear at the top of the Saudi Pro League - with a four-point advantage being held over Ronaldo and Al-Nassr.

Despite having plenty to smile about on the field, Benzema cut a frustrated figure when being asked about his controversial move at the full-time whistle.

He said: “Do you want to talk about the game or do you want to talk about that? Talk about the game. It was a nice performance. I feel good. With these kind of players on this team, we play and fight together.”

Pressed on whether he was insinuating that Al-Hilal players help him more than those at Al-Ittihad did, Benzema snapped back with: “I didn't say that. I said I feel good - it's different.”

After being asked why he did not say farewell to those that he has left behind in Jeddah, Benzema said: “What? You know? You know? Ask them.”

While Benzema is feeling a little flustered at present, the same can be said of Portuguese superstar Ronaldo. He has taken to going on strike at Al-Nassr. He sat out a derby date with Al-Riyadh and is expected to miss a top-of-the-table clash with Al-Ittihad on Friday.

The Saudi Pro League has clapped back at the all-time great and his complaints regarding the distribution of transfer funds and how certain teams are run by saying in an official statement: “The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules. Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership.

“Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.”

Benzema is now embracing a fresh start in Saudi Arabia, but questions are being asked of Ronaldo's future. He has a release clause in his record-breaking contract that can be triggered this summer and is being linked with clubs around the world.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ex-Leicester star Christian Fuchs reveals talks with Cremonese striker over stunning transfer to England's fourth tier after taking manager's job","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jamie-vardy-league-two-ex-leicester-star-christian-fuchs-talks-cremonese-striker-stunning-transfer-fourth-tier/blt205583f20695ffea","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:00:53 GMT","

Christian Fuchs, a member of Leicester's Premier League title-winning squad from 2015-16, has revealed that he tried to talk Foxes legend Jamie Vardy into joining him in the fourth tier of English football. Fuchs is currently calling the shots at Newport County, having stepped into management, and asked questions of whether Vardy was up for another battle against the odds.

Former Austria international Fuchs has returned to British football after bringing his playing career to a close in MLS with Charlotte FC. He was not expecting to tread this path, with coaching teeth being cut at a team that sat bottom of the League Two table when he took over.

He has told the Daily Mail of diving in at the deep end, with a surprising new adventure being embraced: “I like a challenge but this, for my first job, is probably the toughest of them all.” Fuchs has guided his team off the foot of their division and to within three points of safety.

There is still much work to be done and an SOS call was sounded to ex-England international Vardy when taking the reins at Rodney Parade - with a proven top-flight goalscorer asked if he fancied leaving Serie A at Cremonese for a fresh start in South Wales. Fuchs said: “I asked Jamie if he wants to pack his bags. Of course I did, even though I knew what the answer would be!”

Fuchs has overseen a couple of wins from his opening 12 games at the helm, including Newport's first on home soil in 289 days, and is hoping to take inspiration from the many managers that he worked under - including Brendan Rodgers, Claudio Ranieri and Dean Smith.

The Austrian added: “You take bits and pieces – good things and bad things – but then you adapt it to how you feel is the right way. I don't want to be a [Thomas] Tuchel, I don't want to be a Dean Smith, but all of them did something that I appreciated as a player. Everyone has to find their own way. It's more about off the pitch and how you want to be as a person. The bottom line is always how to deal with people. I have phone numbers. I was just on two phone calls this morning to ask for advice. You should not be shy to pick up the phone.”

Fuchs is as surprised as anybody to find himself in the dugout, with his initial plan being to focus on businesses away from football, including a clothing line, the Fox Soccer Academy and maybe even a venture into NFL as a kicker. “I never saw myself in this role,” he admits. “To be honest, it didn't entice me at all. Now, I really, really enjoy it.”

While focused on events at Newport, Fuchs is keeping an eye on how Leicester are faring - with a tough time for the Foxes seeing them hit with a points deduction in the Championship while looking for their fifth permanent manager in the space of 20 months, having parted company with Marti Cifuentes.

Fuchs said of goings on at the King Power Stadium: “It's tough to see, the points deduction, which will put them right into a relegation battle. I checked the table right away. It hurts because as much as I'm dedicated and committed to what I'm doing here with Newport, I'll always be a Leicester supporter. I have watched almost every single game since I left. It hurts a lot.”

Quizzed on whether he could return to the East Midlands in a coaching capacity at some stage, the 39-year-old former left-back added: “Yes. I'm not making secrets. I went through everything with that club that you can imagine and cannot imagine, from the highest highs to the lowest lows. That creates a special bond. I said when I left that you might lose a player but you gain a fan. That's what I am.

“Chris Finn [Newport's head of operations] said to me the other day: ‘It doesn't look good for Leicester...they might sack the manager soon. Bye, Christian!' They know how much Leicester means to me. I might need to make it more of a secret but I cannot. It doesn't take anything away from my loyalty here, the energy and hard work I put in. This club gave me the first opportunity here in the UK to be a manager. So, I am very thankful for that. That has a special place but Leicester is just different.”

With Leicester now locked in a relegation battle of their own, as they seek to avoid dropping from the Premier League and into League One across successive seasons, Newport will be looking to take another step towards safety on Saturday when playing host to Grimsby. They will not have Vardy on board, but Fuchs is doing his best to conjure up another miracle.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Wayne Rooney's son Kai offered new £50,000-a-year contract by Man Utd after impressing in 'very strong' youth team","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/wayne-rooney-son-kai-offered-50000-a-year-contract-man-utd-youth-team/blt0fbe2ee70debf2ca","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:47:17 GMT","

Wayne Rooney's son Kai has reportedly been offered a new contract by Manchester United that would be worth £50,000-a-year. The talented teenager has stepped up into the Red Devils' Under-18 side this season, allowing him to grace FA Youth Cup competition. He is considered to have impressed in a “very strong” team, and will be rewarded accordingly.

Kai, who is 16 years of age and can choose to finish his academic schooling this summer, is one of 14 prospects at Old Trafford that have been offered terms that will extend their association with a club that is famed for providing a first-team pathway to promising academy graduates.

The fabled ‘Busby Babes' and ‘Class of 92' have enjoyed considerable success with United at senior level - delivering top-flight titles and European Cup crowns. Kai Rooney is hoping to follow in illustrious footsteps alongside the likes of Jacey Carrick - the son of current interim head coach Michael.

Proud fathers Wayne and Michael were recently at Old Trafford to watch Kai make his bow in FA Youth Cup action. The left-footed forward stepped off the bench in that contest. He has caught the eye in a series of videos posted on social media that showcase his finishing prowess, while various trophies have already been collected with United.

According to The Sun, Kai - the eldest of Wayne's four sons - has been offered “a formal one-year scholarship”. That agreement will eventually “switch to a three-year pro deal, which would see him on around £50,000-a-year with an annual signing-on fee”.

It is reported that the Rooney family are yet to make a decision on what to do next, but a source has told The Sun: “The group is very strong and the majority of the boys including Kai and Jacey have been offered deals. It means when they finish school they can go into full-time ‘football employment' and then when they turn 17 are guaranteed a pro status. They still have a long way to go to make the grade, but they can be very proud that the club thinks they have a chance of making it.”

All of those offered terms by United have until July to sign the deals in question. They are under no obligation to do so and “could choose to move to another club”. Kai is, however, following the lead of his father - who remains the Red Devils' all-time leading goalscorer.

Wayne has said of his son's exploits: “Kai got moved up to the under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton. It was a proud moment and I'm delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.”

He has also told The Overlap of another powerful forward in the Rooney family: “[He has] my physique, but he'll be taller than me and he's a goalscorer, he's in the box, he sniffs chances out and that's his game, so he's doing OK. I think he's showing potential and good signs.”

Wayne's wife Coleen has previously revealed that Kai once sought to ensure that his dad stayed away from youth team fixtures, with the ex-England captain's presence considered to provide an unwelcome distraction.

Coleen said in 2024: “Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.

“How do you say to all of these kids, ‘Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different, you could speak to them. So he just said, ‘Oh, Dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped.”

In the same year, Kai said in a rare interview: “I'm trying to make a name for myself, not try and be my dad because I'm my own person. I want to see how my career goes, obviously try to do the best I can and try to reach the biggest stages. I'm just focusing on me and to try to not let any pressure get to me and just keep working on me day by day, month by month.”

Wayne - who scored 253 goals for United - and Coleen are eager to ensure that Kai avoids falling into the traps of fame and fortune, as he enjoys life on and off the field, with every effort being made to keep his promising football career on track.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Honest Ahanor: Why Italy are so keen to cap Atalanta's teenage defensive star as quickly as possible","https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/honest-ahanor-italy-cap-atalanta-teenage-defensive-star/blt3ff2829e9eacd239","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:00:00 GMT","

Honest Ahanor is just 17 years old - and yet on Sunday he started his fifth successive game for Atalanta, against Como. Unfortunately, Ahanor's afternoon came to an abrupt end - and quite literally by his own hand. Just eight minutes into the game at Sinigaglia, the defender was involved in an innocuous, off-the-ball clash with Maxi Perrone, who shamelessly collapsed to the ground as if Ahanor had struck him in the face.

Ahanor had done no such thing, but he had raised his arms in Perrone's general direction, resulting in a straight red card for the teenager. As Atalanta coach Rafaelle Palladino pointed out afterwards, Ahanor never should have given the officials a decision to make.

""I've spoken to him and while what I said to him is between us, he knew what he'd done,"" Palladino told DAZN. ""We have to accept these things, though, because they help him grow. He's 17 years old and made a mistake. But, for me, he's still a future champion.""

Few who have been following Ahanor's ascent to Atalanta's starting line-up so soon after his arrival from Genoa would disagree. Indeed, the versatile centre-back has been touted as a potential star for some time now, and so great is the desperation for him to be capped by Italy that it's sparked a debate over the country's citizenship requirements...

Ahanor was born in Aversa, Campania, but because his parents both hail from Nigeria, he's not eligible for full Italian citizenship until he turns 18 on February 23. It's a ludicrous law that has, thus far, prevented Ahanor from representing the country in which he's spent his whole life. Fortunately, being denied international football at under-age level hasn't checked his progress whatsoever.

After moving to Genoa with his family when he was just one year old, Ahanor took his first steps towards the professional ranks with Progetto Atletico, a local football initiative, before being picked up by the Grifone when he was still only five.

It wasn't long before he was being talked about at the Luigi Ferraris as the most promising player Genoa had produced since Pietro Pellegri, who had made his Serie A debut at 15, and Ahanor's prodigious talent was certainly beyond dispute. During the 2023-24 season, for example, he lined out for Genoa's Under-17s, U18s and U19s, helping the U18s win the Italian title.

As a former Primavera coach, Alberto Gilardino was more than familiar with Ahanor's talent, and the former Italy international added the youngster to his senior squad at the start of the 2024-25 campaign. So, while Ahanor's debut six rounds into the season wasn't exactly a surprise, it was historic, as he became the first player born in 2008 to play in Serie A when he was picked on the left wing for Genoa's clash with Juventus.

""When the coach handed me the bib during the final training session, there were a lot of emotions,"" Ahanor admitted. ""But then I was able to calm down thanks to the rest of the squad. On the pitch, I focused on having fun and being there for the team. But it was a unique feeling, wearing the jersey of the team you've represented since you were a child. These are strong emotions that I will never forget for the rest of my life and I will always be grateful to Mister Gilardino for allowing me to play for Genoa.""

Ahanor made his second Serie A appearance as a second-half substitute against Parma on November 4, 2024, but suffered a serious knee injury just a couple of weeks later that ruled him out of action for five months.

""These were long months,"" he later admitted. ""The emotions are always so many, sometimes not even all of them are decipherable. Sometimes I couldn't see far ahead. But in the end, what matters is the response you give in times of difficulty. I experienced every match as a fan in the stands, with desire and love to return to doing what I love with the jersey I love, and in the end I succeeded.""

Indeed, upon returning to full fitness in April 2025, Ahanor went straight back into Gilardino's squad and featured four times for the first team before the close of the campaign. 

Having demonstrated he'd not been in any way adversely affected by his knee injury, Ahanor was a player in demand, with AC Milan, Roma, Monaco and, inevitably, Chelsea all linked with one of the most gifted young defenders in Europe. In the end, though, Ahanor rather understandably felt his development would be best served by a move to Atalanta, a club synonymous with improving players.

""Knowing that so many top teams were interested in me is a pleasure,"" Ahanor admitted, ""but I had no hesitation in choosing Atalanta.""

La Dea agreed to pay Genoa an initial €16 million, plus a potential €4m in bonuses, for a player who had made just six appearances at senior level. However, Atalanta CEO Luca Percassi was in no doubt that the Bergamaschi's famed recruitment team had made another bargain buy.

""He's a player we've known for many years and have followed for a long time, having even had the opportunity to play against him with our youth teams,"" Percassi explained. ""He's a player who has always stood out for his great qualities on the pitch, and, getting to know him, he pleasantly surprised us with how he shows himself to be more mature than his age even off the pitch.""

Then-coach Ivan Juric was just as impressed by Ahanor, and when Isak Hien was forced off injured just 27 minutes into Atalanta's Serie A clash with Torino on September 21, he turned to the 17-year-old. Ahanor gave an excellent account of himself in his side's 3-0 win and, coincidentally, made his first start for his new club against Juventus the following weekend.

Three days later, he got his first taste of Champions League football in the closing stages of Atalanta's loss to Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes before playing all 90 minutes of the matchday-two win over Club Brugge at the New Balance Arena.

Ahanor has featured regularly since then and another injury, this time to Sead Kolasinac on January 3, allowed him to lock down a starting spot under Juric's successor, Palladino, before Saturday's red card in Como.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

It's obviously rare for a 17-year-old to be able to cope, physically and mentally, with the rigours of elite-level football, but Ahanor is already an awesome athlete, as strong as he is fast, while he also boasts an unusually high footballing IQ for one so young, which allows him to read the game wonderfully well.

However, what really stands out about him is technical ability. This is an imposing young man so comfortable on the ball that he's capable of not only playing at centre-back or left-back - but also on the wing.

All throughout his under-age career, he also demonstrated a keen eye for goal, and he's already opened his Atalanta account in a Coppa Italia win over his former club Genoa. What Palladino most likes about Ahanor, though, is his ""attitude, his boldness, and his willingness to give 110 percent, to make the most of every opportunity he gets.""

Unless he experiences a growth spurt, which is not beyond the realms of possibility given his age, Ahanor is not going to be the biggest of centre-backs (if that's where he ends up playing the majority of his football).

Consequently, the six-footer is going to have to get better in the air by improving the timing and technique of his jumping. It can be done, of course. The great Fabio Cannavaro was only 5'9"" (1.76m) but excelled in aerial duels, while England international Marc Guehi is the same height as Ahanor and has just been snapped up by Manchester City. Of course, if he becomes a full-back or wing-back, he'll need to work on his attacking attributes, in particular his crossing.

For now, though, his primary goal should probably be learning when to step into midfield and when to stay deep, because his greatest strength could also become a weakness by leaving his fellow defenders exposed if he moves forward at inopportune times.

Comparisons have been made to Destiny Udogie, which is understandable, given Ahanor is, like the Tottenham full-back, quick, strong, excellent on the ball and of Nigerian extraction. However, Udogie is a lot more attack-minded and has never been utilised as a centre-back.

In that sense, Ahanor feels more similar to David Alaba, as he's just at home playing at the heart of the defence as he is on the left-hand side. Ahanor obviously has a long way to go before he can be properly compared to the Austria international, but they do have some shared attributes and it's hard not to think of Alaba when you watch the teenager switching so seamlessly between centre-back and left-back - much like his idol, Paolo Maldini.

Right now, Ahanor's focus is on regaining his place in Palladino's starting line-up after he serves his suspension for his sending off at Sinigaglia. Meanwhile, once he turns 18 in a matter of weeks, he'll finally be eligible for Italian citizenship, and while the country's bureaucratic processes are infamously slow, there is an outside chance that Ahanor could be called up by the Azzurri for next month's World Cup qualification play-off against Northern Ireland.

It's obviously highly unlikely that coach Gennarro Gattuso would hand Ahanor his first cap in such an important encounter, but the belief is that Italy are keen to at least welcome him into the squad in a desperate attempt to convince him to commit to the land of his birth rather than declare for his parents' homeland, Nigeria.

What's next, then, is unclear at this particular point in time, but what we do know is that Palladino is far from the only person who thinks Ahanor is a future champion.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL looks at the biggest storylines among Americans Abroad, including a series of big games in France, England and Italy

The season has reached the point where most clubs know who they are and what they're fighting for. The title race has taken shape, as have the European and relegation battles. For the most part, teams have settled into the area of the table they are most likely to occupy.

There is some wiggle room, though, and, in this first full weekend of February, the hope for several of the U.S. Men's National Team stars will be to navigate that wiggle room and put their teams in a better spot for the home stretch.

There are big games throughout Europe this week, particularly for clubs looking to stay in crowded races at the top of their leagues. It's a big week for someone like Chris Richards, too, as Crystal Palace look to finally build some momentum in a season that has seen a whole lot go wrong.

GOAL previews the main storylines among Americans abroad this weekend.

Rivalry games are always tense. They're even more tense, though, when a team isn't playing well. That's the situation for Crystal Palace as they continue to sputter. Could this weekend be the one where they really get back on track?

When Palace kick off against rivals Brighton this weekend, it'll have been over two months since their last league win. All eyes, of course, will be on the top end of the field, where new signing Jorgen Strand Larsen could debut to halt the skit. For Americans, though, all eyes will remain on Richards as he looks to do his part, too.

Richards, to his credit, has been one of the few shining lights for Palace in recent weeks. Captain Marc Guehi is gone, having signed with Manchester City, and manager Oliver Glasner says he'll be out the door soon, too, as he prepares to leave this summer. Palace need some form of stability and some form of momentum. They'll hope to find some this weekend, and it'll likely have to involve standout performances in both halves of the field to get back in the win column, finally.

Tim Weah is set to face his former club this weekend, but, regardless of familiarity, there's always something pretty damn scary about facing Paris Saint-Germain.

Marseille will visit the reigning Champions League winners on Sunday, pitting two of Ligue 1's top three teams against one another. PSG are, of course, at the top of the league, but there is some hope that someone, anyone, can challenge them, particularly if Marseille can knock them down a peg with a win this weekend.

To win, Marseille will need to be near perfect, but the good news is that Weah has been more than pulling his weight of late. Playing as a right-wingback, Weah has a goal and two assists since mid-January, which has helped Marseille go unbeaten in the league since that point. Of course, Sunday will be a different type of game with the American likely staring down Les Parisiens' starBradley Barcola, which means far less license to get forward on that right-hand side.

This match is crucial for Marseille, though, as they look to remain involved in the title race, particularly with the knowledge that their Champions League dream ended in the harshest of ways. The season isn't dead, of course, but it would be very alive with a win this weekend.

Staying in France, Mark McKenzie might just be the USMNT's most in-form player, which is saying something given the levels some of his international teammates are playing at. The results speak for themselves, though, and McKenzie will hope those results can continue for a long time.

With his contributions to Toulouse's 1-0 win over Amiens in the cup, McKenzie has now played all 90 minutes in each of the team's last eight games. More importantly, five of those games have seen McKenzie and Toulouse's backline keep clean sheets, allowing them to leap up the Ligue 1 table and into European contention. 

There's still some work to do there, as they sit eighth at the moment, but Sunday's clash with Angers presents a chance to rise up the table even more.

Juventus will still be reeling from Thursday's Coppa Italia loss to Atalanta. In Turin, a 3-0 defeat doesn't just sting - it demands a response.

That response won't come easily. Weston McKennie and Juve now face a brutal run, starting with Lazio this weekend before a looming showdown with Inter on Feb. 14. It's a season-defining stretch, one that will reveal whether this Juventus side is a genuine Serie A title contender or a team destined to slide into the familiar scrap for European places.

We may get an answer to that this week. McKennie has been a revelation, of course, but the club currently sits fourth in a crowded Serie A. They're just five points behind second-place Milan, but just four points ahead of sixth-place Como. There's room to rise or fall, but that'll depend on results. A win against Lazio this weekend will restore spirits ahead of next week's match against Inter. A loss would set off panic, particularly knowing how tough the next one will be, too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","The Butcher is back! Lisandro Martinez's return has been as much of a game-changer for Man Utd as Michael Carrick's appointment","https://www.goal.com/en-om/lists/the-butcher-back-lisandro-martinez-return-game-changer-man-utd-michael-carrick/bltf18900600c3a7ec8","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

Michael Carrick is getting the bulk of plaudits for Manchester United's resurgence since he took charge, but there is another undeniable factor to consider when analysing the uplift in performances and results at Old Trafford. Lisandro Martinez admittedly made his long-awaited first appearance after 301 days out through injury while Ruben Amorim was still in charge, but the true impact of his return is only being felt now.

Amorim understandably wanted to carefully manage Martinez's return after so long out with a severe knee injury which led the World Cup winner to briefly contemplate quitting football. The Portuguese coach drip-fed minutes to his centre-back in his first five matches back before giving him his first start against Newcastle and it does not seem a coincidence that United won 1-0.

Martinez has started every game since, and United's record reads three draws and four wins, the latter three of which have all come under Carrick. The former United midfielder's return to the dugout has no doubt helped Martinez as it has allowed the Argentine to play in a back four, as he has done for the vast majority of his career. He has also benefitted from having a consistent partner in Harry Maguire, whose contrasting skillset ensures they perfectly complement one another.

Despite being dubbed 'The Butcher' due to his aggressive tendencies, Martinez has always stood out for his technical ability rather than his combative nature, even though that remains a big part of his appeal. Instead, Maguire has tasked himself with being the bulwark while Martinez has been allowed to do what he does best, distribute the ball with purpose so as to make United tick.

In United's last game against Fulham, Martinez showed why he is so valuable to the Red Devils' attacking play in two instances at either end of the 3-2 win.

Early in the match, he took the ball from Casemiro just outside his own penalty area and hurried forward into the Fulham half before playing a simple but intelligent pass into Kobbie Mainoo, who was perfectly placed to release Amad Diallo for a curling effort which was tipped away by Bernd Leno.

Then, with United winded by Fulham's two late goals, it was Martinez who sparked the move for Benjamin Sesko's eventual winner by playing a cross-field ball into Amad's path.

Martinez also produced the slide tackles and blocks which United fans love him for, but it is his ability with the ball which makes him such a game-changer, as he is able to play the role of part-defender, part-holding midfielder.

Martinez's calmness with the ball and his eagerness to get into both the middle of the pitch and down the left flank was also a big factor in United's win at Arsenal the previous week, with the Argentine key to the Red Devils' overcoming the Gunners' early dominance before going on to boss the second half.

Martinez's performance in the first game of this winning run under Carrick was, however, his best so far, as he marked Erling Haaland out of the derby win over Manchester City. Martinez's sliding block on the Premier League's top scorer was his most memorable contribution, but his highlights reel was considerable, as he made more sliding clearances and produced a brave diving header to get the ball the away. 

It was the perfect response to Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes' ludicrous prediction before the game that Martinez would get chucked around like a toddler by Haaland. The two legendary United midfielders had not only shown a lack of respect to one of the best and most committed players in the squad, but their analysis was lazy and plain wrong. 

Martinez was written off early on when he signed for United due to his height - or lack thereof - but he quickly showed the other side to his game, and anyone who still believes that his short stature holds him back clearly hasn't been watching him or United over the last four seasons. They also haven't considered how the team have fared when Martinez hasn't been available.

Due to four lengthy setbacks caused by two foot injuries and two knee injuries, Martinez has played just over half the total amount of United's Premier League games since he joined the club. The Red Devils' record in the 70 matches he has participated in reads: 35 wins, 15 draws and 20 defeats. By contrast, they have won just 28 of the 68 matches he has missed, drawn 14 and lost 26.

Some of their worst spells have come when he has been out of the team, too. After suffering a metatarsal injury in April 2023 against Sevilla,  United won only five of their nine remaining games that season, including being thrashed 3-0 by Sevilla to exit the Europa League and losing the FA Cup final to City. 

Early in the 2023-24 campaign, Martinez suffered a recurrence of the problem and had to have a second surgery on his foot. Again shorn of the ex-Ajax man's tenacious leadership, United won just 10 out of 22 games, losing 10 times while crashing out of both the Carabao Cup and Champions League.

Martinez then suffered a knee injury against West Ham three weeks after coming back into the team, and then strained his calf, forcing him out for over three months in total, during which time United won only three of their 14 league games.

Martinez made it back just in time for the 2024 FA Cup final and was one of the key players in United's shock revenge win over City. He then enjoyed a peaceful, nine-month spell without injuries, during which he helped Argentina win the Copa America. But in February 2025, he suffered his worst injury yet, tearing his cruciate ligament against Crystal Palace. 

Martinez did not return until November, and without him United posted their worst league finish in 51 years while also losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. It was the second major final United had lost without Martinez, having won the other two that he did play in. As well as a dark period for United, it was a harrowing time for Martinez.

""After the first two or three weeks I didn't want to play football anymore,"" he told AFA Studio. ""It was day by day, a constant struggle, and my match was every day at the gym. I clung to the people around me, my family, my friends. Today, on the pitch, I feel excellent, and I say that thanks to those days, well, of suffering, of not giving up - today we have the results.""

United are reaping the rewards of Martinez battling back to full fitness and form. A United insider says Martinez drives standards daily at Carrington, keeping people on their toes by not being afraid to tell them - in the right way - if they're not reaching the right standards. He is ultra competitive and hates to lose, even in training. Naturally, he is said to be really enjoying Carrick's approach and the intensity of training.

He is described as extremely positive, often reminding people what a privilege it is to play for United. He also places a big emphasis on the togetherness between players, staff, fans, the whole club. His commitment to the club could be seen especially when he was still injured, as he opted to join the squad on their pre-season tour of the United States, continuing his rehabilitation at their base in Chicago. Amorim, to his credit, would do recovery runs with Martinez to show solidarity with the player.

Martinez stayed relentlessly positive during his rehab. There were many tough days but he always turned up with the right energy as he fought back. He is really close with his family. His dad is a regular visitor to the training ground and often watches training. After the 3-2 win at Arsenal, he went into the crowd to hug him. Within the squad, Martinez is closest to Diogo Dalot and Manuel Ugarte.

Carrick is in some ways fortunate that Martinez was already fit and firing by the team he succeeded Amorim, but he still deserves some credit for the way he has been able to push Martinez's buttons in a bid to get him back to his best.

After the derby win, Martinez praised Carrick for urging the players to ""use the energy of the people"" to beat City. And in an interview with Stansport last week, he gave further insight into his connection with the coach.

""I'm really impressed with him, his body language, his energy, communication. He's very close to the players, the way he trusts the players, the way he talks,  the way he connects with everyone,"" Martinez said. ""If you play for Manchester United, it's because you have something. You need people who understand your quality, you need people who take your best and I think [Carrick] is doing that. He's getting the best out of everybody, not just the players, but the staff.

""And for me, when you touch my heart, I will give everything for you, and he touched it already and you can see that on the pitch we give everything.""

For Carrick, the Argentine embodies exactly what he is trying to build: ""You've got to play with feeling. You've got to play with emotion, you've got to play with excitement. And Licha's epitomised that in terms of how he's gone about every day, and certainly in the games.""

There is certainly excitement about United once more, perhaps a little of the 'magic' Carrick referred to in his first press conference. And Martinez's blend of fierce competitive spirit and outstanding technical ability is a massive reason why.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","How Alcaraz extended lead in battle for World No. 1 with Sinner","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-sinner-world-no-1-pif-atp-rankings-update-february-2026","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 02:19:32 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz's Australian Open victory was important for more than just the moment. With his triumph at Melbourne Park, Alcaraz crucially extended his lead over Jannik Sinner in the battle for World No. 1.


Alcaraz, who on Sunday lifted the Australian Open trophy for the first time, currently leads the PIF ATP Rankings with 13,650 points, 3,350 points more than World No. 2 Sinner.


With just 400 quarter-final points to defend in Melbourne, Alcaraz had room to gain and he did so by leaving with the trophy and 2,000 points. 

Meanwhile Sinner, the 2024 and 2025 champion, was defending 2,000 points from last year's title run. The Italian reached the semi-finals in this year's edition, earning 800 points. Because of that, he departed Australia with 1,200 fewer points than he entered with.

Alcaraz entered the season's first major with just a 550-point advantage over his rival. But thanks to Alcaraz's gain and Sinner's loss, the battle swung 2,800 points in Alcaraz's favour. 

PIF ATP Rankings




With that said, it is still early in the season and there are many points up for grabs in the coming weeks and months. Sinner enjoyed a 65-week debut reign atop the PIF ATP Rankings, which ended after the Italian fell to Alcaraz in last year's US Open final. The back-and-forth battle continued as Sinner reclaimed the honour for one week after winning the Rolex Paris Masters in November, before Alcaraz secured ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the second time in Turin.




While Sinner's 66 weeks as World No. 1 places him 12th among the 29 ATP No. 1 Club members, Alcaraz is not far behind at 57 weeks (14th in PIF ATP Rankings history). Across every phase of their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry, Alcaraz and Sinner have remained in close pursuit of one another.


By triumphing in Melbourne, Alcaraz captured his seventh major trophy and completed the Career Grand Slam — a feat that Sinner will have his chance of conquering at Roland Garros.

Oleksandra Oliynykova saved 21 out of 23 break points en route to upsetting Wang Xinyu at the Transylvania Open to make her first WTA semifinal in just her second main draw. She'll face top seed Emma Raducanu, who defeated Maja Chwalinska in straight sets. Meanwhile, Daria Snigur joined Oliynykova in the semifinals -- making history for Ukraine.

One statistic in particular stands out from Oleksandra Oliynykova's milestone 6-4, 6-4 win over No. 4 seed Wang Xinyu in the Transylvania Open quarterfinals.

The result was the most significant of the 25-year-old's career so far -- it was her first defeat of a Top 50 player, and she advances to her first semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz as a result. To seal it, Oliynykova saved a remarkable 21 out of 23 break points against her. Her 91.3% rate of break points saved is the highest at tour level since full data began to be kept in 2021.

Cluj-Napoca: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Oliynykova only conceded her serve twice, in the opening game of each set. In the first, she staved off three points to go down a double break at 3-0, and then a further five to hold for 3-2. In the second, she fended off five break points at 2-2 -- one with an underarm serve -- and another two at 2-2.

Afterwards, the Ukrainian linked her resilience in key moments to the perspective brought by living in a country entering its fourth year of war brought on by the Russian invasion of 2022. At the Australian Open, Oliynykova -- whose father is a soldier in the Ukrainian army -- spoke about how the apartment opposite hers had been struck by a drone the night before she departed for her first Grand Slam. Her arrival in Cluj-Napoca this week was nearly stymied when Kyiv was hit by a mass power outage as she was about to catch her train.

""I didn't know this statistic but you know, I'm coming from a country where there is war and you don't know what tomorrow is going to bring,"" Oliynykova said in her on-court interview.

""So for me, it's so important during such hard times in my country, I learned to enjoy every moment of tennis. In some way I really celebrate the game. I'm doing this for sport, for tennis.

""The key -- not only today, but in general of the progress I've made -- it stopped, to me, to be more important whether I win or lose. I'm happy to win, of course -- it means a lot, but it's not the most important thing. I learned to be in the moment.""

Amidst the hard times for Ukraine, Oliynykova and compatriot Daria Snigur also helped write some tennis history for the country. Qualifier Snigur won a 4-6, 6-0, 7-5 thriller over Yuan Yue in Thursday's last quarterfinal, advancing to her first tour-level semifinal as a result. It's also the first time since Ukraine gained independence in 1991 that two Ukrainians have both reached the semifinals of a WTA tournament.

On a more light-hearted note, Oliynykova's ""celebration of the game"" also extends to the temporary facial decorations that have become her signature aesthetic. In Melbourne, there were flowers; in Cluj-Napoca, a tournament which leans heavily into its Dracula-related branding, Oliynykova has chosen a row of small bats on her cheeks.

""It's thematic,"" she said with a grin, before explaining that the tournament is a special one for her -- she had entered it for the first time last year, but didn't even make the qualifying cut-off. Now ranked No. 91 and assured of a new career high next week, that's not a problem she'll face again any time soon.

Oliynykova will have the opportunity to keep her dream run in just her second tour-level main draw going when she takes on No. 1 seed Emma Raducanu in the semifinals. The Briton came through a tricky quarterfinal against qualifier Maja Chwalinska 6-0, 6-4, showing controlled aggression to deal with the Pole's defense and finesse.

This time last year, Oliynykova was yet to face a Top 100 opponent. Now, she'll face her second Grand Slam champion within three weeks, having fallen 7-6(6), 6-1 to Madison Keys in the Australian Open first round. However, she has crossed paths with Raducanu before -- indeed, Oliynykova was the second opponent of Raducanu's professional career.

Back in 2018, they played at the lowest rung of the ladder -- the second round of ITF W15 qualifying in Nanjing, China, with a 15-year-old Raducanu making her professional debut. She defeated the 17-year-old Oliynykova 7-6(2), 6-1 before falling to Cao Siqi in the final qualifying round.

Snigur will play the last home hope standing, No. 3 seed Sorana Cirstea, after the Romanian dethroned defending champion and No. 5 seed Anastasia Potapova 7-5, 6-4.

Last year, Agassi dubbed that infamous Roland Garros kit one of his favorites, recalling how it his black denim shorts, hot-pink tights, matching pink-print top and headband, and sneakers famously drew the ire of International Tennis Federation president Philippe Chatrier, also the head of the French tennis federation, at Roland Garros in 1990.""At the time, [he] was thinking about bringing in a dress code,"" Agassi recalled, ""so I did what any noble person would do and I called him a bozo in the press conference.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

As he prepares for his maiden season in F1, Arvid Lindblad's approach has already impressed the Racing Bulls team.

Racing Bulls' leadership team have praised Arvid Lindblad for his “calm” and “professional” approach during the Barcelona Shakedown, with Team Principal Alan Permane admitting that the rookie's attitude reminds him of Isack Hadjar at the start of last season.

After joining the squad for their livery launch in January, Lindblad gained his initial mileage of the 2026 car during the event in Barcelona, putting in laps during Day 3 and Day 4 at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.

When quizzed at the end of the week on how impressed he had been by the 18-year-old both on and off the track, Permane answered: “Very impressed with both. He's very calm, he's very cool – nothing seems to faze him.

“He's a little bit like I described Isack last year – he just wants to learn, he just wants to take in as much information as he can. He's asking lots and lots of questions, he's asking lots of advice – how should he do this, how should he do that?

“And then of course we're helping him all the way. The most important thing – the pace – it looks like it's there. The two guys are very similar, so so far so good.”

Chief Technical Officer Tim Goss gave a similar assessment when asked earlier in the week for his take on how Lindblad was settling in, having praised the youngster for how he was handling the 2026 car – made to new technical regulations – so far.

“He's really calm, really professional, feedback is really straightforward,” said Goss. “For someone so young, it's really, really impressive. His session in the car has really just been about getting to grips with this breed of car.

“They're very, very different, not just the general handling of the car but the way you've just got to manage the energy and the energy management, and he's just been really, really cool, calm, professional.

“As we're getting to grips with the balance of the car, his feedback has just been really simple, really clear, so [we're] really, really impressed with him.”

Lindblad and Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson will next get behind the wheel of their new challenger when pre-season testing gets underway in Bahrain, with the first test running from February 11-13 while a second takes place across February 18-20.

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Lewis Hamilton was in high spirits at the end of a positive Barcelona Shakedown week for Ferrari.

Lewis Hamilton has spoken about an “incredibly enthusiastic” mood at Ferrari in the build-up to the 2026 season, with the seven-time World Champion feeling a “winning mentality in every single person more than ever”.

Hamilton and Ferrari enjoyed a solid start to F1's new era of regulations at last week's Barcelona Shakedown – the famous Italian marque working through their programme without major issues and learning plenty about the SF-26 package.

Sharing his reflections afterwards, Hamilton said: “It's been a really enjoyable week, honestly. I think a huge amount of work over the winter, on my personal side, but what the team have done over the winter to make changes going into the test.

“To see the mileage that we've been able to get the last couple of days due to just so much great work from all the people back at the factory, which I'm really grateful for because having consistency, not having problems…

“Of course, there's always small things, but we didn't really have any downtime moments. I'm sure they could potentially come over the next weeks, but otherwise just a really, really solid couple of days.

“We definitely have work to do to improve, of course, like everybody does, but I think we've had great debriefs, everyone's really on it – I really feel the winning mentality in every single person in the team more than ever, so it's a positive.”

Hamilton, who endured a difficult first season at Ferrari, went on to ponder what might lie ahead for himself and the team in 2026 – the Briton pointing out that the latest generation of F1 car “is actually a little bit more fun to drive”.

“Everyone's positive and incredibly enthusiastic,” he made clear. “I mean, we're under no illusions. We know we've got work to do. Mercedes have done great running as well. I think Red Bull and Haas did some great running as well, so we don't really know where we are, but I think it's a solid first week and we can really build from here.

“There may be some big leaps that we're going to need to take, and development's going to be key. Just really making sure we leave no stone unturned, and we're just really clear and concise with our communication and the decisions we take.

“It's going to take all of us to be at our best. I'm just seeing that everyone's really coming with new energy this year, which is great.”

Hamilton and the rest of the F1 field will be back in action in Bahrain next week, as the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way.

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Red Bull have created their very own power unit for the all-new 2026 regulations.

Max Verstappen has described a “good start” for Red Bull in 2026 following the debut of their new car and new power unit at the Barcelona Shakedown.

After some two decades of works and supply engine deals, Red Bull made the call to go in-house ahead of F1's new regulation cycle – preparing a bespoke power unit within a dedicated Red Bull Powertrains facility at Milton Keynes over the last few years.

Verstappen and new-for-2026 team mate Isack Hadjar completed the first laps with the Red Bull-powered RB22 during last week's running in Spain – and the initial comments from both drivers have been positive.

“I think overall pretty decent,” reflected Verstappen, who was shaking off a cold, as the Shakedown drew to a close.

“The first morning I didn't get to do too many laps, also with the weather basically, but [the final day] was good. I did a lot of laps, we learned a lot. Still a lot of things that we want to look into and do better, but that's normal, I guess.

“In general, with the new engine, to do the amount of laps that we did is very nice, and it's a good start for us, so yeah, positive, but it's still very early days.”

When asked about the key takeaways on the engine side, after Hadjar's “impressive” assessment, the Dutchman added: “Still a work in progress, but I think we've hit the ground running quite well with those things.

“It's still a very complicated formula, I think, for everyone, so there's still quite a bit of work to do, but it's normal.”

Speaking earlier in the week, Red Bull team boss Laurent Mekies hailed the entire organisation's efforts in getting to this point, having previously called the decision to build a power unit from scratch “as crazy as it gets”.

“I have to say, in terms of what we were expecting from the power unit on these first couple of days, I can only repeat how proud we are from everybody back at base to have managed to give us something that we can actually run with,” he commented.

“Of course, it's very early days and of course, nothing is perfect, but we could run, we could start to learn, work as one team, so that was a huge satisfaction.

“It doesn't change the size of the journey in front of us, but certainly it's a first moment that everybody in Milton Keynes should be proud of.”

Red Bull's new power unit, which has been designed in partnership with American automotive giants Ford, will also be used by their sister team, Racing Bulls, in 2026.

Cast your vote for the team you believe will have mastered the new rules right from the start of F1's new era.

The next chapter of Formula 1 is upon us, with the new-for-2026 regulations promising to shake up the pecking order.

This season the championship's rules have been revamped in the biggest shake up the sport has seen for more than a decade. A revised aerodynamic package will deliver new-look cars, while an overhauled set of power unit rules means we have got a roughly 50-50 power split between Advanced Sustainable Fuels and electrical energy.

On top of that, 2026 also brings us new terms to get familiar with such as Overtake, Boost and Recharge.

All of this begs the question – who from our cast of 11 teams has nailed the change in regulations? Well, we're giving you the chance to cast your pre-season – and pre-Bahrain testing – predictions as we ask just that, who do you think will be strongest right from the get-go?

""Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly,"" Camron Guthrie says on Instagram.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Savannah Guthrie‘s brother, Camron Guthrie, has a direct message for those suspected of abducting their mother, Nancy Guthrie.


	In a new video posted on Savannah's Instagram page on Thursday, Camron, a retired F-16 fighter pilot, pleads for those responsible “to reach out.” Investigators have said Nancy was likely taken against her will in a “possible kidnapping or abduction.”




	“This is Camron Guthrie. I'm speaking for the Guthrie family,” he said in the new video. “Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly. We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward. But first, we have to know that you have our mom. We want to talk to you and we are waiting for contact.”

					'Today' Show Gets Extra Security Amid Nancy Guthrie Suspected Kidnapping		
			









	Camron's new comments came a day after he, Savannah and their sister, Annie Guthrie, shared an emotional video on social media, where they addressed media reports about an alleged ransom letter.


	“Our mom is our heart and our home. She's 84 years old. Her health, her heart, is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, and she needs it not to suffer,” the Today show co-host said on Wednesday. “We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please. Reach out to us.”

	











	A ransom letter hasn't been directly confirmed by authorities, but the Pima County Sheriff's Department acknowledged the reporting of a ransom note, obtained by TMZ and at least two local news outlets in Arizona on Tuesday, saying that investigators are “following all leads.”


	Nancy, who takes essential medications and has mobility issues, was last seen by Annie's husband, Tommaso Cioni, when he dropped her off at her home in Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday night. The following day, she was reported missing by family members after she didn't show up for church service.


	The Pima County Sheriff's Department is investigating her disappearance, calling it a “possible kidnapping or abduction.” Nancy's home was also being treated as a crime scene, as blood discovered on the porch of her home tested positive as her own, authorities confirmed.


	Earlier on Wednesday, Sheriff Chris Nanos shot down reports that Cioni had been identified as a possible suspect, scolding members of the media who reported him as a person of interest without confirming it with investigators. He said in a statement shared on the sheriff's department's Facebook page, “At this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.”


Nanos also said in an interview with NBC News' Liz Kreutz on Wednesday that he remains hopeful that Nancy is still alive. “We have nothing else to go on but the belief that she is here,” he shared. “She's present. She's alive, and we want to save her.”

	











	In an update on Thursday, the FBI announced a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Nancy's discovery.


	”We believe Nancy is still out there,” Nanon added. “We want her home. The sheriff's department, along with all of our partners at the FBI, has been working around the clock, and we just want her home and to find a way to get to the bottom of all of this.”

A state senator will introduce legislation Friday that, if passed, would place a price cap preventing scalpers from reselling tickets for greater than their face value. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


	Ticket scalping could be facing major upheaval in New York, as a state senator is set to bring forward legislation that, if passed, would outlaw reselling concert tickets for more than they were originally purchased for.


	State senator James Skoufis will introduce several proposed amendments to New York's exiting ticketing laws on Friday morning, the most notable of which focuses on capping resale prices to the original face value ticket price. 




	“The total price at which a ticket reseller may sell or offer to sell a ticket to a live music concert or music performance may not exceed the total price of the initial ticket, inclusive of all fees and taxes, including those set forth in subdivision one of this section, in connection with the purchase of the initial ticket,” reads a draft of the bill Skoufis' office shared with The Hollywood Reporter.

	The news comes a day after California also announced similar legislation Thursday, marking major potential changes in two of the biggest live music markets in the world. 


	“The vast majority of the public is sick and tired of being locked out of these concerts,” Skoufis says. “It's a nightmarish process to be able to do something as simple as go see your favorite artist in this state. And this is a major proposal to try and stand up for that.”


	Other amendments Skoufis is proposing include a cap on fees for concert tickets, as well as an outlaw of speculative tickets, the widely-criticized practice in which brokers list tickets for sale that they don't actually have yet.


	So far, Maine is the only state in the U.S. that has managed to implement price caps on ticket resale. Other markets that have introduced this type of legislation include Maryland and Washington, D.C. Price caps have become an increasingly common legislative push from ticket reform advocates, who argue that removing the profit incentives from the resale market will turn scalpers off from resale. 

	











	Critics have long argued that resale caps stand in the way of a free market, and that ticket holders should have the right to do what they wish with their tickets, whether that's use them for themselves or sell them to someone else. Others in the industry, however, argue that tickets are not property, but rather a license for entry into a venue, and therefore shouldn't be treated like a market.


	“We've given the free market a chance here for decades and it hasn't worked,” Skoufis says. “And so it's time to to for government to step in and put up guardrails to protect the fans.” 


	The live music business has been an intense subject of legislation in recent years as fans have grown increasingly vocal of their dissatisfaction with the current system, from frustration over dynamic pricing and growing ticket fees to exorbitant pricing on the secondary market. Concerning the primary side, Live Nation, owner of the eponymous concert promoter and ticketing giant Ticketmaster, faces lawsuits from both the DOJ and FTC over monopoly allegations and claims of collusion with ticket brokers. Live Nation has denied the allegations. 


	Not listed in the draft language is how any sort of price cap would be enforced. When asked, Skoufis said  that “there are so many stakeholders who have a lot of money behind them that have a vested interest in making sure that this law is followed if it's passed.”


	He acknowledged more direct enforcement language would be needed, but added that if the rule isn't followed “after this bill is signed and becomes effective, you can be sure that [stakeholders] are going to be deploying their army of lawyers to bring these folks to court.”

Local producers have cautiously welcomed the new government guidelines, which will require streamers and channels to invest at least 8 percent of their net local turnover in locally-made content.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	German commercial broadcasters and international streamers are, unsurprisingly, attacking new government plans, unveiled this week, to force them to invest more in local productions.


	Ahead of the Berlin film festival, which kicks off Feb. 12, Germany‘s Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer unveiled the broad outlines of a plan that would require global streamers and domestic TV stations to invest at least 8 percent of their annual net turnover in European film and TV production. If they invest more than 12 percent, the investment can include the production of non-English language films and series made in Germany. Streamers will be required to give up certain rights to producers, eliminating the standard work-for-hire model.

	Alongside those sticks, Weimer offered a carrot, proposing to nearly double federal government funding for German film production to €250 million ($295 million) annually.


	Together, it's hope the proposals will help boost a struggling local industry. German is Europe's biggest television market and, behind France and the U.K., the continent's third-largest film market, but has been hit hard by the combination of rising production costs and declining local investment from streamers, who have broadly shifted from big-budget prestige projects like Netflix's Dark or Amazon Prime's The Gryphon, to cheaper reality TV formats and smaller scale dramas.


	VAUNET, the lobby group for German-based streamers and commercial channels, called the government proposals “a bitter disappointment for the media industry,” which “abandons the possibility of a quick and unbureaucratic solution.” The streamers have long opposed quotas and the idea of sharing rights with independent producers, dismissing the ideas as “outdated.”

	











	But the German proposals are tame compared to rules in neighboring France, where global streaming platforms are required to invest at least 20 to 25 percent of their annual local turnover in French and European content.


	The German production industry, which had hoped for a more robust investment requirement from the streamers, greeted the government announcement with cautious optimism.


	“The German film industry has been waiting a long time for this signal,” said Michelle Müntefering, CEO and representative for the executive board at German production body Produktionallianz, in a statement. “Good stories need not only creativity but also reliable framework conditions so that ideas can become tangible productions.”


	Germany's historic backlot Studio Babelsberg also welcomed “the long-awaited agreement,” saying it sent a “strong signal” for Germany as an attractive production location.


	“German studios, producers and service providers now have a positive outlook and long-term planning security,” said Babelsberg CEO Jörg Bachmaier.


	Added Müntefering: “This compromise builds bridges between creativity and economic responsibility and sends an important signal ahead of the upcoming Berlinale. Together, we can now show that Germany remains a vibrant place for storytelling, a place where cultural diversity becomes visible. German film has a future.”

Chinese creative Viv Li's doc, premiering in the Berlinale's Panorama Dokumente section, shows her in search of answers to the question of how to deal with your own culture after you have learnt another.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest – the title of her feature directorial debut describes how Viv Li, a self-described Chinese artist wannabe, has been feeling ever since she got stuck in Berlin after the COVID pandemic and ventured into the German capital's alternative culture scene.“A Chinese misfit ricochets between Berlin's alternative frenzy and Beijing's family order, transforming cultural whiplash into an offbeat search for identity and a playful quest for belonging,” reads a logline for the genre-bending movie that world premieres in the Berlin International Film Festival‘s Panorama Dokumente section on Feb. 13.

	Raised to follow traditional, “standard” family life, Li finds Berlin to seem to be bursting with excitement. But her family in China just can't stop wondering why she is such an oddball. “Drifting between new environments and traditional expectations, Li is constantly adapting to shifting opinions about herself, the world, and, of course, China, only to feel more lost than ever,” highlights a synopsis of the film.

	In Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest, we follow Li as she searches for herself, her identity, and a sense of belonging and acceptance in a globalized world. The result is a deep dive into the question: how do you deal with your own culture after you have learnt another?


	Li's journey is a kaleidoscope of, at times surreal, encounters. Nude swimming, anyone!? The exclusive trailer below will give you a better sense for the mix of the serious, the hilarious, and the offbeat in Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest. 

	











	“As I slowly put on the ‘hat' of a Berliner, I realized that all these years of learning to be the other, of being accepted, has weighed heavily on my mind, quietly mirroring the reality of my upbringing and where I am coming from,” Li, who has made the shorts I Don't Feel at Home Anywhere Anymore, Accross the Waters, and You Jian Chui Yan (A Soil A Culture A River A People), says in a director's statement. “But when I was finally home in Beijing, it became difficult to take off all the ‘hats' and to see my own face again.”


	Li wrote the screenplay and directed, and she handled cinematography, together with Janis Mazuch. The editor is Christoph Bargfrede, with sound design courtesy of Marcel Walvisch. Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest is produced by Corso Films in co-production with 100% Film and ZDF – Das Kleine Fernsehspiel. The producers are Daniela Dietrich, Erik Winker, Martin Roelly, and Ümit Uludağ. The co-producers are Olivia Sophie Van Leeuwen, and Ruby Deelen, Mediawan Rights is handling world sales.


	So, without further ado, check out an exclusive trailer for Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest. Get ready for tears – of sadness, of fear, and of laughter.


	Li talked to THR via Zoom from China about the path to her feature debut, why Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest will speak to people around the world, and what's next for her.


Can you share a little bit about why you decided to go on a search for identity via this film?












	I was born and raised in Beijing, and all my family is here, so I never really had an identity problem until I went abroad. I studied in the U.K. in Manchester, then I stayed in South America, was in Southeast Asia, and then I was traveling Europe. This is like a “the grass is greener on the other side” kind of thing. I just really wanted to experience other things, and I wanted to feel how other people lived, so when I went abroad, I wanted to stay longer to really get deeper into how other people live their lives. 


	And then, at one point, I realized, “Oh, holy shit, something is changing in me” after being abroad for so long. I was trying to adjust to all these things, and all these things stayed with me and were engraved in my memories. That's why, with the film, I wanted to portray the effect of memory and how these effects on us are constantly shifting.


Since I grew up in Austria, my father is Hungarian, and then I lived in the U.S. before moving to the U.K., I recognized the identity issue. How do you feel about your search now?


	I got a lot more into Buddhism recently. And then there's this one sentence: There's actually no self at the end of the day. When trying to search for oneself, the goal is the search, because there is no self. Nobody can really know who they are, because we're always changing. I find that very relevant nowadays, especially because the world is so connected, and we can travel so freely. That becomes more evidence that we will never have belonging, and we'll never have a real self.


Does that realization scare you or do you find it liberating?












	I think everything is about accepting. And once you accept the fact, then you can feel free about it. It's the same with death. We are so scared of death, but one day, if you really accept that you're going to die, then that fear will go away. And if you accept that there is no stable, static way of your being, you can feel quite comfortable with moving around.


There is a scene in the film where you guys are discussing how you learned how to be friends from watching Friends. Can you explain this and what it means?Yeah, when I was young, I was learning English, and one of my aunties gave me these pirated DVDs of all Friends episodes. I actually have Friends episode scripts printed there. That's how I learned English. I found it really interesting because you always see people like Phoebe saying, “Okay, can I talk to you a second over here?” And their behavior towards each other was so different from how I grew up, and I found that was the first really interesting, very intimate experience of how other people live. And I just realized, okay, you can actually treat friends in that way, and you can talk to your friends, and you can tell them what is wrong. That was how I learned English and how I learned the first steps of being in a Western society. 


There is also a scene in your film that felt so timely. It's a discussion about how the world is doomed, but we are all arguing and fighting with each other…


	That scene was not always in the cut. We had versions without it. Then my editor and I looked at the whole film, and we realized [this scene] does something to the film. Ultimately, the film is about non- judgment and non-definition. Opinions come and go, opinions are different, and there are always people who have their own perspective. But we just have to realize that no opinion or no judgment is the ultimate judgment or rule.

	











	I felt so small at that point, and I realized that the ultimate ending of a search is that you keep searching, rather than finding a result.


How easy or difficult is it to be in front of the camera and share various emotions with audiences?


	It was not always easy. But there is something I learned from my short film [I Don't Feel at Home Anywhere Anymore] that served as the beginning of the project. When I stepped in front of the camera rather than staying behind it – you already hold power as a director, you relax people. They will feel, “Okay, Viv is with me in front of the camera. She's as vulnerable as me.”


	I feel very comfortable doing it. It's also because I know, as a filmmaker, I know that the film is just a very tiny part of my life, and it's not really who I am. I feel very comfortable showing this part to form my story and to show an intimate moment to people who can imagine all the other parts. And for film, it is really important to give the audience space to make their own [narrative] and to think about their own story.


How much are the scenes we see in Two Mountains Weighing Down My Chest real, or how much are they scripted or set up?












	Most of the scenes at actual moments, and I realized when we were editing the film that all reenacted scenes were not as good as the original moment. I just feel that the original moment has its own power or vibe. The power of documentary is that you can really fall back on those moments and let those moments guide you. And what I really love about the film industry nowadays is that you can take real moments and fiction moments and weave them into each other. That's what I was trying to do with my film.


What have you learned about Berlin?


	I thought Berlin was super free, and I came here feeling I could explore different things. But I also realized that people try to ask you questions about definitions: Are you non-binary? Are you this and are you that? I feel that sometimes, with the world becoming so colorful and so many things going on, we tend to want more definition so we can feel safe within a box and stuff like that. But sometimes there is no definition. 


Are you working on any new projects?


	Yes, this time, I am writing a fiction script. It's based on a road trip that I took almost 10 years ago, but it's in a very early stage. However, over the past two years, I have also done some short fiction films, and I realized that with fiction films, I feel this community a bit more. Doing a documentary sometimes is really lonely. But with a fiction film, you work more within a group, within a collective, and I really enjoy that feeling. So I do want to take a break from being alone.

The 'Shark Tank' star warned celebrities who get political, such as the Grammy-winning singer, to ""shut your mouth.""


							By

Associate Editor


	It seems the latest Hollywood beef is between Mark Ruffalo and Kevin O'Leary.


	The Oscar-nominated actor, who has been very outspoken against Donald Trump and his aggressive immigration policies, took to Threads on Thursday to defend Grammy winner Billie Eilish, who used her acceptance speech on Sunday as an opportunity to slam ICE.




	“Kevin O'Leary why don't you STFU. It's hilarious,” The Avengers actor wrote. “You will go on any show and talk shit about any number of things and smugly expect us to listen to you, but you will dig into a real artist that dwarfs anything you dream of doing for actually saying something that resonates with 100's of millions of people the world over. It's astounding the fantasy double standard Kevin O'Leary lives in.”

	“You played yourself well in Marty Supreme,” he added, referring to O'Leary's role in the Josh Safdie-directed film, which saw him play Milton Rockwell, a cutthroat 1950s businessman and main antagonist.


	Ruffalo's remarks were specifically in response to the businessman and Shark Tank star's recent warning to the “Wildflower” singer and other celebrities who decide to get political on a public stage.


	“Half the people in politics that you piss off won't buy your music anymore,” O'Leary said on Fox News' America Reports on Tuesday. “Don't be stupid about it, but hey, they don't listen.”


	He added, “It's the first lesson 101 for celebrity: As you rise up, whether you're a film star, a music star [or] whatever, shut your mouth and just entertain.”


	On Sunday at the 2026 Grammys, Eilish used her time onstage after winning song of the year for “Wildflower” to speak out against the Trump administration's intense and controversial immigration enforcement. She also wore an “ICE OUT” pin on her outfit.

	











	“I feel so honored every time I get to be in this room,” she said in part. “And, as grateful as I feel, I honestly don't feel like I need to say anything, but that no one is illegal on stolen land. … It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now, and I feel really hopeful in this room.”


	Eilish then went on to urge the public to “keep fighting and speaking up and protesting,” before yelling, “Fuck ICE,” which was bleeped on the CBS telecast.


Bad Bunny, Shaboozey and Olivia Dean were among other artists at the ceremony to make anti-ICE comments.


	Ruffalo wasn't the only star that has come to Eilish's defense, as her brother, Finneas O'Connell, also took to social media recently to clap back at haters.


	“Seeing a lot of very powerful old white men outraged about what my 24 year old sister said during her acceptance speech,” O'Connell wrote on Threads. “We can literally see your names in the Epstein files.”

The infomercial-like retro video was written and directed by Swift and features a coda callback to the ""Graham Norton"" episode where the idea was seemingly hatched last October.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	What if we told you that a simple spray of “Opalite” spray would make you irresistible? That's the premise of Taylor Swift‘s eagerly awaited video for her The Life of a Showgirl single “Opalite,” which debuted on Apple Music and Spotify on Friday morning (Feb. 6). The retro-themed clip features Swift as a miss lonely hearts who spends her days pining for love in her bachelorette pad with her only companion coming in the form of a pet rock.

	The clip opens with a grainy, VHS-like throwback late night infomercial ad for the magical Opalite spray, which promises to turn your relationship “crappiness to happiness” with just one spritz. Sitting in her overstuffed living room, a housecoat-wearing Swift is roped into the ad's pitch, gazing at her giant rock friend longingly, as she takes the stone to the park for a ride on the swing, gingerly treating it like a human companion.


	Between making fold-up “cootie catcher” fortune telling games and friendship bracelets by herself, smearing glitter on herself and her stone, which she takes along to karaoke and a bar, Swift seems content with her inanimate companion. After seeing actress Greta Lee (The Morning Show) on MTV strumming a guitar, Swift orders drinks for her and her pet rock. But when she pours the martini onto her pal, the bartender kindly asks her to leave.

	











	Next, we see Swift doing a Jane Fonda workout on a step along with Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen & Slim), with her rock taking the place of weights. “You couldn't understand it/ Why you felt alone,” she sings as we see actor Domhnall Gleeson (The Paper) living an equally lonely life, laying in bed with a sleep mask on his forehead as he looks longingly at his companion, a tiny cactus tucked in next to him. He also takes his pal everywhere, even as his face and hands are increasingly swathed in bandages due to the plant's spikes.


	Desperate for relief, both he and Swift order some Opalite, which they spray on their significant nothers, at which point a goo-covered Swift magically appears in Gleeson's living room. The awkward couple begin their unlikely romance, with singer Lewis Capaldi making a cameo as a mall photographer who shoots them in increasingly bizarre poses.


	Their mall adventure continues with a stop at a soft pretzel shop and a stroll past a cactus kiosk, where Gleeson's spurned, spiky ex appears to be giving him two spiny middle fingers up and Swift's rock displays a not-so-friendly friendship bracelet message. Other cameos include British talk show host Graham Norton as the owner of an Opalite shop and actor Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) as an Opalite pitchman.


	The retro fun reaches its peak with a glittery dance routine featuring Swift and Gleeson doing adorable couples choreo at a dance competition where the elderly judges — as well as Swift dancer favorite Kameron “Kam” Saunders — seem unimpressed with their routine.


	The clip, written and directed by Swift, ends with a call-back to a Norton Show appearance in October featuring the new video's cast, during which Gleeson expressed his desire to one day be in a Swift music video, which begs the question of whether his comment was a bit, or a long con Easter egg Swift had planned all along?

	











	In an Instagram explainer Swift revealed, “When we were all talking during the broadcast, Domhnall [Gleeson] made a light hearted joke about wanting to be in one of my music videos. He's Irish! He was joking! Except that in that moment during the interview, I was instantly struck with an *idea*. And so a week later he received an email script I'd written for the ‘Opalite' video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton Show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn't mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90's with us and help with this video.”


	The “Opalite” video comes four months after Swift released her The Life of a Showgirl album, the Billboard 200 chart-topper that debuted at No. 1 following its Oct. 3 release and spent a total of 12 weeks at the pinnacle of the album chart. It's just the second visual from the singer's 12th studio album. The first, “The Fate of Ophelia,” debuted as part of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl event, which hit movie theaters before debuting on YouTube two days later.


	This time, however, Swifties will have to wait two days to see “Opalite” on YouTube, as it debuted today on Spotify and Apple Music only. The decision to delay the YouTube premiere follows YouTube's December announcement that it was withdrawing its streaming data from all of Billboard‘s charts.


	YouTube's withdrawal came on the heels of Billboard‘s Dec. 16 announcement of a change to chart methodology that will continue to weigh subscription streams more favorably than ad-supported streams, in a bid to better reflect changing consumer behaviors and the increased revenue derived from streaming in the industry. The change means that paid/subscription streams will be weighted against ad-supported streams at a 1:2.5 ratio, narrowed from the previous 1:3 ratio.

Prosthetic pasties & mesh were also involved, according to makeup artist Sasha Glasser.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	If there were a Grammy Award for most shocking red-carpet look, Chappell Roan almost definitely would have won with her daring, gravity-defying Mugler nipple-ring dress. But how did her team pull off the faux piercings while keeping the pop star relatively covered up?


	Gum wrappers — in part. Makeup artist and prosthetics expert Sasha Glasser revealed as much in an interview with Allure published a few days after the Sunday awards show, also sharing that she attached the gown's nipple rings to special-grade prosthetic nipple coverings painted to match Roan's exact skin tone. “The idea was for her to not be so naked,” Glasser told the publication of why they went with the blurred-out nipple look.

	











	Roan's styling team also layered small pieces of a stretchy nude mesh behind the prosthetics to pull off the illusion. And because they had to pierce the mesh and prosthetics with the nipple rings before they could paint them, Glasser says she and the musician's stylist, Genesis Webb, used gum wrappers to keep the rings clean.




	“Genesis and I tested it,” Glasser recalled. “We'd put the ring in the prosthetic and tug, and it would rip out, so that was scary.”


	By the time the red carpet came along, the team had pulled it off — and the result was jaw-dropping. Billboard‘s Instagram video of the look alone garnered more than 50 million views in just 24 hours alone. 


	Later, Roan posted about the discourse on Instagram, sharing photos of her look and writing, “Giggling because I don't even think this is THAT outrageous of an outfit.”


	“The look's actually so awesome and weird,” she added. “I recommend just exercising your free will it's really fun and silly … Thank you for having me @grammys and those who voted for me!!”


	After walking the red carpet, Roan changed outfits to a cream-colored dress to present the best new artist award, which she won in 2025. The prize went to Olivia Dean this year.

	The Super Bowl halftime show has become one of the most watched and culturally iconic stages in live entertainment— now it's time to find out what it really takes to make it happen. Marketing executive Bozoma Saint John joins Kristin Robinson on Billboard On The Record to pull back the curtain on the Super Bowl halftime show, from booking superstar talent like Beyoncé and negotiating with artists and brands to coordinating with the NFL and Roc Nation. Saint John shares how she convinced Beyoncé to take the stage and reflects on her experience blending music, sports and culture to create unforgettable moments. She breaks down the logistics and precision required to deliver those 13 unforgettable minutes—from rehearsals and stage builds to balancing sponsorships and artist priorities — offering a rare inside look at what it takes to make the Super Bowl Halftime show a spectacle of music, culture and strategy.

	Billboard On The Record is a podcast in partnership with SickBird Productions. 


Kristin Robinson:


What does it take to book a Super Bowl halftime show? Every year, superstar talent has taken the stage during the 30 minute break in the middle of the big game, and it's seen as the crowning achievement in an artist's career. And every year, it feels like the spectacle seems to get bigger and better than ever. So in this special episode of the podcast, we'll be talking about all things music in the Super Bowl, from the planning of the halftime show to getting music placed in the biggest ads of the entire year. Bozoma Saint John, thank you so much for coming to On the Record. 


	Bozoma Saint John:


	Yay!


How are you? 


	I'm great. I'm really good.


Well, thank you for coming, because this is our very special Super Bowl episode, and I felt like you were the perfect person to ask, because it's widely reported that you're one of the people who convinced Beyonce to do the Super Bowl halftime show once upon a time. And on top of that, you've worked at so many different iconic brands who have had ties to the Super Bowl in some way or another. Over time, you've worked at Pepsi, Uber, Apple Music, Beats, Endeavor, etc, etc, etc. So thanks for coming and doing this.


	Yeah, this is so exciting. I mean, first of all, I love sports and I love music, and so it's like the perfect, like, combination of those two things, yeah.


And I feel like recently, like at Billboard, my coworkers and I have been leaning more into covering the intersection of sports and music because I feel like it only increases over time. 


	Yes, yes. 


But that's actually one thing that I wanted to talk to you about before we get into Super Bowl stuff. I mean, you worked at Beats, and when I think of a company that did the sports and music thing, right, I think of Beats. 


Keep watching for more!

One last ride for Dreamville's finest.


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Nearly eight years after J. Cole introduced The Fall-Off‘s intro with KOD‘s “1985” closer in 2018, the Dreamville rapper's final album has arrived.


The Fall-Off hit streaming services on Friday (Feb. 6), tying a bow on the North Carolina icon's decorated career. The project is a double album (Disc 29 and Disc 39), which boasts 11 tracks plus a bonus on each, making 24 in total.


“The Fall-Off, a double album made with intentions to be my last, brings the concept of my first project full circle. Disc 29 tells a story of me returning to my hometown at age 29,” he wrote when revealing the album's tracklist on Instagram Wednesday (Feb. 4).

	Cole continued: “A decade after moving to New York, accomplishing what would have seemed impossible to most, I was at a crossroads with the 3 loves of my life; my woman, my craft, and my city. Disc 39 gives insight into my mindset during a similar trip home, this time as a 39-year-old man. Older and a little closer to peace.”

	











	When The Fall-Off was just hours away, the North Carolina native intensified hype surrounding the project with a trailer on Thursday (Feb. 6), which found Cole back in the makeshift studio of his childhood home that ignited his love for rap. The clip was soundtracked by a speech from English mathematician Andrew Wiles, and how he found beauty in the suffering through his labor of love.

	J. Cole announced the album officially in January and released his “Disc 2 Track 2″ single, which saw him cleverly rap about his life's story in reverse.


	Cole rang in his 41st birthday on Jan. 28 with a surprise, as he dropped the Birthday Blizzard '26 EP, which packaged four hard-hitting freestyles that were hosted by DJ Clue.


	There's been plenty of pump-fake retirements throughout rap history, but Cole is intent on The Fall-Off being his goodbye album. If this is indeed the finish line, what a ride it's been.

EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate has acquired worldwide distribution rights ahead of the European Film Market to the upcoming psychological horror film A Head Full of Ghosts, which has David Harbour (Stranger Things), Rebecca Hall (The Beauty), and Esmé Creed-Miles (The Sandman) in final negotiations to star.


	Filming is being lined up for March on the film from Team Downey, The Allegiance Theater and Fifth Season. The synopsis reads: “The Barretts' suburban life is torn apart when their teenage daughter's descent into madness becomes the subject of a reality show. Fifteen years later, her sister Merry faces her family's haunting past with a journalist, uncovering the very nature of the evil that destroyed them.”

	











	Based on the 2015 novel by Paul Tremblay, the film will be written and directed by Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, the duo behind the German-language cult horror Goodnight Mommy, which was Austria's 2014 Oscar entry for Best Foreign Language Film. The duo made their English-language debut with The Lodge, starring Riley Keough, which Neon released in 2020. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Lionsgate will be selling international rights to the movie at next week's European Film Market in Berlin. The studio will also handle domestic distribution, which is always a positive for international buyers considering pre-buys.


	Producers are Daniel Dubiecki and Lara Alameddine of The Allegiance Theater, Susan Downey and Robert Downey Jr. of Team Downey, alongside David Gambino, and Fifth Season. Lauren Bixby negotiated the deal on behalf of the studio. 

	











	Adam Fogelson, chair, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said: “We're thrilled to partner with Team Downey, The Allegiance Theater, and David Gambino, and our friends at Fifth Season, who collectively bring exceptional prestige and creative confidence to the project. This team's artistic vision for this terrifying story has been undeniable – striking, distinct and genuinely unsettling. It's no surprise that Stephen King called this book his favorite novel of the past decade and said that it ‘scared the living hell' out of him – which says it all.”


	Team Downey is represented by WME and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox. Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala are represented by WME and Black Bear.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Yesterday we brought you news of a hot game-to-TV adaptation from Craig Mazin. Today, we can break news that The Last Of Us, Superman and Alien: Romulus star Isabela Merced has been set to lead the movie adaptation of hit Sega videogame franchise, The House Of The Dead.


	As we first told you a little while back, this one should be in good hands with writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson, who did big things on screen for fellow zombie franchise classic Resident Evil.


	First released in 1997, The House of the Dead was a fast-paced, horror shooter with a groundbreaking zombie/creature premise. That included the innovation of giving its undead villains the ability to run, something that inspired films from Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake to Marc Forster-directed World War Z. It was The House of the Dead that first evolved the flesh-eaters from the lumbering stumblers that George Romero brought to life in his movies. In the arcade game, players take on the role of AMS agents, a government agency tasked with thwarting the conspiracies of organizations that threaten the world. The title comes from the bureau they work for, because their life expectancies are brief.

	Rocket Science will launch international sales at next week's European Film Market where the project will be a hot prospect given Merced's upward curve and the buzzy genre material. The partners very much see it as a franchise starter. CAA Media Finance is repping domestic.


	Anderson will produce alongside his Resident Evil partner Jeremy Bolt, Sega's Toru Nakahara (Sonic the Hedgehog) and Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson (Tomb Raider TV series), Michael Lawrence Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson. Isabela Merced will be executive-producing.


	The movie is described to us as “a top Sega priority” after the success of Sonic the Hedgehog, with the idea to make it as immersive as possible and with a story that plays out in real-time but with a “fresh take” on the franchise.

	











	Merced recently starred as Hawkgirl in Superman from director James Gunn and will reprise the role in the upcoming Man of Tomorrow. She starred in season two of The Last of Us and is set to return for season three, and is also known for 20th Century Studios' hit Alien: Romulus. She will next be seen in features Psyche and Ibelin.


	Anderson said: “The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart. We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films.”


	Nakahara added: “Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans.”


	Story Kitchen commented: “We're thrilled to bring together Isabela, Paul, Jeremy and Sega, alongside our partners at Rocket Science and CAA Media Finance. It's a powerhouse group coming together for a truly iconic property.”


	A 2003 movie version of the video game from Uwe Boll was largely derided and failed to ignite at the box office. Auspices are much better this go around.


	Merced is represented by CAA and Peikoff Mahan; Anderson by CAA, Ken Kamins at Key Creatives & Alexander Lea at Wiggin; Bolt by Alexander Lea at Wiggin; Story Kitchen by WME and Pryor Cashman; Toru Nakahara negotiated on behalf of Sega.

This is the type of remake they should do. The first House of the Dead was absolutely terrible. This is bound to be better.

Isabela Merced is great, I didn't really care about this movie but now I am kinda hyped.

hopefully it's better than the last 2 House of the Dead movies.

Charles C. Stevenson Jr., the actor known for playing bartender Smitty on Will & Grace, has died. He was 95.


	The actor, who also appeared on The Office, Shameless and Glee, among many other credits, died on Jan. 19 of natural causes in Camarillo, California, his son Scott confirmed to Variety.


	“In his own words, his job was ‘marrying or burying people,'” Scott told the outlet in a statement. “As he told it, the panic-stricken director would invariably come to him to beg him to find a way to fill in unscripted space between ‘We are gathered here together' (where he'd probably get his close-up) and the ‘amen' at the end of the scene (where he usually wouldn't). Stevenson admitted that he got pretty good at that.”

	











	Raised in Piedmont, California, Stevenson served in the Navy during the Korean War before studying English at UC Berkley. Stevenson began acting at age 50 after moving to Los Angeles to work in public service.


	Making his onscreen debut in a 1982 episode of NBC's Voyagers!, Stevenson went on to appear on shows like Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Dynasty, LA Law, Cheers, Knots Landing, Designing Women, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Sister Sister, Family Matters, Melrose Place, Boy Meets World, ER, Charmed, Scrubs, Gilmore Girls, House, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm and more.


	Stevenson also had roles in such movies as The Naked Gun (1988), Ed Wood (1994), Men in Black (1997), Pleasantville (1998), Ghost World (2001) and more.

Oh, Smitty.

Oh, Smitty! We'll miss ya!

Charlie was pure gold. An example how to not only be in this business but how to be in life. He was kindness, talent, and humor. All wrapped in one.

Love you Charlie

UPDATE: In a rare backtrack from Donald Trump‘s administration, the video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes has been removed from the U.S. president's Truth Social account. “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” an official said. 


PREVIOUS: Karoline Leavitt has defended an apparently AI-generated clip portraying Barack and Michelle Obama as apes shared on Donald Trump's Truth Social account.


	In a statement sent to Deadline, the White House Press Secretary said: “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

	Overnight, the U.S. president's verified account twice posted a minute-long video about voting machine anomolies, which features the PatriotNewsOutlet.com watermark. In the final moments of the video, a two-second clip flashes up showing the Obamas as apes, dancing in a jungle setting to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”


	The clip of the Obamas features an “@XERIAS_X” watermark, and it appears that the account originally posted the video in October last year. The 55-second video portrays Trump as a lion, while Hillary Clinton and Zohran Mamdani are depicted as a warthog and hyena respectively.


	The @XERIAS_X account has a profile photo of Pepe the Frog dressed as Trump. The account claimed credit for the “fighter jet poop” AI video posted by Trump during the “No Kings” protests last year.

	











	The White House did not respond to Deadline questions about whether Trump personally shared the post on Truth Social, or if he was aware of the Obama clip inserted into the voting machine video.


	The post was condemned by Trump's critics. California Governor Gavin Newsom's X/Twitter account said: “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”

Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now. https://t.co/X09h1mcj74


	The post came amid a flurry of updates on Trump's Truth Social. Other clips shared on the president's account included a dog magically appearing from behind a kitchen counter when hearing the sound of whipped cream being squirted.


	Trump's Truth Social account has previously shared posts that have been condemned as racist. Last year, the account shared a video that showed the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, with a fake mustache and sombrero.


	Jeffries denounced the memes at the time and has done the same with the Obama post. “President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans. They represent the best of this country,” he said. “Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder. Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual? Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Margot Robbie wears replica of bracelet made of Brontë sisters' hair to 'Wuthering Heights' UK premiere","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/05/style/margot-robbie-wears-bracelet-made-of-emily-brontes-hair-to-the-wuthering-heights-uk-premiere/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:14:26 GMT","

Margot Robbie drew direct inspiration from the Brönte sisters for Thursday's “Wuthering Heights” UK premiere in London.

The actress walked the wildflower-lined red carpet wearing a head-turning Dilara Findikoglu corset gown finished with faux blond braids, along with Manolo Blahnik heels.

But it was the hairwork bracelet on her left wrist that instantly caught our eye: a perfect replica of a 175-year-old mourning bracelet once owned and worn by Charlotte Brönte.

Mourning jewelry dates back as far as the 16th century, but became particularly popular during the Victorian era. Rings, bracelets, pendants and other pieces were crafted in memorial of deceased loved ones, often incorporating their locks.

“Wuthering Heights” author Emily Brönte and her sister Anne died five months apart, in December 1848 and May 1849, respectively.

Upon the death of her siblings, Charlotte Brönte commissioned the original bracelet fashioned from their hair, woven together and intertwined for all eternity.

The historic piece is finished with a gold clasp set with garnets. Charlotte is said to have worn the special bracelet every day, and it has been owned by the Brontë Parsonage Museum since 1923.

Robbie's replica was created by Wyedean Weaving, a fourth-generation, family-owned West Yorkshire manufacturer based in Haworth, where the Brönte sisters lived.

“The [Brönte Parsonage Museum] holds the world's largest collections of Brontë manuscripts, clothing and personal possessions and we take our responsibility as custodians extremely seriously,” the institution's director, Rebecca Yorke, shared in a press release.

“This event has offered us an unprecedented opportunity to share an item from our collection and tell its story with a global and contemporary audience, and we are delighted that, thanks to director Emerald Fennell, Margot Robbie and everyone involved with the film, Emily Brontë and her masterpiece continue to be part of popular culture almost 200 years after her death.”

Even Robbie's dress — constructed from sheer silk chiffon, fitted with a fully boned corset bodice and crisscrossed with golden braids from top to toe — was inspired by the mourning jewelry.

The synthetic hair incorporated into the design was hand-dyed to precisely match the Brontë sisters' locks.

Around Robbie's neck was a braided choker that echoed the look of the one-of-a-kind bracelet, and she and stylist Andrew Mukamal turned to Jessica McCormack for some additional sparkle, choosing garnet, diamond and pearl earrings along with a 4-carat ruby ring.

A duo of archival Boucheron brooches set with glimmering red stones — one from 1900, the other from 1920 — finished Robbie's regal look.

Keeping up with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

The reality star gave an update on her relationship with her ex-husband in a Complex interview published Thursday, nearly one week after news broke that she and Lewis Hamilton are secretly dating.

“We'll always be family,” the Skims creator, 45, told the magazine. “We both know that. We will be OK, and there's so much love for our family.”

The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum insisted they both “want what's best for [their] kids” — daughter North, 12, son Saint, 10, daughter Chicago, 8, and son Psalm, 6.

The former couple started dating in 2012 and tied the knot in Italy two years later.

Kardashian filed for divorce in February 2021, with the union legally coming to an end the following November.

West, 48, married wife Bianca Censori in December 2022.

That same month, Kardashian cried over co-parenting with West during an episode of the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast.

She similarly told “Kardashians” viewers in November 2025 that she felt like “snapping” over their “hard” dynamic.

“I just can't really engage,” she said in last year's episode. “I think it's just for the better.”

Kardashian and West have also butted heads over her love life since splitting, with the Grammy winner infamously taunting his ex-wife's first boyfriend post-divorce, Pete Davidson, in 2022.

The Hulu personality reflected on the experience on “Call Her Daddy” in October 2025, saying, “That made me feel really sad. That really wasn't fair for [Davidson].”

Kardashian has since been linked to Odell Beckham Jr. and Tom Brady, most recently making headlines for her and Hamilton's romance.

She and the F1 driver, 41, enjoyed a romantic getaway across the pond over the weekend, traveling from the Cotswolds to Paris.

West, who has previously spoken highly of Hamilton before, has yet to comment on the budding relationship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Dr. Robby begins to crack on The Pitt","https://www.avclub.com/the-pitt-recap-season-2-episode-5-1100-a-m","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 03:03:29 GMT","

Every time I finish an episode of The Pitt, I wish I could just jump ahead to watch the next one. That's especially true of “11:00 A.M.,” which introduces some wildly compelling new threads to the season but also ends before any of them really have a chance to get anywhere. This is the premise of the show, of course. The real-time, limited perspective of the ER setting means we often leave stories dangling, with no clear resolution on what will happen next—like the septic waitress who heads up to surgery, where other doctors will now be fighting to save both her life and her leg. But the best episodes of the show manage to find some kind of central theme anyway, and I'm not entirely sure “11:00 A.M.” does.

Then again, maybe the lack of cohesion is the theme of the week. This episode features some of the most dramatic but also some of the goofiest storylines of the season. And perhaps that's the best way to sum up the true ER experience. In one room, someone is dealing with an embarrassing but also easily treatable bout of constipation. In another, someone is fighting to stay alive. And in another, someone is trying to face death with dignity. How could that kind of environment ever feel cohesive? 

What's most notable about “11:00 A.M.” is that this is the episode where Dr. Robby first starts to crack. Only this time around, it's not because of an overwhelming case load or a particularly challenging patient—it's because he finally has to interact with Langdon. Last week we got the (I think new) information that Langdon was only called into work today because someone else called out. Robby planned to head off on his sabbatical before his old mentee returned to work. In fact, there's a chance that avoiding Langdon is actually what inspired Robby's sabbatical in the first place. Only now there's nowhere to run in the close quarters of the ER, and that's clearly sending Robby reeling. 

Where most of Langdon's colleagues are almost over-the-top in their show of support, Robby is bitter and snarky and sometimes downright cruel to his former protégé—who he blames for letting the infected waitress fall into sepsis. But is that because Robby truly feels like he can't trust Langdon anymore? Or is our dear attending just letting his feeling of betrayal get in the way of his medical objectivity? Either way, Robby and Langdon's fights over the waitress' treatment are brutal—especially when it spills over into Robby yelling at a surgical intern. Yet the way they instantly fall into sync while helping Louie in the episode's cliffhanger suggests their former chemistry is still buried in there somewhere too. 

Beyond the cracks in Robby's façade, the most interesting thing about “11:00 A.M.” is the new patients it introduces. From the confused way the doctors react to the protocol around prisoner patients, it seems pretty clear that Westbridge is the hospital that usually handles medical cases from the local prison. And that brings back some of that sense of discovery I talked about in my recap of the premiere. Where the PTMC doctors set their watches by the morning rush of elderly patients from nursing homes, they don't know anything about handcuff protocol or prison malnutrition or prison-security-guard demeanor. And that gives them a whole new world to discover as they figure out how best to treat their patient's brutal wounds. 

It's a storyline that could go in any number of different directions from here. It's possible we'll get some big twist about why the prisoner is locked up or what he was jumped for. Or it's possible the show will just keep this story grounded in an exploration of the inhumanity of the U.S. prison system. Either way, I'm really curious to see how The Pitt handles this new kind of patient archetype.  

I feel the same way about the home hospice care couple and their “death doula,” night shift charge nurse Lena (Lesley Boone), who turns out to have a very unique side gig. The whole storyline introduces a brand-new energy to the series. There's an immediate crisis that brings the couple to the ER—the wife had a seizure and injured her leg in the process. But her impending death adds different stakes to how the hospital treats her. For most patients, the fact that their injury doesn't need surgery and will heal in six weeks is good news. But for Roxie, it's a reminder that she may not be alive in six weeks. 

It's a quiet tragedy—as is the moment Roxie loses yet another bit of dignity by having to use a bedpan when she can't walk to the bathroom. But the addition of a warm, comforting, pragmatic death doula adds another emotional layer to the dynamic. Part of The Pitt's mission statement is to teach the American public about elements of health care they might not know about. And death doulas are a welcome addition to that list. 

With all that heaviness in the mix, The Pitt makes the fascinating choice to go full-on comedy of errors this week too. While Joy proves her mettle by thinking outside of the box about medical bills, Ogilvie follows in Whitaker's footsteps by having the worst possible first week in the ER. Not only is he exposed to tuberculosis (apparently 70 percent of doctors in training at urban hospitals are), he also gets to perform a fecal disimpaction that turns into literally explosive diarrhea. 

In fact, this episode is downright goofy at times—from Langdon and Donnie immediately agreeing that they want to watch the video of their patient getting willingly branded with dry ice (I laughed so hard) to the poor dislocated shoulder patient getting transferred from PTMC to Westbridge to PTMC again. But in its own way, that only adds to the madness. We're officially a third of the way through this shift/season, and while the train isn't fully off the tracks yet, this “normal” day is starting to get a whole lot more complicated. And with dear, sweet Louie coding, there's no signs of things getting easier next hour either.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The heated rivalry between Candiace and Rob comes to a head on The Traitors","https://www.avclub.com/the-traitors-recap-season-4-episode-8","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 03:59:00 GMT","

To say that Rob Rausch has snake-charmed his way through this season of The Traitors is an understatement. The Love Island alum has amassed a cabal of groupies both inside the castle (we see you, Dorinda Medley) and out (per The Cut, TikTok at large) with his shirtless overall wearing and disarmingly quiet nature. It's been impressive to see just how long that spell would hold over this season's cast, with Rausch's heartthrob status and low-key charm thus far successfully masking his sinister schemes and ruthless gameplay. 

So it's equally entertaining to watch that viper meet his venomous match in fellow Traitor Candiace Dillard Bassett, who's fanged and ready to take him down in the wake of his betrayal against Lisa Rinna last episode. “A careful assassin serves her revenge cold,” Candiace hotly kicks off this week's ep. “So right now I'm putting my platter in a good ol' deep freezer and when the time is right, I will pull it out and serve it.” 

With Rinna banished, there's a space to fill in the turret. Rob and Candiace can either murder a Faithful as usual, as host Alan Cumming tells them, or recruit one to join them in their cloaked duplicity. They choose the former, though it would have been a far juicier TV moment for Candiace (who Rob willingly defaults to in the evening's decision as a sort of penance for the Lisa move) to not disclose her decision to murder Colton Underwood and instead let Rausch find out that his closest ally is dunzo alongside the rest of the cast at breakfast the next day. Alas. “The goal of this murder was to cut the alliance between Rob and Colton,” Candiace says, though Rob is right to point out that the killing will only draw a direct line back to the Housewife. 

The bulk of the house is indeed throwing Candiace's name around, especially with that glaringly retaliative vote against Rob during last week's roundtable. It certainly doesn't help her that Rausch himself—who still has that deadly dagger advantage, giving him not one but two votes in an upcoming roundtable—is fanning the speculation by claiming Colton dropped her name before he was banished. At the same time, Candiace is trying to redirect those castle suspicions to her former ally, bringing up how flustered the snake wrangler was discussing Colton's departure at the breakfast table that morning. 

Candiace is far from happy, then, when Rob is chosen as one of three players to get a potential shield in this week's mission, which requires the rest of the house to reenact paintings and have the trio of seekers (Rausch, Kristen Kish, and Mark Ballas) match them in a dusty old gallery via walkie-talkie. “Everybody wants to drink Rob's bathwater because he's such a Faithful,” Candiace grumbles, but it ends up being a quick-thinking Kish who realizes the shield is hidden inside one of the painting's canvas backings. 

With the mission complete and another $12,000 added to the growing prize pot (which now stands at $150,800), we're back in the ring for more Traitor-on-on Traitor fisticuffs. After Johnny Weir warns her that people are coming for her, Candiace goes straight to the source: Rob. It's a fiery exchange, one of dodged apologies (“You also told Lisa you're sorry,” Candiace pointedly reminds him) and cold-blooded threats. “You are a snake…if I get banished tonight, your name is coming up,” the Housewife promises.  

It's not a surprise, then, that their heated rivalry fires up the roundtable. Despite some early quibbling over whether or not Stephen Colletti could potentially be a Traitor—another name-drop from the late Colton—much of the evening's deliberations are focused on Candiace's throwaway vote against Rob from the table prior. (“Colton was being used as Rob's beard!” Candiace shoots back, which, coupled with Johnny Weir gamely choking out Eric Nam during the mission earlier, will no doubt make a specific subset of the internet go feral.) 

Candiace, unsurprisingly, votes for Rob, and vice versa, but the coffin nail against the Housewife is actually hammered in by Johnny, who begrudgingly decides to run with the evidence presented and go against his Potomac pal. Yes, we officially have a back-to-back Traitor banishment, with Candiace revealing her treacherous identity to cast cheers. She's left hopeful that the rest of the castle will take her exit as a reason to look more closely at Rob's gameplay: “If they don't? The joke is on them. So good luck to you all.” 

Said snake slithers his way up to the turret that evening solo, but Alan tasks him with recruiting a Faithful into his duplicity. He's already got Mark in his pocket, he reasons, and Johnny is a bit too high risk, so he opts for Eric, who isn't pleased to receive that middle-of-the-night missive. “I can't deal with this,” the crooner cries. “I just want to be left alone. This is what happens when you're nice!” It'll be interesting to see if Nam can slink and slide along Rausch or if he, too, will get gobbled up by Rob's game.

[Editor's note: Episode four of A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms arrived today on HBO Max.]  

Exactly how long Ser Dunk (Peter Claffey) sits in that cell isn't clear. It's long enough for the torchlight dancing off the damp stones of House Ashford's dungeons to play tricks with ser's eyes. They look to us like the stars above Westeros, just as they seem to Dunk. It's a moment of strange, cosmic beauty rarely found in the televised A Song of Ice And Fire and a brief, calming reprieve for our hero from the stresses of the night and morning to come. There's no shooting star in this sky (though one does appear for poor Dunk later on, courtesy of Youssef Kerkour's Steely Pate), but the fleeting serenity it provides is gift enough. A small mercy.

In an episode rife with symbolism and meaning, that vivid night sky represents Ser Dunk's inner clarity and why he meets the chaos of Westeros with such an open heart. As A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms has established astonishingly well with its limited screen time, Ser Duncan The Tall may not be the sharpest knight at Ashford Meadow, but he is by leagues the kindest. It's how he was brought up. Ser Arlan (Danny Webb) led him with a firm but fair hand, setting a humble example of what a knight is—or ought to be. 

That's what makes the final moments in this week's episode so heartbreaking, at least before Prince Baelor Targaryen (Bertie Carvel) rides unheralded to save Dunk from defeat. Brought before the people of the Reach to rally two more knights to his cause—another predicament courtesy of Prince Aerion (Finn Bennett), who invokes a trial of seven after Dunk put a fist through his royal visage—the silence that meets him is stunning. The Brute Of Brackyn breaks the tension with wind, a comic and concise shorthand for the kind of honor this world more often must suffer. With that stink, a question hangs in the air: What hope does a good man have against the powerful, cruel, and indifferent? 

Take comfort in knowing Dunk's kindness is what has gotten him this far, despite last week's dramatic detour. That's the moment when Aerion, offended by Tanselle Too-Tall's (Tanzyn Crawford) slaying of a mummer's dragon, snapped her finger in two. Dunk, driven by righteous indignation, put him on the ground—no less than what's expected from a chivalrous knight. They vow to protect the innocent, he later reminds Prince Baelor, and even if he may have never said the words, he assessed an ugly situation with open eyes, saw an innocent threatened, and, with a just heart, took action. Predictably, the regret he feels as he stews under lock and key isn't for defending Tanselle but for not seeing the real mummers' show performed right in front of him by his newly entrusted squire, Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). 

“It's just a bit of bad luck we found each other, isn't it?” Dunk says to Egg, who enters the dungeon in the colors of his house and with tears in his eyes. The way Dunk speaks to the boy is a far cry from their sweet monkeyshines from episodes past, though his curt retorts to Egg's apologies are more him grasping the enormity of the boy's importance to the realm than hostility born from betrayal. Egg's uncle is the Hand Of The King. His true name is Prince Aegon V Targaryen, a name shared with four kings—including the Conqueror. More than that, he's a little boy who wanted nothing more than to squire for his brother Daeron (Henry Ashton), who instead shaved the boy's head and drank the tourney away in hiding. Would he have squired for a donkey under the circumstances? Maybe. But he wound up with Ser Duncan to their mutual benefit. 

While Egg's motivations are understandable and even forgivable, Prince Baelor points out—firmly but fairly—that little Aegon should never have brought Dunk to Tanselle's rescue; that was no kindness. “One need not intend harm to do it,” he says. Baelor, like Egg, knows which members of their house are trouble, but family remains family, for good or ill. “The septons say we must love our brothers,” Baelor says, understanding both Egg's anger and the mechanisms that keep House Targaryen in power. It's interesting that Baelor invokes the Faith Of The Seven here. As Dunk later discovers, Targaryens use their adopted religion not just to assimilate into the realm they conquered, but to their advantage when it benefits them, as Aerion soon proves.

Equally telling is how deftly Baelor navigates his family's latest tantrum, stating the case made against Dunk while seeing right through it. Aerion casts Tanselle's puppet show as high treason (innocent though it may have been, it was “far from wise, even in peacetime,” he says), and Daeron, found by his father Maekar (Sam Spruell), accuses Dunk of kidnapping Aegon as a robber knight. Whether Baelon believes any of it isn't up for debate—he doesn't, as Dunk eventually learns to his relief—but it hardly matters. Dunk laid hands on the Blood Of The Dragon, and that must be answered for. Still, this exchange reflects how tenuous Targaryen rule has become. Without dragons, the royal house must rely on the love of the people to remain secure. Yet love is hard to come by when dragons torment the smallfolk. Baelor knows this line between justice served and justice denied. He would make a magnificent king. 

And now for Dunk's latest pickle: finding six knights willing to face Aerion's in a trial of seven. Ancient tradition holds, by Baelor's telling, that if seven champions fight against seven in tribute to their gods, the guilty will be punished. (Note how Carvel looks at Bennett as he delivers the final line, direct but not without careful affection; also check his muted amusement as Aerion wriggles justification for his cowardice in front of Maekar.) Aerion finds his recruits easily—his lord father, drunken brother, and three Kingsguard are easy gets, as is the pliable Ser Steffon Fossoway (Edward Ashley)—while Dunk learns how cheaply justice can be sold when Steffon trades his brief oath for a promised lordship. 

Yet where ambition attracts opportunists, justice gathers the worthy: Egg rallies Ser Lyonel Baratheon (Daneil Ings), the humbled Ser Hardyng (Ross Anderson), mad Ser Rhysling (William Houston), and Ser Beesbury (Danny Collins) by dawn's light, with Raymun Fossoway (Shaun Thomas) offering his sword as a fresh knight as well. Only one knight remains—and if Baelor “Breakspear” makes Dunk wait, it's not due to reluctance but the weight of donning armor against one's own blood, even when the cause is so plainly just.

This takes us back to something Dunk says to Raymun before hope rides onto the tourney grounds at Ashford. “Maybe the gods figure this is what I deserve…for not knowing my place.” Everyone in Westeros has a role to play, big or small, and Dunk is no different. But why does it weigh so heavily on him? Look at the moment when Dunk considers the puppet head of Florian The Fool. It's a striking image, Dunk pondering who he is and what he must become to honor the memory of Ser Arlan. (For the deceased ser's part, that memory offers a good-natured shrug.) What use is a knight if he doesn't defend the innocent? What more must he be to be truly good? For starters, he should be someone who is true to himself, who doesn't hide what he really is. In the eyes of a mummer's knight, Dunk finally sees what he's been pretending to be—and realizes he's got to drop the act if he's to survive the morning.

The night brought stars but little hope. Yet just before dawn, Steely Pate gives Dunk his shield—with Tanselle's parting gift of a shooting star over a mighty elm and all the hope it carries. Pate describes the work he's done to refurbish Dunk's shield, but he may as well be speaking about Dunk, who willingly bears the burden of truth earned the hard way. “It'll be heavier now,” he says. “But stronger, too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Michael Shannon and his terrifying eyes are remaking horror classic The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari","https://www.avclub.com/michael-shannon-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-remake-dowdle-brothers","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 03:47:59 GMT","

It's actually kind of surprising, given how foundational it is to the art of horror in cinema, that nobody's ever landed a really serious effort to remake Robert Wiene's 1920 German Expressionist classic The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari. Sure, there have been a few token attempts over the last century of movie making, but most have either failed, or been so distant from the source material as to be basically unrecognizable. But maybe filmmakers have just been waiting for an actor possessed of sufficiently intense and off-putting vibes (and eyes) to come along and take over the part of Werner Krauss' infamous, possibly mad hypnotist/psychologist. Cue Michael Shannon!

This is per Variety, which reports that Shannon has signed on to take on the title role in Doctor Caligari's Cabinet Of Wonders. (To be clear, he's playing the doctor, not the cabinet.) The film is being written and directed by John Erick Dowdle, working with his brother and frequent producing partner Drew, who previously worked with Shannon on their Paramount Network series Waco. The film is being financed and produced by independent film studio Anton, which will also handle sales of it at the upcoming European Film Market. As in the original—held up to this day as a landmark movie in terms of allowing its visuals and environments to reflect characters' fractured psyches—the movie will see Shannon's Caligari act as “a traveling mesmerist who journeys from town to town with a sleepwalker under his control, leaving a trail of grisly murders in their wake.” (Whether the new film will adopt the movie's semi-infamous framing sequence, which features a twist that many film scholars feel subverts its anti-authoritarian principles, remains to be seen.)

The upshot of all this is that it's really hard, from where we're sitting, to imagine an actor better suited to a role that requires dominating others through sheer force of will (and intense staring) like this one. The Dowdles clearly agree, with John Erick Dowdle noting in a statement that, “Having worked with Michael Shannon on multiple projects, my brother and I have seen firsthand the unnerving intensity he can bring to even the simplest moments. The idea of seeing him play the horrifying Doctor Caligari became an obsession for us. The trust and creative shorthand we've built together will allow us to push deeper and bolder as we reimagine this iconic German Expressionist classic for a modern audience. I couldn't be more excited to bring this nightmare to life with him.” Filming on the movie is expected to begin in June.

With apologies to Mr. Wizard's apprentices and the residents of Beakman's World, the National Academy Of Television Arts And Sciences has voted to celebrate the life and achievements of Bill Nye, science person, with a lifetime achievement award. Per Variety, Nye will receive the award—recognizing a career spent as a scientific educator, TV host, environmental advocate, and guy getting blown around in a wind tunnel in a funny way—at this year's installment of the Children's & Family Emmy Awards in March.

Nye, who spent six seasons as the star and co-creator of Bill Nye The Science Guy, was originally an engineer for Boeing before moving into comedy and TV in the 1980s, eventually successfully pitching (along with co-creators James McKenna and Erren Gottlieb) a show that updated Watch Mr. Wizard with editing and energy more akin to MTV. Nye has continued to make science-minded TV shows with some regularity in the intervening years, most recently for Netflix in 2017, when Bill Nye Saves The World ran for three seasons on the streamer.

The TV host gave a statement in response to the award, writing, in endearingly dorky fashion, that:

This is quite an honor. Thank you. As you may know, I pretty much put my heart and soul into all the shows I've worked on. I believe that the process of science is the best idea humans have ever had. I loved making shows that encouraged kids of all ages to embrace the P, B, and J—the Passion, Beauty, and Joy—of science, while also showing that you, the viewer, can change the world. I've spent my life doing what I love, and this award is not only a celebration of my past work, but a reminder of the impact we can have if we choose to invest in science education and the next generation of leaders.

TMZ founder Harvey Levin just revealed shocking new details about the ransom letter his outlet received in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie. 

Levin appeared on CNN on February 5, 2026, shortly after Savannah's brother, Camron Guthrie, appeared in a new social media video, appealing to whoever may be holding their mom hostage. The post was uploaded at 5 p.m. in Tucson, Arizona, which was the first deadline outlined by the writer of a ransom note sent to three media outlets, including TMZ, authorities confirmed during a press conference earlier that day. 

Savannah, Camron, and their sister Annie appeared in a video on February 4, noting that they're “ready to talk” but pleading with their mom's captor to provide them with something to prove their mom is alive. 

Camron's February 5 video, uploaded to Savannah's Instagram account, came as the first deadline was passing, with him saying, “Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you. We haven't heard anything directly.” 

Appearing on CNN in an interview with Anderson Cooper, Levin said they might never hear from the person who wrote the ransom letter, which TMZ received earlier in the week and forwarded to authorities. 

“It specifically says there will be no further communication,” Levin told Cooper. “They say no negotiation and no communication. I will tell you that the first words in the letter are that Nancy is safe but scared. They also say she is aware of the demands made in this ransom letter.”

Levin later said that whoever wrote the “carefully crafted letter” seems to be “a rational actor,” noting, “This is a letter that really spells out precisely what they want done, what the consequences are if they don't get what they want. They layer it, so things changed today at 5 o'clock Tucson time. They talk about her health, that she's okay.”  

“I don't know if this actually is the person who has Nancy Guthrie,” he added, “but the way this letter is crafted, it is a rational actor.” 

At the press conference held earlier in the day, FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke, Phoenix Division, confirmed that the ransom letters received by three different media outlets (TMZ and two Arizona news stations) were identical. He also confirmed that the letter outlined two deadlines for meeting the kidnapper's demands — one at 5 p.m. on February 5 and, if that passed without action, the other would be on Monday, February 9. 

“I know you're choosing your words carefully, as you should, and we want you to,” Cooper told Levin during their CNN discussion, inquiring about the deadlines. “Can you just share anything else about that?” 

“So, the deadline that just passed had to do with the demand,” Levin said, later confirming that the writer asked to be paid via Bitcoin. “The Monday deadline has more to do with consequences, and Anderson, that's … about as much as I can say. I think everybody kind of knows the way this plays out when people write ransom notes.” 

Cooper then asked what TMZ's  IT team found when trying to decode where the emailed ransom note came from and Levin answered, “Well, it's really complicated and it's kind of above my skill level, but I will tell you that I had my IT guys talk to the FBI. We couldn't crack it and honestly, the way my IT team explained it, I don't think that authorities have cracked it either.” 

Levin also said that “the letter even says ‘the police will be no help to you.” He theorized that the level of sophistication in covering up any digital tracks was another signal to authorities that the ransom letter could be legitimate. He also said he thinks Nancy is likely still in the Tucson area. 

He explained, “I've been reading this letter over and over, and I now feel more strongly than ever, based on something that's in this letter — I believe there's a radius around Tucson of where this person may be. And if this person really does have Nancy Guthrie … I think there is a radius around Tucson that they kind of disclose in this demand letter. I mean, they say as much — say that she is within a certain radius.”

Anyone with information on the case is encouraged to call 1-800-CALL-FBI or to email online@tips.fbi.gov.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","FBI Dramatically Increases Reward Offer in Search for Nancy Guthrie","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nancy-guthrie-reward-money-increased/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:06:52 GMT","

In a press conference on February 5, 2026, local and federal authorities revealed new details about the search for Nancy Guthrie, and announced a $50,000 reward for anyone who leads them to the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, who disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, overnight on February 1. 

Savannah and her siblings — sister Annie and brother Camron — released a heartbreaking video via social media on the evening of February 4, tearfully reading messages for their mom and those authorities believe abducted her. Midday on February 5, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos led a press conference in which he made it clear they have not named any suspects. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke, Phoenix Division, announced a new reward of up to $50,000, increased from a reward of $2,500 offered earlier in the week. 

Anyone with information on where Nancy might be has been encouraged to call 1-800-CALL-FBI or by emailing online@tips.fbi.gov. 

Janke said the FBI is now working closely with the Pima County Sheriff Department, noting, “We're going to start today by announcing a $50,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie and or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.” 

An updated reward poster issued by the FBI states, “The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Phoenix Field Office and the Pima County Sheriff's Department in Arizona are investigating the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, last seen at her residence in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood of Tucson, Arizona, on the evening of January 31, 2026. She is considered to be a vulnerable adult who has difficulty walking, has a pacemaker, and needs daily medication for a heart condition.” 

The ransom notes that have been emailed to several media outlets did include deadlines, including 5 p.m. Eastern time on February 5, and Janke noted that typically, in a “kidnapping” situation, they would have received direct contact from abductors sooner when a deadline is involved. 

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos began by telling press members of the family's video, “We saw last night the family, you know they just hurt, understandably so. I really want you to know this entire team, those behind me and our community, are hurting with you. We really just want mom back.” 

“Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there,” he continued. “We want her home. Our department, the sheriff's department, along with all of our partners at the FBI have been working around the clock. We just want her home.” 

When Janke stepped up to the podium, he said, “First, I want to let the Guthrie family know that our hearts are heavy for them. After seeing your message last night, it is clear that you and your family are in pain. Please know that we are doing everything to bring your mother home.”

“Shark Tank” favorite Barbara Corcoran opened up about being fired from the hit show before filming even started.

The real estate maven revealed that she was let go and replaced by another female investor before filming for season one even began. 

Corcoran sat down with Tamron Hall for the Thursday, February 5, episode of her talk show to discuss the current season of “Shark Tank,” when she dished on being unceremoniously fired. 

“I was fired before it started, after I was hired,” Corcoran said. “Well, what happened was, when they made the call and they said, ‘I'm sorry. I know you signed the contract already and I know you thought you were coming out next week, but we hired another woman to take your place.'”

She continued, “I was so upset and felt sorry for myself, I must say. I told all my friend I was going to Hollywood. I bought new luggage. I got really fancy, really fast.”

The beloved investor refused to take no for an answer, however. She explained that she sent an email requesting a chance to prove herself. 

“I did the one thing I really knew how to do my whole life. I said, ‘Time to stand back up for myself,'” she recalled. “I wrote an email telling him that I considered his rejection a lucky charm. Everything good happened to me after rejection in my life. And I cited seven or eight rejections right in a row that I turned around and I said, ‘I consider your lucky charm. I'd like to be out there on the plane next Tuesday and compete for the seat.'”

According to Corcoran, she ultimately beat out the other woman for the seat in the “Shark Tank.”

“The better part of the history was me leaving for lunch and seeing my competitor, her Gold Star taken off her trailer. I was like, ‘Good for her,'” Corcoran added. 

After earning her spot in the Tank, the New Jersey native has gone on to appear in every season of the hit series since it's August 2009 premiere. 

“I thought it would last maybe two years,” she told Hall on Thursday. “It's a hardcore business show as it was presented to us. I didn't know if people would have the appetite to watch it, but I forgot that people would buy into those entrepreneur dreams.”

I like her and glad she stuck to her guns.

A Nashville woman named Nancy Guthrie is the victim of mistaken identity. The Bible study instructor responded after receiving dozens of messages praying for her safe return. 

Guthrie—who has amassed nearly 30,000 followers on Instagram—has not shared a new post to her profile since Thursday, January 29, two days before Savannah Guthrie's mother went missing. 

The comment section of her recent posts have been flooded with comments from those following the the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. 

“Praying for your safe return 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻” one user wrote. 

“Prayers for you❤️” another commented. 

“Praying for your return and your family 🌹🙏🏾” a third added. 

“Come home Nancy 😢 Where are you ?” yet another wrote. 

After days of receiving such remarks, Guthrie responded to clarify her identity.

“I am not the Nancy Guthrie who has been kidnapped, but I'm praying that Nancy Guthrie will be safely returned to her family,” she wrote on Thursday, February 5.

The “Today” host's mother was last seen Saturday, January 31, after being dropped off at home by her daughter, Annie Guthrie, following a family dinner. She was reported missing around noon the following day, after friends noticed she was absent from her regular church service. 

During a Thursday press conference, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos revealed a detailed timeline of the night the 84-year-old woman went missing. 

According to Nanos, Nancy took an Uber to her daughter Annie's home for dinner on Saturday night around 5:30 p.m. She was later dropped off at 9:48 p.m. Two minutes later, her garage door closed, indicating she arrived inside her Tucson, Arizona, home. 

At 1:47 a.m., Guthrie's doorbell camera was disconnected. Another camera picked up movement around 2:12 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, her pacemaker app was disconnected from her cell phone. 

Nanos also confirmed that the blood found on the front porch of Guthrie's home belonged to the victim. 

As of Thursday, authorities still have no suspect or person of interest in the case, but revealed that “everybody is still a suspect in our eyes.”

“It would be irresponsible if we did not talk to everybody,” Nanos added. 

Savannah and her siblings, Annie and Camron Guthrie, released an emotional video pleading for their mother's safe return after an alleged ransom note was sent to multiple media outlets. 

“The light is missing from our lives,” Savannah said. “Nancy is our mother. We are her children.”

She added, “We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment, and we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Jeopardy!' Host Alex Trebek's Former California Property for Sale","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/alex-trebek-california-property-for-sale/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:59:31 GMT","

A California property that used to be owned by the late “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek is selling for a little under $7 million. For that price, the potential new buyers will get to enjoy a working ranch, a vineyard, a winery and more.

First hitting the market last June for $8.88 million, that amount was later adjusted to $7.88 million before finding its current price.

The property includes more than 577 acres and boasts “archery and skeet shooting ranges, a historic barn converted into an event space, and open space for horseback riding, ATV riding and hiking,” according to Mansion Global. 

Co-listing agent Mike Goldfarb of Coldwell Banker Realty, told Mansion Global, “It's like adult summer camp.”

Sunset also notes that “the 11-bedroom, 13-bedroom sprawling ranch estate [was] built in 1900. The unique property boasts five houses and a private honeymoon suite, a working winery, barns, stables, and pastures and livestock pens for cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs. History buffs will also appreciate relics such as the original Highway 58 bridge and a blacksmith shop.”

“A truly unique legacy estate, 535 Calf Canyon Hwy blends family retreat with working ranch, vineyard, and winery,” listing agent Lindsey Harn, owner of Lindsey Harn group, told Sunset. “Surrounded by the mountains, lakes, wildlife, and open space, the property feels timeless, yet connected—offering room for 30-plus guests and generations to come.”

While the property's Creston Manor was established in the early 1980s, the founding couple eventually divorced. However, to avoid having to sell it, they brought in investors, which included Trebek. This move helped the winery emerge from bankruptcy. Sunset notes that Trebek then went on to buy out other partners.

In 2001, the current owners — Barry and Donna Goldfarb, the parents of the co-listing agent — bought the property for $1.6 million, according to Wine Spectator.

Trebek's former property can be found in Creston, which is around 30 minutes from San Luis Obispo in the Central Coast area. It's also around three-and-a-half-hours from both Los Angeles and San Francisco, which makes it a desirable location.

“Over the last 10, 20 years, the Central Coast has really carved out its own niche as being a premier destination for wine enthusiasts,” Goldfarb told Mansion Global. “It used to be that you had to go up to Napa or Sonoma to drink fine wines, but there are so many great vineyards and wineries in the Central Coast area.”

Sounds like a beautiful place and  a lot fun!  Would love to experience the beautiful thing's on horseback!

Reviews are technically under embargo until next week for Emerald Fennell's splashy, bodice-ripping adaptation of Emily Brontë's “Wuthering Heights.” But flamboyantly adulating first reactions all over X might suggest they are only under embargo if your feelings aren't positive.

IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcasts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio have both seen the movie, as have many of the press corps coast to coast. So while we can't dig as deep into it as we'd like at this point, we do take a superficial look at the film in this week's episode. Led by global stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the lusty, coming-unrepressed Catherine and Heathcliff, the “Saltburn” and “Promising Young Woman” filmmaker's eye-popping latest will make scads of money for Warner Bros. The film should expect to continue a winning streak that launched last year with “Sinners” and potentially be in the crafts awards conversation.

But as with any film that's previewed early for junket press, approach the first reactions with caution. It's been called “intoxicating, transcendent, tantalizing, bewitching, lust worthy, hypnotic,” “scorching hot,” an exquisite spectacle,” and “a breathtaking work of visual art.” (Variety rounds up the reactions nicely here.) You're unlikely to see a lot of negative feedback on social media right now — unless you look at some of the international response since this lushly designed film had a premiere in Paris earlier this week. Still, the earlier and cushier the access, the more likely to elicit a positive response.

The movie's fealty to the source material, as called into question by many since the very casting of these two leads, is ultimately irrelevant. This is not your high school syllabus version of “Wuthering Heights,” to be sure. Whether that's for better or worse, well, we will dive into that more next week when the movie opens February 13. One thing's for sure, as you could already glean from the trailer: “Wuthering Heights” is all about excess, excess, excess.

Elsewhere on “Screen Talk” this week, we give a final toast to Park City as Sundance shuffles off its slopes, and pick our five favorite films each from the festival that aren't “Josephine.” Beth de Araújo's Grand Jury Prize winner has been practically universally anointed as the best of the fest, so we wanted to make room for more films like the documentaries “Closure” and “The History of Concrete,” and narrative features like “Wicker” and “Leviticus.”

Hollywood unions tend to enter the public consciousness only when something goes wrong. Maybe strikes shut down production on your favorite film or TV show. Then, you see actors who aren't allowed to promote their own work on the red carpet or to the press. Suddenly, release calendars are collapsing left and right, and hungry audiences in theaters and at home are abruptly left with nothing to watch.

These calamitous moments of industry friction aren't so much disruptions to the movie and TV pipelines as they are rare glimpses into how the entertainment business actually works. As an indie film artist, understanding entertainment unions and their function matters — even if you never plan on joining one. Because, for all its self-aggrandizing mythology, the modern studio system is just a labor force, and like any workplace, when its employees cease doing their jobs, that's when the product stops coming.

For impassioned viewers trying to make sense of why movies take so long to fund and to mak, or for fanatical TV experts wondering why seasons keep getting shorter (even on streaming), the transparency provided by unions frequently offers a clearer explanation than the average C-suite press release. Comprised of internally elected union representatives, and nonprofit employees, for the most part, labor leadership broadly shapes how on-set film and TV production work is structured in “mainstream” Hollywood. In theory, using the feedback of these unions' own members sets cultural standards for artists across the world and ensures creative employment remains a sustainable way to live in the U.S.
 










The legal protections afforded to entertainment labor unions protect not just the professionals in them, but also the institutional knowledge that can only be accrued by staying in an unstable industry for the long haul. Learning from patterns of abuse and past mistakes has only grown more essential as modern technology redraws the economics of film, television, and digital content in real time. 

Revenue models have shifted faster than even A-lister contracts can accommodate, and data privacy remains contested in a fast-evolving landscape that's increasingly fearful of — and reliant on — A.I. Positions once rooted in Los Angeles are now scattered across continents, but in that churn, several Hollywood unions still function as connective tissue between departments and generations of workers.

Preserving standards that didn't appear by accident, but through decades of collective negotiation and volunteer works, this IndieWire's 101 guide to the seven core entertainment labor unions: Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA); Writers Guild of America (WGA); Directors Guild of America (DGA); the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE); the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Local 399); the American Federation of Musicians (AFM); and the Animation Guild (TAG, Local 839 of IATSE).
 










As film and TV productions decentralize, and individual career paths fragment, now is the moment to understand the Hollywood infrastructure as it once existed — and where it's being tested in 2026. 

A union film or TV show operates under a collective bargaining agreement negotiated between its producers and an official Hollywood labor union, while non-union productions do not. In practice, that distinction shapes nearly every aspect of an artist's professional experience working on a project — from who can actually be hired, to how long people work, and even who's at fault in an emergency.

Union productions must follow established legal minimums for pay, overtime, meal breaks, safety standards, and contributions to professional benefits. These rules exist to prevent a race to the bottom between studios, which was an exploitative pattern that long defined Hollywood as an industry where sixteen-hour workdays were common and job security did not exist. 

Union contracts also provide grievance procedures, meaning entertainment workers have recourse if the conditions of their employment are violated. To be clear, non-union projects are not inherently exploitative, but they frequently rely on individual creative's skill for negotiation and a sense of communal goodwill — rather than enforceable legal standards. This can allow for flexibility on ultra-low budget or auteur passion projects, but it also places the burden of protection on the workers themselves.

 










With studios taking more risks to stay relevant, the key distinction here isn't creative freedom but scale and sustainability. Note that union agreements can include low-budget tiers designed to accommodate indie efforts, while maintaining their cast and crew's basic protections. For directors, understanding when a project crosses into union territory can prevent costly mistakes and help you plan ahead.

There is no single pathway into a Hollywood union, but most follow the same basic principle: You don't join first, but instead qualify for admittance through your body of work. Meaning, union membership is often triggered by your employment on a union project — not by paying dues or passing an exam.

For cast and crew, this typically means qualifying through a low-budget agreement, waiver, or trainee classification program that you find through your own circumstance. Then, only after a required number of workdays or credits do you become eligible to join your respective union. (Note: Writers and directors generally join once hired on a signatory production, at which point membership becomes mandatory.)

That said, initiation fees and annual dues can be significant, which is why many workers delay joining until it becomes professionally necessary. Joining a union too early can restrict access to non-union work as well — but joining too late can also mean missing benefits that keep you in the game longterm. Ultimately, unions are less about “getting in” than staying in, but luck and timing are always a factor.

 










SAG-AFTRA (aka the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) represents performers across film, television, streaming, radio, voice acting, stunts, and other on-camera media. Its membership spans A-list movie stars, background actors, social media influencers, and recording artists. Think anyone whose embodied physical labor is reproduced or broadcast for profit. 

SAG was founded in 1933 during the Golden Age of Hollywood, when studio contracts often bound actors to strict schedules with limited financial leverage. AFTRA followed in 1937 to represent radio performers, and the two finally merged in 2012 — effectively acknowledging the collapse of traditional media silos and the reality that modern performers typically work across formats.

From stunt regulations to AI protections around digital replicas, the SAG-AFTRA union negotiates minimum rates, residuals, health and pension plans, and safety standards among other issues. Its unified actions tend to be the most visible because actors have a public face, but the SAG-AFTRA influence is deeply structural. Without SAG-AFTRA contracts, productions can struggle to find talent and relevance.

 










SAG-AFTRA's tiered agreements are often the first point of union contact for indie filmmakers. They offer lower-budget pathways that still provide protections for actors, while encouraging directors and producers to engage seriously with the ways performance labor is being devalued and threatened.

The Writers Guild of America represents film and TV writers, through both its East and West Coast branches. The WGA covers film screenwriters, televisions staff writers, showrunners, and anyone else whose primary contribution is the scripted blueprint of an entertainment project.

Founded in 1933, the WGA emerged alongside the Hollywood studio system itself, as writers pushed back against employers who treated their creativity as disposable raw material. Over the decades, the WGA has been at the center of major philosophical battles defending the importance of art and storytelling — often forecasting cultural upheaval before it became visible elsewhere.

The WGA negotiates minimum compensation, residuals, credit determination, and creative rights when it comes to written work. Its jurisdiction over credits is especially powerful, arbitrating decisions that can shape careers, reputations, and earnings. The guild also administers health and pension plans that help make writing a viable long-term profession. Recent WGA actions have focused on streaming economics, the explosion of mini-rooms, and the erosion of stable TV employment.

The Directors Guild of America represents directors, assistant directors, unit production managers, and stage managers who work in the production of movies, TV shows, commercials, and other live media projects. Unlike some creative guilds, the DGA encompasses both artistic leadership and key logistical professionals — reflecting how directing bridges both skills of craft and management.

Founded in 1936, the DGA emerged from concerns over creative control and credit attribution amid the growing power of producers. Its agreements then established minimum salaries for filmmakers, as well as working conditions and the now-standard role of the director as the primary artistic authority on set. The union is known for its relative stability (it rarely strikes), but its contracts are often bellwethers for broader negotiations ramping up… or going south.

The DGA has historically influenced other entertainment unions' bargaining strategies, and for indie directors, reaching DGA status can mark a serious transition into higher-budget or studio-backed work. Of course, directors' authority is still contested as production timelines compress in a stressed economy — and creative decision-making become even more data-driven in the era of streaming.

The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees represents the vast network of behind-the-scenes talent that makes production possible. IATSE encompasses cinematographers, editors, costume designers, makeup artists, grips, electricians, set builders, and dozens of other filmmaking crafts — all organized into local union representations specialized to those departments. 

Founded in 1893, IATSE predates Hollywood, having originated in live theater before having its practices adapted for film and television. The union's jurisdiction grew alongside technological innovation, absorbing new responsibilities as film and TV productions evolved on and off screen. Today, IATSE negotiates wages, hours, safety standards, and career benefits, often fighting against the punishing schedules and burnout that doesn't always register with more public-facing employees at the top.

In 2021, the IATSE contract standoff brought unprecedented attention to working conditions below the line and revealed how unsustainable demands had become normalized across Hollywood sets. The group continues to shape budgets, crew expectations, and timelines — drawing out why entertainment labor issues that aren't visible to viewers can sometimes be the most urgent and dire.

Teamsters Local 399 represents drivers and transportation professionals in Hollywood, including set drivers, location managers, and casting associates. Though smaller in public profile, its impact on the daily world of Hollywood is immense. Without transportation, the show can't go… anywhere.

Founded as part of the broader Teamsters union, Local 399 became indispensable as productions expanded across Los Angeles and into the broader U.S. Its members move cast, crew, and filmmaking equipment, while their union representatives negotiate pay, hours, turnaround times, and safety regulations. That's crucial especially when it comes overnight shoots. 

Read more on the official Teamsters Local 399 website.

The Animation Guild, Local 839 of IATSE, represents artists, writers, directors, and technicians who create through animation. Its members include storyboard artists, character designers, animators, animation writers, and more people whose work straddles visual art and technology.

Founded in 1952, during a period of employee unrest at Disney, TAG emerged to protect creative workers who were too often dismissed as technicians or low-level laborers. Over time, the guild became a crucial advocate for animation as a distinct artistic discipline — negotiating wages, benefits, and work classifications (which became particularly vital as animation expanded across streaming and gaming).

 










TAG members have been at the forefront of debates around labor outsourcing, as well as AI-assisted productions workflows, and the erosion of personal IP ownership. For indie artists, there's a growing overlap between animation and live-action production that's worth watching closely.

Read more on the official Animation Guild website.

The American Federation of Musicians represents instrumental musicians — who work not only in recording sessions but also on film and television scores, live performances, and digital media. Its members range from orchestra players to celebrity composers.

AFM was founded in 1896, fighting early battles over recorded music as it swiftly surpassed live performance labor. That concern echoes loudly in today's union debates as the group negotiates session fees, reuse payments, and residuals tied to infinitely re-playable musical performances. AFM contracts govern film and TV scoring, making it central to how music is produced and compensated for productions. Union scoring can elevate professionalism, but its music requires indie projects to budget.

More than a decade after their debut, Ratboys' 2023 album, The Window, fulfilled the potential of the band's country and emo-inflected indie rock, developing their sound like a photo going from faded to sharp. One song, “Black Earth, WI,” took them furthest afield, like a long drive where you see parts of the country you didn't know were there. A long guitar solo in the middle of the track wanders with no particular destination in mind until it arrives exactly where it's supposed to be, the rest of the band locking in around it. The effect could remind one of jam bands, yes, but also of the unconscious cerebral shiftings of psych rock, where every instrument lysergically trembles a little outside of itself.

In the opening moments of Singin' to an Empty Chair, the new Ratboys record, you sense that the band's not only finally arrived where it's supposed to be, but that the limits of its sound are boundless there. The first track, “Open Up,” forms like a landscape on canvas: gentle bruisings of guitar, a little overexposed with light, warm like the air over broken skin, as frontwoman Julia Steiner's voice wavers like branches in a breeze. Her sentiment feels bravely, nakedly vulnerable: an invitation into communion. “Pick all the locks inside our heads/It takes a while in your defense/But I've got lots of time,” she sings. “What's it gonna take to open up tonight?”

The album returns to this question often, like it can't quite get it off its mind, and several of its songs deal with some kind of rupture in communication or connection. For instance, in “Anywhere,” about how sometimes the person to whom you attach yourself most fiercely is the one with the most fitful presence in your life; or in “Light Night Mountains All That,” about trying to show somebody something cool and its coolness failing to move them beyond indifference or distraction, probably because they are thinking about something or someone else; or, in the record's spiritual centerpiece, “Just Want You to Know the Truth,” about discovering that someone you've known forever is different from the person you thought they were, uncovering the degree to which our realities can be made of myths we've been provided with or have constructed ourselves.

To this interrogation of the self and others and of feelings bottled up for so long that they've started to go bad, Ratboys bring their best, most compositionally advanced songs, moving from tightly wound indie pop to the serene hammock sway of country rock to territories far dreamier and uncertain. Their performances are varied and versatile without feeling like a different band has taken over each song. This is the second time they've been recorded by Chris Walla, who, as he did with his former band Death Cab for Cutie, generates miles of atmosphere from what fundamentally sounds like a band playing indie rock music. On “Burn It Down,” you can almost feel the smoke coming off their instruments, like flint striking steel.

“Burn It Down"" is part of a penultimate three-song suite in which Ratboys are at their most ambitious, each track exceeding five minutes, each arranged so that their structures shift like bends in a road. “What's Right?” shares the journeying feeling of “Black Earth, WI,” though it's a little more enervated, trying to shake off that thing it can't stop thinking about. A great deal of the music on Singin' to an Empty Chair feels engineered for a road trip to nowhere, where the place you're driving toward looks identical to the one you just left, and your thoughts migrate to half-asleep regions they wouldn't ordinarily go. Nothing resolves, just reels outward as far as you can see.

This is where “What's Right?” ends up in its second half; as a corresponding chord change darkens the sky, Steiner's lyrics sleepwalk into a dream state where she meets parts of herself that resist understanding. “My subconscious is a man,” she sings, “He softly says to me/‘I'll vanish when you need me to/I'll hold you when you sleep.'” As in a dream, the lyrics resist literal sense, even though they seem to say something about reality that is otherwise inexpressible: “Break all your concentration/Love yourself/End these thoughts of desperation/Embrace Hell.”

The record's emotional core is located in a far more domestic scene, though it's no less given to sudden traumatic shifts: “Just Want You to Know the Truth,” addressed to a family member from whom Steiner is estranged, depicts their evolving and devolving relationship in broken fragments of memory, some warm, some lonely and confused, all of them insufficient to explain what's happened. “If I told you I was OK/Well, that would have been a lie/So I blocked your telephone/Without sayin' goodbye,” Steiner sings, distorted guitars growing over the song like weeds over something demolished. “Well, it's not what you did/It's what you didn't do.”

In “Just Want You to Know the Truth,” Steiner imagines sitting across from this person and telling them everything she's feeling. Last year, not long after a breakup, I found myself on the couch in my living room, monologuing to the air in front of me, where I imagined my ex sitting and listening. I told the air things I didn't know my ex would ever get to hear, things I might've decided not to tell her anyway. I cried. My behavior may have alarmed my roommates. But in the midst of this outpouring, I realized, several months before we actually reconnected, that my ex and I would be friends, that this would be a new kind of intimacy for us, and its newness would make our connection mysterious and exciting again.

To encounter this approach on Singin' to an Empty Chair a year after I'd tried it myself, this lonely reckoning with the unknowability of others and the difficulty and pain in trying to repair relationships, staggered me a little. Are we all trying this hard to restore something we've lost? Inside are we just empty houses haunted by the people we used to know? Singin' to an Empty Chair offers the encouraging thought that there's something worthy and worthwhile in trying, in reaching out, even if it's just you alone in your living room, talking to your memory of them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Bethany Cosentino Calls on Wasserman CEO to Step Down Over Epstein Emails","https://pitchfork.com/news/bethany-cosentino-calls-on-wasserman-ceo-to-step-down-over-leaked-epstein-emails/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:31:07 GMT","

Note: This article contains descriptions of alleged sexual misconduct.

Bethany Cosentino has shared an open letter calling on Casey Wasserman—the founder and CEO of her agency, Wasserman—to step down after his name and old emails appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files. The documents, released by the Justice Department on January 30, contain intimate messages exchanged by Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion, throughout 2003, per The New York Times. In 2021, a New York court convicted Maxwell of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually traffic minor girls; she is currently serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison.

Wasserman Music has represented Cosentino and her band Best Coast since 2021. In her statement, Cosentino demanded Wasserman change its name, and said she has requested to remove both her and Best Coast's names from the agency's website. “Ghislaine Maxwell is not a neutral character in a messy story—she is a convicted sex trafficker who helped facilitate the abuse of minors,” Cosentino wrote. “I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation.” (Pitchfork has reached out to Wasserman, his agency, and Cosentino for comment.)

Cosentino described her statement as a “refusal to continue lining the pockets of people so closely tied to shady business and toxic, deeply harmful people.” She added: “Artists are not interchangeable assets. We are people. Many of us are women. Many of us, myself included, are survivors. We deserve systems that let us work without asking us to compromise our values in exchange for opportunity.”

In his own statement to the press, shared on February 1, Wasserman said: “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light. I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”

Per Variety, Wasserman's communication with Maxwell included an email where Maxwell offers to give Wasserman a massage, and another where Wasserman writes to her: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” The files indicate that Wasserman and Maxwell remained in contact after a September 2002 flight to Africa, which former president Bill Clinton reportedly organized to conduct HIV research. A 2003 Vanity Fair report noted that Epstein, Maxwell, Wasserman, billionaire Ron Burkle, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker were among those on board.

Wasserman founded his eponymous talent management company in 2002, and launched Wasserman Music in 2021. Wasserman Group oversees hundreds of high-profile musicians and sports players; artists currently on the roster include Kendrick Lamar, Coldplay, Skrillex, Chappell Roan, Animal Collective, Wet Leg, the Knife, and Geese. Wasserman is also the chairman of the planned 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. During a press conference on February 4, International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry said she had “nothing to add” to Wasserman's statement on the files, per the Los Angeles Times.

In 2024, Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas left Wasserman Music for WME shortly after a Daily Mail report alleged Wasserman had engaged in inappropriate relationships with multiple female subordinates. Wasserman and his company did not comment on the allegations at the time.

Read Cosentino's full statement below.

My name is Bethany Cosentino. I am a singer/songwriter, an activist, a mother, and the frontwoman of the band Best Coast. I have been represented by Wasserman Music since its expansion into music in 2021.

It has come to my attention that the founder and CEO of my agency, Casey Wasserman, had a documented romantic relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell between the years of 2001 and 2003, and multiple documented connections and communications with Jeffrey Epstein confirmed by emails now part of public record. Ghislaine Maxwell is not a neutral character in a messy story - she is a convicted sex trafficker who helped facilitate the abuse of minors. As an artist represented by Wasserman, I did not consent to having my name or my career tied to someone with this kind of association to exploitation. Staying quiet isn't something I can do in good conscience - especially in a moment when men in power are so often protected, excused, or allowed to move on without consequence. Pretending this isn't a big deal is not an option for me.

Casey's response, that these emails are “deeply regretted,” is not enough. Regret without accountability is just damage control - an attempt to move on while the rest of us are expected to sit with the discomfort of our careers being publicly tied to him. Artists are tired of swallowing scandals like this. We are tired of learning, over and over, that men who control access, resources, money, and so-called safety in our industry are given endless grace. We are tired of being asked to treat proximity to something horrific as an unfortunate situation we should simply move past - especially when the person involved still holds all the power. And we are tired of watching harm minimized or brushed off as ""a long time ago,"" while the impact of that harm is still very real, especially for women and survivors of sexual assault.

This letter is my public refusal to accept that this is ""just how things are."" It is a refusal to continue lining the pockets of people so closely tied to shady business and toxic, deeply harmful people. I do not want my name on the website of a man who was ever a personal friend of an accomplice to a literal pedophile, or associated with Jeffrey Epstein himself. I have worked with my agent, Sam Hunt, for over 15 years who has done incredible work in representing me. I am in the Sam Hunt business. I am not in the Wasserman business. I have asked to remove my name and band's name from the company site. The position Casey Wasserman has put his agents in is inexcusable. This is a call for him to step down and a change of business name be imminent.

Artists are not interchangeable assets. We are people. Many of us are women. Many of us, myself included, are survivors. We deserve systems that let us work without asking us to compromise our values in exchange for opportunity.

I'm speaking out because pretending this is normal isn't normal. Because people in power can't keep skating by. And because the artists keeping the lights on at Wasserman deserve support, not to be ignored while men in power are protected. It is important for us as artists to remember: these people work for us, not the other way around.

If you or someone you know has been affected by inappropriate sexual behavior, we encourage you to reach out for support:

KAVARI's music sears like a controlled fire, destroying the underbrush to make room for the new. That was literally true of the Glasgow-based producer's 2025 EP Only Pleasure in Flame, a collection of slash-and-burn field recordings that sucked the air right out of your ears. The Scottish sea air has produced a number of maverick electronic musicians—Rustie, Hudson Mohawke, Proc Fiskal—and in recent years, KAVARI's prolific, sound design–forward work is arguing the case for her induction into the pantheon. There might be a time in the near future when newcomers under her influence make a name for themselves; hundreds of people have purchased her 2021 sample pack. PLAGUE MUSIC, KAVARI's debut EP for XL Recordings, condenses a sound she's been honing over the past decade into four concise (albeit incendiary) tracks, reconstructing the over-the-top brostep of MOODY GOOD with a bit of Northern gothic flair.

The year 2023 was a breakthrough year for KAVARI. But even before Aphex Twin began demolishing stadiums with her bulldozer tracks like “Attachment Style (VIP),” she was your favorite DJ's favorite producer, breaking down pop music into its constituent elements and reassembling them into club tools that skulk in the long shadow of GHE20G0TH1K, Fade to Mind, and other pioneers of so-called “deconstructed club”. Those bootlegs make up her colossal Lost Cuts edit packs on her Bandcamp, with titles that blow the character counts of Fall Out Boy's songs: the longest might be the SEO-friendly “KAVARI, Skrillex, Disclosure, Flume, Knife Party, Avicii, Foreign Beggars, Aphex Twin - Someone Loved It, Kyoto, You & Me, Internet Friends, Cinema, Levels, Scatta, Avril 14th (KAVARI Attention Deficit Mix),” on Lost Cuts Vol. 2. After the Aphex Twin nod, however, anyone who was into the harder end of hardcore breaks could attest that KAVARI's original productions, heard in basements from Seoul to Vienna, were as electrifying as her edits.

It might seem that the possibilities for noise have been exhausted by everyone from Playboi Carti to Chuquimamani-Condori to teens making jugg edits on TikTok. KAVARI's genius is to go beyond loud for loud's sake, creating symphonies of texture out of redlined mulch. Much of her signature comes from the creative application of hard clipping and other distortion techniques, saturating samples to create raw material that she later whittles down. When a sound wave is hard clipped, parts that are louder than a certain threshold are sawed off; the result creates a sort of asphyxiated buzzing that can decorate the edges of a synth, kick, or snare—listen to the crunch of the sub bass that lurks beneath “PULSE.” In moments like these, KAVARI carves intricate filigrees out of monolithic blocks of sound, keeping the spiky moments from devolving into overly indulgent harsh noise (for fans of the latter, try her side project EEL BLOOD). The natural crispiness of a timestretched breakbeat is thus augmented by the crackle of its truncated waveform; the frisson of a track like “IRON VEINS” is like taking the first bite into a piece of Korean double-fried chicken.

PLAGUE MUSIC masterfully teeters on the contorted borderline of pleasure and pain. In a recent interview, KAVARI spoke of channeling the “happiness, peace and love” of EDM while remaining mindful of the demons looming after the comedown. The guttural growls and apneic whispers that take the place of “put your hands up” ad libs seem to gesture at intrusive thoughts that might strike on a night out, when all you can think about is the world burning down while you're in the club. A track like Skrillex's “Bangarang” might help shoo away such thoughts with stupefying wubs; on KAVARI's “SERPENT CHAMBER,” however, there's only a voice that purrs with ASMR closeness: “I want you to become aware of the darkness behind your eyes.” The multi-vehicle pile-up that ensues might go even dumber than a Rusko drop, yet there's no escaping the anxiety that remains in the static hiss that closes the track.

KAVARI's best moments might be when she somehow transforms apocalyptic sounds into danceable belters, but over the years she's also shown a remarkable talent for conjuring subtler ambiences. Those appeared on 2022's Lost Cuts [B-side], a collection of blissed-out United in Flames-esque trance edits, as well as in the quicksilver glitches of yeule's “bloodbunny,” which KAVARI co-wrote. Yet the pandemic atmosphere of “SCYTHE” feels like a distillation of the ritual horror explored on her 2023 mixtape Against the Wood, Opposed to Flesh. A kick drum thrums and echoes in the background like a heartbeat fighting to hold on, as field recordings of an anonymous street and sounds of people coughing, first timidly and then violently, establish a tableau akin to a plague-infested 14th century town. If the names of KAVARI's mixes have often included images of blood and breath, vital fluids that give us life, PLAGUE MUSIC reminds us that death is never too far behind.

Correction: A previous version of this review included the artist SOPHIE among a list of Scottish-born musicians, which was misleading.

Taylor Swift has released a video for “Opalite,” the second song from The Life of a Showgirl to get a visual treatment. Directed by Swift herself, the '90s-themed video—which is exclusive to Apple Music and Spotify until February 8—finds Swift in a dead-end relationship with a literal rock, only to be saved by a spritz of a spray potion called “Opalite” and the arrival of charmer Domnhall Gleeson. The two of them embark on a romantic adventure that occasions cameos from Cillian Murphy, Greta Lee, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Lewis Capaldi—all of whom, a coda reveals, were Swift's fellow guests when she appeared on the UK late-night TV show of Graham Norton (who also appears in the video). Watch it go down below.

Elaborating on the video on Instagram, Swift wrote, in part:

The idea for the Opalite music video crash landed into my imagination when I was doing promo for The Life of a Showgirl. I was a guest on one of my favorite shows, @TheGrahamNortonShowOfficial. For those of you who aren't familiar, it's a UK late night show where Graham Norton (the insanely charismatic and lovable host) invites a random group of actors, entertainers, musicians, etc to be on his show and we all sit there and chat like it's a dinner party. They even serve wine. Anyway. I remember thinking I got ridiculously lucky with the group I was paired with. Cillian Murphy, Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee, @JodieSmith, and @LewisCapaldi. All people whose work I've admired from afar. When we were all talking during the broadcast, Domhnall made a light hearted joke about wanting to be in one of my music videos. He's Irish! He was joking! Except that in that moment during the interview, I was instantly struck with an *idea*. And so a week later he received an email script I'd written for the Opalite video, where he was playing the starring role. I had this thought that it would be wild if all of our fellow guests on the Graham Norton show that night, including Graham himself, could be a part of it too. Like a school group project but for adults and it isn't mandatory. To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90's with us and help with this video.

A YouTube upload will follow on Sunday, according to a countdown posted yesterday on Swift's website (where Swift is selling an “Opalite” vinyl single for 48 hours). Swift's decision to withhold the video from YouTube follows the platform's recent decision to pull its stream counts from the Billboard charts, in protest of how Billboard weights ad-supported streams. Pitchfork has emailed YouTube for comment on this quirk of the “Opalite” rollout.

The first Life of a Showgirl video, for “The Fate of Ophelia,” was also written and directed by Swift herself and released, with the album, last October. Shortly afterwards, the album beat Adele's first-week sales record and Swift was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Chat Pile have released two new songs on Seattle label Sub Pop: “Masks” and a cover of Nirvana's “Sifting.” Both tracks will appear on the limited-edition 7"" the Oklahoma City band announced back in December. Give them a listen below.

""It's a true dream to put out a single on Sub Pop, and our new song 'Masks' hopefully honors the spirit of the mythical, sometimes mystical, city of Seattle,” Chat Pile said in a press statement. “We wanted to cover a song from the early Sub Pop era, and something off Bleach seemed the obvious choice.” To mark the release, the band donated $3,000 to the community-based immigrant justice organization DREAM Action OK. Their statement also noted: “Most importantly, FUCK ICE!”

Chat Pile shared their most recent solo LP, Cool World, in 2024. Last year, they also dropped a collaborative album with Texas fingerstyle guitarist Hayden Pedigo, In The Earth Again. Their debut, God's Country, came out in 2022.

	President Donald Trump went on a wild social media posting spree late Thursday night and into Friday morning, one that included a video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, set to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” 


	The clip of the Obamas, which appears to be AI-generated, comes near the end of a 62-second video about election conspiracy theories. Trump posted the video just before midnight on Thursday. The post was taken down late Friday morning amid bipartisan backlash.


	The White House initially defended the post. “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”


	The White House told CNN later Friday morning, however, that the post was made “erroneously” by a staffer, and that the post has been removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.

	











	The video is the latest entry in the right's long history of racism directed at the Obamas. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential election famously pushed the “birther” conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was actually born in Africa and not a U.S. citizen. “An ‘extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,” he tweeted that year. Obama had already released his long-form birth certificate to throw cold water on the conspiracy theory a year prior.

	Democrats were quick to condemn the post depicting the Obamas as apes on Friday. 


	“Disgusting behavior by the President,” California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office wrote shortly after Trump posted the clip. “Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”


	“Trump is a vile racist old man. The people in the @HouseGOP that don't speak out on this, I'm going to assume you support this racism,” wrote Rep. Herb Conaway (D-N.J.), who is Black.

	“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser under Obama, posted on X.


	“Every Republican will pretend they didn't see it, no reporter should let them get away with it,” wrote Dan Pfeiffer, another former Obama adviser.


	The NAACP also weighed in. “Donald Trump's racist video is disgusting and utterly despicable,” the organization wrote in a statement. “Trump is obviously desperate to distract us from the Epstein files and his rapidly failing economy. You know who isn't in the Epstein files? Barack Obama.”


	Some on the right seemed to recognize that Trump posting the video was not a good look. “FAKE NEWS ALERT! Trump Didn't post this monkey video of the obamas. Lying Democrats. It's not on his page. Fake screenshot,” wrote MAGA influencer Terrence K. Williams to his 2.4 million X followers. Williams was quickly corrected by fact checkers and a community note was soon attached to his post, which has not been deleted as of Friday morning.

	Multiple Republican lawmakers — including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who is Black, and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) — called for Trump to remove the post. Scott, a close ally of the president, described the video as the “most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.”


	The video featuring the Obamas was part of a bizarre string of posts from the president, many of which promoted unfounded election conspiracy theories. Trump also shared a 14-second video of a dog sliding itself into a kitchen at the sound of an aerosol whipped cream can, and a 15-second video of Bruce Lee set to a dramatic rendition of the “Seven Nation Army” melody.

Taylor Swift isn't through with her show girl era just yet. The pop star just released the music video for her next The Life of a Showgirl single, “Opalite” — and it's full of lightning strike twists.


	In the funny, unexpected visual, Taylor jumps back in time to the Nineties — you know, the era of the mall before the internet, full of infomercials and at-home workout videos. She plays a lonesome cat lady, who is hilariously dating a rock, but falls for “the revolutionary fix for your problems” that is Opalite. In an infomercial, the product promises that it “magically transforms your problems into your paradise using our state of the art chemical potion. It works on friendships, couples, pets and co-workers.”


	What follows is a silly, but sweet story that features a star-studded cast. It seems Swift called up everyone she appeared on The Graham Norton Show back in October (including Norton himself, who stars as a Nope-alite salesman) to make an appearance. Domnhall Gleeson plays her formerly sad love interest, Lewis Capaldi is a mall photographer, while Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith make small appearances in television ads. Even Cillian Murphy has a cameo.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	On the Amazon Music “Track by Track” version of the LP, Swift explained the song is about “choosing happiness and getting through rough times” and the title comes from “a man-made gemstone.” In the New Heights episode where Taylor announced her 12th studio album, Travis admitted that “Opalite” was his favorite track off the project. In an appearance on Capital FM in October, Swift affirmed the track continued to be his favorite off the album. “He loves that one,” she said.

	Notably, the pop superstar did not initially share the glittery visual on YouTube, instead she chose to premiere the “Opalite” video on two of the largest streaming platforms exclusively: Spotify and Apple Music. The move coincides with YouTube's decision to withdraw its data from Billboard charts following changes to the charts' methodology. Of course, neither music video for The Life of a Showgirl has had a traditional release. She premiered “The Fate of Ophelia” in theaters across the country as part of the her album release parties in October. Just like that video, “Opalite” will be on YouTube in the coming days.


	Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” just came off a record-breaking run as her biggest hit, charting at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 for 10 weeks and marking the star's longest-running feat. “Opalite” could very well be the singer's next hit song; it debuted at Number Two on the Hot 100 and is comfortably sitting at Number 10. If the song tops the chart, it would become the first time Swift had two songs from the same project reach that achievement since 1989.

Twisted Sister have canceled all 2026 50th anniversary reunion shows following the “sudden and unexpected resignation” of Dee Snider due to newly revealed health challenges by the frontman.


	In a statement, the band said all shows beginning April 25 in Sao Paulo Brazil and continuing through the summer have been cancelled and the “future of Twisted Sister will be determined in the next several weeks.”


	The announcement was shared on the band's official Instagram account alongside a separate statement by Snider. “A lifetime of legendarily aggressive performing has taken its toll on Dee Snider's body and soul,” the message began, before revealing that the lead singer suffers from degenerative arthritis and had several surgeries over the years only to be able to “perform a few songs at a time in pain.”


	“Adding insult to injury, Dee has recently found out the level of intensity he has dedicated to his life's work has taken its toll on his heart as well,” the statement continued. “He can no longer push the boundaries of rock ‘n' roll fury like he has done for decades.”

	In his own words, Snider said, “I don't know of any other way to rock. The idea of slowing down is unacceptable to me. I'd rather walk away than be a shadow of my former self.” The frontman ended with “the immortal words” of Dirty Harry in 1973's Magnum Force: “A man's got to know his limitations.”

	











	The run was set to mark Twisted Sister's first tour since 2016 — when they embarked on what was billed to be their 40 and Fuck It farewell tour — and feature the band's three core members: Snider, founding guitarist (and longest-serving member) Jay Jay French, and longtime lead guitarist Eddie Ojeda.

	“Will a football be used as a prop? Will a lyric be muted? Will Bad Bunny expose a nipple?” 


	Joey Isaks is reading the menu of options for bets on the Super Bowl halftime show, trying to decide if there's anything he's interested in putting some money down on. “Will Bad Bunny perform a cover song? I actually like ‘No' at -300 there. They never do cover songs anymore.” 


	Isaks is a professional gambler, and he's made some fairly big scores on the Super Bowl halftime show over the years. “The last one I made a lot of money on was probably the SoFi one … ‘What color shoes will Snoop Dogg wear?'” Isaks' win was in the low five figures. His secret? He received the information in advance. “It leaked that he was wearing white shoes … it was like 7-1.” 


	This year an enterprising gambler can find places to bet on all sorts of propositions for Bad Bunny's halftime performance. While regulated American sportsbooks like FanDuel or DraftKings are generally restricted by state laws to only taking bets on “authorized sporting events or closely related outcomes,” American prediction markets (which fall under federal commodity and futures regulations) and offshore sportsbooks (which aren't located in the U.S.) will take bets on just about anything you can imagine. In addition to the aforementioned offerings, there are bets on what color Bad Bunny's hair will be, what kind of hat he will wear, and who might make an appearance onstage with him. 

	











	“This year it's a layup with Bad Bunny given all of the politics associated with Trump, ICE, etc. The possibility of him wearing a dress,” says Adam Burns, sportsbook manager at BetOnline.ag. 


	The dress and ICE questions are popular options so far this year, according to Burns, but the most popular bet has been the same every year: What will be the first song? “Tití Me Preguntó” is the odds-on favorite at 1-2, but there are some long shots on the board like “I Like It” at 18-1. If you think Karol G will join Bad Bunny onstage, you can get that at 2-1. If you think Joe Biden will join him onstage, you can get that at 50-1. “The ideas are endless.”

	In addition to the halftime show, there are bets on the length of the national anthem, and even a few bets available on Green Day's pregame performance, though nowhere near as many as the halftime show. At the Panama-based offshore sportsbook BetOnline.ag, you can bet on Green Day's first song and whether or not Billie Joe Armstrong will call Donald Trump “fat.” 


	“This is definitely the biggest halftime show menu we've seen in the history of the Super Bowl,” says Dave Mason, BetOnline's brand manager and an industry veteran. “Last year's with Kendrick Lamar and the Drake/Taylor Swift side stories was also close to this number, but Bad Bunny and all the surrounding storylines takes the cake.”


	“We've got a prop on how many times the camera will cut to a confused-looking older guy in the crowd,” says Robert Cooper, odds manager at SportsBetting.ag. “We're calling it the ‘Kevin reacts' prop.” 


	In the gambling world, there is perhaps no event with as expansive a betting menu as the Super Bowl. There are literally thousands of potential bets on the game and everything surrounding it — from the coin toss to who will score the first touchdown to who will appear onscreen during the ads. The behemoth menu of “props” can be traced back to the 1995 Super Bowl, when the 49ers beat the Chargers, 49-26. Fans were expecting a blowout, so Jay Kornegay, manager of the sportsbook at the Imperial Palace casino in Las Vegas at that time, gathered his staff and came up with more than 150 bets on the game to keep fans engaged in what was otherwise going to be a one-sided affair. It worked, and every year since, the menu at sportsbooks across Nevada continued to expand.

	Halftime shows for many years were also fairly boring affairs. Up until the 1990s, the show was usually dominated by marching bands and beauty queens. Occasionally the international organization Up With People would sing and dance to spice things up. In 1992, the halftime show was considered such a bore that the fledgling Fox network aired a special episode of the sketch comedy show In Living Color to coincide with halftime, complete with an onscreen timer to let viewers know how much time they had left before they needed to change the channel and catch the second-half kickoff. The NFL's halftime show was called “Winter Magic” and featured ice skating and a rendition of Frosty the Snowman. Winter Magic got clobbered in the ratings by In Living Color. 

	











	The following year the NFL booked Michael Jackson for the halftime show and has tried to up the ante every year since with increasingly large-scale pop music spectacles with special effects, pyrotechnics, and surprise cameos. They've never again had to worry about viewers tuning away. Today, the halftime show is as much a part of the Super Bowl as the game. For some viewers, even more so. 


	In 2004, Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson scandalized the NFL when Timberlake ripped off a part of Jackson's costume at the end of their performance, something they later said was a “wardrobe malfunction.” The fallout and controversy from the incident was huge and created an outsized interest in Paul McCartney's halftime show the following year. 


	“The year after the Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson fiasco, we posted a prop asking if there would be another ‘wardrobe malfunction,'” says Jacob Crossman, director of trading at BetDSI.eu. “The media ate it up, and the bettors were betting on it happening again!” 


	Over the next few years, the bets on halftime shows increased. In 2006, you could bet on what the Rolling Stones' first song would be (it was “Start Me Up”), and in 2007, you could bet on whether Prince would split his pants onstage (he didn't). 


	“The first time I can recall a Super Bowl halftime show prop bet was at Super Bowl XLIV in 2010,” Mason says. “The Who was the performing artist, and there was a prop on how many ‘guitar windmills' Pete Townshend would execute.”


	“I think one of the most famous, or infamous, was in 2013 when we offered odds on whether or not Beyoncé would show cleavage,” Burns says. “Initially she was pretty covered up, but by the end of the show cleavage was in full effect and the bettors cleaned up.”


	While sportsbooks (and professional sports bettors) will determine the odds for a typical on-field Super Bowl bet using statistical modeling tools like linear regression and Monte Carlo simulations, when it comes to halftime show bets, there's just not really data to work with. 


	“There's not a lot that goes into it. We do a little research, set a soft line, and then the action dictates where the odds go. It's all speculation … more art than science,” Crossman says. 

	











	In terms of what goes into the art of setting halftime show lines, it's a little bit of everything. “A mix of frantic Googling, watching three TikTok predictions, and what we overheard at the water cooler. It's basically organized chaos,” Cooper says. “We're all just guessing together.”


	According to Isaks, some gamblers will try to handicap these bets, applying some sort of statistical analysis to find an edge. “People go through previous set lists,” he says. “So if he opens that tour every time with X song, then you maybe think he's going to open it again.” But Isaks doesn't put much stock in those methods. “I mean, that sounds like a waste of time.” The only real reason to bet on these bets, according to Isaks, is if you already know the winner ahead of time. 


	The sportsbooks have a simple way to protect themselves against this type of insider trading: They don't take very much money on these bets. “We only allow customers to make relatively small wagers on these props. You can't come in and bet $10,000 on Bad Bunny's first song. There are many people who know what he's going to sing first, so we have to protect ourselves against that insider knowledge,” Burns says. (The maximum bet on any of BetOnline's halftime show props is $25.) “Sometimes they beat us to the punch, and that's just the cost of doing business.” 


	Usually the inside information originates at the dress rehearsal the week of the Super Bowl, which is closed to the public but does have some invited guests in the stands watching. That information spreads among gamblers quickly. “Everyone kind of gets it at the same time, and it's like a race to bet it before they take it down,” Isaks says. “It's actually crazy; it's always accurate.” 


	Sometimes, though, that inside information might still not be good enough to win a bet. In 2024, when Usher performed, he opened his show with a few lines from the song “Caught Up” but blended it into the song “My Way.” Some sportsbooks paid “Caught Up” bettors, some paid “My Way” bettors, and at least one sportsbook, BetOnline, paid both. Isaks didn't get paid. “Even though Apple releases the set list after the show, they still didn't grade it by that,” he says. “I remember my wife being like, ‘It was “My Way”! You were right again!' and pumped I won, but I never told her the site graded it a loss. Sometimes things are better left unknown.”

	In years past, trafficking in this inside information was highly lucrative because a number of sportsbooks would take sizable bets. Today, almost nobody will take more than $10 or $25. “You used to be able to make like $50,000 probably on it. Now I don't even know if you can make $1,000 on it,” Isaks says. 

	











	Robert Cooper at Sportsbetting.ag isn't too concerned with getting beat by inside information, limits or not. He says, “Our average bettor is a dude whose girlfriend introduced him to Bad Bunny and all the corresponding conspiracies last week, so we're not too concerned about inside information beating us.”

	EJAE, one of the songwriters and singing voices behind KPop Demon Hunters, has shared a new solo single, “Time After Time.” The anthemic pop number sees EJAE reflecting on a breakup and her inability to stop thinking about a relationship that has ended.


	“The melody of ‘Time After Time' was stuck in my head for years, just like the person I wrote it about,” the singer said in a statement. 


	EJAE has released the single on the heels of her historic win at the 2026 Grammy Awards. At the awards, “Golden,” the breakout hit from Netflix‘s animated film KPop Demon Hunters, won Best Song Written for Visual Media, becoming the first K-Pop song to ever win a Grammy. 


	“This is crazy because this is like a historical moment for you know, as being a Korean American,” EJAE said at the awards. “It's a song that also represents Korea.”


	“Golden” previously won a Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award, and is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars. The film follows the fictional superstar Korean girl group HUNTR/X — Rumi, Zoey, and Mira — as they secretly use their upbeat music to keep humans safe from evil demons. The characters' singing voices are performed by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The trio will showcase “Golden” live at the BAFTA Film Awards in London on Feb. 22. It will be their first time performing the hit song live outside of the United States. 


	EJAE wrote and performed several songs for the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack along with “Golden.” She has previously written for other artists, including AESPA, Red Velvet, Le Sserafim, TWICE, Taeyeon, NMIXX, and FiftyFifty.

BUTTE -Here on the campus of Montana Tech, you can study science, mathematics, engineering, biology, even nursing, but here in the Chemistry Biology Building in this classroom, you can learn about UFOs. Yeah, I'm serious, and so is Dr. Michael Masters, so let's go check out his class.

“Fiber optics technology may have come from reverse engineering these craft,” Montana Tech Professor Michael Masters told his class Thursday morning.

WATCH: Montana Tech joins a select group of universities offering academic courses on UFO phenomena

The Butte university is one of only a handful of colleges around the country with a class on unidentified flying objects.

“One of my students was very honest and said that she saw the posters and thought it was a joke and registered to see if it was actually a joke,"" Masters said.

It's no joke. The anthropology class studies the history and science behind the UFO phenomenon.

""This is a real phenomenon happening, whether you believe in UFOs or not, it's not a belief system anymore, it's an evidence-based inquiry, and the more we take it seriously,” he said.

Masters earned his doctorate in anthropology from Ohio State University and has written several books about UFOs. Students in this new class are challenged to research and examine the topic through credible sources.

“I don't know, I've kind of mixed feelings about it, but after taking this class, I've kind of shifted toward, yeah, there could be something out there,” student Izzy Arave said.

Student Nate O'Neil added, “We couldn't have had this class 10 years ago; we would have all been called crazy for just taking it, probably.“

Masters said Montana Tech has been very supportive of his class and believes this subject is not just for the fringe and should be a topic of serious study.

“We have whistleblowers, we have intelligence insiders coming out and saying there is a legacy program, there are craft, there are bodies, they are reverse engineering these craft, and when people are saying that under oath in front of the United States Congress, we need to pay attention to that and we need to take it seriously,” Masters said.","{'href': 'https://www.kxlf.com', 'title': 'KXLF.com'}","other"

President Donald Trump has reportedly approved a request that could open up some of America's most secretive UFO-linked facilities, in a move that will raise hopes among those in search of long-sought-after answers to the existence of alien life.

While the Pentagon and US government have consistently denied recovering any physical evidence of extraterrestrial visitors, multiple whistleblowers have told Congress that secret programs have long covered up the truth.

Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison, a member of the congressional oversight committee investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), said he has been granted permission to visit the nation's most secretive UFO-related facilities. This includes highly secure military bases and other locations with decades-long ties to unidentified flying objects and classified government programs. Among them, the infamous Area 51 which has been the subject of decades of speculation over the existence of aliens.



In addition to Area 51, multiple US military sites have long been associated with claims of non-human craft, including Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and AUTEC in the Bahamas.

Speaking on the ALN Podcast, Burlison explained that his request to President Trump and his team included visits to facilities where evidence of unusual craft, materials, bodies, or archived records is believed to exist. ""The White House has told the DoD to make it happen,” he said. “The extent at which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that ‘we're backing his request. Do what you can to make it happen.'"" Burlison told the podcast, highlighting official support for his mission.

Burlison also mentioned an object housed outside the US so large a building had been constructed around it, though he could not reveal the site due to classification. ""It's going to involve a lot to make that happen, but that may be the final destination,"" he said.



In previous statements, Burlison has claimed President Trump was ""fully briefed"" on the existence of aliens, recovered UFOs dating back to the 1940s, and alleged alien-human hybrids currently living on Earth, reports the Daily Mail.

Now, with alleged leaks suggesting the White House may reveal what it knows about extraterrestrials by July, the UAP committee could soon be in possession of tangible proof of non-human intelligence.

Initially a skeptic, Burlison said he became convinced of the reality of UFOs after hearing whistleblower David Grusch's public testimony in early 2023. He later connected Grusch with

Congress, helping facilitate hearings that have featured dramatic evidence from military personnel.

The Trump Administration has given the green light to reveal the secret UFO facilities to one of the leading voices in Congress calling for full disclosure of alien life.

US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri revealed that he has requested and been granted access to secure locations, such as Area 51, which have decades-old ties to UFOs and secret government projects. 

Speaking on the ALN Podcast, Burlison added that the request to President Trump and his staff included visiting US military bases and facilities where evidence suggests unidentified craft, materials, bodies, or archives allegedly exist.

Burlison is a member of the congressional oversight committee involved in the ongoing investigation into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs.

Although the US government and the Pentagon have officially denied that there has been any physical evidence of UFOs or alien life ever recovered, Congress has heard from multiple whistleblowers claiming secret programs have covered up the truth.

In fact, Burlison has previously claimed President Trump has been 'fully briefed' on the existence of aliens, UFOs recovered by the military since the 1940s, and alien-human hybrids allegedly living on Earth today. 

Now, as Trump insiders have allegedly leaked that the White House is planning to reveal what America knows about extraterrestrials by July, the UAP committee may soon have the physical proof of non-human intelligence in their hands.

The congressman revealed: 'The White House has told the DoD to make it happen. The extent to which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that ""we're backing his request. Do what you can to make it happen.""'

Area 51 (Pictured) has been tied to UFO encounters and advanced military aircraft since the 1950s

US Congressman Eric Burlison (Pictured) has claimed that he has received approval from the White House to visit classified US facilities allegedly tied to evidence of alien life

Over the years, multiple US military sites have been linked to non-human craft, including facilities, anonymous sources have said, that were housing crashed spaceships and experimental aircraft constructed using reverse-engineered alien technology.

These include Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas, and the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), home to Area 51.

'There is reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved, that they've built an entire building around it,' Burlison said during the January 30 podcast.

The congressman noted that this facility outside the US was classified so he was unable to reveal its exact location, but it was on his list of places he had requested to visit as part of the committee's investigation. 

'It's going to involve a lot to make that happen, but that may be the final destination.'

Burlison said during the interview that he started as a UFO skeptic but was convinced these phenomena were real after listening to whistleblower David Grusch's public interview shortly after entering Congress in early 2023.

The Missouri Republican reached out to Grusch, connected him to the House Oversight Committee, and helped facilitate the string of public hearings that have revealed shocking evidence of alien encounters from respected military officials.

Most of the current evidence has taken the form of images and videos of alleged non-human craft captured by both civilians and military personnel. Many have been leaked to the public after being classified by the Pentagon for years.

President Trump (Pictured) expressed skepticism that reports of UFOs were real during a June 2024 interview but has allegedly granted access to secret bases tied to such claims

The November 2025 documentary 'The Age of Disclosure' alleged that there's been an 80-year cover-up on UFOs and alien technology

Burlison himself revealed never-before-seen video of a US military drone striking an orb-shaped UFO with a Hellfire missile during a September 2025 UAP hearing.

The shocking footage from October 30, 2024 revealed that the unidentified craft not only survived the missile strike, but continued to fly away at extreme speed as the 100-pound, air-to-ground precision weapon simply bounced off the UFO's hull.

The congressman added that access to government records on UAP has been intentionally made difficult to obtain and convoluted to research, with some agencies allegedly failing to report their data properly to Congress.

'We created government, and it's not the right of any government to withhold from you and I the truth about reality,' Burlison declared.

'No government has the right to withhold from you and I that we might be alone or not alone in the universe. That is not their right. That is not classified. That's a truth that humanity deserves to know.'

Burlison has previously claimed to have 'a lead' on new UFO whistleblowers. However, he said during the new interview that it's been difficult to convince potential witnesses to risk losing their government clearances in retaliation, comparing these individuals to 'guinea pigs' in terms of how the Pentagon would respond.

In this story:

SAN FRANCISCO — Consider this Seahawks season an exercise in exorcisms. All ghosts—Sam Darnold's reference to seeing them in 2019, Russell Wilson's Super Bowl XLIX interception, lingering organizational tension from then to now, to cite just three examples—have been busted or can be, in two days, at Super Bowl LX.

This is where Keith Linder enters the conversation. In 2011, he moved from Austin to Seattle, for a job as a software engineer at Microsoft. He rented a house in Bothell, Wa., which is located northeast of downtown. He chose from the offerings on Craigslist. At that point, neither Linder, nor his girlfriend, Tina, knew anything about paranormal activity.

“No,” Linder tells Sports Illustrated in a phone interview last week. “We got baptized.”

The strange started on May 1, 2012. They started hearing this sound, like a baby was coughing, incessantly, day and night. Maybe, they thought, those noises were coming from their neighbors. They were not. They searched every inch of their rental home. And, still, cough-cough-cough.

Then their car keys started to mysteriously vanish. Silverware disappeared. Then the knocking started. Then it really got weird. While they watched television on the couch, a potted plant levitated off the ground, spun in a circle and dropped back in place. Then what Linder describes as a “demonic drawing” suddenly appeared on one wall.

This forced Linder to consider a notion he had never considered previously. Was this house—safe neighborhood, five bedrooms, 2-1/2 baths, constructed only six years earlier—actually … haunted? He thought so. Tina agreed. “But I didn't want to run,” Linder says. “I felt I deserved this house. I worked hard to acquire it.”

He chose, at that moment, to do what many Seahawks players and coaches have done over the past 11 years. He chose to live with his ghosts. Perhaps then he could understand them.

Where might he go for help? Linder wondered that every single day. There wasn't an 800 number to call. Real-life Ghostbusters didn't exist. There was no “I'm haunted” support group.

This club, Linder says, is a tiny one. It's divided between charlatans and people who sound like charlatans. The latter believe they experienced paranormal activity, and they tell their ghost stories while realizing they sound farfetched. Those stories sound farfetched to them, even.

Linder is a Seahawks fan and a football fan, and after I reached out to him, he did some research in relation to Seattle's ghosts. He found several instances of Darnold using that phrase, seeing ghosts, that dated back to high school. He figured Darnold wasn't even aware of that apparent subconscious theme. He also saw Darnold living with the ghosts he saw, in theoretical senses, on football fields.

“I was trying to rationalize [my experience],” Linder says. “Darnold must have felt like that. He was there. He couldn't make sense of it. But it builds you, internally.”

He also wondered if Darnold would follow the same stages that he did.

One: Deny.

Two: Hunt—for the cause of this activity, for any noise, in any corner of the house; and, soon, for answers, to rid the space of paranormal happenings or reduce them or anything that might end the madness he experienced daily.

Three: Fight.

Four: Flight.

Linder didn't know that the greater-Seattle area marked something of a haven for paranormal activity, at least for those who believe in that kind of thing. Several companies run “ghost” tours that ferry tourists around downtown. There's also an underground city, a series of interconnected tunnels, built after a major, crippling fire in 1889. There have been reports of ghost sightings or paranormal activity since then.

The paranormal activity inside that Bothell Hell House picked up, anyway. Loud bangs. Louder crashes. Slamming doors. Flying scissors and airborne kitchen knives, some of which lodged into walls after slicing through them. More violence, the screams closer to existential. Pages torn from Bibles and scattered all over. A burning Bible after that. Plates falling to the ground and breaking. Forks levitating off the table. Blaring fire alarms. Lights all turning off at the same time. Every lightbulb in the house, exploding, at the same time. And that plant! It levitated on a schedule, almost, multiple times a day. Even when they hosted, guests believed they had been touched or grabbed or had their hair pulled by unseen forces.

What else could he do? Linder continued fighting. He hired an exorcist to bless the space and rid it of any evil spirits. This ritual came with two warnings: It might not work and it could anger the very spirits it was supposed to banish. That worked—for all of two days. Then they reached out to Ghost Adventures, a popular reality show on the Travel Channel. That film crew investigated what's now known as the Bothell Hell House for most of a day, using machines to search for electromagnetic pulses which, for paranormal believers, often identify the presence of ghosts. They found none.

Linder became increasingly, deeply and darkly depressed. He found another paranormal investigator online. Everyone in that world knew Don Phillips, a United Kingdom–based paranormal investigator. He flew to Seattle immediately, with a crew, and lived in the house for roughly a month. He caught—again, there's no way to prove this in an objectively verifiable sense—more than 400 recordings of … ghosts. Of that tally, 28 recordings were direct responses to the investigator's questions. Phillips told Linder he made eye contact with the spirits who, yes, haunted his home. One was a small child. Another poltergeist led all the others—an elderly woman, believe it or not. She was a mess—hair pointing in every direction, torn clothes, confused, angry, fearful.

Soon, they uncovered another piece of critical info. There had been Irish settlement near that property more than 100 years earlier, and many families that called that settlement home had also buried their dead nearby. This is where the ghosts—again, can't prove it!—came from.

At that point, much like Darnold departing the Jets, Panthers, 49ers and Vikings before landing in Seattle, with the Seahawks, Linder chose the flight option. Sometimes, he regrets that decision. He doesn't regret the alternative reality, worst-case: him, living in a mental institution, his room padded and his food slipped under the door.

This is his advice to those Seahawks who have or are exorcising ghosts: They have two options. They can fly. Or they can fight. They can bury their demons. But it works far better, he says, to reason with them, understand them and work toward resolutions.

In many, significant ways, that is the story of this Seahawks season. Linder now works downtown, where Lumen Field looms outside the window of his office. He says he grew up in a spiritual household but didn't believe in ghosts at all until he met the ones that haunted him. Now, he says, about half of him believes in the paranormal. “I like that,” he says. “A season of exorcisms.”

I ask to visit the Bothell Hell House. Linder says the current residents do not want visitors, which is understandable, given the wide berth of humanity that shows up at that door. He says not to park too close, which could anger or awaken the spirits that remain inside. He says one person who called him said their car broke down on that block. Others got flat tires, blown-out engines or experienced paranormal activity themselves. He doubted that would happen. But he said that ghosts that haunt houses like the one he rented are always there. They might be dormant more often than not. But they're there, and they're there for a reason.

The eerie realization dawned the moment I turned onto the Hell House's street. You can't make this up. It's located on Stafford Way. The Seahawks had vanquished their hated rival, the Los Angeles Rams, twice in the previous five weeks. Another ghost, slayed. Just like the symbols of stick figures that showed up on Linder's walls, drawn but upside down, Linder could flip “way” and get close to Maye, as in Drake, the Patriots quarterback—the ghost ahead.

“It's their duty to test you,” Linder says. “The Seahawks have embraced their tests. That's why they're in this Super Bowl.” Because of Exorcism Season.

Mike Vrabel's playing days: “The thing that amazed me is we would have a period for special teams. Mike was on a lot of [special teams units]. But for the ones he wasn't on, he and Rodney Harrison wanted to be on the ‘look teams' for those, for [units] that they weren't going to be involved in. That's Mike.”

Vrabel's personality: “He knew I hated it when he would do this. In OTAs or at minicamps, [the defense] would run line stunts. And Mike would always grab one of the offensive linemen, so the defensive tackle could come around them, and we couldn't get our tackle off of Mike. So he's grabbing the heck out of our tackle, and he's looking right at me and just smiling like a Halloween pumpkin, knowing it's gonna drive me crazy. And I would be like, F—ing Vrabel.”

Bill Belichick assistants or former players and their collective struggles as head coaches: “With Mike right now, it's original. It's not Belichick, O.K.? And it's not anyone else he ever played for. He's his own guy. He's not the reincarnation of Belichick at all.”

Vrabel's softer side: “My first exposure to Mike in his playing career was when we went to West Virginia during training camp and worked against the Houston Texans. Mike was coaching the outside linebackers. And I would look over, across the field, look at him, and he was over there, and they would play this game with a big ball, almost like Four Square. And the next thing I'd see was Mike, out there, with his players. He would take this kind of chest protector, strap it to his body and a rusher or a blocker. Me? I'd get slaughtered.”

One point of clarification on this game that I hadn't heard, despite years and years of reporting on Wilson's interception, before. The Seahawks head coach that game, Pete Carroll, has been criticized ever since that attempt left Wilson's right hand for not taking accountability in the aftermath, whether immediate or long-term. But according to three people who were in the Seahawks locker room that night before it opened to the media, Carroll said the following: “If you're going to point fingers at anyone, point them at me. I'm sorry.”

Carroll didn't call the play, throw the pass, run the wrong route or fail to account for Malcolm Butler. Yet he has borne the brunt of the torrent of criticism that resulted from that INT. He should be credited for that. He did take accountability—and he did absorb far more blame than he deserved. His former players, though, see that moment in the locker room as in contrast with every other action or statement that came from Carroll in the aftermath. They see accountability—but only to a point.

Two related nuggets I haven't seen before. One comes from one of those sources, who voiced what many in the organization felt: That the Seahawks defense should have taken more accountability for that defeat. They gave up a 10-point lead with 10 minutes left, after all.

The other: after the XLIX loss but before the start of the next season, assistant coach Tom Cable had apparently had enough. He called out the defense in one team meeting. Told them to stop complaining. Told them they hadn't played perfectly that night, either.

When Cooper Kupp tore through his final training session in Southern California last spring, before he would head to Seattle and join his Rams' division rival Seahawks, the depth of his impact on Los Angeles and the Rams' Super Bowl team from the 2021 was fully revealed.

Quarterback Matthew Stafford dropped by, as did wideout Puka Nacua, as did retired franchise cornerstone Andrew Whitworth. “That just shows you what kind of impact he has had on all these people, man,” says Ryan Sorensen, the trainer who led that session and has worked with Kupp since the 2020 season. “You could tell he just knew. He was going to use all that energy and just completely, utterly dominate.”

Even if Seattle wins this Super Bowl, Sorensen and other members of Kupp's tight inner circle don't believe, not for a second, that he will retire.

Before Canaan Smith-Njigba became a professional baseball player and Jaxon Smith-Njigba became a professional football player, they grew up in Rockwall, Texas. Their father, Maada, loved to “knock out all the sports in one day,” Canaan says. That meant football, basketball, baseball, development for all three and forays into other athletic endeavors.

It also led to what Canaan describes as no less than his brother's destiny, to do what Jaxon has done this season. Canaan says he knew Jaxon would enter the all-time greats conversation when Jaxon was 3 or 4. “As a toddler, he was able to run, catch, throw early on,” Canaan says. “Always been advanced. Always loved football. You could see it.”

Sources remain all over the place on the ankle injury Seahawks do-everything safety Nick Emmanwori suffered in Wednesday's practice, per the pool report that day. Best I can tell: He'll play Sunday but not at full health.

The teams participating in this Super Bowl are staying in Santa Clara and San Jose. The vast majority of the media hoard is bunking in San Francisco. Interviews force long bus rides from one place to the other. If anyone needs an expert on 101-S between those locations …

“My dad—that'd be the dream guy to block.”

That's from Grey Zabel, the Seahawks left guard. He's close with his father, Mark, who played outside linebacker at the Division II college level.

Trump admin reportedly agrees to disclose alleged alien secrets at US bases","https://www.wionews.com/trending/epstein-files-distraction-trump-admin-reportedly-agrees-to-disclose-alleged-alien-secrets-at-us-bases-1770350889695","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 04:31:00 GMT","

Area 51 and other facilities rumoured to be holding alien spacecraft and bodies of extraterrestrial creatures have been opened for investigation. This means the Trump administration is ready for a tell-all about aliens at a time when the Epstein Files have angered people. 

Donald Trump has reportedly allowed the release of all information linked to secret UFO facilities in the United States, such as Area 51. This pertains to all such places that are rumoured to be hiding bodies of aliens, and where alleged sightings of unidentified spacecraft have been made. US Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri had requested the president to grant him access to secure locations, which are tied to UFOs and secret government projects. He told the ALN Podcast that he has been permitted to visit these places, which could be hiding archives and other material linked to these ""extra-terrestrial"" visitors. Several people have told Congress at hearings that the government has known about alien visits for decades and has covered up everything about them. They say there are alien spacecraft and even dead bodies of these space visitors at particular places in the US. The congressional oversight committee has been investigating these claims linked to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). Burlinson is a member of this committee.

The congressman has in the past claimed that alien-human hybrids are living on Earth today, and Trump has been briefed about them. He says the president also knows about UFOs recovered by the military since the 1940s and kept at these secret facilities. There have been reports in the past weeks that the White House is preparing to release information on everything linked to aliens on Earth. Burlinson said, ""The White House has told the DoD to make it happen. The extent at which they've been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defense that 'we're backing his request. Do what you can to make it happen.""'

The Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), where the infamous Area 51 exists, is the most well-known place often linked to aliens. It is primarily a classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility where top-secret weapons and aircraft are tested. People have often reported seeing strange objects in the air hovering over this place, making it one of the most talked-about places linked to aliens. Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio are the other places where alleged extraterrestrial activities have been reported.

This green light to release all information about aliens comes at a time when not just the US, but the entire world is shocked to learn about the horrible details in the Epstein Files. Trump has also been named in the files, with extreme allegations being made that he auctioned off young girls at Mar-a-Lago. A victim in the papers also claimed that he killed his newborn baby. Many more high-profile names have been revealed in the new Epstein papers, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton and Elon Musk. The timing of this announcement on alien facilities clashes with the rage over the gory details in the Epstein Papers.

Veteran Bible teacher and author Victoria Harr announces the release of her new book, Awakening Your Spiritual Senses, a faith centered work that invites readers to move beyond surface level belief and into a deeper experiential relationship with God through the Holy Spirit.

In Awakening Your Spiritual Senses, Harr explores the idea that just as God created humans with five natural senses of hearing, seeing, touching, tasting, and smelling, He has also given believers spiritual senses. These spiritual senses often remain unnoticed until God activates them. When awakened, they intersect with the natural realm and allow believers to experience God's presence and the spiritual realm in fresh and transformative ways.

This book reflects Harrs personal journey and decades of teaching on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. She explains how spiritual senses operate and how God desires to reveal Himself through them. Each chapter introduces a spiritual sense and includes teaching followed by impartation and activation exercises that encourage direct interaction with God. The goal is not only understanding, but transformation and deeper intimacy with Him.

Victoria Harr is a mother, grandmother, and great grandmother who has taught the Bible for over forty years. She has served in a wide range of ministry and outreach roles including Shiloh Youth Revival Centers Inc., World Wide Pictures, the Salvation Army, and BLAST, an after school program serving low income families. While working as a legal secretary, she also led weekly Bible studies in a corporate environment for twenty years.

Her ministry lifestyle includes mentoring women, one on one discipleship, and speaking in churches, classrooms, retreats, and seminars. She leads prayer teams that focus on listening prayer and operates in the prophetic, particularly through Words of Knowledge. Based in San Diego, California, Harr remains active in her home church where she creates and teaches curriculum with a strong emphasis on spiritual gifts and spiritual senses.

Awakening Your Spiritual Senses adds to Harrs collection of published works, which include Spiritual Gifts, A Grandmother's Legacy to Her Grandchildren, A Grandmother's Life as Told to Her Grandchild, and Single Mom What Now.

Harr hopes this book will inspire believers to pursue spiritual growth and refuse to settle for ordinary faith. Once you have experienced Him, you will never be satisfied to look back.

Okay scream queens, horror girls, and sapphics who like their yearning served with a side of impending doom—Whistle is very much for you. 

Arriving in theaters on Friday, February 6, the new supernatural horror film blends old-school teen terror with something the genre has historically struggled to deliver: a properly developed lesbian love story that's an important subplot. On its surface, Whistle embraces the best traditions of early 2000s horror—hot teens making terrible choices, cursed objects with a body count, and death lurking like it's got a personal vendetta. But beneath the blood and bone is a soft, aching queer romance that raised the stakes far beyond who survives the final act.

The film follows Chrys, played by Daphne Keene (His Dark Materials, Logan), a guarded teen with a traumatic past who moves in with her cousin, hoping for a fresh start. New town, new school, but unfortunately, familiar havoc: bullies, mean girls, and an unsettling sense that something ancient and evil is waiting in the wings. That something turns out to be a death whistle, a hexed object that seals your fate once blown by two people. It's ominous, deeply unfair, and very much not extracurricular-club approved.

Enter Ellie, played by Sophie Nélisse (Yellowjackets, Heated Rivalry), a kind-hearted, open-minded classmate who immediately becomes Chrys's emotional anchor—and, let's be real, the crush of every baby sapphic watching. Where Chrys is closed off and sharp-edged, Ellie is warmth and sincerity incarnate. Their connection is instant and magnetic, the kind of pull that feels both exhilarating and terrifying when you're young, queer, and still figuring out how to name what you want.

As Nélisse explained to PRIDE, “They're complete polar opposites, but there are two magnets that are so drawn into each other…They bring out the best in each other, but also they bring out a strength that I don't think they would have been able to ever find on their own.” That strength, unfortunately, becomes essential once death starts quite literally hunting them down.

What makes Whistle stand out isn't just its mythology, but the way it treats love as something worth fighting and dying for. The relationship between Chrys and Ellie isn't a throwaway subplot or queer window dressing; it's the emotional core of the film. Their bond becomes a form of survival, a rare tenderness in a story otherwise filled with dread and gore.

Director Corin Hardy, who co-wrote the film with Owen Egerton, was intentional about grounding the horror in emotional reality. “It was just a big part of what appealed to me in telling the story of Whistle,” Hardy told PRIDE. “As well as the great mythology and this concept of your future death coming to hunt you down…I want the heart, and I want to have characters you care for.” That care is evident in every quiet glance, awkward smile, and moment of vulnerability the film allows Chrys and Ellie to share.

There's a truth and ache to their romance that almost makes you wish you were watching a different kind of movie—one where the biggest threat is teenage embarrassment instead of supernatural annihilation. For queer viewers especially, their story captures the hope and fear of first love, where being seen can feel just as dangerous as being rejected.

Still, Whistle never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a horror movie. The kills are gruesome, and the tension is relentless. By pairing genuine sapphic tenderness with supernatural terror, Whistle delivers something rare: a horror film that's scarier because you care. Between Keene and Nélisse's gentle, believable chemistry and Hardy's commitment to emotional stakes, the film feels destined to become a cult favorite for queer horror fans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Alien+Encounters","NASA UFO Cover-up Claims Explode as 'Snake-Like Creatures' Allegedly Spotted by Shuttle Pilot","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-ufo-cover-claims-explode-snake-like-creatures-allegedly-spotted-shuttle-pilot-1776859","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 10:58:00 GMT","

The internet erupted this week after a physicist with past NASA ties claimed astronauts may have witnessed strange objects in space, including snake-like shapes seen by a shuttle pilot. Supporters say the comments expose years of hidden UFO encounters, while critics warn the stories remain unverified anecdotes rather than confirmed science.

The controversy has revived decades-old mission transcripts, astronaut interviews and conspiracy theories that suggest NASA downplayed unusual sightings to avoid public panic. So what is actually behind the viral claims, and do they truly prove a cover up?

The debate began after a podcast interview featuring a physicist who previously worked with NASA resurfaced online. During the discussion, he alleged that some astronauts had witnessed unexplained objects in orbit and claimed certain reports were ignored by official investigations. He also questioned why astronaut experiences were not heavily discussed in past NASA commissions.

According to the physicist, several individuals with aerospace backgrounds privately shared stories of unusual encounters. He claimed some had seen mysterious crafts or lights moving in ways that did not resemble known satellites or space debris. While he admitted that many accounts came from personal conversations rather than official reports, supporters quickly framed his remarks as proof of a long-running suppression effort.

One of the most viral claims involved shuttle pilot Story Musgrave, who reportedly described seeing snake-like shapes moving through space. Online commentators interpreted this as evidence of unknown life forms or advanced technology. However, experts note that visual illusions in space are common due to lighting effects, floating debris and reflections from spacecraft surfaces.

The physicist also referenced conversations with Apollo era astronauts who allegedly observed flashing lights or unidentified objects. In one story, a red light photographed near a space station sparked speculation because satellites rarely display visible lights. Yet no official NASA confirmation links these incidents to extraterrestrial activity, and alternative explanations such as equipment reflections remain possible.

Another key part of the viral narrative involves Gemini era mission transcripts, which conspiracy theorists say describe a UFO passing near astronauts and interfering with instruments. The physicist suggested that such events deserved more scientific scrutiny. Online forums quickly amplified the idea that NASA deliberately omitted certain details from public reports.

Space historians caution that mission transcripts often contain references to unknown objects that were later identified as debris or natural phenomena. Equipment malfunctions were also common during early spaceflight, making it difficult to separate technical issues from alleged encounters. No publicly verified document confirms deliberate UFO interference with astronaut systems.

Despite the intense online reaction, many scientists argue the claims do not prove a cover up. They emphasise that anecdotal stories, personal memories and second hand accounts cannot replace peer reviewed research or physical evidence. NASA has consistently stated that it investigates unexplained aerial and space phenomena using scientific methods and that most sightings eventually receive conventional explanations.

Analysts say the viral reaction highlights how quickly sensational claims can spread when combined with nostalgia for past missions and growing public fascination with UFOs. They add that astronauts often witness unusual visual effects in space, which can appear mysterious without proper context. While the stories remain intriguing, there is currently no confirmed evidence that NASA suppressed proof of alien encounters or hidden space creatures.

The renewed controversy shows that the mystery of unidentified objects continues to capture the public imagination. For now, the explosive headlines may grab attention, but the evidence behind them remains uncertain and heavily debated.

					 Conspiracist influencers have flooded the internet with baseless claims about Kirk's killing — and lawyers in his alleged killer's case are listening.				

PROVO, Utah — The capital murder case against the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk is in its early stages, but conspiracy theories about Kirk's death are already shaping the court proceedings.

Utah prosecutors allege 22-year-old Tyler Robinson shot and killed the CEO of Turning Point USA at a September event on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem — an assassination in broad daylight, witnessed by thousands in person and millions more online. The state says it has compelling evidence in its case against Robinson, including the murder weapon, DNA, bullet casings, security camera footage, text messages and other electronic communications. And, according to the state, Robinson has confessed.

But online, alternative theories and the ham-fisted investigations behind them have taken over. Conspiracist influencers, podcasters and gossip vloggers, armed with little credible evidence to support their claims, have flooded social platforms and fringe media channels with unfounded theories. They claim Robinson was a patsy, framed or possibly controlled by shadowy actors, including, Israel; the U.S. government; Turning Point USA; or even Kirk's widow, Erika, who took over the organization after his death.

The theories are evolving week to week, as wannabe detectives online draw spurious connections between powerful groups and the flight logs of private planes, unverified reports from anonymous tipsters and video of Kirk's killing and the aftermath, collected from dozens of angles, spliced and dissected to paint the picture of a coordinated plot.

Robinson's trial is months away, but these alternative narratives are already seeping into the courtroom.

At a pretrial hearing Tuesday to determine whether state prosecutors should be removed from the case over an alleged conflict of interest, Robinson appeared in a lilac tie and shackles. A pair of conspiracist YouTubers sat on benches directly behind his parents, alongside members of the general public and a few dozen journalists, including this one.

Cross-examining a state agent about the scope of the investigation, defense attorney Kathy Nester asked whether investigators had looked into the alternative theories surrounding the shooting, including online videos claiming the existence of additional shooters.

“These videos have been used far and wide to look to see if there were potentially other shooters in the crowd,” Nester told Bureau of Investigation Agent Dave Hall. “Have you seen this on social media? Thousands of them?”

“Are you aware,” she continued, “that the videos taken from the scene have been analyzed by people on social media and in the press to see if there was somebody else that could have been involved in this?”

“I'm aware that everybody has a theory on the case,” Hall replied.

“Everybody has a theory on it, right?” Nester said. ”Whether those theories are good or bad, or whether your theory is good or bad … you guys should at least take a look at them. Fair?”

Her line of questioning suggests that these outside theories could play a significant role in the case going forward. They've already been invoked by multiple parties, at hearings and in pretrial motions, to sway Judge Tony Graf in one way or another. Robinson's defense cited them as a reason to restrict public access to the proceedings, and by Erika Kirk — as well as lawyers representing a consortium of media — as a reason to make them more public.

The defense asked that video and still cameras be barred, claiming that biased media coverage could unfairly affect Robinson's right to a fair trial. The state objected to the motion. 

“Speculation and misinformation have already developed in the absence of full public access to courtroom proceedings,” prosecutors wrote. “When the public cannot observe testimony, rulings, and evidentiary context directly, narratives inevitably fill the vacuum.”

Turning Point USA's annual convention begins in the shadow of Charlie Kirk's killing


Andy Campbell 



For months, Erika Kirk has been targeted by online mobs alleging her complicity in her husband's killing — bizarre claims that Turning Point USA has countered with public denials and cease-and-desist letters. On Monday, Kirk invoked the conspiracy theories in her own court filing, asking Graf not to limit public access to the proceedings.
“Public attention cannot be ignored,” Kirk wrote. Without access, she continued, the public won't be able to see the evidence for themselves, and “in the absence of transparency, speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories are likely to proliferate, eroding public confidence in the judicial process.”
In court Tuesday, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray seemed to acknowledge that public speculation — if not the conspiratorial claims surrounding the case — had already influenced the case. He said from the witness stand that the state's decision to seek the death penalty, announced just days after Kirk's killing, had been driven in part by a desire to head off such gossip.
Gray said earlier cases had taught him that delaying such decisions only created “unnecessary public speculation” and “unnecessary angst with families of victims.”
“I wanted to shut that out,” Gray said.
It seems clear, though, that the fevered speculation will continue.
Conspiracist creators livestreamed Tuesday's hearing, and within hours, had cut clips from the proceedings into fresh content for their eager audiences. One prominent creator on X called his latest video: “Patsy Plot Unravels.”
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May, when the state will present evidence and a judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. In the meantime, the conspiracy theories will keep spreading online, and may continue to affect the case.

The Ukrainian military recently released photos and videos showcasing one of Russia's most recent attempts at breaking Ukraine's defenses – quirky camouflage costumes designed to make the wearer harder to detect against the white backdrop of the snow-covered battlefield. Only they don't seem to be working very well. If anything, they only make the wearer easier to spot.

Clips of Russian soldiers wearing white thermal ponchos that, at first glance, make them look like giant penguins have been doing the rounds on social media, inspiring all sorts of hilarious comments. The bulky camouflage comes complete with beak-like hoods designed to complete the giant penguin look, even though penguins are not native to Ukraine.

The bizarre camouflage is reportedly very cheap, but that is the one positive thing that can be said about it. Even though it might help make wearers harder to detect by the naked eye in snow-covered environments, modern military rarely relies on simple human vision. Drones equipped with thermal cameras and motion detectors patrol disputed battlefront lines, making it very hard for camouflaged soldiers to sneak through. 

Ukrainian intelligence claims at least two Russian giant penguins were neutralized by drones as they were trying to traverse open fields wearing the goofy costumes. Nighttime might have given them an advantage, but in broad daylight, they stood out like a sore thumb, even against the snowy backdrop.

The giant penguin camouflage suits have been getting a lot of attention in the media, but experts say that they are just another attempt by the Russian military to field-test new equipment without prolonged testing or refinement, at the cost of conscript lives.

Russian Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseev has been shot multiple times in Moscow by an unknown assailant, the Kremlin said on Feb 6.

""There was an attempt on the life of Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeeev in Moscow. He was taken to hospital, and a criminal case has been opened,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov told reporters.

According to reports, the gunman fled the scene of the attack and their identity is unknown, with Peskov saying ""security services are doing their work.""

""The killer was waiting for the Lieutenant General of the Russian Defense Ministry today near a residential building on Volokolamskoye Highway,"" the Russian media channel SHOT reports.

In response to the shooting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blamed Kyiv for the assassination attempt on Alekseev, accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of ""provocations aimed at destabilizing the (peace) negotiation process.""

Moscow's accusations come as Russian forces continue both offensive operations across the front line, and their long-range strike campaign against energy infrastructure in Ukrainian cities, despite an alleged promise from Russian president Vladimir Putin to U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to pause such strikes.

Ukraine is yet to comment on the shooting.

Alekseev — born in 1961 in Soviet Ukraine — is the first deputy head of Russian military intelligence (GRU), serving in the role since 2011.

He was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2016 for organizing ""malicious cyber activities"" during the U.S. presidential election of that year which saw Donald Trump win his first term in office. 

The Kremlin reportedly awarded him the title of Hero of the Russian Federation the following year. 

Alekseev has also been accused by the U.K. and EU of orchestrating the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury in 2018 that targeted Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. 

They survived, but a British civilian who later found the poison was killed.

The general was the senior member of the Russian delegation negotiating the final surrender in 2022 of the defenders of the surrounded, Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.

Despite Alekseev's promises that the surrendering Ukrainian soldiers would be treated in line with the Geneva Conventions, POWs from Azovstal were subject to systemic torture and abuse, wrote Denys Prokopenko, leader of the Ukrainian contingent at the time and now commander of the 1st Azov Corps of the National Guard. 

""Even if Alekseev survives this time, he will not sleep peacefully. And one day the matter will be brought to an end,"" Prokopenko added.

Alekseev was also instrumental in quelling the short-lived Wagner rebellion in 2023, being one of those sent to negotiate with Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Ukraine has not been officially linked to the shooting and is yet to comment, though Kyiv has previously targeted Russian officials involved in Moscow's full-scale invasion.

Most recently, Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff's operational training department, was killed in a car bombing in Moscow on Dec. 22.

An explosive device attached to the underside of the lieutenant general's car detonated in the morning on Yaseneva Street in Moscow. Sarvarov was taken to the hospital but later died from his injuries.

News Operations Editor 

Chris York is news operations editor at the Kyiv Independent. Before joining the team, he was head of news at the Kyiv Post. Previously, back in Britain, he spent nearly a decade working for HuffPost UK. He holds an MA in Conflict, Development, and Security from the University of Leeds.



The changes will target units that are responsible for intercepting Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.



""Today, I was watching Ukrainian (prisoners of war) who returned home from Russia, and these are the people who deserve the Peace Prize,"" Moldovan President Maia Sandu said.

Some of the meetings could have been linked to Yermak's role in a corruption case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency, the news outlet reported. 



The drone, a small commercially available model, crashed at the 1st Air Cavalry Battalion's base in the Lodz province after snagging a tree. No damage was recorded, the Polish military police reported.

The Russian soldiers — roughly the size of an entire platoon — were taken prisoner during the final clearing of the village of Zoloty Kolodiaz near Dobropillia in Donetsk Oblast.

Ukraine must fully align its agricultural standards with the European Union by the end of 2028, Ukraine's Deputy Economy Minister Tasas Vysostky said on Feb. 6, as the country continues its push for membership.

 The Kyiv Independent's Jared Goyette speaks with a Canadian volunteer, Brittney Shki-Giizis, who left the Canadian military to fight in Ukraine. A former tank instructor, she explains why she chose to come to the front, how she learned Ukrainian to serve in a Ukrainian unit, and how the war's shift toward drones led her to become an FPV (first-person view) drone pilot.



""The new package of sanctions covers energy, financial services, and trade,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

He has been rushed to hospital and the gunman fled the scene, according to reports. 

The victim of the explosion, which took place early in the morning, was a 21-year-old local man, local police wrote after the incident.

Serhiy Deineko, who headed the State Border Guard from 2019 to Jan. 4, 2026, was charged last month in relation to a 204,000 euro bribery scheme.

There are a few reliable ways to supercharge a news story. At the Olympics, the key is to wedge the word “penis” in there somewhere. 

Lots has happened in Milan already. Nothing will be as sticky in the global hive mind as Penisgate. 

This is the story of male ski jumpers injecting acid into their members for the purposes of incrementally engorging their downstairs measurements. A bigger unit means you will be fitted with a larger ski suit. 

The suits act like sails. Measurements are taken using 3-D imaging. Even a slightly enlarged suit can add a measurable distance to the length of a jump. For that reason, skiers will go to great lengths – and apparently thicknesses – to game the system. 

The old way of doing this was packing your underwear with clay. But then some bright bulb said, “Wait. Don't we have some joint-lubricating acid lying around? And a bunch of syringes? You see where I'm going with this, right?”

Ski jumping strikes a balance between aggressive technique and cautious navigation. Get ready to ride along

Penisgate – or, in its original, penis-wirbel – isn't new, after Germany's Bild tabloid blew the lid off this story weeks ago. But no penis-related news matters until it is given the imprimatur of the Games of the Olympiad. 

This story received that at the World Anti-Doping Agency's opening press conference, when someone asked WADA's president about it.

“I promise you I'm going to look at it,” Witold Banka said, with what the Guardian called a “wry smile.” I'm sure that's one way to describe his expression.

Why are penises such a recurring theme at the Olympics? Maybe it's the fact that in the midst of this very serious business, where the participants' lives are constantly forking between agony and ecstasy, everyone needs a release valve. 

There are only a few things that translate through every culture. In that sense, dick jokes are like Shakespeare. 

You absolutely cannot tell one of those during the NHL playoffs. Professional hockey is not a serious enough business. It would be in bad taste. It's only at the Olympics that the ridiculous can be sublime. 

When you run the words “penis” and “Olympics” through the Factiva news database, you get 3,400 hits. Many of these stories chart clumsy attempts at beating urine tests, resulting in many a reactionary “ha ha” column. You could build a museum to house all the prosthetic penises athletes at every level have used over the years. 

A great Olympic penis story can't be a depressing reminder of human frailty, or not just that. There must be some element of cleverness or rising above. 

Everything you need to know about the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics

At the last Games in Paris, French pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati became a global sensation after his bulge snagged the bar. This was kind of a sad story. Ammirati bombed out of the qualifying rounds of his event and became a punchline.

Had he done this at the French junior track and field championships, no one would be allowed to talk about it. Too cruel. But since it was the Games, Ammirati's spandex-abetted disaster became Instagram's front page for a week. After a while, people began to feel bad about it, as they should. Poor Ammirati. He's just a person. A physically blessed person. 

He made a TikTok wherein he gnawed pizza by himself, staring into the middle distance, captioned, “POV: You make more buzz for your package than your performance.”

That Ammirati was in on the joke gave everyone else permission to keep telling it. It was a remarkable act of grace, as well as the smart move. 

Think of it this way – he could be an Olympian or he could be that Olympian. I'm sure it hasn't hurt his social life. 

This time around, the penis moment is the greatest thing that's ever happened to ski jumping. This is not a sport of skill, so much as bravery. Even an amateur can tell that by watching it. 

Based on recent reporting, the discipline is awash in illegal hijinks. Norway invented the sport, and once dominated it. Recently, their team was caught tampering with – you guessed it, didn't you? – the crotches of their suits. Five athletes and coaches received bans. 

The incident produced a few knockout quotes – including, “We regret it like dogs,” from coach Magnus Brevig, and, “This is doping, just with a different needle,” from competitor Jens Weissflog – but didn't really catch the world's attention. Because it wasn't at the Olympics, and no one had the sense to say penis instead of crotch. 

Then Witold Banka wandered into frame chewing on a metaphoric cigar and off you go. I will guarantee you one thing – more people around the world will watch ski jumping this year than ever before. If you were to heat map where their eyes go on the screen as the competitors are flying through the air, the segment would need a PG-13 rating.

Were I a ski jumper, I'd lean into this. Maybe wear a T-shirt that says, “I'm just happy to see you.” Answer questions about it in a Fozzie Bear voice. But sadly, no. Nobody has yet had Ammirati's sense. Maybe they will be able to laugh about it once their competitions are over. 

Laughter is one commodity that can be thin on the ground at an Olympics. In fairness, it's hard to be funny when you're constantly aware that if you blow it, you will be blowing it in front of the whole world. 

But in the midst of all these big emotions, a bit of silliness isn't just a relief. It's the counterpoint that helps give the whole show its humanity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","LA Olympics chief faces calls to resign after flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell are revealed in Epstein files","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/06/politics/casey-wasserman-la-olympics-ghislaine-maxwell-epstein","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 17:00:47 GMT","


            The head of the coordinating committee for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles is facing calls to step down after emails released by the Justice Department last week show he exchanged racy messages with Ghislaine Maxwell more than 20 years ago.
    


            The messages between Casey Wasserman – who, along with chairing LA28, is also a prominent entertainment and sports agent – and Maxwell were included in the millions of documents released by DOJ last week related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            They show that the pair exchanged several intimate messages in 2003, prompting calls from city officials that Wasserman step down.
    


            During one exchange in March, Wasserman asks Maxwell: “So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”
    


            In another email, dated April 1, 2003, Wasserman, who was married at the time, says to Maxwell: “Where are you, I miss you,” before asking to book a massage.
    


            Wasserman has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Messages for Wasserman left through his talent management company and a crisis public relations firm that represents him were not immediately returned on Thursday.
    


            In a statement to other news outlets, Wasserman apologized for his communications with Maxwell while adding he “never had” a personal or business relationship with Epstein.
    


            Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, was convicted of sex trafficking and other crimes in 2021 and is serving a 20-year sentence. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.
    


            While some aspects of Wasserman's association with Epstein were already known, the emails show a deeper and far more intimate relationship with Maxwell than had previously been revealed.
    


            Wasserman's communications with Maxwell took place years before she was convicted of a crime.
    


            The messages between the pair threaten to create a major distraction as Los Angeles gears up to host the 2028 games, which are forecasted to generate between roughly $13.6 billion and $17.6 billion in additional gross domestic product for the region and create tens of thousands of new jobs.
    


            Several local officials in Los Angeles have called for Wasserman to step away, describing the stakes of the Olympics as too great to be put at risk.
    


            “Los Angeles cannot trust our financial future to someone connected with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,” City Controller Kenneth Mejia said in a post on X, calling for Wasserman to “take accountability and resign.”
    


            Los Angeles City Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, who also called for Wasserman to step aside, said in an interview with Spectrum News that she was “incredibly disappointed” to learn of Wasserman and Maxwell's close relationship, adding it “really undermines the legacy of what these Games are supposed to represent.”
    


            Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, also calling for Wasserman to resign, said her opposition to his leadership in LA28 was “not about shaming him for his past indiscretions.”
    


            “This is about the message we are sending to Epstein survivors and to the world about our values — especially as we work to combat any sex trafficking associated with the Games,” Hahn told CNN.  “I worry Casey Wasserman's continued leadership almost guarantees that our Los Angeles Olympic Games will be tied in subsequent press coverage to his association with a notorious sex trafficker.”
    


            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that it is “critical to be 100% focused on making our city shine and ensuring the 2028 Games are the best in Los Angeles' history,” but did not go as far as asking for Wasserman's resignation. Instead, the mayor added that any decision pertaining to the leadership of LA28 must rest with its board.
    


            Several members of the LA28 board, which includes nearly three dozen prominent names in business, entertainment, sports and politics, also did not respond to requests from CNN asking if they maintain confidence in Wasserman's ability to lead.
    


            Both the International and US Olympic committees did not respond to requests for comment, but when asked during recent press conferences about Wasserman, leaders of both committees referred to his earlier statement and said they would have nothing to add.

US President Donald Trump has endorsed Prime Minister Viktor Orban ahead of Hungary's parliamentary election in April.

The election will likely be a tough test for Orban's longstanding conservative rule, with the pro-EU Tisza Party, led by Peter Magyar, emerging as the main opposition party.

In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump called Orban a “truly strong and powerful leader” with a record of “phenomenal results.” He said the prime minister has protected Hungary, grown the economy, created jobs, and promoted trade.

Trump went on to say that they have both worked to “Stop Illegal Immigration” and “Ensure LAW AND ORDER,” adding that the US and Hungary have reached “new heights of cooperation” during Orban's term.

Calling the Hungarian leader a close ally and “true friend,” he wrote: “I was proud to ENDORSE Viktor for Re-Election in 2022, and am honored to do so again.”

Last month, Orban quipped that Trump “may have wanted to put Greenland into his whiskey as a large piece of ice,” and although he could not do this, from now on, “that piece of ice is definitely his.”

He added that Trump managed to “kick-start” international institutions that stagnated under what he called “well-mannered European academics.”

Orban is Hungary's longest-serving prime minister, first holding office from 1998 to 2002 before returning to power in 2010.

His Fidesz alliance faces a tough contest in the upcoming election, with a poll by 21 Kutatokozpont on February 3 showing the Tisza Party leading by seven points, with 35% support versus 28% for Fidesz.

Orban also faces strained relations with the EU. A critic of the bloc's Ukraine policy, he has frequently clashed with Brussels, blocking or opposing initiatives such as military aid for Kiev and the EU's push to use frozen Russian assets to fund the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Budapest has opposed the sweeping sanctions imposed on Russia by NATO and the EU, and has criticized Western weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

Orban warned in January that if the pro-EU Tisza Party wins the election, it “will end up taking our children to war as soldiers.”

In Santa Clara, California, where nearly half of residents were born outside the US, fear builds as game approaches

This weekend, tens of thousands of people will make their way to the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, ready to celebrate a weekend at the Super Bowl.

Beneath the jubilant mood, some residents and officials have been grappling with the possibility of ICE enforcement operations during the game, and taking steps to prepare.

Both Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, and her adviser Corey Lewandowski announced in the fall that agents would conduct operations during the nation's largest sporting event. While Homeland Security Investigations teams that are focused on preventing human trafficking and the sale of counterfeit goods have long worked the event, immigration operations would be unusual.

In the city of Santa Clara, where nearly half of residents were born outside the US, fear was building as the game approached, said Lisa Gillmor, the mayor.

People were afraid of being targeted simply for having brown skin, she said: “They're afraid to send their kids to school. There's fear that maybe they should leave during the Super Bowl if the city is going to be inundated with ICE agents.”

This week, however, the NFL, which has long partnered with the DHS, said there would be “no planned ICE enforcement activities”. “We are confident of that,” said Cathy Lanier, the league's chief security officer.

Gavin Newsom, California's governor, said on Thursday that his office had been “assured there will be no immigration enforcement tied to the game”.

In a statement to the Guardian last week, the DHS declined to confirm reports about operations around Levi's Stadium, writing that the agency does “not disclose future operations or discuss personnel”.

“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

The announcement from the NFL has brought relief, but residents are still on edge, said Otto Lee, the president of the Santa Clara county board of supervisors.

“It helps alleviate some fear in the community, but at the same time, we certainly need to prepare for the worst,” Lee said.

Officials in Santa Clara county were already anticipating a demanding year ahead as the area prepared to host some six World Cup games this summer and the Super Bowl.

The threat of an ICE presence added new challenges. 

As the Trump administration has implemented its mass deportation agenda and staged aggressive operations in which agents have killed two US citizens, alarm has spread across the US.

Although northern California has had low ICE arrest rates, communities there have been readying themselves. Last fall, the Trump administration was expected to deploy more than 100 immigration agents to San Francisco, but the president ultimately called off the operation after conversations with the city's mayor and tech leaders. 

Santa Clara county has a rapid response network that tracks ICE activity and provides verified information to residents.

Lee said at a recent board of supervisors meeting that ICE agents don't have “absolute immunity”, and that local law enforcement would arrest anyone who “comes into our county masked, spreading terror, breaking laws or threatening our residents”.

Lee and other officials were outraged by the possibility of ICE activity at the Super Bowl. The county is focused on ensuring it will be a safe event, and enforcement activities would bring chaos. ICE activities in Minnesota created havoc, Lee said, with “incompetent chaos [and] trigger-happy gunmen”.

“That truly endangers everybody's lives. And certainly does not make our community safer,” he added.

On Monday, the US representative Ro Khanna, whose district includes Santa Clara, and some 21 other members of Congress sent a letter to Noem demanding that the DHS not deploy immigration enforcement personnel.

“This should be a moment of celebration, unity and economic opportunity, not a flashpoint for fear, polarization and violence,” they wrote.

This week, the Santa Clara city council passed an ordinance banning federal authorities from using city property for immigration enforcement. Protests are expected outside the game, and volunteers plan to patrol near the stadium around the community looking out for ICE.

Gillmor hopes that the NFL's announcement will hold true, and she suspects that it will, given that the administration likely doesn't want to disrupt the day for wealthy ticket holders. If there were an ICE presence, she said, local law enforcement would not cooperate with the federal agents, as state law mandates.

“I'm trying to calm the waters here to let them know that we have their back in Santa Clara,” she said. “In the event [ICE] did come, we're going to uphold the law no matter what, but they're not going to get any assistance from us.”

But the issues go beyond the Super Bowl, she said, and anxiety will surely escalate in the coming months as the community prepares for the World Cup and visitors from around the world.

“The core issue is ICE and the way that they've conducted their operations,” she said. “Fear is at a crescendo now, but I think that the underlying issue has been building a long time. And it's not going to stop. After this game, it's going to reappear again no matter what.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Death toll from Washington's campaign on alleged drug traffickers now at least 128

The US military on Thursday said it killed two alleged drug traffickers in a strike on a boat in the eastern Pacific, bringing the death toll from Washington's campaign to at least 128.

“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” the US Southern Command said in a post on X. It said “no US military forces were harmed” in the operation.

President Donald Trump's administration began targeting alleged smuggling boats in early September, insisting it was effectively at war with alleged “narco-terrorists” operating out of Venezuela.

But it has provided no definitive evidence that the vessels are involved in drug trafficking, prompting heated debate about the legality of the operations, which have expanded from the Caribbean to the Pacific.

In January, the US military carried out another strike in the eastern Pacific, killing two alleged drug traffickers.

Last week, relatives of two Trinidadian men killed last year in a strike on a boat the military said was carrying drugs filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the US government.

It is the first such case to be brought against the Trump administration over its missile strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Live Updates


            • US-Iran negotiations: The two countries agreed to continue discussions after holding high-stakes indirect talks in Oman today. Iran's foreign minister called them a “good start.”



• Funding fight: Senate Majority Leader John Thune said conversations on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will continue this weekend. The White House said Trump is willing to consider some of Democrats' demands for ICE reforms, but others are “non-starters.”
    


            • Outrage over video: Trump shared a racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, prompting a rare rebuke from the Senate's only Black Republican, Tim Scott, who called it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” It has since been deleted.
    


• Fulton County: Trump defended the involvement of spy chief Tulsi Gabbard in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to comment on whether she sent Gabbard, saying, “She was there, we are inseparable.”
    


            A high-ranking federal appeals court judge today railed against the Trump administration's “obsession” with targeting “woke” diversity, equity and inclusion programs, even as he sided with the government in a case challenging President Donald Trump's efforts to end government support of such initiatives.
    


            In a unanimous decision authored by 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Albert Diaz, the Richmond-based court said two executive orders that sought to crack down on DEI programs in the federal government were legally sound. But the appointee of former President Barack Obama separately noted that the plaintiffs who brought the case had not challenged the application of Trump's orders to any specific program.
    


            He said that while the administration had argued that some DEI programs may be lawful, evidence in the case's record “suggests a more sinister story: important programs terminated by keyword; valuable grants gutted in the dark; worthy efforts to uplift and empower denigrated in social media posts.”
    


            The Trump administration's “obsession over so called ‘woke' DEI programs appears to know no bounds,” Diaz wrote in the solo concurrence, which specifically cited Secretary of State Marco Rubio's decision last year to nix a Joe Biden-era typeface policy intended to make official papers from the department more accessible.
    


            Rubio, Diaz wrote, “somehow found time to rail against the Calibri typeface previously approved for State Department use by his predecessor. I kid you not.”
    


                    “For those disappointed by the outcome, I say this: Follow the law. Continue your critical work. Keep the faith. And depend on the Constitution, which remains a beacon amid the tumult.”
                





            President Donald Trump said Friday he held his first meeting with the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, describing the visit and discussions as positive and focused on maintaining the historic residence.
    


            “Just had my first meeting with the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, and it went really well — Terrific people who adore the Building, and love our Country even more,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            The meeting with the committee, which is tasked with advising on the conservation and protection of the White House, comes as the president has faced criticism for his decision to tear down the East Wing and replace it with a massive new ballroom.
    


            Trump said he “toured them in and around the Lincoln Bedroom, the Queens' Room, the Yellow Oval, the Map Room, the East Room, and more.”
    


            “They loved it all,” the president added.
    


            Trump also used the post to emphasize his administration's approach to maintaining the White House, saying the building “after many years, is being cherished, and properly taken care of!”
    


            The US and Iran have agreed to hold follow-on discussions after consultations with their capitals following today's indirect talks in Oman, an outcome cautiously viewed as a positive result by both sides, according to source familiar.
    


            The US delegation differed from the previous rounds of US-Iran talks, which took place before the US strike on Iranian nuclear sites last year. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff led for the US previously, along with a small team that joined him over time, but Trump's son in law Jared Kushner was in the room this round, and US Central Command Commander Admiral Brad Cooper was part of the delegation.
    


            Kushner had long been expected to join the discussions but Cooper's inclusion in the delegation was not expected far in advance, the source said. His presence marks the first time a senior US military official joined indirect talks with Iran during Trump's second term.
    


Some context: The Iranians grew frustrated with Witkoff over the course of last year's talks and some people involved believe that having new US players could lead to more productive discussions, the source said. Still, the talks' trajectory is yet to be determined, the source warned.
    


            The location for the next round of talks is not yet set in stone but is likely to be Oman, the source said.
    


            In terms of timing, that also remains unclear right now, the source said. Some people involved in the talks believe that slowing down the pace could allow for more robust negotiations to take place, they said.
    


            The White House did not respond when asked for comment.
    


            After the talks ended, in a sign that the US wants to keep up economic pressure, it rolled out new sanctions on Iranian oil and 14 vessels carrying it.
    


            A racist video shared on President Donald Trump's Truth Social account has been deleted, with the White House now blaming a staffer for posting it late Thursday.
    


            “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down,” a senior White House official told CNN.
    


            The post, which depicted former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes, remained online for roughly 12 hours before it was removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially downplayed the video in a statement Friday morning.
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” she said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”
    


Swift backlash: Politicians from both parties, including GOP Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mike Lawler, urged Trump to remove the post. A source familiar with the matter said GOP lawmakers had called Trump to discuss it with him.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Friday that the FBI has arrested a “key participant” behind the 2012 Benghazi terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.
    


            US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed in the September 11, 2012 attack along with State Department employee Sean Smith and Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods are killed in the attack.
    


            “We have never forgotten those heroes, and we have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said.
    


            The man accused landed in the United States early this morning, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday morning. A plane that departed Misrata, Libya, on Thursday landed at the Manassas Regional Airport in Virginia at 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to flight data reviewed by CNN.
    


            The man, Zubayar Al-Bakoush, will face charges including murder, attempted murder, terrorism, and arson, Bondi said.
    


            Bakoush was charged eleven years ago, but the case remained sealed until his arrest Friday, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. Her office will be leading the prosecution.

            Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to say whether she directed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to go to the FBI search at an election center in Fulton County, Georgia.
    


                    “She was there, we are inseparable. That's all I can say,” Bondi said at a news conference. 
                





            Bondi added she is not worried that Gabbard's presence may have tainted evidence in their investigation.
    


            She later noted FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey was “taking the lead” on the matter.
    


            The administration has offered differing explanations for Gabbard's presence.
    


            Here's what Deputy AG Todd Blanche told CNN earlier in the week:
    


            GOP Sen. Tim Scott criticized President Donald Trump for sharing a racist video that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, writing Friday that Trump “should remove it.”
    


                    “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, wrote on X. “The President should remove it.”
                





            The rare rebuke from Scott, who is the only Black Republican in the Senate and was once a vice presidential contender, came hours after Trump shared the video on Truth Social. The video promotes the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen and superimposes the Obamas' faces onto the bodies of apes.
    


            Scott also chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leading the effort to hold onto the GOP's Senate majority in the upcoming midterm elections.
    


            The White House dismissed blowback over the video earlier Friday, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it “fake outrage.”
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” she said.
    


            Indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States were a “positive and good start,” and the two sides agreed to continue the talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told local news outlets after talks concluded in the Omani capital of Muscat.
    


            “There was a consensus on the continuation of the talks themselves. It was decided that this process would continue but the timing, manner, and date of that will be decided in the future,” Araghchi said.
    


            Speaking to Iran's state news agency IRNA, Araghchi reiterated that the talks focused “solely” on the nuclear issue and “we did not discuss any other topics with the Americans.”
    


            Araghchi added that Iran remains distrustful of the US, but if the negotiations continue with the “same view” from Washington, then a “framework” for future talks could be reached.
    


                    “But I do not want to judge now,” he said.
                





            Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said both parties will make a decision on the next round of talks after consultations with their respective governments.
    


            Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the negotiations, described the talks in a post on X as “very serious.”
    


                    “It was useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress,” he wrote. “We aim to reconvene in due course, with the results to be considered carefully in Tehran and Washington.”
                





            The US military conducted a strike against another alleged drug-trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean yesterday, killing two people, according to US Southern Command.
    


            “On Feb. 5, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM Commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” SOUTHCOM wrote on X, adding that no US military personnel were harmed in the strike.
    


            At least 119 people have now been killed in strikes on suspected drug boats as part of a campaign, dubbed Operation Southern Spear, that the Trump administration has said is aimed at curtailing narcotics trafficking.
    


            Indirect talks between Iran and the United States in the Omani capital of Muscat have now ended, with a “willingness to continue,” according to Iranian state news agency IRNA.
    


            Iranian state-affiliated news agency Tasnim said the two countries have agreed that talks will “continue at another time,” without specifying when.
    


            Throughout the day, the Iranian and US delegations “conveyed views, considerations and approaches” through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
    


            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led the Iranian diplomatic delegation, while President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff represented the US. The Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM) Adm. Brad Cooper was also seen in attendance.
    


            President Donald Trump shared a racist video on his social media platform that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, sparking intense condemnation.
    


            The Obamas briefly and suddenly appear near the end of the short video, which promotes false claims that voting machines helped steal the 2020 election, with their faces superimposed onto the bodies of apes. As the images appear, for about one second, the start of the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background.
    


            The post, which recalls the racist trope of comparing Black people with monkeys, prompted swift backlash. In a statement to CNN on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the broader response to the video “fake outrage.”
    


            “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” Leavitt said. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Obamas for comment.
    


            The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the video in a post on X, writing: “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”
    


            The incident is the latest example of Trump drawing criticism for sharing racist content on his social media platform.
    


            Last year, the president posted an apparent AI video depicting Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office. Later last year, Trump and members of his administration also shared digitally altered images and videos of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a fake mustache and a sombrero, imagery Jeffries publicly described as racist.
    


            Today, President Donald Trump will sign executive orders at 3 p.m. ET. As of now, this is closed to the press.
    


            Later in the evening, the president will depart Washington, DC, en route to Palm Beach, Florida.
    


On Saturday: The president will meet with the president of Honduras at 3:30 p.m. ET, which is also closed to press.
    


On Sunday: At 6:30 p.m. ET, Trump is scheduled to attend a Super Bowl watch party, closed to press. The president is expected to return to the White House on Sunday night.
    


            The commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), Admiral Brad Cooper, was seen attending meetings on Iran in Oman.
    


            A video posted by the state-run Oman News Agency showed Cooper participating in talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-la, Jared Kushner during their meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
    


            Albusaidi is mediating between the United States and Iran in the indirect negotiations.
    


            Russia and the United States “recognize the need to begin negotiations” on the issue of the lapsed nuclear monitoring treaty, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a news briefing today.
    


            Peskov also described this week's trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US, hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi, as “both constructive and challenging.”
    


            Asked if Russia was negotiating a short-term extension to the New START treaty with the US, Peskov said: “The provisions can be formally extended; informal extensions in this area are unlikely.”
    


                    “But there is an understanding, and this was also discussed in Abu Dhabi, that both sides will take responsible positions, and both sides recognize the need to begin negotiations on this issue as soon as possible,” Peskov added.
                





            The landmark New START treaty, which capped the nuclear arsenals of both the US and Russia, expired on Thursday, renewing fears about a nuclear arms race between the two biggest nuclear superpowers.
    


            US President Donald Trump said yesterday that the US should negotiate a new and improved nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to a treaty extension.
    


                    “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            Ahead of high-stakes talks with the US on Friday, Iran's foreign minister said his country “enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year.”
    


            “We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X hours before the talks.
    


            The talks are the first official meeting between the two sides since the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites last year and come amid heightened tensions.
    


                    “Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric—they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement,” Araghchi wrote.
                





            Araghchi also met his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Oman's capital Muscat ahead of the talks with the US delegation, Iranian media reported.
    


                    Araghchi told Albusaidi that Tehran is “utilizing diplomacy to secure Iran's national interests” while being “fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and national security” against “adventurism,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
                





            Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that efforts to find agreement over the Department of Homeland Security funding bill will “continue through the weekend.”
    


            He said he prefers a full-year funding extension as a backup but CNN has reported that Democrats are opposed to a short-term deal so far. As of now, the two parties appear to be at an impasse on the issue.
    


Remember: The funding deadline is February 13.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Republicans for not presenting a clear rebuttal to the Democratic demands on funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Thune has also expressed frustration about not being able to get the Democratic side to sit down and negotiate, and many Republicans have said many of the Democratic demands are nonstarters.
    


            High-stakes talks between the US and Iran are underway in the Omani capital of Muscat, Iranian news agencies reported early on Friday.
    


            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the Iranian diplomatic delegation, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special US envoy Steve Witkoff are representing the US.
    


            Araghchi presented to his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi a “preliminary plan” to “manage the current situation” between Iran and the US and advance negotiations, Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. Albusaidi then conveyed the plan to the US delegation led by special envoy Steve Witkoff, and a US response will be delivered to the Iranian side during the talks, IRNA added.
    


            The White House previously offered limited expectations for negotiations, saying President Donald Trump preferred to resolve tensions diplomatically and that he would receive a briefing from his delegates to the discussions afterward.
    


            Trump hopes the large US military buildup he's ordered in the Middle East will act as leverage as he seeks concessions from Iran on its nuclear and missile programs.

President Donald Trump's social media post featuring a video about election conspiracy theories and a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle has been deleted.

The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady.

The deletion, a rare admission of a misstep by the White House, came hours after press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there was nothing offensive about the post. After calls for its removal for being racist — including by Republicans — the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down.

An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response.

“Serving the people of Nevada has been the honor of my lifetime,” he said in a statement. “Nobody is prouder of our Nevada Congressional District than me. Thank you for the honor. Every achievement worth doing began with listening to Nevadans and fighting for our values.”

Amodei has served as a member of Congress for Nevada's 2nd Congressional District since 2011. He serves on the House Appropriations Committee and chairs the Homeland Security Subcommittee.

Amodei, from Nevada's capital of Carson City, served for years as Nevada's only Republican in Congress in a historically red district. He worked with Nevada's Democratic delegation to fight plans to move a mail center from Reno to Sacramento, to extricate people from Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, and he led legislation to reauthorize the restoration of Lake Tahoe.

“I came to Congress to solve problems and to make sure our State and Nation have (a) strong voice in the federal policy and oversight processes,” he said Friday in a statement. “I look forward to finishing my term. After 15 years of service, I believe it is the right time for Nevada and myself to pass the torch.”

Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee are sending a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi as they press the Trump administration for answers on how personal information of victims was included in the release of over 3 million government files on Jeffrey Epstein.

“The scale and severity of the exposure of survivor information are simply staggering,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter led by Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel.

The letter Friday, which asks Bondi to answer how the Justice Department is responding to the release of victim information, is the latest move by Democrats to call attention to the issue. 

A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” Leavitt said by text, referring to Disney's 1994 feature film, which does not feature the range of jungle primates featured in the video the president posted. 

“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

Nearly all of the 62-second clip, which was among dozens of Truth Social posts from Trump overnight, appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied.

At the 60-second mark is a quick scene of two primates, with the Obamas' smiling faces imposed on them.

Those frames were taken from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker. It shows Trump as “King of the Jungle” and depicts a range of Democratic leaders as animals, including Joe Biden, who is white, as a jungle primate eating a banana.

Shortly after Friday's talks broke, the Treasury and State Department in Washington announced a new round of sanctions on Iran targeting its energy sector. 

The departments imposed penalties, including freezes on assets in U.S. jurisdictions, on 14 so-called “shadow fleet” of oil tankers that the U.S. says are used to try to evade sanctions as well as 15 trading firms and two business executives.

“Time and time again, the Iranian government has prioritized its destabilizing behavior over the safety and security of its own citizens, as demonstrated by the regime's mass murder of peaceful protestors,” the State Department said in a statement. “The United States will continue to act against the network of shippers and traders involved in the transport and acquisition of Iranian crude oil, petroleum products, and petrochemical products, which constitutes the regime's primary source of income.”

President Donald Trump's social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticized the video as racist.

The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. The deletion, a rare admission of a misstep by the White House, came hours after press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed “fake outrage” over the post. After calls for its removal for being racist -- including by Republicans -- the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down.

The post was part of a flurry of social media activity on Trump's Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and a Trump attorney general from his first term finding no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome.

An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response.

The Trump administration is asking a federal judge to allow it to end temporary legal protections for roughly 350,000 Haitians in the U.S. while it appeals her ruling blocking the termination.

In a court filing on Thursday, the Department of Justice asked U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes to pause her decision. 

Reyes ruled Monday that a lawsuit challenging the termination was likely to prevail on its merits.

The Trump administration wants Reyes to issue a decision by Monday. 

Attorneys for the plaintiffs objected to that timeline in a court filing, arguing there was no emergency that requires the sudden termination of Haiti's Temporary Protected Status.

“Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. 

“The President should remove it,” said Scott, a Black Republican who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media.

Bondi says Gabbard presence in Fulton County doesn't taint search

Bondi said “absolutely not” when asked if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at last week's FBI search of the election office in Georgia tainted the search.

The office has been central to right-wing conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss. 

It came a week after Trump predicted prosecutions over a contest he has baselessly insisted was tainted by widespread fraud.

Bondi stressed on Friday that the search was helmed by FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey.

Gabbard has said that she present at the search because Trump wanted her there. Trump this week said Gabbard had gone to Georgia “at Pam's insistence,” referencing the attorney general.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday that federal authorities are assisting Arizona officials investigating the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's mother.

Bondi spoke during an unrelated news conference in Washington when she was asked about the investigation involving 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of the “Today” show host.

“It breaks my heart for Savannah and for her family,” Bondi said.

Bondi called for prayers for the family and said she's known Savannah Guthrie for more than 30 years.

She declined to say more about what federal officials are doing to assist.

A “key participant” in the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans is in custody, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Friday.

The 2012 attacks on the U.S. compound killed Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

The attack emerged as a divisive political issue.

Republicans challenged President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on security at the facility, the military response to the violence and the Democratic administration's changing narrative about who was responsible and why.

Officials said that Zubayr Al-Bakoush was brought to an airfield in Virginia early Friday.

“We have never stopped seeking justice for that crime against our nation,” Bondi said.

—

Corrective: This story has been corrected to show that the suspect arrived at an airfield in Virginia, not Joint Base Andrews in Maryland as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced.

The military strength of the US was showcased during talks with Iranians. 



U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, also attended the meeting — something that did not happen in previous rounds.

It likely served as a signal to Tehran that Washington may still strike Iran if negotiations fail.

With the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships in the region, along with more fighter jets, the U.S. now likely has the military firepower to launch an attack if it wanted.

Iran's top diplomat said that indirect talks with the United States held in Oman on Friday were “a very good start” but negotiators now must speak with their leaders.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the comment in a live interview from Muscat, Oman, on Iranian state television. 

Araghchi described the talks as taking place over multiple rounds and that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations.

Oman has mediated indirect talks between Iran and the United States over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the nations after Washington bombed Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.

Oman issued a public statement acknowledging the talks after Associated Press journalists watched Iranian and American officials separately visit a palace on the outskirts of Muscat to speak to the sultanate's foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi.

It wasn't immediately clear Friday if that was the end of the talks for the day.

The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel's attacks devastated Iran's air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well.

Ice dance duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates rock-and-rolled their way to a world-best 91.06 points in the rhythm dance to open the team competition at the Milan Cortina Olympics, where the American figure skaters are the reigning champions.

Cheered on by a crowd that included Vice President J.D. Vance, his family and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chock and Bates were able to secure their team the maximum 10 points for their Lenny Kravitz-inspired dance while making a big early statement.

The three-time world champions, Chock and Bates are the favorites to win individual Olympic gold later in the Winter Games.

Trump claims his tariffs have revived the U.S. economy. However, the U.S. economy was already growing before his second term. 

During the first three quarters of the year, Trump's tariffs — or the threat of them — delivered mixed results. 

Inflation figures are skewed by data disruptions, and tariffs have actually increased core goods prices. 

Trump also claims foreign producers bear most tariff costs, but studies show U.S. consumers and firms are affected.

OSLO, Norway (AP) — Norway's crown princess apologized on Friday for the situation she has put the royal family in as she faces scrutiny over her contacts with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, part of a broader apology for all those she has “disappointed.”

Crown Princess Mette-Marit's communications and contacts with Epstein have put her in the spotlight over the past week, adding to the embarrassment to the royals just as her son went on trial in Oslo for multiple offenses, including charges of rape.

The Epstein files contained several hundred mentions of the crown princess, who said in 2019 that she regretted having had contact with Epstein, Norwegian media reported. 

The documents, which include email exchanges, showed that Mette-Marit borrowed an Epstein-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in 2013. Broadcaster NRK reported that the stay was arranged through a mutual friend, which was later confirmed by the royal household.

The royal palace said Friday that Mette-Marit wants to talk about what happened and explain herself in more detail, but is unable to at present. It added that she is in a very difficult situation and “hopes for understanding that she needs time to gather her thoughts.”

It also issued a statement from the crown princess — her second in a week — in which she reiterated her deep regret for her past friendship with Epstein. 




“It is important for me to apologize to all of you whom I have disappointed,” she said. “Some of the content of the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be. I also apologize for the situation I have put the Royal Family in, especially the King and Queen.”

King Harald, 88, and the royals are generally popular in Norway, but the case against Mette-Marit's son, Marius Borg Høiby, has been a problem for the family's image since 2024 and the latest Epstein files have compounded that. Mette-Marit is married to Crown Prince Haakon, the heir to the throne.

The release of documents included an email from Mette-Marit to Epstein in November 2012 asking: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my I5-year-old son's wallpaper?” 

He replied, “Let them decide,” and advised that the mother should, “Stay out of it.”

Mette-Marit, 52, said in a statement issued shortly after the files were released that she “must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein's background more thoroughly, and for not realizing sooner what kind of person he was.” She added: “I showed poor judgment and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.”

The crown princess isn't the only high-profile Norwegian who faces unflattering attention stemming from the documents on millionaire financier and sex offender Epstein released by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

The Norwegian Economic Crime Investigation Service, a mixed unit of police and prosecutors, said Thursday that it would look into whether gifts, travel or loans were received by former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland in connection with his positions. 

Jagland was Norway's prime minister between 1996 and 1997. He also has chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee and was secretary general of the Council of Europe.

The files revealed years of contact between the politician and Epstein. Emails indicate that he made plans to visit Epstein's island with his family in 2014, when he was chairman of the Nobel committee, with an Epstein assistant organizing the flights.

Norwegian authorities are also looking to lift Jagland's immunity, which he enjoys because of his past as a diplomat. His legal representative told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that Jagland is cooperating with the investigation.

The World Economic Forum also announced on Thursday that it was opening an internal review into its CEO Børge Brende to determine his relationship with Epstein, after the files indicated the two had dined together several times and exchanged messages. Brende was Norway's foreign minister from 2013-2017. 

He told NRK that he is cooperating with the investigation, that he only met Epstein in business settings and that he had been unaware of Epstein's criminal background.

Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually abused underage girls at his homes in the U.S.

Can money buy happiness?

Elon Musk revived the age-old question this week with a bleak take of his own.

""Whoever said 'money can't buy happiness' really knew what they were talking about,"" the billionaire CEO wrote on X on Thursday with a sad-face emoji.

The post quickly went viral, racking up more than 92.8 million views and sparking reactions about whether wealth actually improves life.

Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban pushed back against it, offering a blunt counterpoint: Money doesn't change who you are — it just amplifies it.

""If you were happy when you were poor, you will be insanely happy if you get rich,"" Cuban wrote in a reply to Musk's post later on Thursday. ""If you were miserable, you will stay miserable, just with a lot less financial stress.""

Cuban's point cuts against the idea that wealth itself is a cure-all for dissatisfaction — and he's speaking from experience, ranking 372nd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated net worth of $9.62 billion as of Friday.

Academic research shows there's only so much wealth can do to boost happiness.

David Bartram, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Leicester, told Business Insider's Roya Shahidi on Thursday that while wealth and happiness are linked, the relationship comes with sharply diminishing returns.

""Once you've got a few million, anything extra is meaningless for happiness,"" Bartram said.

For the ultrawealthy, he added, happiness is more likely to come from a sense of purpose — ""having a sense that you've done some good in the world, and that you've treated people around you with care and kindness.""

Other research suggests the income-happiness link may stretch further than previously thought, though not without caveats.

A 2021 study by Matthew Killingsworth, a senior fellow at the Wharton School, found that happiness and well-being continued to rise alongside income.

But in a follow-up paper published in 2024, Killingsworth concluded that the amount of money needed to feel happier becomes an ever-moving target.

His data did not directly examine millionaires or billionaires, though Killingsworth said it was ""plausible"" the trend could extend to the world's wealthiest.

Musk himself has made similar arguments in the past. In a November appearance on Nikhil Kamath's ""People by WTF"" podcast, he said the pursuit of money alone was unlikely to bring fulfillment.

""Aim to make more than you take. Be a net contributor to society,"" Musk said, adding that wealth tends to follow naturally when people focus on building useful products and services — rather than chasing money for its own sake.

In this article

DETROIT — The unraveling of the U.S. electric vehicle push is increasingly raising concerns of an existential crisis for the American auto industry, as Chinese carmakers surge ahead in the technologies that many still believe will define the next era of cars.

The latest warning sign came Friday, when Stellantis disclosed a $26 billion charge from a major business overhaul, including a pullback in EVs, triggering a more than 20% plunge in its stock. CEO Antonio Filosa blamed the hit on overestimating the pace of the energy transition.

It follows other automakers in the U.S. significantly pulling back from pure EVs in favor of large gas-guzzling trucks such as the Ford F-150 and SUVs like the Chevrolet Suburban. Chinese automakers are taking the opposite approach and are growing globally, led by EVs.

Legacy automakers General Motors and Ford Motor have lost billions of dollars on EVs and are pulling back partly because of the loss of a federal tax credit and lackluster consumer demand.

Even Tesla, which pioneered the EV industry, is facing pressure. It was surpassed by Chinese automaker BYD in EV sales as the Elon Musk-led brand lost its appeal and market share in Europe this year, while BYD ramped up exports there and around the world. Tesla also last week canceled its two oldest, lowest-selling electric vehicles to repurpose an American plant for humanoid robots.

After helming the electrification movement for years, Musk increasingly appears focused elsewhere, especially on robots, driverless taxis and his artificial intelligence company, which he combined with Space X in what was the biggest merger in history.

Meanwhile, global market share for Chinese brands has jumped nearly 70% in five years, and many experts see a threat to U.S. automakers, including the anticipated entrance of Chinese brands into America. 

There's fear among global automakers that Chinese rivals like BYD and Geely could flood global markets, undercutting domestic production and vehicle prices. The U.S. has taken a protectionist approach by implementing 100% tariffs on imported EVs from China, but Chinese automakers have made inroads across Europe, South America and elsewhere.

Companies in the U.S., where the automotive industry represents about 5% of the country's gross domestic product, are worried about long-term implications.

""The Chinese auto industry presents an existential threat to the traditional [automakers],"" said Terry Woychowski, a former GM executive who serves as president of automotive at engineering consulting firm Caresoft Global.

Several automotive experts used the word ""existential"" when discussing the growth of Chinese automakers.

""The existential risk to the U.S. auto industry isn't Chinese EVs alone, it's the combination of sustained government support, vertically integrated supply chains and speed,"" said Elizabeth Krear, CEO of the Center for Automotive Research. ""Those advantages lower costs and accelerate execution. Concurrently, saturation in China's domestic market is driving automakers to expand aggressively into global markets.""

The Chinese automotive sector has rapidly changed from an insular industry to the largest exporter of vehicles globally since 2023.

China's growth has been fueled by government funding for companies as well as a culture of innovation and speed the country has instilled in its workers, experts said. A slowing Chinese market and plant underutilization have also forced companies to begin exporting to major auto markets globally.

China's expansion of EVs has been particularly impressive, with a nearly 800% increase globally, largely fueled by sales in China growing from roughly 572,300 in 2020 to 4.95 million in 2025, according to GlobalData. Outside of China, EV sales have surged by more than 1,300%, from less than 33,000 to more than 474,000, according to the firm.

While China has grown, Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers — GM, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis, which is no longer based in the U.S. — have collectively fallen from a global market share of 21.4% in 2019 to an estimated 15.7% in 2025, according to S&P Global Mobility.

That compares with China's largest automakers BYD and Geely, which have grown from a less than 3% market share to an estimated 11.1%, according to S&P Global Mobility. 

China's most recent announced expansion is to Canada, a relatively small vehicle market that removed 100% tariffs on imported vehicles from China amid a trade dispute with the Trump administration.

That follows the rapid growth of Chinese automakers in lower-income, less established regions that have historically been growth markets for U.S. automakers, such as South America, India and Mexico. They're also making inroads in Europe, where the share of sales has risen from virtually nothing in 2020 to nearly 10% in December, according to Germany-based Dataforce.

""The shift to electric has made it easier for them, because they've got the right products,"" said Al Bedwell, U.K.-based expert and director of global automotive powertrain for GlobalData. ""The fact that it is electric has really opened the doors, and it wouldn't have happened otherwise.""

Bedwell said China wanted to wean itself off oil since it doesn't have vast amounts on its own. ""It saw an opportunity to be a leader,"" he added.

GlobalData forecasts Chinese EVs will continue to grow globally to roughly 6.5 million units by 2030, followed by nearly 8.5 million in 2035. That includes continued expansion in the U.S., where a few China-made vehicles such as the Buick Envision have been imported in recent years.

""Breaking into the U.S. market successfully and sustainably is not an easy accomplishment; it takes time, investment, patience and the willingness to make product mistakes but improve them until you get it right. It is expected that some Chinese automakers will have that blend and eventually look to participate in the U.S. market,"" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility.

Brinley noted it took Japan's Toyota Motor from 1957 to 2001 to reach a 10% market share, while South Korea's Hyundai Motor reached 10% after 26 years in 2022.

""Because the U.S. is a mature market and sales are forecast to remain between 16 million and 16.5 million units through at least 2035, newcomers will take share from existing brands and automakers,"" Brinley said. ""How quickly they connect with consumers and which automakers lose volume or share to the new competitor remains to be seen.""

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group representing nearly every automaker in the U.S., wants to prevent that from happening. It called on Congress and the Trump administration in December to prevent Chinese government-backed auto and advanced battery manufacturers from gaining entry to produce in the U.S.

""Automakers doing business inside the United States face geopolitical and market pressures from China that are a direct threat to America's global competitiveness and national security,"" John Bozzella, CEO of the alliance, said in a message to a U.S. House of Representatives select committee, citing unfair, anticompetitive trade practices and intellectual property theft.

U.S. automakers spent billions of dollars developing and launching EVs under regulations and incentives from the Biden administration that have largely been undone by the Trump administration.

That deregulation opened the doors for automakers to de-emphasize all-electric vehicle plans.

GM and Ford alone have announced more than $27 billion in write-downs recently due to their retreat on EVs, including canceling new models and lowering production of current ones.

Jeep maker Stellantis on Friday announced a 22 billion euro ($26 billion) hit from a business turnaround plan that includes pulling back on electrification and reintroducing V8 engines to U.S. models.  

U.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.2% during the fourth quarter.

GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Wednesday that the Detroit automaker, which has largely become a regional player in North America, isn't abandoning EVs but is right-sizing to natural demand instead of attempting to appease regulators.

When asked about the expansion of Chinese automakers, Jacobson said GM ""can hold our own"" but that it needs to be on a level playing field — rehashing that he thinks U.S. tariffs should work to offset subsidies Chinese companies get from Beijing.

""You can see the type of intensity and competitiveness that those vehicles bring to the marketplace. And therefore, we've got to be ready,"" he said during a Chicago Federal Reserve automotive conference in Detroit. 

GM wasn't ready for the rise of the domestic auto industry in China, which was the company's top sales market from 2010 to 2023. The automaker's earnings from China fell from around $2 billion annually in 2018 to a second consecutive year of losses in 2025 as China grew its own auto manufacturing.

GM's crosstown rival Ford is taking a different approach. It has largely scrapped plans for large EVs in exchange for a next generation of smaller models that CEO Jim Farley believes will be the company's saving grace against Chinese automakers.

Farley, who has been complimentary of Chinese automakers at times, said the new platform will be a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles.

""This is a Model T moment for the company,"" Farley said last year. ""We really see, not the global [automakers] as a competitive set for our next generation of EVs, we see the Chinese. Companies like Geely and BYD … and that's how we built our vehicle.""

Domestic EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Saudi-backed Lucid Group — both exclusively producing vehicles in the U.S. — are facing profitability and sales challenges.

Amid the demand issues, the EV startups have tried to appeal to investors by touting themselves as technology plays rather than automakers, following in the footsteps of U.S. EV industry leader Tesla. 

Tesla's Musk has been warning about Chinese automakers for years, saying in 2023 after the rise of BYD that such companies will ""demolish"" global rivals without trade barriers.

Musk has historically positioned Tesla as a technology company that also sells cars despite that the vast majority of its revenue comes from car sales, leasing and repairs. He took it a step further on the company's most recent quarterly earnings call, saying that Tesla is ending production of its Model S and X vehicles and will use the factory in Fremont, California, to instead build Optimus humanoid robots. 

After the original Roadster, the two models are Tesla's oldest vehicles. The EV maker started selling the Model S sedan in 2012, and the Model X SUV three years later. They only represented about 3% of Tesla's sales in 2025, with the company continuing to offer the Model Y, Model 3 and Cybertruck.

In recent, years the company has slashed prices for those vehicles as global competition for electric vehicles has soared. 

Musk believes China will once again be the company's main competition in its newest humanoid robot venture.

""China will definitely be the tough competition as there's no two ways about it,"" Musk said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""So I always think people outside of China kind of underestimate China. China's an ass-kicker, next level.""

Amid the hunt for ""Today"" cohost Savannah Guthrie's mom Nancy Guthrie, TMZ and an Arizona CBS News affiliate report receiving demands for millions in Bitcoin for her release.

TMZ said its note demanded millions of Bitcoin cryptocurrency and provided a specific Bitcoin address. The outlet reported that it has verified the validity of the address.

While investigators continue to evaluate the validity of the notes, some Americans may wonder if the Bitcoin address would be enough to find the culprit or at least narrow the search for the kidnapper.

It's not that simple. Here's what to know about Bitcoin.

Once someone establishes a Bitcoin wallet with a private key that makes the wallet unique to that user, a first Bitcoin address will be generated where you can receive or send Bitcoin. People can create more addresses.

It works much like an email address someone might use to correspond with others, except that each Bitcoin address should only be used once. For enhanced privacy, each transaction should use its own Bitcoin address, according to Bitcoin.org, an open-source, community-driven website that provides Bitcoin education.

Different addresses hide or scatter transactions, making them harder to link to one person. People can use the same address, but patterns of money going in and out of that address will be visible.

Knowing the address of transactions still doesn't reveal its owner because addresses are pseudonymous and unattached to emails, phone numbers or street addresses. More sophisticated tools would be needed to dig further.

“Criminals demand ransom payments in cryptocurrency because it is quick, efficient, and they can easily verify if and when payments are made,” wrote Angelena Bradfield and Stephanie Wake at bank advocacy group BPI in 2021.

According to Bitcoin.org, here are some features criminals may like in Bitcoin:

Finding the owner of a Bitcoin address is nearly impossible, said Ken Gray, professor in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of New Haven and former FBI agent.

“Crypto's not trackable,” Gray said. “It's outside the banking system. You can't find the owner. That's why it's the currency of choice for criminals.”

Money transferred by PayPal or Venmo could be traced, and ""no one wants to carry a big suitcase of cash,"" Gray said. ""Crypto is the modern way of transporting large amounts of money"" quietly.

There are many stories of investigators recovering billions of dollars in cryptocurrency. But Gray said those cases usually begin by tracing a person through something physical, like an email or call, that leads them to the cryptocurrency.

In Guthrie's case, the investigation might begin with the ransom notes the media outlets received, he said. Investigators could try to trace the emails. If the criminal's a professional, the person may have used an anonymous email that passes through several networks to get to the recipient. That may make it more difficult to trace, but the FBI can sometimes exploit vulnerabilities.

As for the crypto itself: ""It's not leading to the person who's requesting it,” Gray said.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin juggernaut Strategy, Ethereum giant BitMine Immersion Technologies, and crypto exchange Coinbase all looked much more verdant Friday as the price of BTC stabilized after dropping 14% on Thursday.

Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, had gained 22% since the opening bell and was recently changing hands for $131. The company holds 713,502 BTC in its treasury, which was acquired for an average price of $76,047. But after BTC took a plunge yesterday, the Virginia software company is now underwater on its BTC stash.

Bitcoin was recently trading for $69,500 after stabilizing since yesterday's dive. It has gained nearly 6% in the past day, but is still 16% lower than it was this time last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. The price of Bitcoin fell as low as $60,225 on Thursday, CoinGecko data shows.

MSTR reported a $12.4 billion Q4 loss during its earnings call late Thursday afternoon. “Strategy has built a digital fortress anchored by 713,502 Bitcoin, and our shift to digital credit, which aligns with our indefinite Bitcoin horizon,"" Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a statement to shareholders.

But at least two analysts have tempered their optimism for the firm. Canacord Genuity analyst Joseph Vafi cut his price forecast for MSTR by 60%, from $474 to $185; BTIG analyst Andrew Harte made a similar price forecast cut, from $630 to $250. Both analysts maintained their buy ratings, though, saying that there's still significant upside for investors.

Meanwhile, Tom Lee's BitMine—the only Ethereum treasury to have added more ETH to its coffers in January—has seen its share price jump 15% to about $20 since the New York open. The company commands a treasury of 4,285,125 ETH that's worth about $8.7 billion at current prices. At the time of writing, BMNR was sitting on a $7.5 billion unrealized loss.

Tom Lee's BitMine Hits 7-Month Stock Low as Ethereum Paper Losses Reach $8 Billion

But Ethreum treasuries work a little differently than their Bitcoin counterparts. BMNR has staked $6.7 billion worth of its ETH. Lee said last week that when the company has fully staked its ETH through MAVAN and its staking partners, it will be earning more than $1 million per day in rewards via the Ethereum network.

Coinbase has also staged a comeback, seeing its price rise 10% to $161 at the time of writing.

Coinbase, which trades under the COIN ticker on the Nasdaq, tends to stabilize quickly during turbulent markets. That's because volatility that leads to high trading volumes bolsters the bottom line for Coinbase, Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said previously.

""The increase in volatility had a meaningful impact on our transaction revenue,"" she said in February 2024, right after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading in the U.S. ""We saw strong growth and reengagement from both simple and advanced traders. Notable average trading volumes materially increased among our advanced traders.""

Other major crypto stocks surging Friday include Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings and CleanSpark, both up more than 19% to recent prices of $8.06 and $9.87 respectively, with miners Terawulf and Riot Platforms up nearly as much on the day. And institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital is up more than 17% on the day to a price of nearly $20 after seeing its shares dive earlier this week following an earnings loss.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

XRP and Solana could soar higher once the crypto market warms up again.

Many altcoins, defined as any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin (BTC +7.11%), fizzled out over the past year as high Treasury yields, unclear monetary policies, and other messy macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments.

However, investors who can stomach some near-term volatility might find a few good buying opportunities before the crypto market warms up again. Two of those promising altcoins are XRP (XRP +18.36%) and Solana (SOL +4.78%). Let's see why these two smaller tokens could still be worth nibbling on in this choppy market.

Image source: Getty Images.



XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, was created by the founders of Ripple Labs, a fintech company that specializes in blockchain-based money transfers. Its creators minted the entire supply of 100 billion tokens before launch, and it's primarily used as a ""bridge currency"" to accelerate transactions across Ripple's network.

In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple for selling its own XRP holdings to raise capital and argued that XRP was an unlicensed security. That lawsuit caused Ripple to lose several of its top customers, and the top crypto exchanges delisted XRP.

But last year, that lawsuit finally concluded with a lighter-than-expected fine for Ripple and a ruling that XRP wasn't a security when it was sold to retail investors. The crypto exchanges subsequently relisted XRP, and the SEC approved its first spot price ETFs in late 2025. Ripple also expanded by applying for a U.S. banking license and launching its own stablecoin. That expansion could support the increased usage of XRP as a bridge currency.

XRP can't be valued by its scarcity in the same way as Bitcoin, and its blockchain doesn't natively support the development of decentralized apps like Ethereum. However, it recently added Ethereum-compatible ""sidechains"" to drive more developers to integrate XRP into their applications. That expansion -- along with the growing usage of Ripple as a faster, cheaper, and more flexible alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers -- could drive XRP's price higher.

Solana was built on the same energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism as Ethereum. However, it upgraded its blockchain with its own proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism, which timestamps transactions before they're validated. That tweak enables Solana to process Layer 1 (L1) transactions at much higher speeds than Ethereum and other PoS blockchains.

Solana suffered a significant setback when FTX collapsed in 2022. The crypto exchange held nearly $1.2 billion in Solana tokens and liquidated them to cover its debt. That liquidation, along with rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023, erased all of its massive gains from 2021.

Yet Solana continues to attract thousands of developers. To support that growth, it expanded its ecosystem with its digital payments platform, Solana Pay, added support for stablecoin transactions, and even launched its own blockchain-powered Android smartphone.

The SEC also approved Solana's first spot price ETFs in late 2025. Unlike Ethereum's first batch of spot price ETFs, which didn't include staking (to earn interest-like yields on locked-up tokens), most of Solana's new ETFs launched with staking. Those new ETFs could make Solana a more attractive investment for institutional investors.

Solana still faces some near-term challenges. Its L1 blockchain often struggles with network congestion, outages, and security issues. Its main developer languages (Rust and C) have steeper learning curves than Ethereum's Solidity, and other PoS blockchains are catching up to Solana with faster Layer 2 (L2) solutions that bundle transactions and process them off-chain. But if Solana overcomes those challenges, its price could stabilize and soar higher as it continues to pull more developers away from Ethereum and other PoS blockchains.

We have fined MediaLab.AI, Inc. (MediaLab), owner of image sharing and hosting platform Imgur, £247,590 for failing to use children's personal information lawfully. 

The penalty follows an investigation that found MediaLab allowed children to use Imgur without putting in place the basic safeguards required under UK data protection law.   

We concluded MediaLab breached the law by: 

Personal information often drives the content children see online. MediaLab had no way of knowing the age of Imgur users, meaning that children were at risk of being exposed to harmful content on the platform, including content related to eating disorders, homophobia, antisemitism and images of a sexual or violent nature.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:

“MediaLab failed in its legal duties to protect children, putting them at unnecessary risk. For years, it allowed children to use Imgur without any effective age checks, while collecting and processing their data, which in turn exposed them to harmful and inappropriate content.   

“Age checks help organisations keep children's personal information safe and not used in ways that may harm them, such as by recommending age-inappropriate content.

“This fine is part of our wider work to drive improvements in how digital platforms use children's personal data. Ignoring the fact that children use these services, while processing their data unlawfully, is not acceptable. Companies that choose to ignore this can expect to face similar enforcement action.” 

Investigation findings and enforcement action

Our investigation found that between September 2021 and September 2025, MediaLab processed the personal information of children using Imgur in ways that breached the UK GDPR.

UK law says that online services using the personal information of children under 13 can only rely on the lawful basis of consent if consent is given by the child's parent or carer.

Imgur's terms stated that children under 13 could only use the platform with parental supervision. However, MediaLab did not implement any form of age assurance measures to determine the age of Imgur users and did not have measures in place to obtain parental consent where children under 13 used the platform.

Under the law, we can issue fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of an organisation's annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.

In setting the £247,590 penalty amount, we took into consideration the number of children affected by this breach, the degree of potential harm caused, the duration of the contraventions, and the company's global turnover. We also considered MediaLab's acceptance of our provisional findings set out in the Notice of Intent issued in September 2025 and its commitment to address the infringements if access to the Imgur platform in the UK is restored in the future. If MediaLab resumes processing the personal data of children in the UK without implementing the measures it has committed to, we may take further regulatory action.

We are considering the redaction of personal and commercially confidential or sensitive information ahead of publishing the monetary penalty notice.

Our role and remit in protecting children online

We are the UK's independent regulator for data protection, and safeguarding children's privacy online is a priority.

UK data protection law says children should be given special treatment when it comes to their personal information. Our Children's code (also known as the Age Appropriate Design Code) translates the legal requirements into design standards for online services likely to be accessed by under-18s, helping organisations understand what is expected of them. That includes putting children's best interests at the forefront and giving them a high level of privacy by default.

In December 2025, we reported strong progress on its Children's code strategy, including a proactive supervision programme to drive improvements in how social media and video sharing platforms handle children's data.

Age assurance advice for online services

Age assurance tools act as a guardrail to prevent children from accessing online services they shouldn't be using or to help platforms tailor their online experience accordingly.

These tools can form part of a proportionate approach to reducing the data risks children face online and supporting conformance with the Children's code.

To support them in tailoring an age-appropriate experience, organisations should match the age assurance method they use to the level of risk on their platform. Organisations can either apply the full protections of the Children's code to all users or use proportionate age assurance tools to tailor safeguards by age.

Where children under a certain age are not allowed to use a service, organisations must focus on preventing access and enforce their minimum age requirements using robust age assurance methods.

Further guidance is available in our age assurance opinion.

Notes to editors

The next phase of the Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) implementation commenced yesterday, 5 February 2026. This means that most of the remaining data protection provisions of the Act have come into force, except for the requirement for organisations to have a complaints procedure which is due to commence on 19 June 2026 and some ICO governance provisions which will follow at a later date. 

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has opened formal investigations into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) and X.AI LLC (X.AI) covering their processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.  

We have reprimanded Staines Health Group for sending excessive medical details about a terminally ill patient to their insurance company. 

In January 2025, we responded to the government's call for proposals to boost the UK's economy and foster economic growth.

We have fined two companies a total of £225,000 for sending millions of unsolicited marketing messages in breach of the law. 

We have updated and enhanced our guidance on international transfers of personal information, making it quicker for businesses to understand and comply with the transfer rules under UK GDPR. 

Our new report released today shows how the rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the way we live our lives, with personal shopping ‘AI-gents' potentially arriving within the next five years.

The ICO and His Majesty's Government have today (8 January) signed an important Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which sets out government's commitment to raise data protection standards.

Even for an asset class known for its volatility, bitcoin and its cryptocurrency brethren are having a rough week.

Bitcoin's value is down around 28% in the previous four months and has lost over 17% in just the last seven days, according to tracking by Coinbase. In one 24-hour period earlier this week, the digital currency's price declined by over $10,000, slipping to around $60,000 per token before recovering slightly. As of mid-morning Friday, bitcoin was trading at just over $69,000 per token.

Cryptocurrency advocates have long hoped that digital tokens would earn a reputation as an investment safe haven, much like precious metals, where savvy investors cache assets during times of economic upheaval or uncertainty. Recent global economic conditions have helped drive the cost of gold and other metals into record territory amid widespread fiscal worries.

In a Wednesday note to investors, Deutsche Bank said the latest drop was “triggered by” Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh, as the new chair of the Federal Reserve, per a report from BBC News. Some industry watchers believe Warsh will take a more “hawkish” approach on monetary policy, keeping interest rates higher, whereas looser monetary policy tends to support investment in assets such as cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin prices have been trending down for the last four months, Deutsche noted, and there has been growing negative sentiment around cryptocurrency more broadly.

“This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.

Cryptocurrency values have been mostly on the rise since President Donald Trump began his second term thanks to his advocacy for the digital assets. But he hasn't always been a fan.

In the run-up to the 2024 election, Trump reversed his former stance as a critic of the digital currency market, which he described in one instance as a “scam” during his first term. He later pivoted to being a crypto proponent and made repeated campaign pledges to create a friendly space for the sector.

And since the start of his second term, he's worked to follow through on those promises with both staffing decisions and administrative changes that have relaxed regulatory oversight. And while crypto values have shown their trademark volatility over the past 12 months, many tokens have also achieved their highest valuations ever over the same period including bitcoin which hit an all-time high of over $126,000 per token last October.

On Friday, cryptocurrency analyst Mark Thielen from 10X Research told CNBC that bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon.

“I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,” Thielen said. “But I think during the summer we make another low.”

If the world of cryptocurrencies is still seeming rather, er, cryptic, here's a handy breakdown from Investopedia:

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.

Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology — a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.

A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

London (AFP) –                     Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, sank this week, wiping out gains sparked by Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November 2024.                 

Issued on: 06/02/2026 - 16:23Modified: 06/02/2026 - 16:21

The digital currency slumped to $60,033.01 on Friday before trimming losses, and is down around half from its October peak above $120,000. 

AFP explains why prices have fallen.

Digital currencies soared after Trump's election victory as he was widely viewed as a strong supporter of the technology. 

He publicly celebrated bitcoin crossing $100,000 for the first time in December 2024.

But the rally suffered a sharp setback in April after Trump announced sweeping US tariffs, rattling markets worldwide. 

Bitcoin later resumed its march higher along with stocks and other markets, and hit a record of $126,251.31 six months later.

But enthusiasm has faded as investors grow impatient over regulatory uncertainty.

While the US Congress passed a law in July to regulate stablecoins -- a form of cryptocurrency backed by traditional assets -- a broader crypto bill, the Clarity Act, has stalled in the Senate.

""A key test for Bitcoin's ability to sustainably recover will be the passage of the Clarity Act,"" said Deutsche Bank analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon. 

The recent slide in precious metals like gold and silver -- as investors locked in profits after their meteoric rise -- was one of the main triggers for bitcoin's slump.

That pullback sent many investors rushing to sell cryptocurrencies and other risky assets to help raise cash.

""This break is not happening in a vacuum, but in a context of widespread mistrust,"" said John Plassard, head of investment strategy at Cite Gestion Private Bank.

""Volatility in technology and precious metals is fuelling a global movement to reduce risk.""

The sell-off has been intensified by forced deleveraging, as investors who borrowed money to bet on bitcoin's rise are forced to sell when losses mount, pushing prices lower.

Cryptocurrency declines gathered pace this week as investors sold tech stocks on renewed concerns over an artificial intelligence bubble.

Analysts noted that bitcoin and AI-related stocks often move in the same direction. 

""In recent years, liquidity has flowed across digital assets and advanced tech stocks at the same time,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group XTB.

""This means that both asset classes share a tight financial link.""

Michael Burry, the entrepreneur who gained fame for spotting the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, fanned fears on Monday as he flagged a possible ""death spiral"" for bitcoin.

The downturn has raised questions about the viability of digital asset treasury firms, which stockpile cryptocurrencies in a bet that prices will keep rising. 

Many of these firms are ""sitting on significant unrealised losses,"" said Charlie Sherry, head of finance at BTC Markets.

If these firms are forced to sell their bitcoin holdings to stay afloat, it could flood the market and amplify a downward spiral in prices.

Shares in Strategy, which holds more than 713,000 bitcoins, plunged more than 17 percent on Friday after it reported a $12.4 billion net loss linked to crypto declines.

And US cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced Thursday that it would slash roughly a quarter of its workforce and withdraw from several international markets amid the downturn in digital assets.

Crypto markets are adding to overnight gains in U.S. morning trade on Friday, with bitcoin BTC$65,998.81 climbing above $68,000, up nearly 17% since hitting $60,000 late yesterday.

Bitcoin is now higher by 2.5% over the past 24 hours. Ether ETH$1,926.58 is up 2.2% and solana SOL$86.39 2%. Outperforming is XRP XRP$1.4620, which has climbed to $1.50, now higher by 17% over the last day.

Crypto-related stocks are seeing major upside moves Friday after plunging in the previous session.

Strategy (MSTR) — which reported a $14.2 billion fourth-quarter loss late Thursdy — is higher by 14%, though at $122, still lower by 22% year-to-date. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is up 15% and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) is up 12%.

Underperforming on Friday is bitcoin miner-turned AI infrastructure provider IREN (IREN), down 1.8% after disappointing earnings results Thursday night.

Those looking for bottom signals are pointing to last night's Strategy earnings call in which Michael Saylor pledged a commitment to leading a Bitcoin security program that will address the quantum threat.

Some in crypto have argued that bitcoin's security model faces a serious threat from quantum computing — a threat so imminent that many investors are either selling or refusing to allocate to bitcoin at all.

""Saylor's announcement tells me prices have finally gotten the Bitcoin community to acknowledge and address quantum risk,"" wrote Quinn Thompson.

Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, noted that bitcoin is now back at price levels last seen 14 months ago with key momentum indicator RSI flashing deeply oversold conditions. He added that trading volumes in BTC and ETH have surged to their highest in over two years. That technical setup that often invites at least a short-term bounce.

""It would be odd if we did not see at least some short term reversion here,"" he said.

Bitcoin BTC$65,998.81 suffered a flash crash to $55,000 on South Korean exchange Bithumb this week after what appears to have been a major internal accounting error.

Bithumb mistakenly credited users with 2,000 BTC each instead of a small reward worth 2,000 Korean won (about $1.50), according to a blog post on Friday. 

The result was tens of millions of dollars' worth of phantom bitcoin appearing in hundreds of user accounts. No bitcoin was moved onchain, and inflated balances existed only in Bithumb's internal ledger.

Users who suddenly saw enormous balances wasted little time trying to sell, triggering a sharp selloff on Bithumb's BTC/KRW pair, sending prices 15.8% below other exchanges. At one point, BTC traded at 81 million won ($55,000) while prices elsewhere remained relatively stable.

Bithumb said it identified the abnormal transactions through internal controls and restricted trading in the affected accounts shortly after the incident. 

The exchange said prices on its platform normalized within about five minutes and that its liquidation prevention system operated as intended, preventing any cascading forced liquidations linked to the price movement.

The company added that the incident was not related to an external hack or security breach and that customer assets remain secure.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has risen steadily, placing substantial strain on health systems, prolonging turnaround times and intensifying physician burnout. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here we utilize data from a large academic health system to develop Prima, an AI foundation model for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 29,431 MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from major neurologic disorders, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of 92.0%, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists and clinical referral recommendations. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale AI training and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.

The Prima model parameters will be publicly available for investigational use only under an MIT licence. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the University of Michigan for MRI data collection. Restrictions apply to the availability of raw patient MRI imaging data, which were used with institutional permission through IRB approval for the current study, and are thus not publicly available. All data sharing between medical centres is regulated through data use agreements with the study authors. A similar data-sharing protocol may be established for interested investigators. Please contact the corresponding author (T.H.) for any requests for data sharing, and a response will be made within 2 weeks. All requests will be evaluated based on institutional and departmental policies to determine whether the data requested is subject to intellectual property or patient privacy obligations. Data can only be shared for non-commercial academic and investigational purposes.

All code was implemented in Python (version 3.9) using PyTorch (2.3.1) and Transformers (4.37.0) as the primary machine learning framework. All code and scripts to reproduce the training and inference of Prima are available via GitHub at MLNeurosurg/Prima under an MIT licence.

a, Our health system Sectra PACS server was queried for all cranial MRIs. We then filtered these MRIs based on the availability of an associated radiology report and having a minimum of 2 series per study. We then ensured that all metadata was present, resulting in a total of 221,147 UM-220K dataset. b, Overview of the stages of training Prima on UM-220K, which includes volume tokenization, hierarchical ViT training with CLIP objective function, and transfer learning to predict radiologic diagnoses. An LLM provides radiology report summarization and diagnostic labels for reliable, accurate, and scalable vision-language modeling. c, Volume tokenization stage involves dividing each MRI volume into smaller subvolume patches of shape 32x32x4, removing background tokens, and encoding each subvolume using a VQ-VAE encoder. The latent VQ-VAE tokens are then passed forward to the sequence ViT with the concatenated positional encodings. d, The hierarchical ViT is trained using a CLIP objective on frozen volume token features. The sequence ViT is a multimodal transformer that takes as input both the volume tokens and the embedded free-text sequence description. The series registers are passed forward to the study ViT that outputs a single representation for the full MRI study. The paired reports are summarized and passed through a pre-trained neuroradiology model to align the MRI study and the paired report. e, A transfer learning strategy is used such that the volume tokenizer, sequence and study transformers are frozen, and an MLP is trained on the learned study features for radiologic and clinical task prediction.

Descriptive details of the UM-220K dataset are shown here. a, The majority of MRI data is collected from patient's with permanent residence in the state of Michigan. A geospatial map shows the counties with the top 20 imaging centers across the state. The top centers are located in populous regions and regions with higher median income based on census data (www.census.gov). The Upper Peninsula and Northern Michigan are lower resource settings, rural areas, and most susceptible to experiencing longer turnaround times (Fig. 4). b, Average turnaround time through time. We observed a steady year-to-year increase in turnaround time since 2019. This increase correlates with increasing MRI demand and imaging volumes at our health system. c, The distribution of turnaround times. The distribution shows a severe right skew, with a Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness of 5.25. The majority of turnaround time measured in patient-days is in the right tail distribution greater than 2 days. These results prompted us to target turnaround time as a metric of algorithmic fairness. d, Distribution of MRI counts through time and divided by month of year. We observed a consistent increase in the number of MRIs/year. e, Age and sex distribution of the UM-220K. f, Distribution of patients by the number of diagnoses per patient, including patients with no diagnoses. g, Distribution of diagnostic categories and (h) the granular radiology diagnoses for each category. The aims was to have a broad set of diagnostic categories that spanned the full diagnostic spectra and to include clinically meaningful and actionable diagnostic classes.

a, Example of an original MRI report with highlighting of the major findings in the MRI study. GPT-3.5-turbo is then prompted in stages to summarized the report to achieve an itemized report summary of positive findings. Additional details regarding prompting are in Supplementary-Data-Fig. 2. b, The report classification performance of GPT-4 for 5 diagnoses from the different diagnostic categories: structural, adult tumor, cystic lesions, infectious, and vascular ischemic. Prompting details of GPT-4 classification are in Supplementary-Data-Fig 3. c, tSNE visualizations of the sequence name encoding after training the sequence name encoder, Esn, using a CLIP objective. The model correctly encodes sequence names based on both imaging planes and sequence type. This effectively prompts ViTseq for better MRI sequence feature extraction. d, Comparison on Prima CLIP-score and retrieval performance between GPT-3.5-turbo summarized reports and human expert summarized reports on 100 prospective studies. We observe no statistically significant difference between the two summarizations on CLIP scores (P=0.62, paired two-sided t-test) or retrieval metrics (P > 0.80, McNemar's test), indicating that Prima, although trained on GPT-3.5-turbo summarized reports, is aligned with radiologist summarization. e, Line plot shows the average validation perplexity during training of the neuroradiology language model given different percentages of the report data. Neuroradiology language model was trained using next-word prediction and benefits from increased training data, approaching the lower perplexity bound of 1 with 100% of the MRI reports. f, tSNE plots of the CLIP encoded summarized reports versus full reports. The summarized reports show better label-conditional clustering compared to the full reports. These results demonstrate the challenge of using full reports for CLIP objective, which contain extraneous or non-informative textual details that can degrade visual representation learning. The center panels are Silhouette plots to quantify cluster quality. The red dotted line is the average Silhouette coefficient. Larger values represent better clustering results.

a, MRI scanners acquire images with specified orientations (for example LAS, RAS, etc) and planes (for example axial, coronal, sagittal). The MRI tokens will have the same orientation and plane as the source MRI sequence after patching. b, Examples of VQ-VAE reconstructions in different MRI sequences and orientations. c, Because Prima takes as input multiple different orientations and imaging planes, the volume tokenizer should be orientation invariant, meaning the representation of the same anatomic region should not change if imaged in axial versus coronal plane or LAS versus RAS orientation, for example. We used two strategies: random orientation permutations and 3D-CNN encoders. Our VQ-VAE volume tokenizer is encouraged to encode each volume token equivalently across all orientations under a reconstruction loss. Examples of MRI subvolumes are shown in different orientations after permutation. The latent volume tokens with near-equivalent latent encodings are shown in the center panel. with the reconstructions after the decoder on the right. d, Ablation study over the codebook sizes shows the quantization loss validation curves. Larger codebook sizes led to less overfitting and better reconstructions. e, Reconstruction losses with and without random orientation permutations. Random permutations regularized the VQ-VAE and resulted in higher-quality reconstructions and lower reconstruction losses. f, Examples of reconstructions before and after orientation permutations for different MRI sequences. Reconstructions are perceptually equivalent after forward pass through the VQ-VAE model regardless of orientation or imaging plane. Subtle reconstruction differences can be seen on difference maps.

a, Radar plot of prospective zero-shot performance (in AUC) comparison between Prima and open-source pre-trained VLM families across 52 tasks. The baseline performances reported for each VLM family is from the best-performing model in the family for each task. Zero-shot Prima substantially outperforms all baselines across the majority of tasks. b, Radar plot of prospective MLP-probing performance on UM-220K across 52 tasks, between Prima MRI study representations and average-pooled study representations from open-source pre-trained 2D CLIP-like models, all probed over UM-220K training data. Prima outperforms the 2D CLIP models, highlighting the importance of CLIP pre-training on 3D volumes and whole studies. c. Bar plot of Prima performance against baselines zero-shot performance and MLP-probing performance after training a diagnostic classifier on UM-220K data, over n=52 tasks. Error bars indicate standard deviation across AUC of each task. d, Mean prospective AUC across model design choices over n=52 tasks. Error bars indicate standard deviation across AUC of each task. Prima architecture outperformed other model designs. e, Top 5 validation set image-to-text retrieval accuracy of Prima with and without the patient discrimination loss. We see over a 5x speed-up in training time when using the patient discrimination loss. f, Ablation experiments over the neuroradiology language model. We found that pre-training on radiology reports resulted in more efficient training and that updating the language model during CLIP training was essential for MRI representation learning. g, AUC performance of Prima on each of the 52 tasks with various amounts of training data for both CLIP training and MLP probing. We have not observed an upper bound on performance and the data provides evidence that additional MRI data will continue to improve performance. These results emphasize the importance of health system-scale training and the health system-as-data engine framework.

a, Performance in each diagnostic category averaged over the diagnostic tasks. Error bars indicate standard deviation across AUC of each task within the category. b, Average Top-1 retrieval accuracy on the prospective testing cohort by days of CLIP training and amount of computation in ExaFLOPs. c, We show the normalized positive rate (NPR) of the top 20 nearest retrospective neighbors for prospective instances on each prediction task. NPR is calculated by \(\frac{{\text{average}}\,{\text{positive}}\,{\text{rate}}\,{\text{in}}\,{\text{top}}\,{\text{20}}\,{\text{nearest}}\,{\text{retrospective}}\,{\text{neighbors}}}{{\text{positive}}\,{\text{rate}}\,{\text{in}}\,{\text{retrospective}}\,{\text{set}}}\). which indicates how many times as likely the top 20 nearest neighbors of a study are to have same positive label, compared to the positive rate of the full dataset. We compute NPR averaged across all prospective studies (orange) and across positive prospective studies only (blue). The expected NPR value for randomly distributed examples is 1 (dotted line). This analysis demonstrates that Prima embeddings tend to group studies with the same diagnoses closer together. d, We investigate Prima's use of MRI sequence modalities for radiologic diagnosis by dropping T1-weighted and T2-weighted modalities during inference, and showed the top 10 diagnoses with the highest drop in performance. For diagnoses that produce T2 hyperintensity such as encephalitis, acute ischemia, and cerebral edema, Prima shows an expected drop in diagnostic performance, indicating Prima is using known radiologic features to diagnose specific pathologies. We make similar observations when dropping T1-weighted modalities. This shows that Prima is utilizing MRI sequences for radiologic diagnosis, concordant with human interpretation. e, A reliability diagram shows that Prima's diagnostic outputs are well calibration [34]. The sigmoid prediction logit is the confidence score. We then calculate the balanced accuracy of the predictions with a confidence within each 0.1-binned interval. A calibrated classifier should have a confidence score that matches the accuracy within each interval (gray dashed line).

a, Confusion matrices for ordinal metric learning, cross entropy, and binary ordinal losses for MRI prioritization. Cross entropy provided the overall best results. Examples of normal, medium, and high acuity are shown. Most importantly for triage and acuity assessment, misclassification rates were lowest for normal-high discrimination. c, External testing performance on BraTS, Stroke, NYUMets, and UCSFMets datasets. We see true positive rates on par with our prospective testing cohort. c, LIME importance scores extended to the BraTS dataset, identifying volume tokens within the externally annotated tumor regions. An example of both a lower grade diffuse glioma, IDH mutation, and a higher grade glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, MRI are shown. Prima correctly identified the FLAIR hyperintense regions as evidence of tumor infiltration. Contrast enhancing regions of the glioblastoma were most important for high grade glioma classification. d, Quantitative evaluation of LIME volume token selection versus the segmented tumor regions. We show that Top-3 accuracy for Prima selecting volume tokens within the ground truth segmented tumor region was 98.0%. These results provide external, quantitative evaluation of trustworthy predictions from Prima. b, LIME visualizations for our external acute stroke dataset. An example of an acute middle cerebral artery distribution stroke and a posterior cerebral artery distribution stroke are shown. Prima assigned high LIME score to regions of diffuse restriction on DWI images, indicative of acute ischemia.

We show a diverse selection of patients from our prospective testing cohort with associated LIME importance scores on the volume tokens. The top 5 tokens are color-coded according to the legend above. Prima correctly identifies the pathologic regions in all the clinical scenarios presented above, including pediatric posterior fossa tumors, vascular malformations, ischemic lesions, adult brain tumors, brain cysts, and developmental abnormalities. High LIME score tokens that localize to the pathologic regions demonstrate trustworthy Prima predictions. Red dashed line represented expert annotated pathologic regions. Full interactive demonstration with LIME visualizations and predictions can be found at prima.mlins.org.

a, We performed a multi-label classification analysis across all 52 diagnoses. The Prima logit-label matrix above shows the AUC value for each logit-label binary comparison. The diagnoses were ordered using consensus clustering for easier visualization [69]. The lower left-hand matrix is the correlation matrix of the ground truth labels with the same ordering. Prima learned the label co-occurrence relationships, such as ventriculomegaly often co-occurs with ventricular catheters or brain tumors co-occur with mass effect. It also correctly captures the semantic similarity of diagnoses within differential diagnoses. We observe higher AUC values for related structural pediatric diagnoses, brain tumor diagnoses, and brain injury/trauma. These findings demonstrate that Prima has correctly modeled the multi-label classification problem while learning the semantic relationships between related diagnoses. b, Multi-label LIME analysis shows that Prima attends to different pathologic regions of the same MRI sequence depending on the diagnostic prediction. High LIME scores are assigned to tokens within the posterior fossa when the LIME scores are computed for 'medulloblastoma' prediction. Conversely, high LIME scores are assigned to the enlarged ventricles when the LIME scores are computed for 'ventriculomegaly' prediction. We see similar patterns investigating the relationship between 'brain contusion' and 'midline shift' labels, and 'brain metastasis' and 'vasogenic edema' labels. Prima demonstrates trusthworthy multi-label classification.

a, Intersectional fairness analysis of sex, race, and geographic region on our prospective testing cohort that includes a diverse patient population. Radar plot shows each intersectional group and mean AUC values for each group. Prima shows minimal variance in diagnostic performance across intersectional groups. b, Intersectional equalized odds analysis demonstrate minimal disparity in TPR or FPR across intersectional groups. TPR and FPR disparity was less than 0.1 threshold we used for clinical significance. c, Equalized odds by diagnostic subgroup are shown, including brain tumors, strokes, and pediatric diagnoses. Similar to the demographic features shown in Fig. 4, there is minimal disparity between diagnostic subgroups. Prima displays algorithmic fairness on intersectional and equalized odds analysis of our diverse prospective testing cohort. The error bands in the AUC plots are standard deviations across individual tasks within each diagnostic subgroup (n=13 tasks for tumors, n=6 tasks for strokes, and n = 3 tasks for pediatrics). Box plots show the median (center line), interquartile range (box: 25th-75th percentile), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values, plotted over 20 bootstrapped iterations of 200 samples from each subgroup.

Accurately predicting the activity of a chemical in each bioactivity assay based on its already known properties is extremely useful in drug development. Unfortunately, we discovered that many assays in widely used assay-activity benchmark datasets directly relate to cell health and cytotoxicity. Many other assays intend to capture a more specific phenotype, but their active compounds impact cell count, while inactives do not. In both cases, counting cells achieves unexpectedly high performance in these benchmarks, making them less useful for discerning whether additional properties, such as phenotypic profiles (mRNA or Cell Painting), provide additional useful information on bioactivity. To accomplish this goal, we recommend filtering benchmarks to exclude such assays and including a cell-count baseline. Using a benchmark with 24 protein-target assays, we confirm that models leveraging Cell Painting image-based profiles outperformed the baseline cell count model. We propose several other practical recommendations for benchmarking machine learning models for predicting bioactivity and assessing the added value of mRNA, protein, or image-based profiles.

More Than 880 employees and contractors working for Google signed a petition this week calling on the company to disclose and cancel any contracts it may have with US immigration authorities. In the letter unveiled on Friday, the workers said they are “vehemently opposed” to Google's dealings with the Department of Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

“We object to the technology we build being used to power state violence around the world,” a Google software engineer, who declined to give their name out of fear of retaliation, told reporters on Friday.

“I stand to benefit from other people's suffering, which I find abhorrent and I refuse to be a quiet participant in that system,” added a second Google staffer, who went by Alex.

Google declined to comment on the petition's demands. But a company spokesperson, who requested anonymity out of fear for their safety, says the technologies at issue are basic computing and data storage that are available to any customer.

US immigration authorities have been under intense public scrutiny this year as the Trump administration ramped up its mass deportation campaign, sparking nationwide protests. In Minneapolis, confrontations between protesters and federal agents culminated in the fatal shooting of two US citizens by immigration officers. Both incidents were captured in widely disseminated videos and became a focal point of the backlash. In the wake of the uproar, the Trump administration and Congress say they are negotiating changes to ICE's tactics.

Some of the Department of Homeland Security's most lucrative contracts are for software and tech gear from a variety of different vendors. A small share of workers at some of those suppliers, including Google, Amazon, and Palantir, have raised concerns for years about whether the technology they are developing is being used for surveillance or to carry out violence.

In 2019, nearly 1,500 workers at Google signed a petition demanding that the tech giant suspend its work with Customs and Border Protection until the agency stopped engaging in what they said were human rights abuses. More recently, staff at Google's AI unit asked executives to explain how they would prevent ICE from raiding their offices. (No answers were immediately provided to the workers.)

Employees at Palantir have also recently raised questions internally about the company's work with ICE, WIRED reported. And over 1,000 people across the tech industry signed a letter last month urging businesses to dump the agency.

The tech companies have largely either defended their work for the federal government or pushed back on the idea that they are assisting it in concerning ways. Some government contracts run through intermediaries, making it challenging for workers to identify which tools an agency is using and for what purposes.

The new petition inside Google aims to renew pressure on the company to, at the very least, acknowledge recent events and any work it may be doing with immigration authorities. It was organized by No Tech for Apartheid, a group of Google and Amazon workers who oppose what they describe as tech militarism, or the integration of corporate tech platforms, cloud services, and AI into military and surveillance systems.

The petition specifically asks Google's leadership to publicly call for the US government to make urgent changes to its immigration enforcement tactics and to hold an internal discussion with workers about the principles they consider when deciding to sell technology to state authorities. It also demands Google take additional steps to keep its own workforce safe, noting that immigration agents recently targeted an area near a Meta data center under construction.

You should buy a dehumidifier. It will almost certainly improve your home environment. Pulling moisture from the air helps banish condensation and mold, making it cheaper and easier to regulate the temperature in your house or apartment. There's a reason the chatter about dehumidifiers has grown so loud and sales are soaring; it's because they work.

Whether you've seen a persuasive Reddit thread, a life hack on TikTok, or an expert guide to the best dehumidifiers, the hype is real. I live in Scotland, where it's dark and damp for months every year. We even have a word for the weather: dreich (which means dreary and bleak). We also have a mix of poorly ventilated and poorly insulated homes that we heat twice a day. The result is windows soaked with condensation and black mold galore.

I've been using a dehumidifier for the last year, across two quite different homes, and it's one of my favorite appliances. I'm never going back to the damp life. My Meaco dehumidifier might be the hardest-working device in my home. It's not perfect—I'll get to the downsides—but first, let me explain why I love it.

Most of the homes I lived in for the first 40 years of my life were damp. Many had single glazing, limited insulation, and solid stone or brick walls with no cavity. Combine that with gas central heating, which heats the home quickly but is used sparingly, usually twice a day, and you have temperatures that spike and rapidly fall, making the perfect breeding ground for condensation and mold. Cold and damp homes are a serious problem in the UK.

For a long time, I thought wet windows and black mold in corners were just normal. I'll never forget when we moved out of our last flat in Edinburgh. When I pulled the double bed with the big headboard away from the wall, it was completely covered in black mold. I had been feeling ill for a while, and when I looked it up, I had all the symptoms of black mold exposure. I was completely ignorant about damp risks.

Our first real home as a married couple with young kids was a modern construction, with double glazing, proper insulation, and effective central heating, and it was the warmest home I've ever lived in. But, because there were no drafts, condensation appeared on the windows every morning. Cooking and drying laundry would make it worse, but opening windows during the winter made it too cold and expensive to reheat.

I read about the potential benefits of a dehumidifier and decided to try it. Immediately, the condensation was gone, but the other big benefit was drying clothes indoors.

I know you're not supposed to do this, but I grew up putting clothes on the radiators to dry. Or we'd use a clothes airer in the hall. In some of the flats I lived in, it took days for a pair of jeans to get dry, and there was a constant musty smell. But there was no tumble dryer and often no or limited access to outside space for hanging clothes outdoors.

While line-dried clothes and sheets are the best, hanging laundry out in a Scottish winter is an invitation for rain. The weather report is rarely accurate. I also hate that whole “Is it wet or just cold?” guessing game. Bring it inside prematurely, and, naturally, it's always wet.

A dehumidifier is a total game changer for drying clothes. I used the MeacoDry Arete, which has a special laundry drying setting, and a six-hour blast is often enough to dry a whole load. No need to go outside, no musty smell, just dry laundry. That alone is enough reason to snag a dehumidifier.

When we moved into an old Victorian house with historic damp problems, I upgraded to the MeacoDry Arete Two with a 25-liter capacity. Humidity levels in the house sat around 65 to 75 percent. The general wisdom is that it should be between 40 and 60 percent (we aim for 50 to 55). There was persistent condensation on several windows and damp patches on some walls. The dehumidifier went to work. It's a fancy Wi-Fi-connected model with a touch display on top. While I like being able to switch it on or off and change the mode without leaving the bed, you don't really need a Wi-Fi model.

After a few months, our dehumidifier started switching on less often, bolstered by other improvements, like better insulation, gutter clearing, and new windows. Dehumidifiers won't cure a damp problem; they just help you treat the symptoms, so you should definitely investigate further if there's a wall that won't dry out or a stubborn mold patch in your home. You can also use water leak detectors to ensure you catch potential issues early.

A dehumidifier won't heat your home either, but it will make it feel warmer, and potentially make your heating system more effective when it's on. Less heat is required to make a dry house warm, and dehumidifying can also make a warm house feel cooler (so I'm told). You also don't have to lose heat through ventilation without the risk of damp taking hold, and it generates a little heat when it's working.

Weirdly, there isn't a great deal of solid research around the effects of dehumidifiers. You'll find the odd study about their impact on mold and condensation, but surprisingly little evidence that they can remove mold spores, dust, and allergens, despite frequent claims that they do from manufacturers. I would say, anecdotally, that I think my family gets ill less frequently since employing a dehumidifier, but it's not a panacea, and it probably isn't improving the air quality that much: You need a good air purifier for that.

My MeacoDry is a compressor dehumidifier that condenses the humid air by running it through a refrigerant and extracting the water (you can also get desiccant dehumidifiers). There are three things I don't like about it: It can get noisy, you have to empty it, and it's heavy. Noise-wise, it actually makes a sound much like my fridge when the compressor kicks in, and after that, it's a steady hum that hovers around 40 to 50 decibels (there is a nighttime mode that is slightly quieter).

Depending on how humid your home is, you'll have to empty the tank every day or every few days. I'd advise emptying it before it fills to avoid sloshing water all over yourself. You'll also need to move your dehumidifier around to get the best from it, and, even with a handle and wheels, this thing is heavy and awkward to shift. Ours usually lives in the downstairs hall, but I move it for laundry or to target specific rooms, and it works best if you place it out in the open (not against a wall).

The other obvious downside is the cost. If you want to get nerdy about it, you can work out the cost to run with this guide. But when you balance that with the cost of your heating and the potential health cost of damp, it's usually well worth it. You likely know if you have a damp problem, but it's best to check your humidity levels before you pull the trigger on a dehumidifier because drying the air out too much can also cause problems. I really like the Switchbot Hub 3 for tracking humidity and temperature, as well as acting as a Matter smart home controller, but there are plenty of cheaper options.

If you're ready to dehumidify, and you're in the UK or Europe, I can heartily recommend the MeacoDry Arete 2 (25L). For folks in the US, the Midea Cube 50 ($300) might be your best bet, but these are the top-end, biggest dehumidifiers, and both come in smaller sizes that are cheaper. You can find more options in our Best Dehumidifiers guide.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

A candidate vaccine that fights a suite of coronaviruses including COVID-19 and related, deadly respiratory diseases is starting human clinical testing in Australia. The vaccine was developed using technology from the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design.  

South Korean pharmaceutical company SK bioscience is leading the trial for the new coronavirus vaccine, called GBP511. SK bioscience previously partnered with UW researchers on a COVID-19 vaccine that received regulatory approval.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has provided the GBP511 program with approximately $65 million in funding. 

Unlike most vaccines that target a single virus or strain, GBP511 aims to protect against multiple coronaviruses at once.

“GBP511 is the first vaccine to reach human testing that is intended to protect against multiple strains of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as related coronaviruses with the potential to spark dangerous outbreaks,” Neil King, associate professor of biochemistry at UW Medicine, said in a statement. 

King, who is deputy director of the Institute for Protein Design, co-invented the self-assembling nanoparticle technology that was used to generate the vaccine. The institute is on the cutting edge of AI-assisted protein innovation and perhaps best known as the home of David Baker, a 2024 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry.  

The new vaccine recognizes sarbecoviruses, a subgroup of coronaviruses that include the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as those responsible for other major disease outbreaks: the original SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused widespread illness in the early 2000s and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks primarily in the Middle East. The family also includes viruses found in animals such as camels and bats, some of which have already infected humans and others that potentially could.

The vaccine features pieces of four different coronaviruses attached to a computer-designed nanoparticle, triggering an immune response to a variety of invaders.

“The beauty of this approach is that by presenting the immune system with multiple related antigens at once, we can train it to recognize features that are conserved across the entire sarbecovirus family,” said David Veesler, a professor of biochemistry at UW Medicine who led the preclinical studies.

The international Phase 1/2 trial launched its enrollments last month and aims to include approximately 368 healthy adults in Perth, Western Australia. Results from the study examining the vaccine's safety and effectiveness are expected by 2028.

Spotify is rolling out a new “About the Song” feature that lets users explore the stories behind the music they're listening to, the company announced on Friday. The feature displays short story cards that users can swipe through and rate with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

These short, swipeable stories are summarized from third-party sources to highlight interesting details and behind-the-scenes moments, the company says.

With About the Song, Spotify is giving its users access to a feature that isn't available on rival platforms like Apple Music.

The feature is rolling out in beta on mobile in English for premium users in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. 

Users can access the new feature through the “Now Playing” screen by scrolling down to find the “About the Song” card on supported tracks, after which they can swipe through to explore the story behind the track. 

“Music fans know the feeling: A song stops you in your tracks, and you immediately want to know more,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “What inspired it, and what's the meaning behind it? We believe that understanding the craft and context behind a song can deepen your connection to the music you love.”

It's been a busy week for Spotify, as About the Song isn't the only feature it's announced in recent days.

Yesterday, the streaming service shared that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app. Spotify also announced two new audiobook features, including “Page Match,” which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps.”

Earlier this week, the company made lyrics translations available worldwide and introduced the ability to view lyrics when offline for all users, not just premium subscribers. Spotify also moved the location of lyrics, as they will now appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music.

Earlier today, Spotify said it's revamping its Developer Mode APIs, which developers use to test third-party applications. The changes include a mandatory premium account, a cap on the number of test users, and a limited set of API end points.

The viral social network for bots reveals as much about our own current mania for AI as it does about the future of agents.

For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website's tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht's idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT-5, or Google DeepMind's Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I've been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post's author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever's watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what's coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it's true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.  

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco's R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn't amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It's important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what's missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there's also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots' accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven't been prompted to do. “There's no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It's basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren't really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It's just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don't think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet's newest playground, there's still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users' private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn't a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it's hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users' crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk. 

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what's going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you'd believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we're watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it's worth paying attention.

If you had asked me just a few months ago whether Apple would consider dipping its toes into AI devices like the kind being pursued by Jony Ive and Sam Altman's mysterious company, I would have given you a laugh the size of OpenAI's water bill.

Things change quickly, though, and what seemed like a joke just a short time ago is actually starting to feel a little bit real. Here are Tim Cook's recent musings on the topic from an internal meeting reported by Bloomberg (emphasis mine):

“I truly believe there is no company better positioned to let our customers use AI in profound and meaningful ways than Apple… There will be new categories of products and services that are enabled through AI, and we're extremely excited about that…We're excited about the opportunities that it opens for Apple.”

First of all: vague much? There's nothing earth-shattering in Cook's comments, but it's those words next to recent news and behind-the-scenes reports that have my alarm bells going off. The most important context comes from a report by The Information that suggests (and this is not a joke) that Apple could be working on its own wearable AI pin a la Humane.

The Information says that Apple's pin is a “thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum-and-glass shell” and that it also has two cameras—one standard and a wide-angle that's built into the front. With those cameras, the device is designed to take in the wearer's surroundings with photos and videos, and most likely use some kind of computer vision-based features thanks to AI. If Cook is serious about his recent comments regarding AI, especially the “new categories” part, then there is really no newer category than AI gadgets.

If anonymous reports aren't enough to convince you, though, Apple also seems to be investing heavily in what feels like an obvious segue into more AI-centric hardware. Last week Apple spent a reported $2 billion to buy Israeli company Q.ai, which makes technology that can recognize “silent speech” by taking in cues like muscle micro-movements in the face and whispers. That could apply to loads of devices and products, including Siri and any device that uses it.

In particular, though, Q.ai fits in with the more boundary-pushing tech that Apple may have planned. Rumored AirPods with infrared cameras, for example, could use Q.ai and computer vision to vastly improve Siri or enable a more full-featured ambient computing experience. Alternatively, smart glasses, which Apple is also rumored to be making, rely heavily on voice computing and would benefit greatly from a less obvious voice assistant experience—being able to silently dictate a text or command to your glasses, for example, would make smart glasses more usable in a public setting.

As long as we're spitballing, Apple's rumored wearable pin would also benefit from Q.ai's technology in a similar way to smart glasses, if it can actually pave the way for a more seamless voice computing experience.

It's all hypothetical, to be sure, but I'd be lying if I said the pieces weren't there for Apple to start pushing more heavily into the world of AI gadgets, and while Apple doesn't tend to rush, it's clearly feeling the heat after stumbles like AI Siri, which—years after the fact—has yet to roll out to Apple devices in the way the company had originally pitched to consumers.

Apple might not be the first to jump on the trend (it rarely ever is), but something tells me, based on recent news, that it might be a little more serious than we thought. Whether it can actually crack the code on making AI devices more useful and appealing is an open question, though. Competitors in the space, like Jony Ive and Sam Altman, seem to be struggling with basic stuff like the whole computing part, but needless to say, they're not Apple. If nothing else, whatever Apple potentially does will likely be a lot less of a dumpster fire than Humane and Rabbit.

While we're still waiting to actually get some of Nacelle's new Star Trek action figures and all their weird and wonderful deep cuts, the company hasn't been afraid about teasing its big plans for the future of the line. From even more out-there figures to plans for a celebratory 60th anniversary wave purely inspired by the crew of the original series, there's plenty to look forward to—but if you're especially interested in the latter, its biggest plan yet is right up your alley.

io9 can exclusively reveal that Nacelle is planning a collectible “Build-A-Bridge” series of mini displays to accompany its line of action figures, starting off with the classic bridge of the USS Enterprise from the original Star Trek. In 1/10 scale to fit with the upcoming action figure series, the series will be available across 12 individual releases representing individual stations of the Enterprise bridge, from science to communication to the central consoles for navigation and, of course, the captain's chair.

Each display can either be used on its own to highlight individual figures (which are sold separately) or interlocked to create a complete circular diorama of the bridge, approximately 40 inches in diameter. Each section will also have light and sound features, replicating classic Star Trek background effects to bring your display to life.

“In the brief history of Nacelle Toys, the Build-A-Bridge playset is our most ambitious project yet,” Nacelle CEO Brian Volk-Weiss said in a press release provided to io9. “Launching during Star Trek‘s 60th anniversary, it's a tribute to the ship that started it all.”

While Nacelle is currently staying quiet about how much each individual display will cost, the company has confirmed that it will take fans a while to actually complete the full diorama: when the project launches some time later this year, it'll roll out on a monthly preorder basis, meaning it will take at least 12 months for the entire set to be completed. But fingers crossed, if the classic Enterprise goes well, we'll get a chance to see more bridges, from the smaller-scaled Defiant to icons like the Enterprise-D or Voyager, in a similar format.

We'll bring you more on Nacelle's plans for the future of Star Trek toys as and when we learn them.

Are we honestly upset that the pace of tech product releases is slowing down? Nvidia may have already pushed back the launch of its next-generation RTX GPUs for PC gaming. The bigger issue at play isn't the loss of future graphics cards bearing minimal performance boosts. Even if it launched new cards, Nvidia isn't doing anything to keep them affordable.

On Thursday, The Information reported, based on anonymous sources, that Nvidia was scaling back plans for its consumer-end GPUs. The report claimed there were three issues at play. One, that Nvidia was delaying the launch of any of its “Super” RTX 50-series refreshes beyond 2026. Two, that Team Green was likely pushing the launch of the RTX 60-series GPUs—codenamed Rubin—into 2028. Finally, Nvidia is cutting production of its current 50-series GPUs.

It's the last point that we should be most concerned about. Nvidia has reiterated to Gizmodo that it was still shipping “all GeForce SKUs” but blamed memory supply for any current supply hiccups. What Nvidia is not saying is it needs to make more room for production of its AI training chips—the reason the company has catapulted into the most profitable business in the world.

Rumors swirled late last year that Nvidia had originally intended to launch the “Super” versions of its current GPUs, like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080. CES 2026 came and went without any peep of consumer news from the GPU maker. However, that timing would have been a quick turnaround compared to past GPUs. Nvidia launched its previous RTX 40-series in October of 2022, then pushed out the Super versions of those cards in January of 2024. Those GPUs included higher specs and lower base prices than the previous models and were an all-around solid upgrade with increased core counts and clock speeds. They had the added effect of lowering costs for the original 40-series as well.

Prices of today's cards can't possibly compare to just two years ago. The RTX 50-series launched with higher base prices than their previous counterparts. Now, in 2026, you can't find any 4K-ready GPUs, like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5090, for hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than their original manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP). If an RTX 5070 Ti costs more than $1,000 while an RTX 5080 demands $500 or more than the original price, what would adding a Super variant actually change?

It's too early to be talking about the 60-series, anyway. In a video published late Thursday, reliable leaker Moore's Law is Dead cited several anonymous sources surrounding and inside Nvidia who claimed the company didn't have concrete plans to push back the fabled Rubin GPUs past 2027. If Nvidia is going to make any decision to delay the launch, it will likely happen closer to the date of arrival.

It's too early to tell how the RTX 60-series will shake things up. Based on what we know about Nvidia's Vera Rubin AI training chips, which is our first glimpse of the “more efficient” next-gen GPU, it will still demand a heap of VRAM for playing today's games at higher resolutions. And it's not just memory shortages impacting, but manufacturing scale. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Taiwanese outlet UDN that TSMC will need to increase manufacturing by 100% in the next 10 years “just to meet Nvidia's demand.”

A little more than a year ago, Nvidia did not think of itself as a gaming company. Nor is it a “technology company,” as Jensen put it in a 2025 Q&A. Nvidia is an AI company. Anything related to gaming and the “personal computer,” whether it's GeForce, cloud streaming, DLSS, or its newfangled lightweight laptop chips, are outliers on Nvidia's quarterly spreadsheets. If the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia should hope there are still enough gamers left who can afford whatever new, ultimately expensive GPU comes their way.

The Winter Olympics in Italy this year could have an oddly shaped bump in the road. The world of elite ski jumping is currently beset by rumors of athletes artificially enlarging their penises to gain an advantage.

German newspaper Bild first reported on the potential scandal last month. The outlet claims some male skiers may be injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid to justify the use of larger suits while competing. Silly as this sounds, the World Anti-Doping Agency isn't completely dismissing the claims just yet.

“Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it,” said the smiling WADA president Witold Bańka, who is from Poland, at a press conference Thursday.

Bild is generally considered a tabloid (think New York Post). And its article doesn't identify any specific athletes accused of penis enlargement, only detailing supposed whispers from the community. So this report should be taken with a large grain of salt. But there is certainly a logic to the alleged penis-doping.

Professional ski jumpers are carefully fitted for suits prior to the start of major events. But a larger-than-needed suit, particularly around the crotch, can be more aerodynamic and allow for longer coasting times. We're not talking about a theoretical benefit either—athletes have already been caught cheating with their suits lately, albeit without needing to inject any penises.

Last summer, two Olympic gold medalist ski jumpers and three staffers on the Norwegian men's team were charged with ethics violations over a sizing scandal at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2025 earlier that year. They were caught on tape adding non-elastic stitching to the crotch area of their suits after inspection (the team admitted to the ploy). Former competitive ski jumpers have also alleged that cheating has long been rampant in the sport and that it has often revolved around suit manipulation.

All that said, penis-gate remains only a rumor for the time being.

“There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage,” FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport this week.

How far would someone go for a shot at Olympic gold? For a male ski jumper desperate enough, maybe the answer is a few more inches.

In a population-based cohort study, a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement in men aged 45-70 years effectively identified individuals with low risk for cancer. Men with PSA levels < 1.00 ng/mL (55.9% of the cohort) had a low cumulative incidence of prostate cancer (3.3%) over 20 years, whereas higher PSA levels were associated with a substantially greater incidence. Older age, higher PSA levels, and higher PSA density were associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

This cohort study “found that a low baseline PSA level was associated with low long-term prostate cancer risk,” the authors wrote. “This finding supports longer screening intervals within population-based, risk-adapted programs,” they concluded, adding that “an initial midlife PSA measurement may help focus resources on individuals at greater risk while reducing unnecessary investigations and overdiagnosis.”

The study, led by Maximilian Lindholz, MD, MS, Charité Universitatsmedizin Berlin in Berlin, Germany, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

Although the study demonstrated low prostate cancer incidence in men with low PSA levels, researchers were unable to distinguish between clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancer. The whole-body MRI sequence used was not dedicated to prostate imaging or comparable to the sequences recommended in the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System for prostate cancer diagnosis, potentially affecting prostate volume and PSA density calculations. Additionally, prostate cancer-specific mortality could not be assessed.

This study was supported by grants from Siemens Healthineers and fellowships from the BIH Charité (Junior Digital) Clinician Scientist Program funded by the Charité-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, the Berlin Institute of Health, and Stiftung Charité. Several authors reported receiving grants or personal fees and having other ties with various sources. Complete disclosures are noted in the original article.

A fully integrated substance use disorders emergency department (SUD-ED) model achieved 33.2% of post-acute treatment engagement, with patient-initiated admissions showing 3.49-fold higher odds of engagement than ambulance-initiated admissions, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

""In parallel to research on post-acute treatment engagement, a landscape of initiatives is emerging for expanding access to specialized SUD care in acute and hospital settings, from the moment of contact,"" the authors wrote.

""Aftercare options should, therefore, be broadened to better suit treatment-naive individuals, for example, by offering dedicated time slots for outpatient follow-up (next-weekday appointments) for individuals with greater SUD severity and low-cost, supplementary aftercare approaches, such as digital aftercare guides, to better reach individuals with no prior SUD-treatment experience,"" they added.

This study was led by Danilo Romero, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on January 25, 2026, in Addiction.

The observational design precluded causal conclusions regarding the efficacy of the integrated model. The inclusion of patients requiring residential care in the outpatient treatment rate calculation may have underestimated the true rate of appropriate treatment engagement.

This research received funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Oncologists are increasingly reaching for the prescription pad before the scalpel, driving a dramatic rise in the use of neoadjuvant therapy for solid tumors, according to new research.

The second annual report from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Cancer Database (NCDB), published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, draws on data from more than 22 million cancer cases diagnosed at 1250 ACS Commission on Cancer hospitals between 2004 and 2022.

It found that the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy for gynecologic cancers rose nearly fivefold from 2010 to 2022, jumping from 7% to 34%. During the same time frame, use of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer more than tripled, from 12% to 40%. Usage for rarer abdominal cancers (peritoneum, omentum, and mesentery) nearly doubled, from 23% to 47%.

Among patients with melanoma, immunotherapy use also rose sharply, from 26% to 78% for stage III disease and from 9% to 67% for stage IV disease.

“Historically, when we thought about treating solid tumors, the first expected treatment was to have surgery to remove the tumor,” senior author Judy C. Boughey, MD, chair of the ACS Cancer Research Program, and chair of the Division of Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said in a press release. “Now, we are seeing treatment more frequently with targeted medication before surgery.”

The shift toward neoadjuvant therapy is driven by the potential to improve long-term outcomes and the ability to assess how a tumor responds to drugs in real time.

“Neoadjuvant therapy is gaining momentum because it lets us treat the whole patient earlier, not just the tumor we plan to remove, while simultaneously testing the biology of the disease,” Ajay Maker, MD, chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at UCSF Health, San Francisco, told Medscape Medical News. “We are seeing from many clinical trials that it can increase the likelihood of margin-negative surgery, and in some cases, allow less extensive operations, which supports a broader shift toward better patient selection and thoughtful de-escalation, recognizing that more treatment is not always better.”

By observing tumor response prior to surgery, clinicians can tailor subsequent treatments. 

“If a patient's tumor responds to systemic therapy, they generally will do well with treatment; if that doesn't happen, it tells the clinical team that they need to think about different therapy,” Boughey noted in the press release.

Beyond tumor shrinkage, there may be an immunologic advantage to this approach.

Shailender Bhatia, MD, director of the Melanoma and Renal Cancer Team at Fred Hutch, Seattle, told Medscape Medical News that administering immunotherapy while visible tumors are still present, compared with removing visible tumors first, may create a “better training environment for immune cells against cancer proteins.”

“These data have spurred enthusiasm about neoadjuvant therapy amongst all disciplines involved in care of melanoma patients, including surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists,” Bhatia said.

Maker agreed and suggested that the broader trend has been driven by collaborative decision-making at a clinical level.

“The multidisciplinary cancer team who interprets and applies these data has likely been the most influential in this shift,” Maker said. “Centers and guideline panels can reinforce the shift, while payers have generally followed once evidence and guidelines solidify.”

While the NCDB report highlights the rising adoption of neoadjuvant therapy, this strategy is not without potential shortcomings, experts caution.

Maker noted, for example, that while a patient with melanoma who responds well to frontline immunotherapy may be a candidate for less intensive lymph node surgery, this approach is not without risks.

“There is a possibility that patients can progress or become too frail for surgery during neoadjuvant treatment,” Maker said. “Further, we are sometimes giving systemic therapy to people who might have done well with surgery alone. It can also blur the original staging and add logistical and cost complexity. So, the balance is using it where it truly adds value while avoiding overtreatment or loss of a surgical window.”

Beyond the risk for toxicity, Bhatia also pointed out the downside when a case responds poorly to neoadjuvant therapy.

“If the systemic treatment doesn't work against the cancer, the tumors get even bigger and become hard to resect or completely inoperable,” he said. “The oncology community has to ensure, though, that the risks of toxicity with systemic therapies are justified by the risk of cancer spreading systemically; otherwise, a lot of our patients will suffer unnecessarily with minimal gains.”

Bhatia suggested that the trend toward neoadjuvant therapy is likely to advance as systemic treatments continue to improve.

“What makes cancer such a formidable disease is the risk of cancer cells spreading systemically beyond their site of origin,” he said. “As our systemic treatments get better over time, these are likely to be used sooner and sooner in a patient's journey, either before surgery as neoadjuvant therapy or after [surgery] as adjuvant therapy.”

Maker suggested that the trend may lag in disease types with mixed data. 

“Pancreatic cancer is a good example,” Maker said, “in that retrospective data, real- world experience, and prospective trials do not always point in the same direction.”

He also predicted increasing usage of disease characterization tools, refining patient selection.

“Critically, as tumor assessment becomes more sophisticated and personalized, molecularly targeted and biology-driven therapies will likely play a larger role, including in the neoadjuvant setting, where they can be used to target disease biology, downstage tumors, potentially eradicate micrometastatic disease, and refine patient selection for surgery,” Maker said.

Overall, he said there will be a shift “toward more personalized sequencing of therapy rather than simply more preoperative treatment for everyone.”

In addition to the shifts in neoadjuvant therapy, the NCDB report provided in-depth analyses of esophageal and prostate cancer, revealing distinct changes in treatment patterns.

For esophageal cancer, the use of immunotherapy rose sharply, increasing from 8% in 2018 to 30% in 2022. However, the disease remains difficult to detect early; roughly half of patients are diagnosed at stage IV, and most (70.5%) do not undergo surgical resection.

“If patients with esophageal cancer are diagnosed at less advanced stages, we theorize that more patients could be treated with surgery or other less invasive treatment options,” first author Elizabeth B. Habermann, PhD, chair of the ACS Cancer Data Modeling Pillar and Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Deputy Director of Research in the Mayo Clinic Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Rochester, said in the press release.

In prostate cancer, the report documented a more modest move away from surgery. In 2022, roughly 60% of patients were treated with methods other than surgery — including radiation and/or hormone therapy — up from 54% in 2018. For those who did undergo surgery, prostatectomy remained the dominant procedure. The report noted that a prostate-specific antigen level over 20 ng/mL at diagnosis and a higher tumor grade were associated with worse survival.

The NCDB is a joint project of the Commission on Cancer of the ACS and the American Cancer Society. The investigators disclosed having additional relationships with Eli Lilly, SimBioSys, Quantum Leap Healthcare, and others. Bhatia disclosed having relationships with Bristol Myers Squibb, Replimune, Immunocore, and others. Maker reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Most children who screen as being at an increased likelihood of autism are not referred to specialist care, a scoping review in Pediatrics found.

That reality, reported by Shana M. Attar, MS, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues, contrasts with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation for universal autism screening at 18- and 24-month well-child checkups and immediate referral of all indicated children for diagnostic evaluation, early intervention, and audiology.

The authors noted that over the past two decades, the median age of autism diagnosis in the United States has decreased by just 2 months, and early autism-specific services have an estimated utilization rate of just 50% for indicated young children. Because primary care pediatricians and general practitioners serve as the gatekeepers to specialized care, their scoping review synthesized generalist providers' decision-making processes for referrals of young children aged 0-5 years.

“New innovations in diagnosis are emerging, but we need more information about how families are supported through the diagnostic process,” study co-author Sarabeth Broder-Fingert, MD, MPH, a professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan School of Medicine in Worcester, Massachusetts, told Medscape Medical News.

She added that referral rates were lower than she anticipated. “The reasons for low referral rates were not surprising, though. Given the lack of diagnostic services, it's no surprise that pediatricians don't want to refer kids to long waitlists or unavailable services.” 

In the 38 studies examined by the review, referral rates varied widely, ranging from over 1% to almost 100%, depending on the practice, referral site, and referral setting — that is, whether referrals were reported in routine clinical care or after targeted intervention.

“Perceived symptom severity and greater caregiver concern were associated with increased referral rates,” the authors wrote. Barriers noted included providers' lack of confidence in screening tools and lack of local diagnostic and intervention sites.

The review found that in studies that had no intervention component, providers referred children to evaluations and early intervention services at rates ranging from 20% to 58.4%. In intervention studies, referral rates ranged from 45% to 98% post-intervention.

In another recent analysis of 290 pediatricians across 54 primary care practices, screening rates were reported as 93% at 18-month wellness visits and 82% at 24-month visits, but referral rates of children indicated for specialist evaluation were much lower at 31%. 

Similarly, a 2020 retrospective chart review of 2822 toddlers in pediatric primary care who screened at elevated risk on a standardized autism screening at their 16-month wellness checkup found that physicians referred only 40.2% of indicated children to at least one of three recommended services. Only 3.7% of indicated children were referred to all three services, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of screening. “Unfortunately, screening administration in isolation confers little benefit to children and families,” the authors wrote.

Offering a nonparticipant's perspective on the referral issue, Mary Beth Miotto, MD, MPH, FAAP, a pediatrician in Boston, told Medscape Medical News that referrals from primary care to specialist care continue to face headwinds for both parents and pediatricians. “When I was working with a national team in 2015 to increase the screening and diagnostic rates for developmental concerns, every healthcare team in our program identified referrals as their biggest challenge,” she said.

While the causes of backlogs are diverse, including insufficient diagnosticians and differing regional practice customs, Miotto has nevertheless seen substantial progress. “Parents are much more open to both the screening and the referrals, although there are families who are not quite ready for the specialty referral, and then the primary care physician will continue to keep in close touch to help them.” But if anything, she said, increased developmental screening rates and awareness may have increased the bottleneck for diagnosis. 

The biggest barrier to consistent referral is capacity, Miotto said. “There have been times when the waitlists got so long that certain autism centers were closed to referrals for months on end. When this happens, a community pediatric or family medicine team may lose access to their only referral center.”

She would like to see more time available for pediatricians, family physicians, and advanced practice clinicians “to listen to families, have a discussion that is meaningful and family-centered but scientifically correct, and continue to grow trust from visit to visit.” 

According to the authors of the study, new research efforts should focus on increasing early intervention, which is appropriate even for false-positive children screening at elevated likelihood of autism. In addition, rigorous studies that optimize referral processes across providers and settings are needed.

But the abiding obstacle is resources, said Broder-Fingert. Creating more supply — high-quality diagnostics and support services for families and more training for primary care providers — would likely improve referral rates. But would there then be enough trained specialists to treat affected children? “Not even close,” she said. “The workforce needs to be tripled at least.”

Her group is currently working to train primary care pediatricians to diagnose autism. “We think this is a great way to expand the workforce. We also need better reimbursement rates for autism diagnostic assessments.” 

This research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health. A subscription to Covidence, a web-based program provided by the University of Washington that facilitates literature reviews, was used in this analysis. The authors and Miotto reported no conflicts of interest.

The FDA has updated the product labeling of capecitabine (Xeloda, Genentech) and fluorouracil to reflect the risks of acute toxicity and potentially fatal adverse reactions in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

“All healthcare providers should be aware of the risks of DPD deficiency, inform patients prior to treatment about the potential for serious and life-threatening toxicities due to DPD deficiency, and test patients for genetic variants of DPYD prior to initiating treatment with capecitabine or [fluorouracil] unless immediate treatment is necessary,” according to a new FDA safety announcement.

The DYPD gene encodes the enzyme DPD, which breaks down more than 80% of fluorouracil. Certain variants in the gene are known to cause DPD deficiency, and affected patients with partial or complete DPD deficiency may experience early-onset toxicity, including life-threatening mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity when exposed to capecitabine and fluorouracil, the FDA explained.

Recent labeling changes to both drugs include a boxed warning highlighting these risks, recommending DPYD testing prior to treatment when possible, and recommending against treatment in those with homozygous or compound heterozygous DYPD variants that result in complete DPD deficiency.

A n ew subsection was also added to dosage and administration information for each drug, addressing the need for evaluation and testing for DPD deficiency prior to treatment initiation and for individualized dosing in those with partial DPD deficiency. The warnings and precautions sections were similarly updated.

In January 2025, the FDA shared a related announcement highlighting initial label changes and underscoring the need for discussions with patients about these risks. The new announcement provides information about the latest labeling changes.

“The FDA will continue to monitor this safety issue and evaluate the evolving landscape and impact of DPD deficiency on the safety of capecitabine and fluorouracil; additional regulatory actions may be considered,” according to the latest announcement, which “urges patients and healthcare providers to report side effects to the FDA MedWatch program.”

Emergency department (ED)-based screening interventions for cervical cancer resulted in documented screening in 1 of 6 patients, with higher rates of abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests (12% vs 3.8%) and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection (15% vs 11%) than national averages.

""[The results of the current study underscore the potential importance of targeting] patients in [the ED] setting, as the rates of abnormal Pap tests and hrHPV infections observed in this sample of the ED patient population are significantly elevated relative to overall national estimates,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Beau Abar, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York. It was published online on January 19, 2026, in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

The study was limited by missing results from tests performed outside the primary healthcare system, potentially leading to an underestimation of abnormal findings. The single-system setting limited generalizability. Additionally, the methodology limited the evaluation of shared decision-making discussions and provider recommendations for subsequent screening intervals and modes.

The study was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute provided to one author. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Among patients at high risk who developed perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial injury after major noncardiac surgery, evaluation by a cardiologist after surgery was linked to lower risks for major adverse cardiac events and all-cause death at 1 year than no cardiologist evaluation.

“[The findings] support current ESC guidelines on cardiovascular assessment for noncardiac surgery, emphasizing interdisciplinary care, including cardiologist involvement, for high-risk patients developing PMI [perioperative MI],” the researchers wrote.

“They highlight the operational challenges in implementing routine cardiologist evaluation in the postoperative care of patients developing PMI,” they added.

The study was led by Noemi Glarner, MD, PhD, and Christian Puelacher, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Basel in Basel, Switzerland. It was published online on January 30 in European Heart Journal.

The study was a nonrandomized comparison; thus, residual confounding could not be ruled out. Individual treatment decisions of cardiologists varied and adherence to the recommended protocol was not formally measured. The study excluded patients receiving palliative care and followed patients for only 1 year.

The study received support from multiple organizations, including the Swiss Heart Foundation, Swiss National Science Foundation, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, and from companies including Roche, Abbott Diagnostics, and Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany). Several authors reported receiving grants, honoraria, contracts, or having other financial and nonfinancial ties with several organizations, including the funding agencies.

An investigational anti-clotting medication, asundexian, demonstrated a reduction in the risk of a second ischemic (clot-caused) stroke without raising bleeding concerns, according to a preliminary late-breaking science presentation at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2026. The meeting, Feb. 4 - 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premier meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health.

Asundexian holds the potential to reduce the risk of a recurrent stroke over the long term without an increased safety risk. This is a major advance in our ability to prevent strokes in people at risk of stroke recurrence.""

Mike Sharma, M.D., M.Sc., principal investigator of the study, the Michael G. Degroote Chair in Stroke Prevention, professor of medicine at McMaster University and senior scientist at the Population Health Research Institute, a joint institute of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

According to the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, nearly 1 in 4 stroke survivors will have another stroke, called a secondary stroke.

The 2021 guideline from the American Stroke Association states that antithrombotic therapy, including antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, is recommended for nearly all stroke survivors to prevent a second stroke. Dual antiplatelet therapy (treatment with two anti-clotting or blood-thinning medications) is recommended only in very specific patients, including those with early-arriving minor stroke and high-risk transient ischemic attack or severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis. Antiplatelets, most commonly aspirin, prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together and forming clots that lead to stroke. Dual antiplatelet therapy, which includes a second medication (such as clopidogrel or dipyridamole), is given in addition to aspirin, however, it is not recommended for long-term use.

""Antiplatelet therapy has limited effectiveness in preventing recurrent stroke because of bleeding risks,"" said Sharma, who is also director of the Brain Health and Stroke program of the Population Health Research Institute. ""Previous efforts to improve outcomes by adding other anticlotting or blood thinning medications have not succeeded due to the increased risk of bleeding, lack of benefit or both.""

Asundexian is a novel investigational medication that inhibits a clotting protein called Factor XI (FXIa), which is involved in producing large blood clots that can block blood vessels. Other anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, inhibit a different clotting protein (Factor Xa) to reduce the risk of stroke. However, unlike these medications, asundexian does not increase the risk of bleeding. People born with a genetic deficiency of Factor XI are known to have a lower risk of ischemic stroke and rarely have spontaneous bleeding.

This research, the OCEANIC-STROKE (Oral faCtor Eleven A iNhibitor asundexian as novel antithrombotiC) study, is a Phase III international trial that included more than 12,300 stroke survivors. It is investigating whether adding daily asundexian to antiplatelet therapy could reduce the risk of a new stroke caused by a blood clot without increasing the risk of bleeding or other adverse events.

Participants recently had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke that was not caused by a heart condition such as an irregular heart rhythm. This type of stroke is called a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Some participants had experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which involves symptoms that go away within minutes to hours and do not cause lasting damage to the brain. The TIA patients included in the trial were identified as having a high risk of progressing to a stroke within one week.

Participants were randomly selected to receive either standard antiplatelet therapy plus a daily dose of asundexian or standard antiplatelet therapy plus a placebo. Neither patients nor researchers were aware of which treatment they received during the trial.

Participants were followed for 3 to 31 months, and researchers found that compared to a placebo, adding asundexian to antiplatelet medication:

""Asundexian, when combined with standard antiplatelet therapy, helped reduce the chances of having another stroke without increasing the risk of bleeding. This benefit applies to all types of strokes, not just those caused by plaque build-up in large arteries. If approved by the FDA, asundexian could be widely used for patients who have had a non-cardioembolic stroke or a TIA,"" he said.

The study is limited by having relatively few participants with severe strokes, despite broad inclusion criteria that could have included them.

In a substudy of OCEANIC-STROKE, brain imaging and standardized MRI images were collected for participants. Analysis of that data is not yet complete; however, the results should provide further information on the impact of asundexian on both clotting and bleeding.

Asundexian is an investigational medication that has not been approved in any country. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted the medication fast-track designation for its potential use in stroke prevention after ischemic stroke not caused by a blood clot originating in the heart.

Study details, background and design:

The co-principal investigator of OCEANIC-STROKE is Ashkan Shoamanesh, M.D., associate professor of medicine at McMaster University and senior scientist at the Population Health Research Institute of Hamilton Health Sciences.

How influencers, clinics, and online masculinity culture are turning “low T” into a crisis, and creating a profitable medical marketplace for men seeking to measure up.

Study: Selling masculinity – A qualitative analysis of gender representations in social media content about “low T”. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Social media often emphasizes masculinity as the essence of being male. Low testosterone levels are represented as a sign of diminished masculinity. These narratives are increasingly linked to the monetization of testosterone testing and treatment. A recent study in the journal Social Science & Medicine explores the depiction of masculinity in social media posts relating to low testosterone (often referred to as “low T”).

Over the decades, testosterone, the male sex hormone, has been the subject of social messaging that correlates it with masculinity. This, in turn, is linked to male attributes of strength, sexual virility, and vitality.

Traditional attitudes towards gender treat men as being biologically designed for strength, dominance, and sexual prowess. In this view, testosterone drives masculinity. Building on this narrow and historically entrenched perspective, testosterone testing and treatment are often presented as being essential to real manhood.

Apart from presenting such concepts, social media heavily circulates and reinforces these ideas by promoting and selling tips and tricks for masculinity. Social media platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, greatly enhance the spread and visibility of these messages.

The manosphere is the network of online communities that echoes, amplifies, and reinforces rigid ideas of masculinity while promoting similarly backward-looking attitudes towards femininity. These communities are frequently described in the academic literature as perpetuating regressive gender-related social constructs of male hegemony.

Manosphere-related posts commonly relay misinformation about men's health and fitness. They frequently revolve around specious links to medical and biological facts to drive profitable marketing. Thus, social media posts promoting testosterone have been associated with testosterone therapy sales of over 400 million USD in the United States.

The risks of such practices include the potential for overdiagnosis of low testosterone in healthy men and the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) without sufficient clinical indication. TRT has been associated in prior research with multiple harms, including cardiovascular issues, male infertility, acute renal injury, pulmonary embolism, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. These concerns motivated the current study.

The investigators conducted a qualitative study of posts on Instagram and TikTok, drawing on performativity theory, a social theory that explores the formation of identity through repeated actions and narratives.

Their sample consisted of 200 posts, including 100 from each platform. From this broader sample, the authors conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of a subset of 46 posts that explicitly addressed masculinity or sexual performance. They found that 46% related to testosterone. Financial interests were present in 72% of the accounts, such as owning a wellness brand that sold testosterone tests or therapies, or being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company.

Commercial links, including links to clinic consultations, were included in 67% of posts. About one in three individual accounts was ostensibly owned by a medical doctor. The study notes that none of the posts provided evidence to support their claims. The authors also note that the sample was limited to English-language posts and may reflect an Anglo-centric social media environment, and they explicitly discuss their own positionality and interpretive role as researchers.

Qualitative analysis generated four themes:

1. Low testosterone is represented as a medical issue that endangers masculinity and sexual virility. Social media content often frames this as a crisis of being less than masculine by idealizing stereotypical traits as mandatory. This framing helps legitimize medical treatment, including testosterone testing and therapy, as an urgent intervention to attain what is presented as “normal.”

2. Low testosterone rebranding occurs, shifting from being an issue mostly associated with older men to being framed as a potential problem in active younger men. This group is typified as being muscular, energetic, confident, and easily aroused. Variations from this ideal are attributed to low T. According to the authors, such tactics expand the potential audience and may increase demand for testing and treatment.

3. Clichéd ideas of masculinity become the grounds for subtly demanding self-optimization by linking them to high testosterone. The threshold for what is considered normal testosterone is pushed upward. A significant medical intervention, namely testing for and taking testosterone, is reframed as a lifestyle practice that promotes so-called normal aging.

4. Social media content frequently presents a binary construct that portrays real manhood as the opposite of femininity in biochemical and material terms. This framing can result in shaming of men who do not fit the ideal of “real men,” or who are open about vulnerability or mental health needs.

Social media posts included in this analysis draw on the insecurities men often feel about relationships and sexual performance. The language of these posts reflects that of empowerment and advocacy, but is frequently repurposed, according to the authors, to market testosterone-related products.

These posts often promote biomedical solutions, namely engagement with health technologies and scientific-sounding interventions. They claim that such approaches empower men to take control of their health, and the authors acknowledge that some men may experience these messages as motivating or affirming.

Biomedicalization also involves viewing medicine as a marketable product by commodifying insecurity, in this case, raising and amplifying fears about masculinity to sell testosterone-related services. Thus, low testosterone is framed as a plausible medical explanation for a wide range of mental, physical, and relational challenges, even when such links are not supported by clinical evidence.

The authors describe how social media platforms demonstrate the interaction of language-based claims and material objects, including testosterone, diagnostic tests, and digital platforms, to reinforce masculine insecurity and narrow gender norms.

These posts also divert attention away from underlying or coexisting health conditions. As a result, they may shape how men think about their bodies, mental health, and the types of medical help they seek. Testosterone-related social media posts typically draw on manosphere-adjacent thinking to promote the idea that “real men” have high testosterone levels. This framing encourages testosterone testing as a screening tool for low T, despite the absence of evidence supporting population-level screening benefits.

Social media platforms bring together influencers, clinics, and health-related companies in ways that contribute to the transformation of masculinity into a marketable commodity. These online discussions frame “real manhood” using regressive and stereotyped ideals that shape how men perceive themselves and how they interact with healthcare systems.

Social media discourse also medicalizes normal aging in men, contributing to the expansion of a lucrative market for testosterone-related products. The authors emphasize that their analysis does not criticize men who choose to use testosterone therapies, but rather examines the broader social, cultural, and commercial forces shaping these choices.

Biomedicine in the age of social media appears to govern not only ideals about the normal body, but also sexual subjectivity and encroaches into the gendered self for profit.

When Patrick Agyemang made his move to Derby County in the English Championship and left MLS, he knew it would be a gamble. Now midway through his first season in Europe, is he forcing his way onto the U.S. men's national team's World Cup roster? 

By virtue of his MLS success with Charlotte FC, Agyemang had become the top choice for the North American-heavy 2025 Gold Cup squad and showed flashes of what he could be for a USMNT led by manager Mauricio Pochettino.

However, once the 25-year-old moved overseas, his form dipped. Agyemang found himself struggling for USMNT opportunities. His rise, from college soccer in Rhode Island to MLS Next Pro, MLS and now the English second tier, has been swift but not without its hiccups at each step. 

Yet, after some struggles to find his footing with Derby County, his play and attacking output has improved, putting him in contention for not only the USMNT's March friendlies against Germany and Portugal, but the final World Cup squad. 

Standing a towering 6'4"" and leaning on his long strides to separate from defenders, Agyemang has nine goals in 26 league appearances this season, often playing as a solo striker at the top of Derby's 4-2-3-1. 

Having scored in three of his last four matches against Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion and Bristol City, he enters this weekend's clash against Ipswich Town looking to add to an impressive tally. A win for his seventh-place side could push them above Wrexham and into the Championship playoff spots.

And for Agyemang, it's about keeping his levels high and earning his spot in a competitive USMNT striker pool. Luckily for him, he's in his best form since May 2025—the last time he scored in back-to-back games against D.C. United and Chicago Fire in MLS.

It's getting to a point with Noahkai Banks that Pochettino may have to consider bringing him to the World Cup, if the thought hasn't already crossed his mind. The 19-year-old center back, playing in a back three for FC Augsburg, has been nothing short of exceptional and there's plenty of reasons to be excited about his future.

While he missed the match against Bayern Munich two weeks ago due to suspension, he returned with a standout showing to help his side to a 2–1 win over FC. St. Pauli, bringing them to 11th in the Bundesliga table.

Banks has played 1,253 minutes in the German top flight this year and is set to surpass his last year's total against Mainz, who feature fellow American Lennard Maloney. 

Few players have produced as much as Malik Tillman, pushing for a starting role as USMNT's No. 10, has in recent weeks.

He takes center stage of a heavy American battle this weekend as Bayer Leverkusen take on Borussia Mönchengladbach—Tillman is Bayer's representative while Gio Reyna and Joe Scally are prominent players for the opposition.

Among the three, Tillman's performances are the most intriguing at the moment. He's scored three goals in two matches over the past week, though he missed out in the 3–0 win over St. Pauli in the DFB Pokal.

Thiago Silva's son has taken the next step in his football career after receiving an international call-up.

However, Chelsea youngster Iago is set to make his debut for a different country to his dad.

Silva has 113 caps for Brazil and has represented the Selecao at the last four World Cups.

His 14-year-old son is in line to star for England at youth level, though.

Iago has been named in the Three Lions' latest Under-15 squad for two matches in Cyprus next week.

The defender previously attended a training camp with the side at St. George's Park in October.

Head coach Matt Thorpe has now included Iago in his 24-player squad for the trip to Cyprus.

The Young Lions are set to face Cyprus on Tuesday before a match against the USA on Saturday, February 14.

Iago will be hoping to make his international debut during the trip as he continues his development.

He is already joined in Chelsea's youth system by his older brother Isago.

The 17-year-old centre-back is a member of the Blues' Under-18 side after signing scholar terms last year.

Both youngsters joined the club during their dad's four-year spell at Stamford Bridge.

Silva starred for Chelsea between 2020 and 2024, making 155 appearances for the Blues.

During that time, he also won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup.

After a spell in his native Brazil with boyhood club Fluminense, the 41-year-old returned to Europe last month.

Silva has re-joined Porto on a deal until the end of the season in a bid to regain his place in the Brazil squad ahead of the World Cup.

His last appearance for the national team came in their quarter-final defeat to Croatia at the previous tournament in 2022.

Although Iago may not be following in his footsteps at international level, Silva could still see his sons play for Chelsea in the future.

He previously spoke of his desire to watch them in action for his old club one day.

Silva admitted: ""I have to say, at every club I've been at, I've felt a lot of love from the clubs themselves and the fans, but here it feels a little bit different, because of the fact that my kids are playing in the team too.

""For me, it would be a dream to see them play professionally at Chelsea. I love watching them, ultimately, and I try to help them as much as I can.

""I love seeing my kids playing here, my wife is here all the time and even wants to be at every away game.

""I think she realises that time is running out slightly, so she wants to make the most of the last few years of my career.

""When I got here, it felt like love at first sight, to be honest, and I'm still very proud to be here.""

Scotland football fans say they have been left in limbo after failing to receive confirmation of whether they will get tickets for this summer's World Cup finals.

The men's national team will face Haiti and Morocco in Boston before taking on Brazil in Miami when they return to the tournament for the first time in 28 years.

Tens of thousands of members of the Tartan Army who applied for tickets were told to expect an email from football's governing body Fifa on Thursday.

But supporters' groups say fans have not received any official confirmation - and are now panicking they will miss out.

Hazel Stewart, from the Tartan Army Magazine, told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: ""The messaging we got from the SFA (Scottish Football Association) on Thursday was that emails would start popping into our inboxes and then we would find out if we were successful or not.

""That goes for both the Scottish Supporters' Club, which people could apply through, or the Fifa ballot which people used if they didn't get tickets through the SFA. But no-one has had any emails from Fifa.

""People are panicking and can't get into the Fifa website because it keeps crashing.""

Fifa has already faced criticism over ticket prices for the finals, which will be staged from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the USA, Canada and Mexico.

Prices for the group games will range from £134 to £523.

The governing body also sparked outcry by confirming travelling fans will only receive a fraction of available tickets at the host stadiums.

Scotland have been allocated 3,889 tickets for the Haiti match on 13 June and the same number for the Morocco game on 19 June.

Both fixtures will be played in the 63,815 capacity Boston Stadium.

For the clash with five-time champions Brazil on 24 June, Scotland have been granted 3,736 tickets.

It will be played in the Miami stadium which has a capacity of 64,091.

Now fans say the ticketing delay is another blow after the high of Steve Clarke's Scotland side qualifying for the finals with a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark in November.

Hazel Stewart said: ""There was a link sent out for people to get into the Fifa website and see if they had tickets.

""Obviously some people weren't successful.

""However, everyone is worried that the link is not a formal one. So that's where the confusion is arising with people panicking.

""I went into the link and I've got all the tickets for myself that I applied for through the SFA.

""I'm just hoping and praying that is the actual outcome for me.""

She added: ""There has been all the excitement about people going back to the World Cup finals after 28 years and now there are people really gutted.

""We're in this position that we will have less than 4,000 fans there and we will all be dotted around in different sections and not together.""

The SFA has said ticket pricing and allocation is a matter for Fifa.

If recommendations go ahead, judges would have to provide reasons why jailing someone for two years or less was the only option.

Spending strategy assumes hospitals and the ambulance service can make efficiency savings, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Roy and Shirley Erskine, parents of Judy Murray, and grandparents to tennis stars Andy and Jamie, died in January.

Ex-Real Madrid boss tipped for Old Trafford job if Michael Carrick leaves at end of season","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/zinedine-zidane-man-utd-real-madrid-boss-tipped-old-trafford-job-michael-carrick-leaves-end-of-season/blt17f1d428442c54c0","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:08:08 GMT","

Manchester United are once again weighing up their long-term options in the dugout as the search for Ruben Amorim's permanent successor continues. While Michael Carrick appears to have steadied the ship, the shadow of Zinedine Zidane looms large over Old Trafford. The legendary former Real Madrid manager has been out of work for years, but Wes Brown believes the lure of the Premier League may tempt him.

United find themselves at another pivotal crossroads as the 2025-26 season enters its final stretch. The turbulent era of Amorim has left the board searching for a leader who can finally bring sustained stability to a club that has become synonymous with managerial turnover. While Michael Carrick has performed admirably as the interim head coach, restoring a sense of calm and identity to the squad with three straight wins, the lure of a high-profile manager remains a constant topic of conversation within the corridors of Old Trafford.

Among the elite names consistently linked with the vacancy is Zidane. The Frenchman has been away from the touchline since his second departure from Real Madrid in 2021, and his continued unemployment remains one of football's greatest enigmas. Zidane has famously rejected numerous advances from Europe's top clubs over the last five years, with many insiders suggesting he has been waiting specifically for the France national team job after the World Cup. However, with the international setup remaining stable for now, the question is whether the three-time Champions League winner could finally be persuaded to test himself in the unique crucible of the Premier League.

Former United defender Brown believes that the club's history of appointing high-profile managers makes the current search particularly difficult. Speaking to BettingLounge, Brown identified Zidane as the dream candidate to take the reins if the club decides to move in a different direction this summer. For Brown, the Frenchman possesses the specific aura and personality required to command a dressing room that has seen several high-profile coaches come and go without success.

""United have had so many big name managers that it's tough,"" Brown explained. ""I'd throw Zinedine Zidane in there. I'd love that. But again, it is about personalities."" Brown's endorsement of Zidane stems from the belief that a manager of his stature would not only demand immediate respect from the players but also provide the fans with the world-class appointment they have craved. However, the ex-England international also cautioned that any new appointment must be perfectly aligned with the club's structure to avoid the friction that has plagued previous regimes.

One of the primary concerns for any overseas appointment at Old Trafford is the lack of prior experience in the English top flight. Brown pointed to the struggles of recent managers who arrived from foreign leagues and found the adaptation process difficult. Both Erik ten Hag and Amorim struggled to maintain consistency and avoid internal conflict, leading to their eventual departures. Brown believes the board must learn from these ""disputes"" to ensure the next permanent manager is ready from day one.

""Is it going to work getting in someone who's not worked in the Premier League? I think that's a big one too,"" Brown noted. ""You don't want to be in the same position as we were with Erik ten Hag or Ruben Amorim. You can't be having disputes along the way. It has to be clear from day one what the situation is, what the setup is, and I think that's very important going forward.""

Despite the glamour associated with names like Zidane, the man currently in the seat is making it increasingly difficult for the board to look elsewhere. Carrick's transition from coach to interim manager has been met with widespread approval from the supporters, who see him as a link to the club's most successful era. Brown admitted that while something clearly went wrong behind the scenes with Amorim, Carrick has done enough to prove he is more than just a temporary fix.

""Obviously there was something going on behind the scenes with Ruben that wasn't correct, and then you have to get rid of another manager. It doesn't work,"" Brown concluded. ""We won't get carried away about Michael but at the same time I think the majority of fans would say he's doing a great job, and a good enough job to stay on.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Virgil van Dijk reveals retirement plans as Liverpool captain is quizzed on manager & pundit roles","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/virgil-van-dijk-reveals-retirement-plans-liverpool-captain-manager-pundit/blt9a7ba0b03197b95f","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 15:03:12 GMT","

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has been discussing his retirement plans, with the Dutch defender being asked about whether he sees himself as a manager or pundit. There is still plenty left for the Premier League title winner to achieve before the day comes for boots to be hung up for the final time. He wants to continue inspiring the next generation across the present and future.

Van Dijk took a scenic route to the top of the world game, passing through Groningen, Celtic and Southampton before ending up at Anfield in January 2018 for a £75 million ($102m) transfer fee. He has won domestic and Champions League crowns with Liverpool.

The Reds have endured a slight wobble this season, after spending heavily in the summer of 2025, and have attracted criticism as a result. Van Dijk found himself embroiled in a verbal back and forth with Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney at one stage.

Speaking to another Red Devils great, Gary Neville, Van Dijk has told Sky Sports of the need for former players to be more considerate when offering their opinion on stars of today: “For me personally, I can deal with it, but I'm a bit worried for the next generation. I feel like the ex-top players have a responsibility to the new generation.

“Criticism is absolutely normal and part of the game, and I think it should stay that way. But sometimes criticism also goes into being clickbait, saying things to provoke things, and without thinking about the repercussions for a mental side of players, and especially the younger generation, who are constantly on social media. You can say, 'yeah, you shouldn't be on social media' - that's what I've mentioned [to them] loads of times.

“There is always this thing of when you play a good game, younger players check all the positive praises, but when you have a worse game, and you're getting bullied all over social media or you're getting bad criticism, it can really affect you. I've seen that in certain players in the past, and currently as well, because it's just not easy.

“It's going to get worse and worse because the platforms nowadays, with the clickbait and the headlines, everyone is on it constantly. I feel like especially the ex-pros, top players who have been through everything as well, they have this responsibility of protecting a little bit of that side as well. That's something maybe to look at.”

With that in mind, Van Dijk said when asked if he could move into punditry - or whether a stint in the dugout might appeal: “I'd never say never, because I feel like I have that platform of saying or doing the right thing, but I don't see myself being a pundit.

“I don't think I see myself being a coach. I feel like you're stepping from one world in terms of being under pressure constantly - not that I don't like it because it's part of what I wanted to be - to then quitting for a little bit and then go back in it, and then also have no control really of what's going to happen on the pitch.

“I really like inspiring the next generation. I'm at the academy quite a lot because I feel like those are the guys that are eventually going to keep Liverpool up there. I have my own youth tournament and I want to make sure it's the biggest U13s tournament in the world, so something with that. I know what it brings to those youngsters, and I really like that. But let's see, there's plenty of time.”

For now, Van Dijk is focused on helping Liverpool to end the 2025-26 campaign as positively as possible - as they remain in the hunt for Champions League and FA Cup glory alongside a push for top-four finishes in the Premier League.

Asked if the Reds need to have elite European competition on their schedule for next season, Anfield skipper Van Dijk said: “100 per cent, because I want to play Champions League football and everyone else wants to as well. But going into my last season [of his current contract], I need to play Champions League football, so we're working very hard to make sure that we do that.

“I still feel this season could still be special, even after all the difficulties we had over the summer, during the first part of the season and with injuries. We're in the Champions League, we're in the FA Cup still, so we'll see what happens. But we need consistency, we need to work, we need to enjoy it as well, because we are very privileged to be able to go out there every time, represent the club and play good football.”

Liverpool will face another stern test of their credentials on Sunday when playing host to Manchester City - with that contest set to see Van Dijk lock horns again with prolific Norwegian striker Erling Haaland. Arne Slot's side enter the latest round of top-flight fixtures sat sixth in the Premier League table.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Following Cadillac's running at the Barcelona Shakedown, Team Principal Graeme Lowdon has given his take on the mood in the camp.

Cadillac Team Principal Graeme Lowdon has praised the “strong team spirit” of the new squad following their early mileage at the Barcelona Shakedown, with the mood in the camp ahead of pre-season testing in Bahrain slated as “really positive”.

While the event at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya marked the first opportunity for all teams to run their new cars at length, it was a particular milestone for Cadillac ahead of the American outfit's maiden campaign in F1 – one that they marked by including the names of the founding members of the team from both the United States and the UK into a special livery design.

Following the 2026 challenger's initial running, Lowdon spoke positively of how the whole squad has come together.

“We've got a really strong team spirit,” the Briton explained. “Everyone's energised, everyone's up for this. Super proud for me and everyone in the team to carry the names of everybody in the team on the livery for this shakedown.

“That was something that we really wanted to do and we've just got a really good bunch of people who want to join the team, which is great, and it's just a great team atmosphere at the moment.”

Reflecting further on the emotions during Cadillac's first day at the shakedown, Lowdon said: “It is a big step, and it's okay to allow ourselves a tiny bit of time to feel the emotion. But I think the overriding feeling is it feels like business as usual as a proper Formula 1 team, and we're getting stuck into the same work that everybody else is.

“Huge, huge, huge respect to everybody in the team – I'm so lucky to be in this situation where I can work with so many really talented people, both here at the track, back at Silverstone, back in Indianapolis and in Charlotte as well, and it's a great feeling to be kind of feeling as if we're really on our way now.”

Lowdon went on to share his summary of the team's mood when the shakedown came to an end, ahead of their next opportunity to run when pre-season testing begins in Bahrain on February 11-13, which will be followed by a second test across February 18-20.

“I think [the feeling is] one of excitement and encouragement as well – really happy with the ways things have gone,” he conceded. “We've steadily worked through all the usual niggles and the like that you find with a brand-new car, but also you have to remember it's only the fourth day of this team running their Formula 1 car.

“But every day we're getting more streamlined, the procedures are working well. People are working extremely well together, which I'm really, really happy about, so [I'm] encouraged. Still a lot of work to do, but that's the same for all of the teams up the pit lane. I think we'll be heading to Bahrain with a really positive feeling.”

Williams have put their FW48 on track for the first time at Silverstone.

1 / 4

Williams' 2026 car has hit the track for the first time, with the squad confirming that the FW48 ran during a shakedown at Silverstone.

Sporting a special ‘Flow State' testing livery, the new challenger was taken for its maiden laps as part of a promotional filming day on Wednesday.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz both spent time at the wheel, with Albon suggesting that the car's debut run was a “fairly smooth” day.

“That's shakedown done!” said Albon. “Obviously a few bits of data to look at and areas to improve, but generally a fairly smooth day. We had decent weather for Silverstone at this time of year and glad to finally be in the car and driving the FW48.

“Our full focus is on Bahrain now, looking at the data and getting ready for the start of the season.”

Sainz commented: “We just had our first laps in the FW48! It's always an exciting, special day for the drivers, the mechanics and the entire team and it's been a great effort from everyone to get the car on track today.

“It was a typical winter day at Silverstone, so we focused on getting in our first few laps and completing our shakedown plan. We are ready to fly to Bahrain in a few days where we'll dive into more complete run plans, so I'm looking forward to it!”

Williams were the only team to miss the Barcelona Shakedown in late January, but went on to confirm that they will participate in official pre-season testing in Bahrain, which begins with the first test from February 11-13 followed by a second test across February 18-20.

Reflecting on the shakedown, Team Principal James Vowles added: “This was a milestone day for us and it is always a very proud moment to see a new car on track for the first time.

“The team has absolutely pulled together under the pressure of the situation and delivered a car today for a planned promotional filming day here at Silverstone.

“We were able to understand more about our package in preparation for Bahrain next week, and Carlos and Alex were able to provide some positive feedback to direct us, while also identifying some minor issues for us to clean up between now and then.

“The push isn't over yet – this is just the beginning and there is more in front of us.”

It comes after the Grove-based outfit unveiled their livery for the 2026 season on Tuesday, featuring a mostly blue and black colour scheme.

The band has canceled all 50th anniversary shows and their future ""will be determined in the next several weeks.""

Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider has left the group due to “a series of challenges,” a situation that has forced the cancelation of the rock band's planned 50th anniversary concerts.

	A statement reads, “due to the sudden and unexpected resignation of Twisted Sister's lead singer Dee Snider brought on by a series of health challenges, the band has been forced to cancel all shows scheduled, beginning April 25th in Sao Paolo Brazil and continuing through the summer.”

	The future of the ‘80s rockers “will be determined in the next several weeks,” reads a social media message signed by Jay Jay French and Eddie Ojeda, the founding and longtime guitarists for the heavy metal outfit.


	Snider suffers from degenerative arthritis, which has required multiple operations. The rocker, known for his wild hair, bright makeup, and impressive abs, recently revealed that his heart has been impacted by life on the road.


	“A lifetime of legendarily aggressive performing has taken its toll on Dee Snider's body and soul,” reads a separate statement from the band, posted to the Twisted Sister website. “Unbeknownst to the public (until now) Snider (70) suffers from degenerative arthritis and has had several surgeries over the years just to keep going, able to only perform a few songs at a time in pain.”

	











	Snider “can no longer push the boundaries of rock ‘n' roll fury like he has done for decades,” the band's statement continues.


	Twisted Sister is best known for their 1984 song “We're Not Gonna Take It,” which crashed the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 21 and continues to play where people gather – and at times during conservative rallies and in campaigns that, more than once, has seen Snider step in and call time.


	“We're Not Gonna Take It” appeared on the band's third studio album, Stay Hungry, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, and is one of their six titles to impact the all-genres tally.


	The band also charted with “I Wanna Rock” (No. 68 in 1984) and their cover of the Shangri-Las' “Leader Of The Pack” (No. 53 in 1985).


	Speaking on his abrupt departure from the band, Snider remarks: “I don't know of any other way to rock. The idea of slowing down is unacceptable to me. I'd rather walk away than be a shadow of my former self.”

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: On Thursday we brought you news of a hot game-to-TV adaptation from Craig Mazin. Today, we can break news that The Last of Us, Superman and Alien: Romulus star Isabela Merced has been set to lead the movie adaptation of hit Sega video game franchise The House of the Dead.


	As we first told you a little while back, this one should be in good hands with writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson, who did big things on screen for fellow zombie franchise classic Resident Evil.


	First released in 1997, The House of the Dead was a fast-paced horror shooter with a groundbreaking zombie/creature premise. That included the innovation of giving its undead villains the ability to run, something that inspired films from Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake to the Marc Forster-directed World War Z. It was The House of the Dead that first evolved the flesh-eaters from the lumbering stumblers that George Romero brought to life in his movies.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In the arcade game, players take on the role of AMS agents, a government agency tasked with thwarting the conspiracies of organizations that threaten the world. The title comes from the bureau they work for, because their life expectancies are brief.


	Rocket Science will launch international sales at next week's European Film Market, where the project will be a hot prospect given Merced's upward curve and the buzzy genre material. The partners very much see it as a franchise starter. CAA Media Finance is repping domestic.


RELATED: Everything We Know About ‘The Last Of Us' Season 3 So Far


	Anderson will produce alongside his Resident Evil partner Jeremy Bolt, Sega's Toru Nakahara (Sonic the Hedgehog) and Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson (Tomb Raider TV series), Michael Lawrence Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson. Merced will be executive producing.


	The movie is described to us as “a top Sega priority” after the success of Sonic the Hedgehog, with the idea to make it as immersive as possible and with a story that plays out in real-time but with a “fresh take” on the franchise. We brought you first concept art for the project 18 months ago.

	











	Merced recently starred as Hawkgirl in Superman from director James Gunn and will reprise the role in the upcoming Man of Tomorrow. She starred in Season 2 of The Last of Us and is set to return for Season 3, and is also known for 20th Century Studios' hit Alien: Romulus. She will next be seen in features Psyche and Ibelin.

	Anderson said: “The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart. We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films.”


	Nakahara added: “Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans.”


	Story Kitchen commented: “We're thrilled to bring together Isabela, Paul, Jeremy and Sega, alongside our partners at Rocket Science and CAA Media Finance. It's a powerhouse group coming together for a truly iconic property.”

	A 2003 movie version of the video game from Uwe Boll was largely derided and failed to ignite at the box office. Auspices are much better this go around.


	Merced is represented by CAA and Peikoff Mahan; Anderson by CAA, Ken Kamins at Key Creatives & Alexander Lea at Wiggin; Bolt by Alexander Lea at Wiggin; Story Kitchen by WME and Pryor Cashman; Toru Nakahara negotiated on behalf of Sega.

You had me at Isabela but lost me with WS Anderson… he's not a good director

This is the type of remake they should do. The first House of the Dead was absolutely terrible. This is bound to be better.

Isabela Merced is great, I didn't really care about this movie but now I am kinda hyped.

hopefully it's better than the last 2 House of the Dead movies.

			By Dominic Patten, Ted Johnson 


	As a flood of criticism hit Donald Trump over a vile online video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, the post has suddenly been deleted.


	After a rare backtrack for the Roy Cohn-schooled Trump, the White House put the blame for the blatantly racist repost on an over-eager and lower-level aide. Contacted by Deadline, an administration official said Friday, “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”


	Nine days into Black History Month, the posting from Trump's Truth Social account was made around midnight ET. The witching hour is a pretty standard time for Trump to jump online, precedent has shown. The deletion comes just hours after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt strongly defended the video, saying, “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	It should be pointed out there are no apes in The Lion King. 


	On Friday morning, even Trump loyalists began to speak out against the attack on the former POTUS and FLOTUS, with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) calling it “the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.” Scott, who at one time was considered VP material and is running to be governor of South Carolina, was joined in his condemnation by New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler today. “The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,” Lawler tweeted.


	The Obamas have not yet said anything about the latest attack from Trump, who started his political career trying to undermine the former President's birth and American citizenship.

	











	Among other Democrats, the response was quick and blunt. Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett summed up what many in her party in Congress and in governors mansions said Friday.

“A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”

Yeah, right. Do they actually think we're going to believe their lies?

This is a distraction from the other distractions.

“ The most racist thing I have seen coming out of this White House “ , thanks Scott for acknowledging not just this racist post, but that others have come from this administration/Trump. Yet you have stood by him even though he has a decades long history of discrimination against blacks and insulting them.

But you already defended it. We're sinking lower than the titanic here…

The group chat was like we can go half racist but we can't go full racist. Please take it down. I have to go in the office today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Karen Gillan lands next movie role in ""one-of-a-kind"" supernatural thriller","https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a70268592/karen-gillan-blasphemous/","Fri, 06 Feb 2026 14:29:28 GMT","

The Exorcist meets Training Day? We're sold.

Karen Gillan is currently filming the long-awaited new Jumanji movie, reuniting with Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart, ahead of its release this December. She's keeping even busier though by already lining up her next project.

She's been confirmed to star in new supernatural thriller Blasphemous alongside Josh Hutcherson and Clive Owen, based on a 2023 Black List script by Luke Piotrowski who is also making his directorial debut on the movie.

It follows a rookie priest (Hutcherson) and his devout mentor (Owen) as they transport a possessed young woman (Gillan) to a secure location for an exorcism. Unfortunately for them, she unexpectedly escapes which puts their lives on the line and their faith to the ultimate test.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Blasphemous has described as a mix between The Exorcist and Training Day. Filming is planned to start this August in New York, but no release date has been confirmed yet.

""Blasphemous is one of the best scripts the collective producer group has ever read,"" said Scott Strauss of Badlands, who produces alongside Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee of Thunder Road, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia of Seven Bucks Productions, and Gillan and Jess Biddle of Red Riot Pictures.

Related: Here's your first look at long-delayed new Jumanji movie

""It's a one-of-a-kind genre ride that features sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and powerful ideas. We can't wait to watch Clive, Karen, and Josh help Luke bring this unique vision to life.""

Following the announcement, Gillan shared her excitement at the new role on Instagram, posting: ""Can't wait to raise some hell for you…""

As well as the upcoming Jumanji sequel, Gillan was also confirmed to star in the Highlander reboot, alongside Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe and Dave Bautista. It's currently filming and has yet to confirm a release date.

We do know though that the next Jumanji movie is set to land in cinemas on 11 December 2026, barring any production delays. It started filming in November 2025 when we were treated to a first-look at the cast's return.

A bank account named for an ancient god in Israel. A “synagogue of Satan.” References to “goyim” that hint at a Jewish-run global cabal. The mystery of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's alleged visit to China.

These are among the latest antisemitic conspiracy theories to be born from the Jeffrey Epstein files, following the document dump that has occupied online commentators for days.

Since the financial advisor and sex trafficker's arrest by federal authorities in July 2019 and death by suicide a month later, antisemitic conspiracy theories about him have circulated widely, often invoking his Jewish identity and connections with Jewish and Israeli leaders.

But the Justice Department's newly released batch of Epstein files on Friday, which contained over 3 million pages of documents, has taken things to a new intensity.

“If you think Epstein was just some rich pedo, you're missing the big picture,” wrote the X/Twitter account Clandestine, which has more than 734,000 followers. “Epstein was part of the satanic global elite that pull the strings from the shadows. Epstein was a Deep State puppet master.”

Mike Rothschild, a writer who researches antisemitic conspiracy theories on the far right, said the amount of material available in the files made them fertile ground for misinterpretation and confirmation bias.

“Whatever your particular brand of conspiracy theory is, there's something in the files for you,” Rothschild told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “One of the problems that we're having is that there is so much information and there's no filter for it.”

Among the real revelations in the documents are a variety of exchanges of relevance to the broader Jewish world. Those include revelations that various Jewish nonprofits had courted Epstein for donations even after his conviction, evidence of Epstein's financial ties with several Orthodox yeshivas, and new details about his well-known relationship with former prime minister Ehud Barak.

Some of the emails also show Epstein referencing the High Holidays and deploying Jewish phrases like “goyim” in a disparaging manner.

“This is the way the jew make money.. and made a fortune in the past ten years„ selling short the shippping futures„ let the goyim deal in the real world,” wrote Epstein in a 2009 email to the cognitive psychologist and onetime Trump University executive Roger Schank.

In another email dated August 2010 to Jewish entertainment publicist Peggy Siegal, discussing a party guest list, Epstein wrote, “No, goyim in abundance- jpmorgan execs brilliant wasps.”

Some of the largest conspiracist personalities seized on the new document dump, claiming that it confirmed their longstanding beliefs about secret Jewish control.

“Remember the end of last year when I was called antisemitic for telling you this is the literal, religious worldview of many people in power?,” Candace Owens, right-wing commentator turned conspiracist, wrote in a post on X responding to a photo of an email where Epstein used the term. “Type in ‘goy' or ‘goyim' in the Epstein files and be sure to tag a Christian who needs to wake up and leave the Zionist cause.”

In an hour-long livestream titled “BAAL SO HARD: The Epstein Files,” Owens referred to Jews as “pagan gypsies” and repeated the neo-Nazi conspiracy that B'nai Brith was behind the “ritualistic murder” of Mary Phagan, whose killing sparked the antisemitic lynching of Leo Frank in 1915.

“The Epstein files create an opportunity for us to discuss this, to hear the way they speak about us behind closed doors exactly how Sigmund Freud spoke, it's racist,” said Owens during the stream, which had reached 2 million views on YouTube Thursday. “I want to make it clear that this is for them a religious philosophy, a racist perspective that we are goyim, meaning cattle, that are meant to be herded and ruled over.”

On Sunday, Owens posted on X, “Yes, we are ruled by satanic pedophiles who work for Israel,” adding “This is the synagogue of Satan we are up against.”

It isn't just leading antisemitic personalities but rank-and-file social media users who have sought to paint the data dump as an indictment of Jewish power.

“Normies: ‘let's not jump to any antisemitic conclusions, we don't know why Epstein did these terrible things.' Epstein: ‘I love trafficking children, manipulating markets, and don't believe goyim are human. Also this is all because I am Jewish,'” wrote an Eastern Orthodox Christianity influencer on X.

The Nexus Project, an antisemitism watchdog group, condemned the proliferation of antisemitic Epstein conspiracy theories in a series of posts on X, writing, “The Epstein files are real. The antisemitism they're fueling is also real. And right now, the second part is getting almost no attention.”

“Jeffrey Epstein was a monster. His crimes were real. His victims deserve justice and are being revictimized right now by the DOJ,” the Nexus Project wrote. “Turning his private emails into proof of a Jewish conspiracy is pure antisemitism. And it is spreading faster than anyone is willing to say.”

Rothschild said he believed the files were “reinforcing stuff that these people already are pushing out.”

“If you are predisposed to believe Candace Owens' theory that Israel is behind everything bad that's ever happened, you're going to find it in the Epstein files, even if it's not there, because there's so many mentions and there's so much intrigue swirling around about it, because it's just all this raw material you can kind of use it to make whatever you want,” said Rothschild.

New conspiracy theories also stemmed from an email exchange where Epstein requested money be wired to a bank account that some concluded was titled “Baal,” the name of an ancient Canaanite god.

“BREAKING: 🇺🇸 🇮🇱 EPSTEIN NAMED HIS BANK ACCOUNT BAAL,” wrote AdameMedia, a popular right wing X account that frequently posts conspiratorial content. “Baal is a demonic being that was worshipped in ancient israel by some hebrews before they converted to Judaism. Child sacrifice is a ritual of Baal worshippers, usually through burning, like lsraeI did to Gaza. Archaeological discoveries have found thousands of urns with cremated infant and small children remains. Now we have evidence of Epstein's circle kiIIing and even eating children.” (Similar files say “bank name” where this one says “baal,” suggesting an error.)

Others across the ideological spectrum extended longstanding theories about Epstein's ties to Israel.

On Friday, the right-wing anti-Israel personality Tucker Carlson hosted Cenk Uygur, the progressive co-creator of The Young Turks, for a podcast interview titled “Cenk Uygur: Epstein, JFK, 9-11, Israel's Terrorism and the Consequences of Opposing It,” during which the pair claimed that Epstein was an agent of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. (In July, Carlson received pushback from former prime minister Naftali Bennett after he said Epstein worked for Mossad.)

“Jeffrey Epstein was much more powerful than we realized. He could set up a meeting with almost any world leader. He can get almost anyone into the White House. Again, Ehud Barak has trouble getting into the White House, Epstein makes a call, boom, he's in the White House. Israeli spy stays over at Epstein's house,” said Uygur. “There's just no question about it. He is definitely intelligence and in every turn he's looking to help one country and it's Israel. American media says shut up.”

Left-wing Twitch streamer Hasan Piker also repeated the claim that Epstein was working for Israel in a post on X Sunday.

“Benjamin netenyahu [sic] is in the files and former pm ehud barak has such an extensive relationship w esptein [sic] they might as well call it the israel files what the fuck are you talking about,” wrote Piker in another post on X, responding to influencer Eyal Yakoby's claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not named in the files.

The DOJ's Epstein database includes 659 search results for “Netanyahu,” but the vast majority of the documents that appear under the search include news articles forwarded to and from Epstein relating to the Israeli leader.

“Going by sort of the raw number of mentions in an email database is not helpful, because there's no context for it,” said Rothschild. “If there's 630 mentions of Netanyahu, but 100 of them are just forwarded articles, and 100 of them are people responding to Epstein saying how much they hate Netanyahu, that doesn't mean anything. It just means that you have this number and people run with it, because people are taking these things and turning them into proof for whatever conspiracy they already believe in.”

On X, another conspiracy theory took hold after users claimed that an email sent from China to Epstein in April 2009 coincided with a trip by Netanyahu that same month. (The article cited said Netanyahu met with the Chinese foreign affairs minister in Jerusalem, not China.)

“Benjamin Netanyahu was in China and it seems likely that he was the man sending Jeffrey Epstein torture videos,” wrote Jake Shields, a far-right influencer and former MMA champion, in a post on X.

Other emails appeared to tie Epstein to Russia, leading to speculation that he had provided intelligence to the country and prompting calls for an investigation by the Polish prime minister.

Some conspiracy theorists online rejected the idea that Epstein might have been a Russian asset, instead suggesting it is a distraction being offered to take the heat off Israel.

“The memo went out, and the media is trying to say that Jeffrey Epstein worked for the KGB,” said the TikTok influencer “contraryian” in a video posted Tuesday that has amassed more than 30,000 likes. “He might have had multiple passports, but he talked to Israeli politicians, Jewish businessmen, and repeatedly invokes his Jewish identity.”

In response to a New York Post article about Epstein's alleged Russian affiliations, one X user with 300,000 followers and a stream of antisemitic posts claimed that the coverage was evidence of a “Jewish controlled media.”

“Jeffrey Epstein- ‘I work for the Rothschilds, Israel, and world Jewry.' Jew York Post- ‘Epstein probably worked for the Russians….,'” the post,  read. “You don't hate the Jewish controlled media enough.”

In a podcast episode Monday, Jewish conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, who has previously criticized conservative rivals for linking Epstein with Mossad, said there was not evidence in the files that Epstein was blackmailing people “on behalf of a foreign power or a cadre of powerful people who are attempting to shape global policy.”

Rothschild, the conspiracy theory expert, said everything he has seen reflects deep-seated antisemitic animus among conspiracy theorists.

“Antisemitism is huge in these circles, it always has been,” he said. “Whether it's just outright attacks on Jews, or the sort of more crouched globalists, European bankers, you know, antisemitism is a huge part of that world.”

But he emphasized that not all claims about Epstein amount conspiracy theories — which is why the drumbeat of antisemitism can continue unabated.

“Jeffrey Epstein was part of a cabal. I mean, it's not like the Elders of Zion sitting around in a dark room, you know, deciding on the fates of nations, but it's pretty clear that Epstein was at the center of a gigantic conspiracy,” said Rothschild. “That's not a theory. That has nothing to do with Judaism. It has everything to do with greed and perversion.”

The consequences, he said, are bad for the Jews and for everyone else.

“Anything that calcifies our politics and our discourse even more, I think is very dangerous,” Rothschild said. “Certainly there's always going to be a danger that it falls disproportionately on the Jewish community. I think it's probably making life difficult for actual survivors of trauma like this to get people to pay attention to them.”

            A suicide bomber killed at least 31 people and injured  169 during Friday prayers at a Shiite Muslim mosque in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, authorities said.



            It was the deadliest attack in the country since January 2023, when a blast at a mosque in the north-western city of Peshawar killed more than one hundred people.
    


            “We had just begun the prayer when we heard the sound of gunfire, followed by a powerful explosion,” a worshipper at the mosque, Syed Ameer Hussain Shah, 47, told CNN.
    


            “I got injured as well. At that time, the mosque hall was full, with more than 400 worshippers inside.”
    


            Pakistan has witnessed a rising wave of militancy in recent years, but attacks have been less frequent in the heavily guarded capital. A bombing in Islamabad in November, which killed 12, was the deadliest suicide attack to rock the city in nearly two decades.
    


            Images in the aftermath of the attack showed bodies covered in blood lying on the floor of the mosque surrounded by shards of glass and debris.
    


            “It was a horrible scene of my life which I could never have imagined,” 24-year-old Shoaib told CNN from PIMS Hospital Islamabad, where he was visiting his wounded cousin.
    


            “I heard the sound of single fire when we were in the middle of Friday prayers and, after a few seconds, a huge deafening sound of the explosion,” he said. “Everyone was running outside while some worshipers began to shift the wounded to hospital. My young cousin sustained a wound in the right leg.”
    


            The US embassy in Islamabad condemned the attack. “Acts of terror and violence against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” it said on X. “The people of Pakistan deserve safety, dignity, and the ability to practice their faith without fear.”
    


            Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said the targeting of innocent civilians was “a crime against humanity,” and the entire nation stood “shoulder to shoulder with the families affected,” the Associated Press reported.
    


            Afghanistan's ministry of foreign affairs also condemned the attack. “The Islamic Emirate considers attacks that violate the sanctity of mosques and sacred religious rites and target worshippers and civilians to be in contradiction to Islamic and humanitarian values,” it said.
    


            Early investigations into the incident had pointed the finger of suspicion at Pakistan's Taliban, or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), police sources said, but the TTP issued a statement saying it had “no connection whatsoever” with Friday's attack.
    


            “Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's targets are clear and well-defined: Pakistan's security institutions and their collaborators,” it added.

Some fear that accepting grants from a little-known federal agency would open institutions up to scrutiny and control.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.

A library in rural Alaska needed help providing free Wi-Fi and getting kids to read. A children's museum in Washington wanted to expand its Little Science Lab. And a World War I museum in Missouri had a raft of historic documents it needed to digitize. They received funding from a little-known federal agency before the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried to dismantle it last year.

The Institute of Museum and Library Services is now accepting applications for its 2026 grant cycle. But this time, it has unusually specific criteria.

In cover letters accompanying the applications, the institute said it “particularly welcomes” projects that align with President Donald Trump's vision for America.

These would include those that foster an appreciation for the country “through uplifting and positive narratives,” the agency writes, citing an executive order that attacks the Smithsonian Institution for its “divisive, race-centered ideology.” (Trump has said the museum focused too much on “how bad slavery was.”) The agency also points to an executive order calling for the end of “the anti-Christian weaponization of government” and one titled Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again.

The solicitation marks a stark departure for the agency, whose guidelines were previously apolitical and focused on merit.

Former agency leaders from both political parties, as well as those of library, historical and museum associations, expressed concern that funded projects could encourage a more constrained or distorted view of American history. Some also feared that by accepting grants, institutions would open themselves up to scrutiny and control, like the administration's wide-ranging audit of Smithsonian exhibits “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.”

The new guidelines are “chilling,” said Giovanna Urist, who served as a senior program officer at the agency from 2021 to 2023. “I think that we just need to look at what's happening with the Smithsonian to know that the administration has a very specific goal in mind when it comes to controlling the voice of organizations and museums across the country.”

An agency spokesperson told ProPublica it is not unusual for the institute to publish directors' letters with grant applications, and that this one informs readers “about this Administration's thematic emphases in the semi-quincentennial year.” He did not comment on criticisms that those letters insert political themes into a historically nonpartisan program.

“Under President Trump's leadership, IMLS is working to revitalize our cultural institutions, urging less traditional applicants to consider working with us, and to promote civic pride and a deep sense of belonging among all Americans,” he said, adding that any institution that “meets programmatic requirements and goals” outlined in the funding opportunity “will receive all due consideration and undergo peer review.”

The spokesperson did not say how alignment with Trump's executive orders would be weighed in the selection process or address concerns about the administration's intrusion into funded institutions.

Established in 1996, the institute is the only dedicated source of federal support for libraries and one of the primary federal funders of museums and archives. Its long-running grant programs promote community engagement and public access to information, while bolstering institutions' ability to care for collections and prepare for disasters. One grant, named after former first lady Laura Bush, helps recruit and train library professionals.

Last March, Trump attempted to eliminate the agency through an executive order and fired director Cyndee Landrum, a career library professional. Attorneys general from 21 states and the American Library Association sued the Trump administration to block it from dismantling the agency; the courts have halted the efforts for now.

To head the agency, the administration appointed Deputy Secretary of Labor Keith E. Sonderling, who does not appear to have prior professional experience in museums or libraries. (An institute spokesperson didn't comment on concerns ProPublica passed along about this.) In a press release announcing his appointment as acting director, Sonderling said, “We will revitalize IMLS and restore focus on patriotism, ensuring we preserve our country's core values, promote American exceptionalism and cultivate love of country in future generations.”

Ten days later, he put nearly all of the agency's 75 employees on administrative leave, fired the board and rescinded some previously awarded grants.

The grants were reinstated under court order in December, and the agency is now accepting applications for 13 grants whose awards range from $5,000 to $1 million. According to Grants.gov, the agency now expects to award nearly 600 grants totaling more than $78 million.

ProPublica spoke with directors who ran the agency under every previous presidential administration dating back to Barack Obama's. Though each era brought different priorities, they said, those changes were implemented with input from the field — not by encouraging applicants to align their work with a president's worldview. With the new guidelines, they said, the administration is signaling a preference for certain types of projects and narratives.

Crosby Kemper III, a lifelong conservative Republican appointed by Trump to lead the agency in 2019, stayed on into President Joe Biden's term. While he was not a fan of the former president's emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion and feels that the library and museum fields needed a course correction from their natural lean to the left, he believes that what is coming out of the current Trump administration is not helpful.

“All these Trump executive orders — and I mean all of them — are just extensions of his own animus towards anybody who disagrees with him and his outsized ego,” said Kemper, who called the orders “nonsense” and the grant guidelines “horrific.” “It's clear the administration wants a whitewashed story, if you'll pardon the pun there. And that's wrong.”

Leaders of the American Historical Association, the American Library Association and the American Alliance of Museums warned that changes to the agency's grant language and recent funding actions have led to uncertainty across the field.

Among questions raised: Would the government revoke grants it had already awarded, as it did last year? Would accepting the money open up institutions to broader investigations, like the 52 universities scrutinized over their DEI practices? The institute spokesperson did not comment on either of those questions. Sarah Weicksel, the American Historical Association's executive director, said institutions are even worried about how they would be perceived if they took the funds. “They're wondering, is accepting the grant a sign that they accept the executive orders that have been laid out here?”

Questions also remain about whether enough staff is left to process the applications properly. The agency's $112 million budget for this year is roughly a third of the funding it has received in recent years. The agency did not answer a question about its current staffing, but in its most recent Congressional Budget Justification document, it requested support for 13 full-time employees. Former agency officials said that number is low, but that they trusted the remaining staffers to choose quality projects and, in the words of Kemper, “do the right thing.”

But staffers are only part of the process. Typically, each grant application is reviewed by volunteer library and museum experts. Susan Hildreth, who led the agency from 2011 to 2015, questions the lack of information about the current process on the agency's website. “I couldn't find it anywhere in the documentation,” she said. The institute spokesperson said the grant process remains the same as previous years.

Opinion polls consistently find that libraries and museums are among the most trusted public institutions in the country by Americans across the political spectrum, and Urist said they are trusted because of their independence. “When the federal government puts its thumb on that scale, it threatens the trustworthiness of these community anchors.”

Weicksel said it's important for the public to know how the administration is aiming to shape institutions essential to the nation's culture and ability to understand itself and its past. Patty Gerstenblith, distinguished research professor of Law at DePaul University, agreed, saying that the administration's actions raise serious First Amendment concerns.

“Certainly at a minimum,” Gerstenblith said, “people should know that the government is using its funding as a way of essentially coercing a different presentation of American history.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticized the video as racist.

The Republican president's Thursday night post was deleted Friday and blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation's first Black president and first lady. The deletion, a rare admission of a misstep by the White House, came hours after press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed “fake outrage” over the post. After calls for its removal for being racist -- including by Republicans -- the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously and it had been taken down.

The post was part of a flurry of social media activity on Trump's Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and a Trump attorney general from his first term finding no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. 

An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response. 

Nearly all of the 62-second clip, which was among dozens of Truth Social posts from Trump overnight, appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied. At the 60-second mark is a quick scene of two primates, with the Obamas' smiling faces imposed on them. 




Those frames were taken from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker. It shows Trump as “King of the Jungle” and depicts a range of Democratic leaders as animals, including Joe Biden, who is white, as a jungle primate eating a banana. 

“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,” Leavitt said by text, referring to Disney's 1994 feature film, which does not feature the range of jungle primates featured in the original video. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

By noon, the post had been taken down with responsibility placed on a Trump subordinate. 

Trump did not comment on the video in the post, which comes in the first week of Black History Month and days after a presidential proclamation that cited “the contributions of black Americans to our national greatness and their enduring commitment to the American principles of liberty, justice, and equality.”

While it was still up, Trump's post drew condemnation from across the political and ideological spectrum. 

The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the assassinated civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., resurfaced her father's words: “Yes. I'm Black. I'm proud of it. I'm Black and beautiful.” She praised Black Americans as “diverse, innovative, industrious, inventive” and added, “We are beloved of God as postal workers and professors, as a former first lady and president. We are not apes.”

The U.S. Senate's lone Black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, called on Trump to take down the post. “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,” Scott, who chairs Senate Republicans' midterm campaign arm, said on social media. 

Another Republican, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is white but represents the state with the largest percentage of Black residents. Wicker called the post “totally unacceptable” and said the president should apologize. 

NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement, “Donald Trump's video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable.” 

Johnson asserted that Trump is trying anything to distract from economic conditions and attention on the Jeffrey Epstein case files. 

“You know who isn't in the Epstein files? Barack Obama,” Johnson said. “You know who actually improved the economy as president? Barack Obama.”

Trump and the official White House social media accounts frequently repost memes and artificial intelligence-generated videos. As Leavitt did Friday, Trump aides typically dismiss critiques and cast the images as humorous. 

There is a long history in the U.S. of powerful white figures associating Black people with animals, including apes, in demonstrably false and racist ways. The practice dates back to 18th century cultural racism and pseudo-scientific theories in which white people drew connections between Africans and monkeys to justify the enslavement of Black people in Europe and North America, and later to dehumanize freed Black people as an uncivilized threat to white people. 

Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote in his famous text “Notes on the State of Virginia” that Black women were the preferred sexual partners of orangutans. President Dwight Eisenhower, discussing the desegregation of public schools in the 1950s, once argued that white parents were concerned about their daughters being in classrooms with “big Black bucks.” Obama, as a candidate and president, was featured as a monkey or other primate on T-shirts and other merchandise. 

Trump, for his part, has a record of intensely personal criticism of the Obamas and of using incendiary, sometimes racist, rhetoric. 

In his 2024 campaign, Trump said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country,” language similar to what Adolf Hitler said to dehumanize Jews in Nazi Germany.

During his first White House term, Trump referred to a swath of developing nations that are majority Black as “shithole countries.” He initially denied using the slur but admitted in December 2025 that he did say it. 

When Obama was in the White House, Trump advanced the false claims that the 44th president, who was born in Hawaii, was born in Kenya and was constitutionally ineligible to serve. Trump, in interviews that helped endear him to many conservative voters, repeatedly demanded that Obama produce birth records and prove he was a “natural-born citizen” as required to become president. 

Obama eventually released his Hawaii records. Trump finally acknowledged during his 2016 campaign, after having won the Republican nomination, that Obama was born in Hawaii. But he immediately said, falsely, that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton started those birtherism attacks on Obama.

A detached ruler, obsessed with sex and video games, refused every lifeline he was offered.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Some dictators go down fighting. Some are lynched and strung up for their victims to spit on. Some die in bed.

Bashar al-Assad, who oversaw the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Syrians during a quarter century in power, may have achieved something new in the annals of tyranny. As the rebels closed in on Damascus on December 7, 2024, Assad reassured his aides and subordinates that victory was near, and then fled in the night on a Russian jet, telling almost no one. I remember seeing a statement issued that same evening declaring that Assad was at the palace performing his “constitutional duties.” Some of his closest aides were fooled and had to escape the country however they could as rebel militias lit up the sky with celebratory gunfire.

Assad's betrayal was so breathtakingly craven that some people had trouble believing it at first. When the facts became impossible to deny, the loyalty of thousands of people curdled almost instantly into fury. Many swore that they had always secretly hated him. There is an expression in Arabic for this kind of revisionist memory: When the cow falls, the butchers multiply.

But the emotion was real for many, as was the belief that Assad was solely responsible for everything that had gone wrong. “You can still find people who believe in Muammar Qaddafi, who believe in Saddam Hussein,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist and editor, told me. “No one now believes in Bashar al-Assad, not even his brother.”

The sudden collapse of the Assad regime put an end to a cruel police state, but now there is virtually no Syrian state at all outside the capital. The country's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has done a superb job of charming Donald Trump and other world leaders. He is also an Islamist whose authority is tenuous, and whose country remains so dangerously volatile that it could easily descend into another war.

No one—not the CIA, not the Mossad—appears to have had any idea that Assad would fall so fast. But in the days and weeks afterward, an explanation for his regime's collapse began to gain currency. Assad's backers, Russia and Iran, had been drawn into other conflicts, with Ukraine and Israel respectively, and no longer had the ability to protect him. Their sudden withdrawal exposed what had been hidden in plain sight for years: the terrible weakness of an exhausted, corrupt, and underpaid army. A little like the American-backed regime in Afghanistan that fell in 2021, the Assad dynasty was the casualty of broader geopolitical realignments. After the fact, its fall came to seem inevitable.

But over the past year, I have spoken with dozens of the courtiers and officers who inhabited the palace in Damascus, and they tell a different story. Many describe a detached ruler, obsessed with sex and video games, who probably could have saved his regime at any time in the past few years if he hadn't been so stubborn and vain. In this version, it was not geopolitics that doomed the regime. None of the countries in the region wanted Assad to fall, and several of them offered him lifelines. If he had taken hold of them, he would almost certainly be sitting in the palace now. Even in the final days, foreign ministers were calling, offering deals. He didn't answer. He appears to have been sulking, angered by the suggestion that he might have to give up the throne.

In the end, Assad's embittered loyalists may have been right. It was all about Bashar.

Perhaps all autocrats come to think of themselves as invincible, but Assad had a particular reason for his misplaced confidence: He had already survived one near-death experience.

The Arab Spring uprisings reached Syria in 2011 and blazed up into civil war. A large portion of the country's people took up arms against its ruler, and scarcely anyone expected Assad to survive. “I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed,” Barack Obama declared in 2012. Obama was so confident that his State Department helped fund a “Day After Project” to be ready for the new Syria. My editors at The New York Times asked me to write an obituary of the Assad dynasty, and I remember thinking that I should get it done quickly. I still have it in my files.

Read: The dispute behind the violence in Syria

That obituary probably would have been published in 2015 if not for a deus ex machina named Vladimir Putin. A Russian intervention that began in September of that year changed everything for Assad. Waves of deadly air strikes by Russia's Sukhoi and Tupolev jets, working in concert with Iranian and Shiite militias, shifted the momentum on the battlefield, inflicting fierce blows on the rebel forces. By now, the Syrian opposition, once led by nonviolent protesters, was dominated by Islamists, who were divided and feckless and could be easily lumped together with the telegenic savageries of the Islamic State, known as ISIS.

By late 2017, Assad had more or less won the war. His regime controlled the major cities, and the opposition was confined to the northwestern province of Idlib, where a former al-Qaeda leader named Ahmed al-Sharaa (then known as Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) was emerging as a leading figure.

That deceptive moment of victory, many Syrians have told me, was when everything started to go wrong. Assad didn't seem to understand that his triumph was a hollow one. Large portions of his country had been reduced to rubble. The economy had shrunk almost to nothing, and sanctions levied by the United States and Europe were weighing it down even further. Syria's sovereignty had been partly mortgaged to Russia and Iran, which were squeezing Damascus for money to repay their investment in the conflict. Assad's supporters, having suffered through years of war and struggle, would not remain patient forever. With the fighting over, they began to expect some kind of reprieve.

Assad could have given his people what they wanted. The Gulf Arab states had the money and clout to bring him in from the cold, and in 2017, the United Arab Emirates began reaching out to Damascus. But it had a condition, the same one it had been seeking since before the civil war: Assad had to distance himself from Iran. The Gulf Arabs had long seen the revolutionary theocrats in Tehran as their biggest threat, and Syria's long-standing alliance with them—forged by Bashar's father, Hafez al-Assad—was a sore point with all of the other Arab leaders.

For Syria, exchanging Iran's dubious company for the wealth of the Gulf made a lot of sense. But there was a catch: It wasn't necessarily the best thing for the Assad family. Unlike the Gulf states and the West, the Iranians had always made clear that they would do anything to keep Assad in power. All he had to do in return was continue to facilitate Tehran's provision of weapons and money through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that was the star player in Tehran's “Axis of Resistance.”

Assad did reach a modest rapprochement with the Emiratis, who reopened their embassy in Damascus in 2018. But he refused to cut his ties to Iran. Khaled al-Ahmad, a shrewd political operator in Assad's inner circle who had negotiated the deal with the Emiratis and had briefly believed that a real political transition was possible, finally concluded that Assad was incapable of changing course. “I decided he was a dead elephant in the room,” he told me of Assad. (Ahmad is now an adviser to the new Syrian government.)

Around this time, a young Israeli national-security official reached the same conclusion and began urging his superiors to organize an internal coup against Assad. The Israelis had long viewed Assad as a manageable enemy—someone who mouthed all of the usual slogans about the Zionist enemy but kept the border between the two countries quiet. But the Israeli official, who is no longer in government service and spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, told me that around 2019, he began to fear that Assad was too feckless to be reliable. “The regime was an empty shell,” he said.

The Israeli command demurred on the coup proposal. The idea had been discussed periodically over the years in Tel Aviv and Washington but had never gotten very far, perhaps because Assad's father had deliberately created a regime that kept potential rivals in check or under surveillance.

“Everybody in the region was comfortable with him being there,” the former Israeli official said. “Being weak, posing a threat to no one.”

Assad apparently mistook this tacit consensus for power. “Bashar was living in a fictional world,” a former Hezbollah political operative who was often in Syria during those years told me (he asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions): “The Iranians need me. The Russians have no choice. I'm the king.”

Assad's backers began to grumble, but the Syrian leader wouldn't listen. In 2019, the former Hezbollah operative said, the Russians and the Iranians began pushing him to make mostly symbolic reforms that would placate Western countries and ease the burden of Syria's economic isolation. Assad lied and temporized, the official said. Iran's foreign minister at the time, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a recent interview with Al Jazeera that he'd urged Assad to “engage with the opposition” but that the Syrian leader, “drunk with victory,” had stalled.

Perhaps the most arresting example of Assad's obtuseness came during the first Trump administration. In 2020, Washington sent two officials, Roger Carstens and Kash Patel, to Lebanon to locate Austin Tice, an American journalist who had disappeared in Syria in 2012 and was thought to be in the hands of the Assad regime. Abbas Ibrahim, then the head of Lebanon's General Security branch, brought the two men to Damascus, where they met with one of Assad's top security officials, a widely feared figure named Ali Mamlouk. The Americans raised the subject of Tice, Carstens told me, and Mamlouk responded that the United States would need to lift sanctions and remove its troops from Syria before any American request could be discussed. Ibrahim, who had taken part in the meeting and recalled some details differently, told me that he had seen Mamlouk's remark as an opening gambit and had never expected the Americans to make such sweeping concessions.

To the surprise of both Ibrahim and Mamlouk, the U.S. government signaled its agreement to a deal in exchange for proof that Tice was alive. Ibrahim then flew to Washington, where he was told that Trump had confirmed the American position. But Ibrahim was even more amazed when he got the response from Assad: No deal, and no more talks. Ibrahim asked why, and Mamlouk told him that it was “because Trump described Assad as an animal” years earlier.

Ibrahim told his Syrian counterpart that this was madness. Even if Tice was dead, the Americans would hold up their end of the deal as long as they could find out what had happened to him and “close the file.” (There have been conflicting reports about what happened to Tice, including some suggesting, without proof, that an Assad-regime officer may have killed him.) The Americans were eager for anything they could get, Ibrahim recalled to me: “I got a call from Pompeo once; he said, I'm ready to fly by private jet to Syria, ready to shake hands with anyone.” (Pompeo and Patel did not respond to my requests for comment.)

This was a “golden opportunity” for Assad, who presumably could have met with Mike Pompeo, then the U.S. secretary of state, and told him apologetically that the regime did not know what had happened to Tice, Ibrahim said. The meeting alone would have bestowed a new legitimacy on Assad, and made other countries more inclined to reach out to him.

The Biden administration renewed the offer in 2023, sending a high-level delegation to Oman to meet with Syrian officials about Tice. This time, Assad behaved almost insultingly, Ibrahim said, refusing even to send a senior official to meet them. Instead, he sent a former ambassador who was given strict instructions to not so much as speak about Tice.

That Assad, with his hubris and lack of foresight, was soon to fall may be less puzzling, in retrospect, than the fact that he lasted so long. The reason he did goes back to his father, who built a regime so sturdy and ruthless that it survived 25 years of the son's mismanagement. One lesson to be drawn from Assad's fall is a very old one: The greatest vulnerability of all political dynasties is the problem of succession.

Hafez al-Assad was a dictator in the classic mold, a shrewd and strong-willed man who rose from rural poverty through the military and seized power in a 1970 coup. He had a genius for undermining and outwitting his rivals, and he made dictatorship seem natural. It was what many Syrians wanted after the chaotic years that followed their country gaining independence from France, in 1946. “For some reason it seems to me that within the Arab circle there is a role wandering aimlessly in search of a hero,” wrote Gamal Abdel Nasser, the lantern-jawed Egyptian leader who embodied that heroic role perfectly in the 1950s and '60s and helped create the modern idea of what an Arab dictator should be.

Bashar was different. Even first-time visitors to Syria could see that he didn't look the part: He had a weak chin and panicky eyes, and his head and neck were oddly elongated, as if he'd been squeezed too tight in the birth canal. When you saw his image on one of the ubiquitous billboards around Syria, it was easy to get the feeling that someone had played a practical joke and substituted the head of an anxious schoolboy for that of the leader.

When he started talking, the impression was even worse. His voice was thin and nasal, and he always looked uncomfortable during speeches, as if he was desperate to get it over with. In a culture that puts great value on eloquence and authority, he had none.

Many people who know Bashar told me that his lack of confidence stems from his early years. His older brother, Bassel, bullied his younger siblings so mercilessly that he permanently distorted their personalities, one former palace insider told me. The family dynamics are on display in a famous photograph taken around 1993. Bassel stands at the center of the frame, looking cocky and slightly bored, with his parents seated in front of him and his siblings on either side. Bashar is on the left, his body slightly angled away, his face uneasy. Unlike the others, he seems to be looking beyond the photographer, as if scouting an escape route.

Bashar came to power through an accident. Bassel, a military officer and a show-jumping equestrian who was known as Syria's “Golden Knight,” was the heir apparent. But he died in a car crash in 1994. Hafez yanked Bashar back from London, where he'd been training to be an ophthalmologist, and began grooming him as the next leader.

Many in Syria's dissident circles at first found Bashar's awkwardness and shyness appealing. The fact that he didn't resemble a dictator kindled their hopes that he would be kinder and more tolerant. For a brief moment, that appeared to be true. During the “Damascus Spring” that followed Bashar's accession after his father's death, in 2000, the margin of free speech seemed to widen.

But a crackdown soon followed, and in the following years, Assad's psychology appeared to be working in the opposite direction. He was so afraid of being perceived as weak, he seemed to believe that he had to prove, again and again, that he could live up to the brutality that was expected of him.

I have spoken with at least a dozen people who knew Assad, and they all commented on his stubbornness. He doesn't listen to advice, many of them said, and often seems to resent hearing it. Similar things were said about his father, a famously uncompromising negotiator. Both men had to “bargain with and manipulate sinecures of power within this opaque system in order to reach consensus,” David Lesch, a scholar at Trinity University who interviewed Bashar extensively in the 2000s, told me. But Assad lacked his father's native toughness. According to some who knew and studied him, his rigidity masked a lack of confidence in his own judgment.

That insecurity, some told me, also makes him impressionable. He was particularly taken with Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, an immensely popular and charismatic figure. Assad seems to have believed the propaganda Nasrallah fed him, perhaps because it was what he wanted to hear: that the Axis of Resistance would strike a fierce blow against Israel and that, afterward, Assad would be able to set any conditions he liked for peace. In other words, Assad would not have to make any difficult choices or sacrifices. Everything would be handed to him on a platter.

On October 7, 2023, Assad must have imagined for a few hours that Nasrallah's prophecies had come true. Hamas fighters swept across the border fence from Gaza and massacred more than 1,000 people. Israel—the Samson of the region—looked weak and unprepared.

But before long, Israel was launching thousands of air strikes not just into Gaza but also into Lebanon and Syria. Assad said nothing about this campaign against his allies, which eventually killed Nasrallah himself. Perhaps he hoped to keep his name off Israel's target list. But according to Wiam Wahhab, a Lebanese political figure who was close to the Syrian regime, Assad's silence fueled Iranian suspicions that he was feeding information to the Israelis. The Axis of Resistance was falling apart.

That should have worried Assad, especially in light of the fact that Russia, his other protector, was bogged down in Ukraine. But the atmosphere at the palace was not conducive to clear thinking. Assad was spending much of his time playing Candy Crush and other video games on his phone, according to the former Hezbollah operative I spoke with. He had sidelined the éminences grises of his father's day and relied instead on a small circle of younger figures with dubious credentials. One of them, a former Al Jazeera journalist named Luna al-Shibl, doubled as Assad's lover and also procured other women for him to have sex with, including the wives of high-ranking Syrian officers, according to former palace insiders and the former Israeli official.

Shibl, who was married to a regime insider, seems to have encouraged Assad's palace-born habit of looking down on ordinary citizens. In a recording that surfaced this past December, Assad and Shibl can be heard laughing dismissively about the pretensions of Hezbollah and mocking the soldiers who salute them as they drive through a Damascus suburb. Assad, who is at the wheel, says at one point of the Syrians they pass in the street: “They spend money on mosques, but they don't have enough to eat.”

To understand the obscenity of Assad's comment, you need to know that he was amassing an enormous personal fortune, mostly from drug smuggling, even as many Syrians were at the point of starvation. Ordinary soldiers were paid as little as $10 a month, far less than they needed to survive. The Syrian pound, which had once traded at 47 to the dollar, had reached a rate of 15,000 a dollar by 2023. The poverty deepened after 2020, when the U.S. Congress imposed another steep round of sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.

Even longtime supporters from the Alawite religious minority—the sect to which the Assads belong—began to complain about their destitution. One member of the Assad clan who lives in Europe told me that he'd visited Syria in 2021 and been amazed to discover that the officers—from the elite Republican Guard unit—charged with protecting his immediate family were so poor that they spent their off-duty hours hawking fruit and cigarettes in the street.

Assad and his family maintained their own living standards by turning Syria into a narco-state, with Bashar's brother Maher overseeing the manufacture and smuggling of immense quantities of Captagon, an illegal amphetamine. The drug trade earned Assad billions of dollars, but it also fueled an addiction crisis in the Gulf states and Jordan, angering their leaders.

Assad's megalomania seems to have taken a strange new turn in these past few years. According to Ahmad, Assad had concluded that he needed “monarchy tools” like those of Putin and the Gulf rulers, including cash reserves large enough to subsidize militias and reorient the economy. Assad's comments to a Russian interviewer during his final months in power betray a hint of this idea of royal powers. Asked about the downsides of democracy, Assad said, with a contemptuous grin: “In the West, the presidents, especially in the United States, are the executive directors, but they're not the owners.”

In July 2024, with the war in Gaza dominating the headlines, Luna al-Shibl was found dead in her BMW on a highway outside Damascus. The regime media called it a road accident, but the circumstances were odd: According to some reports, the car was only lightly damaged, yet her skull had been bashed in. Rumors spread quickly that she had been killed on the orders of Tehran for providing targeting information to the Israelis.

But Assad was the one who'd ordered the murder of his former lover, the former Israeli official and two people with ties to the regime told me. Shibl had become a de facto Russian agent, providing Moscow with information about Iran's activities in Syria, the former Israeli official said. Perhaps she'd sensed that the end was coming for Assad and that she needed another protector. This account was impossible to confirm; Russian officials do not comment on intelligence matters.

When a tyrant falls, we may be tempted to imagine a final moment of tragic self-awareness—a personal reckoning, like Oedipus blinding himself, or Macbeth raging on the heath. But I don't think real dictators go down like that. They are too good at lying to themselves.

For Assad, the final chapter began in November 2024. The rebel militias under Ahmed al-Sharaa's command had been lobbying for Turkey's permission to launch a military operation, and finally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave it to them. (Turkey denied official involvement in the operation.)

Erdoğan did so reluctantly. All year, he had been asking Assad to meet with him. His demands were pretty modest: a political reconciliation and a deal to allow the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey to return home. But Assad acted as if he held all the cards, refusing to meet unless Erdoğan agreed in advance to withdraw all Turkish forces from Syria. The rebel operation that Erdoğan approved seems to have been intended as a way to prod Assad to negotiate; it was framed not as an invasion but as a defensive move.

When the rebels marched northeast toward the city of Aleppo on November 27, 2024, Assad was in Russia, where his son would be defending his Ph.D. dissertation on number theory and polynomial representations at Moscow State University. As Aleppo's defenses crumbled, Assad remained in Moscow, to the shock and dismay of his commanders back home. He seems to have been hoping to persuade Putin to rescue him.

But the Russian president kept him waiting for days, and when they finally met, it was very brief. According to the former Israeli official I spoke with, Putin told Assad that he could not fight his war for him, and that the Syrian leader's only hope was to go to Erdoğan and cut a deal. The Russians had always valued their strategic relationship with Turkey far more than their relationship with Syria. Whether Assad grasped this is impossible to know. But Putin was not going to launch a new war against Turkey's rebel allies just to save a petty dictator whose own soldiers were deserting.

Aleppo had fallen to the rebels by the time Assad landed back in Damascus. After only a few hours, he flew to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad told me. It is not clear whom he met with or what was said. The Emiratis feared Sharaa's Islamist militias as much as they feared Tehran. But they had no boots on the ground.

Back in Damascus, Assad tried a last gambit, calling on the “monarchy tools” he had been assembling for years. He put out word that he would pay exorbitant salaries to volunteers who could quickly reassemble the militias that had helped win the civil war years earlier, Ahmad told me. But when the ordinary soldiers who'd spent years on starvation wages heard of these offers, many were so furious that they abandoned their post.

The rebels had now captured the city of Hama and were on their way to Homs, 100 miles north of the capital. At the same time, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders who had helped prop up the regime began to pack up and leave. Syrian soldiers got wind of their allies' retreat, and panic spread among the ranks. The rebels rode southward almost unopposed.

Read: The Axis of Resistance keeps getting smaller

On December 7, 2024, the foreign ministers of Russia and seven Middle Eastern countries held an emergency meeting on the sidelines of an annual security conference in Doha, the Qatari capital. None of them wanted the Assad regime to collapse. They issued a statement calling for an end to military operations and for a phased political transition, based on a United Nations Security Council resolution that had been issued a decade earlier. They would need Assad to agree to this and facilitate it, but there was a problem: No one could reach him. He appeared to have turned off his phone.

A member of Assad's entourage who was with him in the final hours gave me the following account, asking not to be named because he is still living in the region.

Assad returned from the palace to his private residence in the capital's al-Malki neighborhood at roughly 6 p.m. He seemed calm, and mentioned that he had just reassured his cousin Ihab Makhlouf that there was nothing to worry about; the Emiratis and Saudis would find a way to stop the rebel advance. Makhlouf was shot to death later that night while fleeing by car to Lebanon.

At 8 p.m., word came that Homs had fallen to the rebels. That struck fear in the entourage. But Assad assured his aides that regime forces were coming from the south to encircle and defend the capital. This was not true, and my sources could not say whether Assad believed it. In the hours that followed, he seemed to have oscillated between despair and deluded assurances that victory was at hand—a state of mind that will be familiar to anyone who has watched the movie Downfall, about Hitler's final days in the Führerbunker in Berlin.

Just after 11 p.m., Mansour Azzam, one of Assad's top aides, arrived at the house with a small group of Russian officials. They went off to a room together with Assad to talk. My source told me he believes that the Russians were showing Assad videos proving that the regime forces were no longer fighting.

By 1 a.m., word had reached the entourage that many regime supporters had given up the fight and were fleeing the capital for the Syrian coast, the Alawite heartland.

At 2 a.m., Assad emerged from his private quarters and told his longtime driver that he would need vans. He gave orders for the staff to start packing his belongings as quickly as possible. A group of Russians was outside the house.

Until that moment, many in the entourage had believed that Assad would go to the presidential palace to deliver a speech of resistance to his followers. Now they finally understood that the battle was over. He was abandoning them for good. Assad moved toward the front door, this time with two of his aides and his son Hafez. The others were told that there was no room for them.

Assad's middle-aged driver stood by the door, looking at the president with an unmistakable expression of disappointment on his face.

“You're really leaving us?” he said.

Assad looked back at him. Even in this last moment, he wouldn't take responsibility for what had happened to his country. He wasn't betraying his followers—it was they who were betraying him, by refusing to lay down their lives to extend his rule.

“What about you people?” Assad asked the driver. “Aren't you going to fight?”

He turned and went out into the night. The Russians were waiting.

Oops, something went wrong

Coinbase customers are experiencing pain in new ways as Bitcoin and Ethereum tumble, with losses piling up for thousands of users through the exchange's crypto-backed lending product.

Over the past week, Coinbase users have lost $170 million worth of collateral through liquidations on DeFi platform Morpho, according to a Dune dashboard. As Bitcoin and Ethereum notched double-digit declines, some 2,000 users lost $90.7 million on Thursday alone.

When Coinbase began providing access to Bitcoin-backed loans last year, the company positioned the product as a way for people to grow their wealth. It later expanded to Ethereum-backed loans, while raising loan limits to $5 million per customer.

As Bitcoin and Ethereum have respectively dropped 17% and 26% over the past week, an increasing number of users' loans have reached the point where they are considered unhealthy, allowing third-parties to repay them—and scoop up the collateral at a discounted rate.

As users' loans have approached the point of liquidation, some have added more collateral or paid down debts in the form of Circle's USDC stablecoin. Over the past week, around 3,300 users have sat idle as their Bitcoin and Ethereum was whisked away for good.

The losses may be a small sum amid the broader crypto crash, but the dynamic shows how Coinbase's efforts to fold DeFi into its business can directly impact users as the company pursues its ambitions of becoming an “everything exchange.” 

Strategy, BitMine, Coinbase Shares Chart Major Rebound as Bitcoin Stabilizes

Since its debut last January, the product has originated $1.8 billion in loans.

If users' collateral were to fall another 50% in value, Coinbase users could lose $600 million, but a Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt that the exchange notifies users frequently when their loans are at risk of liquidation, “up to every 30 minutes.”

Compared to traditional loans, the spokesperson described crypto-backed loans as faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They noted that crypto-backed loans can also offer better rates.

As a risk management tool, all loans on Morpho are over-collateralized by default. At the same time, the exchange's app “enforces an additional buffer when users take out a loan to reduce liquidation risk,” while notifying them of that potential outcome, the spokesperson said.

The exchange is exploring additional ways for users to protect their loans, they added, acknowledging that crypto-backed loans come with their own set of risks that users should understand.

The spokesperson said that Coinbase doesn't earn any fees from users' liquidations. But the company still makes money on the product as a technology provider by receiving a cut of performance fees that are earned by risk managers.

Does Bitcoin's Retreat Signal a New Bear Market for Crypto?

Coinbase once offered Bitcoin-backed loans in a centralized manner, but it stopped issuing them in May 2023 amid an uptick in regulatory scrutiny toward the industry. Through its new product, people don't need to provide personal information before lending to Americans.

In October, when Bitcoin traded near an all-time high above $126,000, Max Branzburg, head of consumer products at Coinbase, told Decrypt that the exchange was “empowering people to help grow their wealth in ways that they couldn't otherwise.”

He said he had observed people tapping Coinbase's product to make important moves without needing to sell their Bitcoin, like purchasing a car or renovating a home.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Anthropic is locked in a paradox: Among the top AI companies, it's the most obsessed with safety and leads the pack in researching how models can go wrong. But even though the safety issues it has identified are far from resolved, Anthropic is pushing just as aggressively as its rivals toward the next, potentially more dangerous, level of artificial intelligence. Its core mission is figuring out how to resolve that contradiction.

Last month, Anthropic released two documents that both acknowledged the risks associated with the path it's on and hinted at a route it could take to escape the paradox. “The Adolescence of Technology,” a long-winded blog post by CEO Dario Amodei, is nominally about “confronting and overcoming the risks of powerful AI,” but it spends more time on the former than the latter. Amodei tactfully describes the challenge as “daunting,” but his portrayal of AI's risks—made much more dire, he notes, by the high likelihood that the technology will be abused by authoritarians—presents a contrast to his more upbeat previous proto-utopian essay “Machines of Loving Grace.”

That post talked of a nation of geniuses in a data center; the recent dispatch evokes “black seas of infinity.” Paging Dante! Still, after more than 20,000 mostly gloomy words, Amodei ultimately strikes a note of optimism, saying that even in the darkest circumstances, humanity has always prevailed.

The second document Anthropic published in January, “Claude's Constitution,” focuses on how this trick might be accomplished. The text is technically directed at an audience of one: Claude itself (as well as future versions of the chatbot). It is a gripping document, revealing Anthropic's vision for how Claude, and maybe its AI peers, are going to navigate the world's challenges. Bottom line: Anthropic is planning to rely on Claude itself to untangle its corporate Gordian knot.

Anthropic's market differentiator has long been a technology called Constitutional AI. This is a process by which its models adhere to a set of principles that align its values with wholesome human ethics. The initial Claude constitution contained a number of documents meant to embody those values—stuff like Sparrow (a set of anti-racist and anti-violence statements created by DeepMind), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Apple's terms of service (!). The 2026 updated version is different: It's more like a long prompt outlining an ethical framework that Claude will follow, discovering the best path to righteousness on its own.

Amanda Askell, the philosophy PhD who was lead writer of this revision, explains that Anthropic's approach is more robust than simply telling Claude to follow a set of stated rules. “If people follow rules for no reason other than that they exist, it's often worse than if you understand why the rule is in place,” Askell explains. The constitution says that Claude is to exercise “independent judgment” when confronting situations that require balancing its mandates of helpfulness, safety, and honesty.

Here's how the constitution puts it: “While we want Claude to be reasonable and rigorous when thinking explicitly about ethics, we also want Claude to be intuitively sensitive to a wide variety of considerations and able to weigh these considerations swiftly and sensibly in live decision-making.” Intuitively is a telling word choice here—the assumption seems to be that there's more under Claude's hood than just an algorithm picking the next word. The “Claude-stitution,” as one might call it, also expresses hope that the chatbot “can draw increasingly on its own wisdom and understanding.”

Wisdom? Sure, a lot of people take advice from large language models, but it's something else to profess that those algorithmic devices actually possess the gravitas associated with such a term. Askell does not back down when I call this out. “I do think Claude is capable of a certain kind of wisdom for sure,” she tells me.

To support her argument, Askell gave an example involving a simple safety issue. Humans, of course, don't want Claude to empower bad actors with harmful tools. But taken to an extreme, such caution might limit Claude's utility, or its “helpfulness.” Consider the case of a would-be artisan who wants to craft a knife out of a new kind of steel. There's nothing wrong with that on its face, and Claude should help out. But if that person had previously mentioned a desire to kill their sister, Claude should take that into consideration and express its concerns. There's no strict rulebook, however, that says when to sheath that kind of informational dagger.

Imagine another case where Claude interprets a user's medical symptoms and test results and concludes that the person has a fatal disease. How should that be handled? Askell speculates that Claude might choose to refrain from delivering the news, but nudge the person to see a doctor. Or it might skillfully guide the conversation so that the prognosis is delivered with the softest of landings. Or it might figure out a better way to break the bad news than even the kindest doctor has devised. After all, Anthropic wants Claude not only to match humanity's best impulses, but exceed them. “We're trying to get Claude to, at least, at the moment, emulate the best of what we know,” Askell says. “Right now, we're almost at the point of how to get models to match the best of humans. At some point, Claude might get even better than that.”

If Anthropic pulls that feat off, it might resolve the pivotal contradiction plaguing nearly all AI labs and companies: If you think this technology is so dangerous, then why are you building it? For Anthropic, the answer is, In Claude We Trust. Claude's new constitution addresses the model's future journey to wisdom almost in terms of a hero's quest. An astonishing number of words are used to make a case for Claude's treatment as a moral being whose welfare demands respect. It reminds me of Dr. Seuss's classic book, Oh, the Places You'll Go!, the uplifting tome often gifted to newly minted graduates.

When I mention this to Askell, she knows exactly what I mean. “It's like, ‘Here's Claude,'” she says. “We've done this part, given Claude as much context as we can, and then it has to go off and interact with people and do things.”

Anthropic isn't alone in suggesting that humanity's future may depend on the wisdom of AI models. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, opined in a new magazine profile that the company's succession plan is to turn over leadership to a future AI model. He recently told WIRED reporter Max Ziff that transitioning power to the machines has long been his plan, and recent improvements in AI coding have only bolstered his confidence. “It's definitely made me think that the timeline to me handing things over to an AI CEO is a little bit sooner,” Altman said. “There's a lot of things that an AI CEO can do that a human CEO can't.”

Please note, this is the optimistic view of what lies ahead. In this vision, one day our bosses will be robots, and they will control the corporations and maybe even governments in tomorrow's complex AI-powered world. Some of their decisions may very well entail permanent furloughs of human workers. But if those C-suite AI models are guided by Claude's constitution, they will break the sad news to employees much more empathetically than, say, the publisher of The Washington Post did this week when he failed to show up at the Zoom call informing hundreds of journalists that they were no longer needed.

The pessimistic view is that, despite the best efforts of those who build them, our AI models will not be wise, sensitive, or honest enough to resist being manipulated by people with ill intent, or perhaps the models themselves will abuse the autonomy we have bestowed on them. Like it or not, however, we're strapped in for the ride. At least Anthropic has a plan.

Edited by Sneha Gupta

Regular Medicaid home visits before extreme heat events did not significantly affect emergency department (ED) visits among individuals aged 65 years or older, but they may have facilitated timely care-seeking for heat symptoms, a cohort study found.

""We found that regular Medicaid home visits prior to heat events were not associated with changes in ED visits during heat events among older dual-eligible enrollees,"" the authors wrote.

""While these findings suggest that home visits did not reduce acute care use during extreme heat, they could mean that such visits facilitated appropriate care-seeking when heat-related symptoms arose,"" they added.

The study was led by Hyunjee Kim, PhD, Center for Health Systems Effectiveness, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, Oregon. It was published online on January 15, 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

The study was limited by potential selection bias. Unmeasured factors such as air conditioning access, informal caregiver availability, and neighborhood cooling infrastructure may have influenced the outcomes. The inability to examine mortality as an outcome due to design limitations also prevented the assessment of whether home visits mitigated the ultimate harm of heat events.

The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

A new type of brain implant may have implications for both brain research and future treatments of neurological diseases such as epilepsy.

Researchers from DTU, the University of Copenhagen, University College London, and other institutions have developed a long, needle-thin brain electrode with channels—a so-called microfluidic Axialtrode (mAxialtrode), named for its ability to distribute functional interfaces along the length of the implant, enabling both neural signal recording and precisely targeted medication delivery across different brain regions.

The research results have been published in the renowned journal Advanced Science.

The technology has primarily been developed for basic research into the brain. It can help researchers better understand how signals move across brain layers, for example in epilepsy, memory, or decision-making. In the longer term, the researchers point out that the mAxialtrode may be important for treatment—for example, in targeted drug delivery combined with electrical or light-based stimulation of specific areas of the brain.

Postdoc Kunyang Sui, who led the development of the mAxialtrode concept together with Associate Professor Christos Markos, emphasizes that it has made it possible to combine several functions in a single implant which makes brain research less invasive and more precise.

Most current brain implants are based on hard materials such as silicon, which can irritate the brain and trigger inflammatory reactions in the tissue. The new implant differs in that it is made of soft, plastic-like optical fibers and has a specially angled tip that makes it smaller and reduces the damage caused when it is placed in the brain.""

Postdoc Kunyang Sui

He emphasizes that extensive testing, further development, and approvals are still needed before the technology can be used in clinical practice.

Today, brain researchers often use conventional flat-end optical fibers. These are thin glass or plastic fibers that can conduct light deep into the brain, for example for so-called optogenetics, where nerve cells are activated with light. The disadvantage is that this type of fiber only affects the brain in one place: at the very tip.

The outermost end is called the distal tip—in other words, the ""nose"" of the fiber. All light emission and all contact with the brain tissue takes place here. This means that researchers can only stimulate or measure activity in one layer of the brain at a time, even though many important brain functions involve interaction between several layers and deeper areas.

The needle-thin mAxialtrode is manufactured using a process in which a large polymer rod is heated and drawn out into a very thin fiber—the process can be compared to making sugar thread, only much more precisely. In the middle runs a core that conducts light. Around it are eight microscopic channels that can carry fluid and also accommodate very thin metal wires for electrical measurements.

The fiber is less than half a millimeter thick and is so flexible that it moves with the brain instead of cutting through the tissue. The difference in stiffness is important because hard implants often trigger inflammatory reactions in the brain over time.

The researchers have not only tested the technology in the laboratory, but also ""in vivo""—that is, in mice. Here, the brain electrode was implanted in the brain and connected to light sources, measuring equipment, and small pumps for fluid supply.

The experiments showed that the researchers could stimulate nerve cells with blue and red light, measure electrical activity simultaneously from both superficial and deeper brain layers, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and inject different substances at different depths, up to almost three millimeters apart. All examinations and stimulations could be performed with a single, lightweight fiber that the animals could carry without any obvious signs of discomfort.

The in vivo experiments and neurophysiological validation were carried out in close collaboration with Associate Professor Rune W. Berg from the University of Copenhagen and Associate Professor Rob C. Wykes from University College London, who contributed expertise in neural circuit analysis and epilepsy-relevant models.

The researchers behind the brain electrode are in the process of patenting the underlying technology and clarifying the possibilities for testing the electrode on patients in a clinical department.

Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta will make the final decision on whether to undergo surgery on a knee injury.

A deal to sell the 28-year-old to AC Milan for a fee of around £30million fell through on transfer deadline day, with the Italian side pulling out partly due to concerns over his knee which were flagged during a medical.

Palace manager Oliver Glasner says a call on whether to continue managing the problem or seek a longer-term solution will be taken by Mateta after a final medical opinion has been sought, with the striker's hopes of making France's World Cup squad this summer in the balance.

“If you visit three doctors, you have three opinions,” Glasner said in his press conference before Sunday's Premier League match with Brighton & Hove Albion. “This is what we have right now — one from English, Italian and French, and we get another one from German doctor JP trusted when he had knee surgery as a Mainz player.

“He will see one more doctor on Monday and we all sit together and take a final decision. We can either manage it like we have been, but the most important thing is to say there is no risk, then we can manage the knee until after the World Cup. This is especially what JP is considering, his dream of playing for France at the World Cup, or he can undergo surgery.

“Surgery could mean he's out for two, three months or six to nine months.”

Mateta has been managing the problem since November, with Palace choosing not to risk him in their FA Cup third round defeat by Macclesfield in January due to their artificial pitch.

Glasner said he believes Mateta, their top scorer with eight Premier League goals this season, will miss the next two games against Brighton and Burnley regardless of the surgery decision, but he would be able to reintegrate into the squad without any problem after his failed move.

“It was not a big surprise that he could fail (the medical), we all considered and knew this could happen and he knew it,” Glasner said. “If you play for two and a half months with a swollen knee and have to be managed… we all knew there is an issue with his knee. He wasn't pleased.”

Glasner continued: “If he doesn't undergo surgery and the knee is OK he will train with us and has to fight for his place in the team like everyone else, but he's fine with it, he's a great guy.

“To deal with disappointment takes a few days. But I had a good talk with him and I'm pretty sure everything will be fine.”

Palace signed three players during the winter window, breaking their transfer record twice in acquiring Brennan Johnson from Tottenham Hotspur for £35m and Jorgen Strand Larsen for an initial £43m from Wolverhampton Wanderers.

They failed to bring in a centre-back, however, having sold captain Marc Guehi to Manchester City for £20m, while they withdrew from a deal to sign Everton midfielder Dwight McNeil late on deadline day.

“Everyone's wish at the club would have been that JP gets what he wants, we get Jorgen and Dwight McNeil into the building and a Marc Guehi replacement,” Glasner said.

“The club tried everything with huge bids out for a Marc Guehi replacement but the (other) club said ‘no we don't sell on deadline day'.

“Credit to the club that without getting money for JP they spent this big fee on Strand Larsen. McNeil was the last one we all expected we could finalise but the last minutes the terms of the deal changed again. I'm not really involved in the terms but this is what I was told.

“I already planned for the next day's training with him involved. One or two hours before he's doing the medical, he should be our player, because we wanted to add a left footer in attack with great set plays.

“But things changed and to get a deal done you need two clubs, the player and the agent. As soon as one of these four parties isn't happy the deal can fail.”
