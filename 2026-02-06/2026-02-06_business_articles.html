                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Truth Social account of President Donald Trump on Friday morning removed a racist image showing former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama portrayed as apes after outrage over the post. The depiction of the Obamas, posted late Thursday from Trump's official Truth Social account, was included in a video clip pushing a conspiracy theory about voting machines during the 2020 election. The White House initially defended Trump's post when asked for comment on Friday morning, but the sole Black Republican senator quickly called for Trump to remove the post. "This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King," press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement earlier Friday. "Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public," Leavitt said. Hours later, the post was deleted from Trump's Truth Social account. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a White House staffer erroneously posted the video and that it since had been taken down. In addition to showing the Obamas as apes, the full video shows other animals bearing the faces of prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Trump is depicted in that video as a lion. The Obama Foundation did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump's opponents may seek to make the post an issue for the midterm election in November, though it's still nine months away. Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress have expressed worries that they will not be able to retain their slim majorities in both the House and Senate in November's election. The NAACP, in a post on X, said: "Trump posting this video — especially during Black History Month— is a stark reminder of how Trump and his followers truly view people. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who is Black and a close ally of Trump's, blasted the image. "Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House," Scott wrote in a post on X. "The President should remove it," Scott wrote. Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is considered at risk of losing his seat in the House of Representatives in November's election, criticized Trump's post, saying on X, "The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered." Democratic elected officials quickly called on other Republicans to condemn the post. "They represent the best of this country. Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder." "Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual? Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry," Jeffries wrote, referring to the Senate majority leader. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., in a own post on X, said, "This kind of Jim Crow-style dehumanization is pathetic and a disgrace to the office."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legacy automakers General Motors and Ford Motor have lost billions of dollars on EVs and are pulling back partly because of the loss of a federal tax credit and lackluster consumer demand. Even Tesla, which pioneered the EV industry, is facing pressure. It was surpassed by Chinese automaker BYD in EV sales as the Elon Musk-led brand lost its appeal and market share in Europe this year, while BYD ramped up exports there and around the world. Tesla also last week canceled its two oldest, lowest-selling electric vehicles to repurpose an American plant for humanoid robots. After helming the electrification movement for years, Musk increasingly appears focused elsewhere, especially on robots, driverless taxis and his artificial intelligence company, which he combined with Space X in what was the biggest merger in history. Meanwhile, global market share for Chinese brands has jumped nearly 70% in five years, and many experts see a threat to U.S. automakers, including the anticipated entrance of Chinese brands into America. There's fear among global automakers that Chinese rivals like BYD and Geely could flood global markets, undercutting domestic production and vehicle prices. The U.S. has taken a protectionist approach by implementing 100% tariffs on imported EVs from China, but Chinese automakers have made inroads across Europe, South America and elsewhere. "The Chinese auto industry presents an existential threat to the traditional [automakers]," said Terry Woychowski, a former GM executive who serves as president of automotive at engineering consulting firm Caresoft Global. Concurrently, saturation in China's domestic market is driving automakers to expand aggressively into global markets." China's growth has been fueled by government funding for companies as well as a culture of innovation and speed the country has instilled in its workers, experts said. While China has grown, Detroit's "Big Three" automakers — GM, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis, which is no longer based in the U.S. — have collectively fallen from a global market share of 21.4% in 2019 to an estimated 15.7% in 2025, according to S&P Global Mobility. That compares with China's largest automakers BYD and Geely, which have grown from a less than 3% market share to an estimated 11.1%, according to S&P Global Mobility. China's most recent announced expansion is to Canada, a relatively small vehicle market that removed 100% tariffs on imported vehicles from China amid a trade dispute with the Trump administration. That follows the rapid growth of Chinese automakers in lower-income, less established regions that have historically been growth markets for U.S. automakers, such as South America, India and Mexico. "The shift to electric has made it easier for them, because they've got the right products," said Al Bedwell, U.K.-based expert and director of global automotive powertrain for GlobalData. Bedwell said China wanted to wean itself off oil since it doesn't have vast amounts on its own. "It saw an opportunity to be a leader," he added. GlobalData forecasts Chinese EVs will continue to grow globally to roughly 6.5 million units by 2030, followed by nearly 8.5 million in 2035. That includes continued expansion in the U.S., where a few China-made vehicles such as the Buick Envision have been imported in recent years. "Breaking into the U.S. market successfully and sustainably is not an easy accomplishment; it takes time, investment, patience and the willingness to make product mistakes but improve them until you get it right. It is expected that some Chinese automakers will have that blend and eventually look to participate in the U.S. market," said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. Brinley noted it took Japan's Toyota Motor from 1957 to 2001 to reach a 10% market share, while South Korea's Hyundai Motor reached 10% after 26 years in 2022. "How quickly they connect with consumers and which automakers lose volume or share to the new competitor remains to be seen." It called on Congress and the Trump administration in December to prevent Chinese government-backed auto and advanced battery manufacturers from gaining entry to produce in the U.S. "Automakers doing business inside the United States face geopolitical and market pressures from China that are a direct threat to America's global competitiveness and national security," John Bozzella, CEO of the alliance, said in a message to a U.S. House of Representatives select committee, citing unfair, anticompetitive trade practices and intellectual property theft. U.S. automakers spent billions of dollars developing and launching EVs under regulations and incentives from the Biden administration that have largely been undone by the Trump administration. That deregulation opened the doors for automakers to de-emphasize all-electric vehicle plans. GM and Ford alone have announced more than $27 billion in write-downs recently due to their retreat on EVs, including canceling new models and lowering production of current ones. Jeep maker Stellantis on Friday announced a 22 billion euro ($26 billion) hit from a business turnaround plan that includes pulling back on electrification and reintroducing V8 engines to U.S. models. U.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.2% during the fourth quarter. GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Wednesday that the Detroit automaker, which has largely become a regional player in North America, isn't abandoning EVs but is right-sizing to natural demand instead of attempting to appease regulators. When asked about the expansion of Chinese automakers, Jacobson said GM "can hold our own" but that it needs to be on a level playing field — rehashing that he thinks U.S. tariffs should work to offset subsidies Chinese companies get from Beijing. And therefore, we've got to be ready," he said during a Chicago Federal Reserve automotive conference in Detroit. The automaker's earnings from China fell from around $2 billion annually in 2018 to a second consecutive year of losses in 2025 as China grew its own auto manufacturing. GM's crosstown rival Ford is taking a different approach. It has largely scrapped plans for large EVs in exchange for a next generation of smaller models that CEO Jim Farley believes will be the company's saving grace against Chinese automakers. Farley, who has been complimentary of Chinese automakers at times, said the new platform will be a simple, efficient, flexible ecosystem to deliver a family of affordable, electric, software-defined vehicles. "This is a Model T moment for the company," Farley said last year. "We really see, not the global [automakers] as a competitive set for our next generation of EVs, we see the Chinese. Domestic EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Saudi-backed Lucid Group — both exclusively producing vehicles in the U.S. — are facing profitability and sales challenges. Tesla's Musk has been warning about Chinese automakers for years, saying in 2023 after the rise of BYD that such companies will "demolish" global rivals without trade barriers. Musk has historically positioned Tesla as a technology company that also sells cars despite that the vast majority of its revenue comes from car sales, leasing and repairs. He took it a step further on the company's most recent quarterly earnings call, saying that Tesla is ending production of its Model S and X vehicles and will use the factory in Fremont, California, to instead build Optimus humanoid robots. They only represented about 3% of Tesla's sales in 2025, with the company continuing to offer the Model Y, Model 3 and Cybertruck. Musk believes China will once again be the company's main competition in its newest humanoid robot venture. "China will definitely be the tough competition as there's no two ways about it," Musk said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa on Friday said the automaker plans to move forward as one company amid speculation that it would be better off selling brands or splitting up after disappointing results. "It makes all of sense to stay together. His comments come hours after the company announced 22 billion euros ($26 billion) in charges from a business restructuring that includes pulling back on electrification plans and reintroducing V8 engines to U.S. models. Filosa described the actions as an "important strategic reset of our business model, with the only intention to put our customer preferences back at the center of what we do globally and in each regions." Stellantis' stock plunged more than 20% in Milan and New York markets. Filosa on Friday did not specifically rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of 14 auto brands that includes U.S. brands Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, as well as Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically. "We want to really manage our brands in the sense to provide to them the products and the technology that our customers, that are now at the center of our strategic reset, will tell us that they want and they need," he said. Filosa said additional information about the company's plans moving forward will come at a May 21 investor day. Friday's announcement comes days after Stellantis executives met with the company's U.S. franchised dealers at their annual National Automobile Dealers Association conference with a message that the automaker planned to grow sales across its U.S. lineup of brands, according to two dealers who attended the meeting. The majority of Friday's announced charges — 14.7 billion euros — are related to realigning product plans with consumer preferences and new emission regulations in the U.S. The automaker also canceled its dividend for 2026 and issued a 5 billion euro nonconvertible hybrid bond. The charges related to EVs follow General Motors and Ford Motor announcing billions of dollars in similar expenses due to pullbacks in plans for all-electric vehicles. Stellantis said it anticipates a net loss for 2025. For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit rise in its adjusted operating income margin. "While charges were expected, the amount comes in above F ($19.5B) and GM ($7.6B). Expect shares to trade meaningfully lower today as a result. We continue to believe STLAM is a show-me-story. In the US, the company has lost substantial market share given high pricing and a perceived lack of product investment," RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said in a Friday investor note. Filosa on Friday called out mistakes by former company leaders more than he has since he succeeded Carlos Tavares as CEO in June. Tavares, who was ousted in December 2024 amid disagreements with the Stellantis board, in a book last year reportedly said that the group's French, Italian and U.S. operations might have to be split amid pressure from its main stakeholders. It's been just over five years since Stellantis was created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, declining from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame. Stellantis' global market share has fallen from 8.1% in 2020 to an estimated 6.1% last year, according to S&P Global Mobility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Voyager Technologies CEO Dylan Taylor said two years would be an "aggressive" time frame for space data centers and that cooling remains a problem for the developing technology. While SpaceX has the heavy lift rockets to bring components to space, Taylor told CNBC's Morgan Brennan that the lack of a cooling solution to transfer the heat remains a major barrier. "So essentially, all heat dissipation has to happen via radiation, which means you need to have a radiator pointing away from the sun to do that." Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long touted a future with data centers in space and highlighted the build-out as a primary reason for combining his rocket company SpaceX and his AI startup xAI this week in a deal valued at $1.25 trillion. Voyager, which went public in June, is widely known for its Starlab project that is set to replace the International Space Station, which is slated to be retired in 2030. Taylor said the company is on track to meet its 2029 launch goal for the project, which it's working on with Palantir, Airbus and Mitsubishi. Voyager already has its own cloud compute device on the ISS. President Donald Trump's plans to boost defense spending and revamp the country's space program have helped lift interest in space technology investing over the last year. The highly anticipated SpaceX public offering, expected later this year, has also stoked investor interest. Last year, a wave of space tech companies went public as the IPO market reopened following a yearslong drought. That path, however, hasn't always been so rosy for the sector. Voyager's stock has lost more than half of its value since its debut, while rocket maker Firefly Aerospace has shed nearly two-thirds in value since its August public offering. Taylor said Voyager is poised to help lead the charge on data centers in space, helped by its laser communication tools. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Melania, 55, was working as a model at the time, and her life changed dramatically as she became a high-profile businessman's wife and eventually first lady — as did her style. Take a look back at Melania's fashion evolution, from her days walking red carpets to her political life. Melania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles. When she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins. Before her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show. She paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles. A full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice. Melania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump. She wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments. Black dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006. At the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes. Melania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump. Melania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress. At the premiere of "Nine," Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes. Melania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. Melania's gray dress for her "Good Afternoon America" appearance had a professional feel. The fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. When Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code. The jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace. After Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on "Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015." Lauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling "two narratives" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye. But after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because "she was trying to say something with more storytelling" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC. For the RNC, Melania wore the "Margot" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles. The dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past. Melania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves. The silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady. "It was so curated," Rothman said of the look. "It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory." Ralph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist. Braillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term. In 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said "I really don't care, do u?" In her book "I'll Take Your Questions Now," Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to "fake news" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported. Melania dined with members of the royal family at Winfield House in June 2019. She wore a red Givenchy cape dress, a silhouette favored by royals like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Melania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit. She wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels. When the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble. But when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print. "Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes," Rothman said. Melania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022. For the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors. A black Chanel bag completed her look. Melania appeared at the Republican National Convention in July after being largely absent from Trump's campaign. She attended in a blazer and coordinating skirt designed by Christian Dior. "From the red shoe to the red suit to the brighter hair on the stage, there's just more of a power punch of intention with that story than what she was wearing before she was in that role and was in her 20s." Melania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024. The gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg. It was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics. Melania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white. "It's a huge fashion moment," Rothman said of Melania's hat. Melania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side. The first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel. In September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt. The Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past. She wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style. At the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting "Melania." Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon shares sunk more than 9% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel. Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively shed more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as "sentiment contagion takes hold," Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC. Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning. "We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race." Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. "With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment," the analysts wrote in a research note. "We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT." Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as "staggering" demand for the iPhone. "The bet is becoming binary," Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. "Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong." — CNBC's Annie Palmer and Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.

Elon Musk revived the age-old question this week with a bleak take of his own. "Whoever said 'money can't buy happiness' really knew what they were talking about," the billionaire CEO wrote on X on Thursday with a sad-face emoji. The post quickly went viral, racking up more than 92.8 million views and sparking reactions about whether wealth actually improves life. Cuban's point cuts against the idea that wealth itself is a cure-all for dissatisfaction — and he's speaking from experience, ranking 372nd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated net worth of $9.62 billion as of Friday. Academic research shows there's only so much wealth can do to boost happiness. David Bartram, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Leicester, told Business Insider's Roya Shahidi on Thursday that while wealth and happiness are linked, the relationship comes with sharply diminishing returns. "Once you've got a few million, anything extra is meaningless for happiness," Bartram said. For the ultrawealthy, he added, happiness is more likely to come from a sense of purpose — "having a sense that you've done some good in the world, and that you've treated people around you with care and kindness." Other research suggests the income-happiness link may stretch further than previously thought, though not without caveats. In a November appearance on Nikhil Kamath's "People by WTF" podcast, he said the pursuit of money alone was unlikely to bring fulfillment. Be a net contributor to society," Musk said, adding that wealth tends to follow naturally when people focus on building useful products and services — rather than chasing money for its own sake.</p>

AI is forcing the Big Four to rethink how work — and workers — are defined. The line was reminiscent of news from January, first reported by Business Insider, that fellow Big Four firm Deloitte is overhauling job titles for all of its professionals. From June 1, simple, traditional job roles like "consultant" and "associate" will be replaced by more specific descriptors that better reflect the work Deloitte carries out for clients.

"We're not changing our titles," Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, clarified to Business Insider in an interview. Still, PwC's approach to talent echoes the industry shift. What that "skills, not titles" ethos means is that, as employees apply for projects, move around the organization, and progress in their careers, it's their portfolio of skills that will set them apart rather than a job title, said Seals-Coffield. The first is a firmwide emphasis on 30 key skills: 15 AI-centric and 15 human-centric, both of which are "extremely critical" to PwC's success, Seals-Coffield told Business Insider. "We're not necessarily asking someone to digest all 30 skills in one year," said Seals-Coffield. Different levels will focus on different skills, she added, but taken together they represent what PwC believes will matter most as AI reshapes client work. On the human-centric aspect, this includes applying critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated outputs and using empathy to understand client dynamics. The technical skills include AI fluency and AI simulation, which Seals-Coffield described as simulating the work now being completed by AI to ensure staff understand why and how it's done. Seals-Coffield said she recently watched a demo of an agent giving feedback on presentation skills this week that was "pretty brutal, but in a really good way." You're still not being specific about the ROI. The Learning Collective is introducing new programs for two groups feeling the impact of AI acutely: engineers and junior workers. In a move away from traditional roles associated with the Big Four, PwC has launched a new tech engineering career track, aimed at attracting and recruiting more technical talent. For junior staff, PwC has launched the Associate Discovery program — a drive to expose new employees to AI from day one. By the time associates land on their first major engagement, PwC wants them to have experience building agents, working with AI, and developing the human skills required to make those tools useful. The firm has also reduced the number of offices where consulting associates can begin their careers, from around 60 down to 13, said Seals-Coffield. The Learning Collective is trying to change that by encouraging learning beyond courses, such as bringing team members along to meetings or getting teams to discuss what they've learned that week with each other. "They will find that we are asking them more and more to engage in these learning experiences in their intact team," Seals-Coffield said. "Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience," she added.</p>

Meanwhile, Canadians are doubling down on what Canada has to offer. Statistics Canada said domestic travel in the second quarter of 2025 was 10.9% higher than a year ago. Over a third of the domestic travel was characterized as holiday, leisure, and recreation trips. "We're going to choose to not go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever," Trudeau said. The decline in Canadian tourists can affect US businesses that rely on them to prosper. "We spoke with Canadian customers who told us point-blank that they were hesitant to cross due to the current political tension," Kyle Daley, owner of supermarket Soloman's Store in New Hampshire, said in the report. Daley added that "When our neighbors stay away, our margins disappear and in groceries those margins are vanishingly small to begin with." Karaguesian said the effects would be felt more by local economies. That can include Michigan, Vermont, and other areas along the border. "The longer-term ramifications are that our economy will suffer and that businesses will close and people will lose their jobs, which is just terrible," Becca Brown McKnight, a city councilor in Burlington, Vermont, previously told Business Insider. "We are really lucky in Vermont to have a robust small business economy; a lot of these are mom and pop shops, and this is people's entire livelihood." Gretchen Whitmer said that the state and Canada's "economies are intertwined" in response to a question at a fireside chat about why Canada should trust the state "in the midst of a chaotic tariff policy." Sandy Levine, the owner of some restaurants in the Detroit area, said in a WDET article published in June that "We certainly still see people from Canada and from other countries, but it's not nearly to the degree that it was maybe like six months ago or a year ago." Karaguesian thinks that if the White House had simply focused on arguing for tariffs to rebuild the US manufacturing sector without harming Canada, then the administration "could achieve the same thing and not have put off so many Canadians through a mixture of pride and fear."</p>

Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a "sell everything" mindset. "A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities," Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday. Heavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit but both stocks recovered to end 0.4% lower. Australia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses to end 0.8% higher ahead of a general election this weekend. Cryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk. The selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week. "Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived," Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals. Hansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves. He added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market. The latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes. Analysts expect the volatility to continue as investors reassess their positions after a period of aggressive positioning and stretched valuations across risk assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States has warned it may impose sanctions on Algeria over its decision to purchase advanced Russian-made Su-57 fighter jets, raising fresh questions about Africa's defence ties with Moscow amid heightened global geopolitical tensions. Robert Palladino, head of the US State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, said Washington was concerned by reports that Algeria is acquiring new military equipment from Russia, according to remarks made during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Militarnyi reported. Algeria, one of Africa's largest military spenders alongside Egypt, confirmed in 2025 that it had agreed to purchase the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57E stealth fighter to replace ageing aircraft in its air force. Palladino said the United States could respond by invoking the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), legislation designed to discourage major defence purchases from Russia. He added that Washington was using existing diplomatic tools “to protect our interests and stop what we consider unacceptable.” Algeria has sharply increased defence spending in recent years, driven by instability across the Sahel, Libya, and the wider Mediterranean, as well as its ambition to assert greater regional influence, particularly amid perceptions of a US tilt towards Morocco. Its armed forces operate one of the continent's most sophisticated air forces, with a fleet that includes Su-30MKA multirole fighters, MiG-29s and advanced Russian-made air-defence systems such as the S-300. Russia has maintained close military ties with Algeria, supplying key equipment across the country's air force, navy, and ground forces. Each aircraft is to be equipped with the latest L-265VE “Khibiny-U” electronic warfare systems, including the corresponding command and control indicators, alongside orders placed with Russia's Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies for onboard systems Washington has increasingly warned African governments that large-scale arms purchases from Moscow could trigger sanctions under CAATSA, a stance that has already complicated defence procurement decisions in several countries.

SpaceX moved to cut off Russian access to Starlink this week, disabling connectivity over Ukraine while maintaining a whitelist of approved Ukrainian terminals. The new measure has spurred excitement among Ukrainian officials and pundits close to the war, who have said that Russian troops were increasingly using Starlink to guide long-range strikes and coordinate forces. Serhii "Flash" Beskrestnov, an advisor on drone warfare for Ukraine's defense ministry, wrote that the move had disrupted Russian ground assaults in some frontline areas.

But Ukrainian troops have long raised concerns that Moscow's troops were acquiring terminals from the black market, with Kyiv saying it's found the US tech in downed reconnaissance drones. Pressure for SpaceX to curb Russian access reached a fever pitch last month, as Ukrainian defense officials said they'd begun seeing Starlink terminals on long-range strike drones. Cutting off the Kremlin's forces from Starlink, however, has been more complicated than simple geofencing. Ukrainian troops also use Starlink, so disabling access in contested regions would have affected Kyiv's operations. That appears to be changing with the new whitelist. For the last few days, Ukraine's defense ministry and Telegram influencers have been calling on troops to quickly register their terminals under the country's DELTA battlespace management system. Businesses must apply for access via an online portal, while civilians were told to bring all their private Starlink terminals to administrative centers along with a national ID. The whitelist is updated every day, said Ukraine's defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. The connectivity changes have also been reported to cut Starlink access for terminals traveling faster than 75 kilometers per hour, or roughly 46 miles per hour, in an effort to shut down attack-drone guidance. Rybar, a prominent Telegram channel run by a Russian military blogger, wrote on Thursday that the Starlink restrictions would "temporarily slow down" Moscow's combat operations. The channel, which had until this week been calling on its followers to donate or fund Starlink terminals for Russian troops, also wrote on February 1 that the Kremlin needed to start developing "domestic equivalents" of communication systems for the front lines. "If the system is hacked, such a list would give Russian troops the geolocation of numerous Ukrainian Armed Forces positions," he wrote in a separate post. Roman Alekhin, another Russian military blogger, raised concerns on Thursday that Russian forces may not have ready alternatives to Starlink and might instead temporarily rely on fiber optics for frontline communications. Ukrainian Telegram channels, meanwhile, hailed the outage as a potential significant blow to Russian forces. "The enemy even installed terminals on tanks to adjust fire online," Sternenko wrote. Still, some Ukrainian forces also reported being affected by the outages. "It was found out from our troops that there were problems with those who did not promptly submit lists for private Starlinks," wrote Beskrestnov, the Ukrainian drone advisor. Fedorov, who was confirmed as Ukraine's new defense minister last month, thanked SpaceX and Musk for introducing the Starlink measures. 'Thanks to the first steps taken in recent days, no Ukrainians have been killed by Russian drones using Starlink — and that is priceless," he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China will allow duty-free imports of selected products from South Africa under a trade agreement currently being finalised, signalling Pretoria's accelerating pivot toward alternative global markets as relations with the United States remain strained. “This trip comes at a time when South Africa is pursuing an objective of market diversification and export growth,” the ministry said, without disclosing which sectors would benefit. China is already South Africa's largest single-country trading partner, overtaking the European Union in 2023. South African exports to China are dominated by minerals and agricultural products, sectors that could gain significantly from reduced tariffs in the world's second-largest economy. In August last year, Washington imposed 30% tariffs on some South African products, raising concerns within Pretoria that thousands of jobs could be at risk. Tensions between South Africa and President Donald Trump's administration have escalated over the past year across diplomatic, trade, and geopolitical sectors, disrupting what was once a stable transatlantic relationship. Pretoria has since sought to renegotiate trade terms with Washington, but progress has been uncertain, fuelling fears over South Africa's continued preferential access to US markets and its future standing under US-backed trade frameworks. Against this backdrop, deepening trade ties with China reflects a broader recalibration of South Africa's foreign economic policy toward non-Western partners, including China, the broader BRICS bloc, and parts of the Global South. While uncertainty remains over whether the US will fully reintegrate South Africa into its preferred trade arrangements, Pretoria appears increasingly determined to diversify its options—and reduce vulnerability to unilateral trade shocks.
