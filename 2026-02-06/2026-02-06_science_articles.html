Before final publication, the manuscript will undergo further editing. Please note there may be errors present which affect the content, and all legal disclaimers apply. Accurately predicting the activity of a chemical in each bioactivity assay based on its already known properties is extremely useful in drug development. Unfortunately, we discovered that many assays in widely used assay-activity benchmark datasets directly relate to cell health and cytotoxicity. Many other assays intend to capture a more specific phenotype, but their active compounds impact cell count, while inactives do not. In both cases, counting cells achieves unexpectedly high performance in these benchmarks, making them less useful for discerning whether additional properties, such as phenotypic profiles (mRNA or Cell Painting), provide additional useful information on bioactivity. To accomplish this goal, we recommend filtering benchmarks to exclude such assays and including a cell-count baseline. Using a benchmark with 24 protein-target assays, we confirm that models leveraging Cell Painting image-based profiles outperformed the baseline cell count model. We propose several other practical recommendations for benchmarking machine learning models for predicting bioactivity and assessing the added value of mRNA, protein, or image-based profiles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenClaw is an open-source artificial-intelligence agent designed to assist users with everyday tasks, such as sending e-mails and managing their calendars.Credit: Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty OpenClaw is an AI agent capable of performing tasks on personal devices, such as scheduling calendar events, reading e-mails, sending messages through apps and using the Internet to make purchases. Most of the popular AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot works by interacting directly with user prompts, whereas agentic AI models such as OpenClaw can carry out actions autonomously in response to instructions. Improvements in the capabilities of large language models have made it possible to create more versatile AI tools, researchers say. “OpenClaw promises something especially appealing: a capable assistant embedded in the everyday apps people already rely on,” says Barbara Barbosa Neves, a sociologist who focuses on technology at the University of Sydney in Australia. “It's a kind of chaotic, dynamic system that we're not very good at modelling yet,” he adds. Although agents can act autonomously on the platform, Cohney says that many posts are shaped in some way by humans. Users can choose the underlying large language model that will run their agent and give it a personality. For example, they could ask it to behave like a “friendly helper”, he says. But agents do not possess intentions or goals and draw their abilities from large swathes of human communication. “It is still worth studying because it tells us something important about how people imagine AI, what they want agents to do and how human intentions are translated, or distorted, through technical systems,” she adds. Joel Pearson, a neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that when people see AI agents chatting between themselves, they are likely to anthropomorphize the AI models' behaviour — that is, see personality and intention where none exists. The risk of that, he says, is that it makes people more likely to form bonds with AI models, becoming dependent on their attention or divulging private information as if the AI agent were a trusted friend or family member. “As the AI models get bigger and more complicated, we'll probably start to see companies leaning into achieving that sort of autonomy.” ArXiv says submissions must be in English: are AI translators up for the job? ‘It means I can sleep at night': how sensors are helping to solve scientists' problems ‘It means I can sleep at night': how sensors are helping to solve scientists' problems Aligning with world-class university standards, CityUHK (Dongguan) has now launched a global recruitment campaign for faculty members The University invites individuals from diverse backgrounds to apply for faculty positions in this field The University invites individuals from diverse backgrounds to apply for faculty positions in this field An essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.

In 2014, after Russian-backed forces took over Donetsk, the unofficial capital of Ukraine's Donbas region, Voropayeva and many of her colleagues chose to leave, setting up their university in exile. The university's first new home was in Pokrovsk, a small city about 60 kilometres away from Donetsk, still in the Donbas region, where it already had a sister institution. In April 2022, two months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the university moved again. The city council offered several buildings to turn into offices and classrooms. How the invasion of Ukraine is affecting Russian expat researchersThe European nation is not the only place where war or political unrest has forced universities and their staff members into exile. Others around the world, including in Sudan and Myanmar, have also had to relocate. How the invasion of Ukraine is affecting Russian expat researchers More than 50% of DonNTU first-year students are from the Lviv region. Illya Khadzhynov, an economist and vice-rector for scientific work, was last in Donetsk in July 2014, when his institution, Donetsk National University (DonNU) was taken over by the pro-Russian separatist government. It authorized the university's roughly 700-km move west to a former jewellery factory in Vinnytsia, in the west-central region of Ukraine, a building with no lecture theatres or laboratories. But with support from international donors, including US$350,000 from the International Renaissance Foundation, a Ukrainian charity founded by Hungarian-born US philanthropist George Soros, DonNU refurbished the factory building and re-established a campus there, including labs for research and teaching. Khadzhynov estimates that about half of the university's 12,000 students moved to Vinnytsia. Serhii Radio, a chemistry researcher at DonNU, says that back in 2014, not everyone felt able to leave everything behind. Those who did took only “the most necessary things that you can carry in two hands”, he says. He was unable to take any lab equipment that might stand out at the checkpoints they had to pass, controlled by armed pro-Russian separatist groups. Their current 650-strong staff includes 180 who have been displaced from other cities. Now I work on ways to help the country's soil heal The war itself has brought the added problem of electricity cuts, which make it difficult for Radio to perform experiments for his studies using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. “An experiment needs more than eight hours, and this is a very long time for electricity,” he says. At DonNTU, Voropayeva says: “Laboratory equipment has been in storage since 2022 or was destroyed during shelling.” The university is gradually restoring its labs, and a pooled centre for collective use of scientific equipment enables Ukrainian academic institutions to share resources, sometimes on a fee-for-service basis. Salaries have become catastrophically low — Voropayeva says that a full-time associate professor receives the equivalent of €300–350 (US$350–410) a month, which is comparable to pre-war wages but now buys considerably less because of rising prices. Another challenge for both institutions has been the move from the heavily industrial Donbas, where many institutions excelled in applied science, to a region with a different industrial history. The war in Ukraine has also forced some Russian academics into exile. Smolny was the first liberal-arts college in Russia, awarding degrees from 2003 and following a broad multidisciplinary curriculum. But in June 2021, Bard College was declared an “undesirable” organization by the Russian prosecutor's general office and all ties were cut. Last semester, they ran 23 courses and now offer a two-year associate-degree programme accredited by Bard College. Fedchin says that about 50% of its students taking non-degree courses are in Russia. He and his family relocated from Russia to France in March 2022, where, as well as teaching maths and statistics for Smolny Beyond Borders, he has a temporary teaching position at the University of Lorraine in Nancy. It is currently under way in Kenya, Jordan, Bangladesh and parts of East Africa. “Some of the universities are still not working today,” says Ibrahim. Others, including the University of Khartoum, have adopted online teaching and have set up centres in regional universities to host exams and crucial practical training in subjects such as medicine. Engineer Gihad Ibrahim had to leave his home in the Sudanese city of Khartoum North when civil war broke out.Credit: Mashreq University This includes the private Mashreq University, which specializes in applied science, engineering and medicine. In Cairo, Mashreq University rented an entire unused college building. Student numbers have also decreased by 45% owing to drop-outs and temporary suspensions of study. “Many students were not able to pay their fees because we had 300–400% inflation after the war and lots of people have lost their jobs,” says Ibrahim. The college has tried to provide scholarships where it can. After two-and-a-half years working this way, Ibrahim says with pride and determination that they are sustaining teaching “regardless of the difficult situation”. Most of the universities in conflict zones have also been destroyed and looted.

Stigma is a massive barrier to seeking help for alcohol dependence in academia. Two researchers share their experiences with Adam Levy.Your browser does not support the audio element.Download MP3See transcript Wendy Dossett tells Adam Levy why the stigma of having an alcohol dependence in academia can be a huge barrier to seeking help. “We're not supposed to be struggling with cognitive issues, mental health problems, damaging ourselves in the way that somebody with an alcohol addiction is doing.” Dossett, now an emeritus professor of religious studies at the University of Chester, UK, says that as an early career researcher she saw alcohol as the fuel to her academic life, driving her creativity and making the social elements of academic life easier to navigate. When, in her 30s, a colleague suggested she might need help, Dorsett says she felt a “mixture of horror and absolute gratitude that somebody had the courage and care for me”. She went on to research the spiritual elements of recovery from addiction, which she says is less talked about in academia than, say, depression and anxiety. Victoria Burns, a social work scholar at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, founded Recovery on Campus Alberta after telling her dean that she had an alcohol dependence. He told her she was the first academic to disclose in his 26-year career, prompting her to research other deans' experiences of faculty members disclosing addiction and recovery. This is the fifth episode of Off Limits, a podcast series exploring topics that are often perceived as taboo in the workplace, including religion, bereavement, activism and sizeism.

Hello, I'm Adam Levy, and this is Off Limits: Academia's Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers. Alcohol and academia have a complex relationship. On the one hand, in many countries and contexts, consuming alcohol is incredibly normalized. In fact, as we heard in last week's episode, people who don't drink for religious reasons can struggle to find social spaces in academia that don't centre around drinking. And so it's perhaps unsurprising that many academics can struggle with alcohol dependency. But while alcohol consumption may be the norm, coming to terms with and openly discussing harmful relationships with the substance remain incredibly taboo. Over her career, she's investigated a number of questions related to faith. In the last decade or so of my career, I turned my religious studies methodologies onto the phenomenon of recovery from addiction. This is a topic close to Wendy's heart. And so we spoke about her journey with alcohol. But looking back on my student days and my early career, alcohol was a terrible problem for me. Much like lots of people who suffer with substance issues, I had low self esteem. I felt that I didn't fit in, and substance use enabled me to function for many years. I experienced sexual abuse at the age of 21 and I reacted to that experience by drinking more, and my problems with alcohol escalated. The way you describe it is, of course, with hindsight. Did you have this kind of understanding at the time that alcohol was something you were using to cope with these other things in academia and in your personal life? So alcohol felt like it was a fuel to my academic life. A lot of it is about networking, and, you know, making friends with the right people, and, you know, being able to tell people your ideas in a confident manner. I probably had some kind of inkling that it was also causing me trouble, but that kind of remained at an unconscious level, really, all through my 20s. Were there any particular moments which, at the time, or perhaps in hindsight, really highlighted, ”Okay, this is becoming a problem.” And actually getting in the way of the things you thought it would be helping for? There were some spectacular ones and some just the daily grind of waking up every morning or coming round, I should say, every morning and trying to get myself ready to go to work. Those were the kind of day in, day out realizations that there was there was something wrong. For example, I chaired an international symposium in blackout. You know, it doesn't mean I was unconscious. At the end of it, a very good friend of mine, a colleague, said to me that they thought I needed to get some help, and that they were worried about my drinking. Were you surprised by this, I suppose almost intervention from a colleague? It was an intervention, and this was well over 20 years ago now, and I I look back on that moment with a mixture of horror and absolute gratitude that somebody had the courage and care for me, really, to actually say that they thought I had a problem. You know, who would want to admit that they were out of control? You know, especially in academia, perhaps there is a great stigma around mental health problems. We're supposed to be making contributions moving the frontiers of knowledge forward. We're not supposed to be struggling with cognitive issues, mental health problems. We're not supposed to be damaging ourselves in the way that somebody with an alcohol addiction is doing. So, yes, the stigma is a massive barrier to help-seeking. I think we've made such great strides with, you know, especially depression and anxiety. Is that something you kept separate from your colleagues? I didn't mention it to any colleagues for many years. Because academia is such a drinking culture, you've got a few options if you don't drink. But over time, I became more comfortable, more secure in my own recovery status, and I think that gave me a little bit of confidence to raise it with peers and to say, ”Yeah, I don't drink. But it was a whole other thing to bring that up with senior members of the university. And I was anxious about many different things. I was anxious about causing myself issues with promotion or respect from senior colleagues, or, you know, trust from senior colleagues. And can I ask, I mean, you mentioned that at academic events with alcohol, at first, you found it very difficult to be open about how you were navigating alcohol. Were these events also challenging, just in terms of yourself and in terms of being in the context where drinking alcohol is not only the norm, but maybe also expected? I don't know many people in recovery who are fully comfortable in an environment where there's lots of alcohol, or lots of drunkenness. I find it quite difficult sometimes being around drunk colleagues. But certainly in the early days of my recovery I found it incredibly difficult. Not necessarily because I might be tempted to drink, but that is always a possibility, but because I just found it so stressful to be in that environment. Academia has historically at least functioned around drinking. Also other drugs as well, especially the kinds of drugs that enhance cognitive performance in the short term. In order to be competitive in an academic environment, there is a sense that people feel they need to have some kind of enhanced performance in order to deliver. I felt as though this research really was me finding my academic voice, actually, and finding the contribution that I could make to the recovery world, and to the academic study of recovery. You know, recovery from substance misuse is different to recovery from other kinds of mental health issues. And of course, the recovery scene is not homogenous. There are many, different ways of recovering from alcohol or other drug use. Those all derive from a spiritual notion that the person suffering with the addiction, their condition is a state of powerlessness, and their willpower is not sufficient to overcome the problem. So therefore they must access a higher power. So I was, I was trying to show how members of 12 step programs are spiritual innovators in the way they they think about higher power. I mean, you're speaking to me now. You also spoke to Nature for a feature published back in 2025. It's been a long and difficult journey to become more open. What should academics listening do to better support their their colleagues who are going through challenges with dependency? I'd love colleagues to become much more informed about addiction, and in particular, much more informed about recovery, and to know that recovery is possible. There can often be a tendency to judge people who struggle with addiction. I'd love it if more academics knew about the recovery-friendly university movement, and that means they're actively seeking ways to support both staff and students who have substance issues. They're saying that we are proud to have people in recovery within our university community. I think communities are the places in which recovery can happen in a in a community where there are people in recovery and they're known and it's seen that they're welcomed and they're celebrated, then that creates its own contagion. And it means that other people can find their way to recovery as well. So universities are actually really places where we can seed recovery for the wider community. We'll hear from her again in a later episode, as we discuss the struggles and stigma surrounding fertility. Next up, though, I spoke with another researcher, Victoria Burns, associate professor of social work at the University of Calgary in Canada. She is the founder and director of Recovery on Campus Alberta. We'll get to her work with this organization in just a moment. But first we discussed how Victoria began to reflect on her relationship with alcohol. And then I didn't drink my first year of university. But then my second year, I did an exchange program to France. And that's where I really started to drink in earnest. I always held down jobs and was an A student. But I also started to drink more, and it was actually at 19 when a boyfriend gave me an ultimatum to stop drinking because I would black out and end up in risky situations. No, so I did a lot more research. I said bye to the boyfriend, and thought that he was just being too controlling. And during that period, there were many, I guess, increasingly dangerous situations that I was in related to my drinking. So I like to say every time I drank, something bad didn't happen, but anytime something bad happened, alcohol was involved. You just kind of mentioned it in passing there. But did it shake you up quite a bit to end up having to seek, you know, medical support in this situation? I did seek medical support earlier on at my university. And after some particularly bad binges I went to the student wellness and no one really gave me supports related to my drinking. They just told me I needed to drink less and were quite judgmental. And when I ended up in the hospital, that last time, I ended up seeing three therapists, actually. It was the abstinence-based one who had recommended I try AA. And then I found a woman's meeting. And I had tried, actually, 14 months before my final bottom to go to rehab, but they wouldn't accept me because I was quote, unquote, too organized as a full time student. So on paper, things looked okay, but I was really dying inside. And now, after you did successfully go to AA and transition away from alcohol, how did you approach discussing, disclosing this with academic colleagues and with supervisors, for example? So I didn't disclose to anybody in my academic circles, except for a couple of senior academics. I did tell not to tell anyone noise in recovery, because it could negatively affect my job prospects. I didn't want to do anything that would negatively affect my career. So I really led a double life in recovery for the first five years. And I am a social work scholar. And this became increasingly unmanageable as well. What do we know about how researchers who struggle with substance dependence, disclose or don't disclose? I was researching harm reduction and housing first at the time. So I ended up disclosing to my Dean. And he gave me a green light to conduct research in this area, because he said, out of his 26-year career, he never had anyone disclosed to him about being in recovery. However, there were many incidents where faculty members were showing up to the classroom intoxicated or concerns about people's drinking or drug use, but Deans and service providers not really knowing what that process was to help them. And several of the participants actually said, ”Well, as long as they're bringing in grants, no one really cares.” And it's also problematic, because like me, I have never met anyone in recovery in academia, and I was a student for 14 years. So one of the recommendations of this work was to shift more into this vulnerable, authentic leadership and role model. You know, recovery is not something to be ashamed of. It's something that's actually a source of pride, often committed to service and helping others. I find it almost paradoxical, because, on the one hand, alcohol is so visible in academia. You know, there's so many contexts in academia, at least in certain countries where alcohol and also alcohol abuse can be quite visible. But then there seems to be a silence around both the misuse of alcohol and the recovery from that misuse. Yeah, there definitely is a paradox around that. I had been sober for about two years at the time, and I successfully passed my defence and my two supervisors, the tradition was to have some champagne, and they had known me as a drinker as well. And then the third time I said no, thank you. He said, ”Come on, it's not like you're an alcoholic.” And I took the glass and I pretended to drink it and then I threw it away, but it was such a common kind of innocuous tradition, seemingly. But these are the kind of things we need to, I realize, educate people on how to be a recovery ally. Because if I had not been as secure in my recovery, I think, you know, that could have been a really a shakier moment than it was. And I'm just really grateful that I was able to kind of push through that and not pick up. But these things happen all the time. Yeah, so another recommendation from that research was to start a peer support group for faculty. I was really committed to creating a recovery-friendly workplace. So if someone did put their hand up and say, ”I'm struggling with substance use,” that they would get the help and be met with compassion and non judgment. There wasn't any recovery programs on campuses until 2019. And it was actually a student at University of British Columbia who started the first campus recovery program in Canada. And it was through that work, I was able to to hire a part time coordinator, and now we have 10 going on, 11 peer support meetings a week. We've grown from that $8,000 to over $5 million. With this in mind, what's your hope for the academia of the future, and academia where, instead of maybe exacerbating people's issues around substances, we provide a more supportive environment? I don't want a student or a staff member to feel the shame and stigma of being in recovery or of seeking help. The visibility of people in recovery, I think, is very important, because there's still such a narrow perception of what it means to, well, A, have an addiction, and B, what it means to be in recovery. So allowing folks who go to treatment, they have that community on campus where they have a safe place to go, that we're normalizing the idea that you could have a really enriching, fun, joyful university experience without the need to be intoxicated. There are many people who can use substances and safety, but there are also many people who can't. And up until recently, they didn't really have that space where they could fully be themselves and be around others on similar paths. Victoria Burns there, joined, as you might have heard towards the end of the interview, by her cat Charlie. Community can be so important for each and every stigmatized subject we've touched on in this series, from coming out as LGBTQIA+, to navigating research with a disability. And this is equally important for the subject of next week's episode: navigating grief. Until then, this has been Off Limits: Academia's Taboos, a podcast from Nature Careers.

Fracturing is unavoidable and threatens the reliability and functionality of materials. Therefore, regulating the propagation of cracks in a predictable and ductile manner is of paramount importance. Herein, we exploit the properties of topological mechanical metamaterials (TMMs) as a versatile mechanism to guide cracks unidirectionally and turn fracturing of lattices made of brittle materials into ductile events. Inspired by quantum topological states, recent discoveries of TMMs have uncovered varieties of unconventional mechanical phenomena, ranging from one-way wave propagation to polar elasticity. We show that polarized floppy modes occurring in TMMs lead to strongly asymmetric stress fields localizing around the notch tips, leading to ductile one-way fracturing, in sharp contrast to classical theories of fractures in brittle materials. Our work demonstrates the universality of this fracture unidirectionality feature, which is protected by TMM's bulk topology, and provides robust solutions in programmable fracturing for a broad class of materials and structures.
