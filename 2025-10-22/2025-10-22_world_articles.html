                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military has attacked and destroyed another boat in its ongoing and controversial fight against what it says are drug-trafficking activities. Previous attacks have hit seven vessels in the Caribbean and killed at least 32 people. It marked a departure from previous strikes, which have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, where the US has deployed an extraordinary military presence. In a brief video released by US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a small boat, half-filled with brown packages, is seen moving along at sea. “Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and Hegseth gave no additional details other than the video on X. Donald Trump announced what appears to have been the first strike on a boat on 3 September, releasing a brief video of the attack. The attacks have prompted widespread condemnation, both from civil liberties groups and South American nations. The president confirmed last Wednesday that he had authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela, but not what the agency would be doing. White House officials have tried to justify the increasing number of strikes with a dubious legal theory that claims the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organizations” with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardian has reported. Until this month, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force. White House officials have also sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article two powers, which allow the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements. The self-defense argument revolves around Trump's designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act. But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing. The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC), the Guardian has previously reported. Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Trump's second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has stated that he is opposed to Israeli annexation of the West Bank. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The Israeli legislature advanced a bill calling for Israel to annex the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, amid U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel. The Knesset approved legislation for Israel to apply “sovereignty” over the Palestinian territory in a preliminary vote, narrowly passing with 25 members for and 24 against. Israeli media reports that members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party, Likud, were opposed to the legislation, viewing it as a way to snub Netanyahu as his government already takes moves to annex the West Bank. Indeed, the vote was timed to coincide with a visit by Vance and members of Trump's top Middle East advisers, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who does not officially hold a position but has been conducting business in the region on behalf of the administration. “ I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. It's not gonna happen,” Trump said late last month, ahead of Netanyahu's address at the UN General Assembly in New York City. Notably, however, Trump has been providing Israel with ample military resources and diplomatic cover allowing Israel to carry on with its current illegal de facto annexation of the West Bank. Further, in his first term, Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that significantly advanced Israel's quest for annexation. “As longstanding supporters of Israel's security and Palestinian aspirations for statehood, we are unified in our opposition to unilateral measures by either party that undermine the prospect of lasting peace through negotiations to achieve a two-state solution. That includes any steps by Israel to annex territory or expand settlements that prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state,” they went on. In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Kushner claimed that Gaza and the West Bank are too different culturally to link as a state — without acknowledging Israel and the U.S.'s role in separating the two territories. “You need both places to be functioning — in a good way, where they can thrive before you can connect them,” he said. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Employees at the National Institutes of Health learned in an email on Friday, in the midst of a hiring freeze, that their prestigious environmental health sciences research center has a new director. Yet Jay Bhattacharya, a political appointee who oversees the 27 institutes and centers under NIH, named Kyle Walsh, an associate professor in neurosurgery at Duke University, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). In an email dated Oct. 17, Bhattacharya informed NIH employees, who were told they may periodically check their emails for updates about the shutdown, that Walsh's appointment was effective Oct. 10. The NIH director — who President Donald Trump said would work with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to restore the agency to “a Gold Standard of Medical Research” — did not mention that Walsh calls Vice President JD Vance “one of his closest friends” or that Vance officiated at his wedding. Woychik had overseen the research and management of NIEHS as deputy director for nearly a decade before he was tapped to run it. His predecessor, world-renowned toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, had spent nearly 20 years in top leadership roles at the largest division of environmental health research at EPA before she was picked to lead NIEHS in 2009. It is unprecedented to appoint someone at such an early stage of their career who lacks the type of leadership experience required to manage a major research institution, current and former federal scientists say. And all directors of NIH institutes, except for the director of the National Cancer Institute, who is a political appointee, go through a rigorous screening and vetting process after an open search. If there had been an open search in this case, several scientists told Inside Climate News, Walsh wouldn't have made the first cut. Woychik had just been reappointed to another five-year term, Berg said, so Walsh's hire didn't have anything to do with the sitting director's performance. “The fact that he was appointed without any sort of search is worrisome,” he said, adding that “his main credentials seem to be his connections with JD Vance.”Vance has been buddies with Walsh since they attended Yale University, and he stayed at Walsh's house when he was finishing up his book, Hillbilly Elegy. Walsh said Vance is “one of my closest friends” in an interview with a charity that supported his brain cancer research. Birnbaum, now a scholar in residence at Duke, heard rumors before Trump's inauguration in January that Walsh was going to be picked to head NIEHS, she said. “Many people at Duke and elsewhere seemed to know about it.” Walsh has been telling his colleagues and others at Duke for almost a year that he would be getting this job, a scientist at NIEHS, who requested not to be named for fear of retaliation, told Inside Climate News. Neither Walsh nor the Duke press office responded to requests for comment. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said Walsh brings broad experience in environmental and neuro-epidemiologic research from his leadership roles at Duke University. Hilliard did not respond to questions about Walsh's experience leading a major research institute with hundreds of employees, or charges that he was hired due to his political connections. The vice president's office did not respond to a request for comment. Research by NIEHS-funded scientists, for example, laid the groundwork for EPA's air pollution rules and showed that the pesticide chlorpyrifos poses unacceptable neurodevelopmental risks to children, prompting EPA to conclude that the insecticide is not safe for use on food. The person who had been hired to lead an NIEHS program on climate change and health, Birnbaum said, “was fired immediately” after Trump returned to office. And anything that had to do with equity was cut from NIEHS programs and research grants, she said, even though disadvantaged populations are most impacted by environmental hazards. As a scientist who focuses on the genetics of brain cancer, Walsh has “no scientific qualification to head an institute that is focused on environmental chemicals and disease,” said Jerry Heindel, who spent decades at NIEHS, where he led the agency's Division of Extramural Research and Training until he retired in 2016. Heindel reviewed the scientific research Walsh published and could find no papers on environmental chemicals. The primary NIH center that best aligns with Walsh's background focuses on cancer and genetics, but it is based in Maryland. The main campus of NIEHS is in Durham, North Carolina, not far from Walsh's previous position at Duke. Several scientists told Inside Climate News they suspect Walsh did not want to move. For Berg, the former NIGMS director, it's not just Walsh's lack of qualifications that are worrisome. “The administration has certainly been pretty direct about their feelings about climate change and its potential consequences, and the reality of it occurring at all,” Berg said. With at least 11 NIH agencies currently being led by interim directors, some scientists worry the positions, once occupied by the nation's most accomplished scientists, will go to unqualified political appointees. “Everybody's worried they're going to come down and close us, because this administration seems very hostile to environmental health and environmental issues,” said the NIEHS scientist. “Anything having to do with the environment and environmental health has been absolutely obliterated by this administration.” If people care about making America healthy again, the words and actions of this administration are not matching that goal, the scientist said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for US Senate in Maine, said on Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner, in an Associated Press interview, said that while his campaign initially said he would remove the tattoo, he chose to cover it up with another tattoo due to the limited options where he lives in rural Maine. Platner added that he had never been questioned about the tattoo's connections to Nazi symbols in the 20 years he has had it. Questions about the tattoo come after the recent discovery of Platner's now deleted online statements that included dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans. Platner has apologized for those comments, saying they were made after he left the army in 2012, when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The oyster farmer and first-time political candidate is mounting a progressive campaign against Republican Susan Collins, who has held the Senate seat for 30 years. The crowded Democratic primary field includes two-term governor Janet Mills. Platner has resisted calls to drop out of the race. He has the backing of senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills. Platner planned a town hall for Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giants quarterback Russell Wilson called his former head coach Sean Payton “classless” following comments he made after the Denver Broncos' 33-32 victory over New York on Sunday. “Classless… but not surprised… Didn't realize you're still bounty hunting 15+ years later through the media,” Wilson wrote on X followed by some laughing emojis and the hashtag #LetsRide, a catchphrase he became known for during his time with the Broncos between 2022 and 2023. New York's backup quarterback was perceived to be responding to comments made by Denver head coach Payton after the Broncos' dramatic fourth quarter comeback to beat the Giants on Sunday. “They found a little spark with that quarterback,” said Payton, referring to rookie passer Jaxson Dart who replaced Wilson as the Giants' starter after the team began the season 0-3. “I was talking to John Mara not too long ago and I said: ‘We were hoping that that change would've happened long after our game,'” Payton added. Wilson responded by referring to the “Bountygate” scandal which involved Payton's New Orleans Saints using a bounty system between the 2009 and 2011 seasons where players were paid bonuses for, among other things, hard hits and deliberately injuring opposing players. In 2012, Payton was suspended for one year without pay after the NFL found that he was aware of the bounty system and, though not directly involved with it, had done nothing to shut it down. The Broncos went an underwhelming 11-19 in Wilson's starts over two seasons, failing to make the playoffs in either of them. By benching Wilson, Denver made sure that he couldn't get injured and was consequently able to save money on his release. Speaking to reporters at the time, Wilson said he was approached by the team after the Broncos' Week 8 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and told if he didn't move back his injury guarantee in his contract that he'd be benched. They came up to me at the beginning of the bye week – Monday or Tuesday – and told me that if I didn't change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I'd be benched for the rest of the year … I was definitely disappointed about it,” said Wilson. “I wasn't going to take away injury guarantees,” he said. I've played for 12 years and that matters to me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An aerial view shows destroyed residential houses burning after shelling by Russian forces in Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Aug. 31, 2025. At first, the pictures went viral for another reason. Two Ukrainian civilians were shot dead and another injured on the roadside, the victims of another Russian war crime that was as everyday as it was horrific. Ordinary, peaceful residents of the city of Pokrovsk — the very people Russia claims to be “liberating” in its war of destruction in the Donbas, who held on to life in their homes for a year after their city became a war zone — snuffed out in an instant. After more than a year as the rock upon which Russia's territorial ambitions in Donbas were broken, cracks are opening in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, and the end may finally be near. The videos were just the latest in a series of geolocatable snippets of drone footage, filmed both by Russians and Ukrainians, showing Russian assault troops deep inside the urban area of Pokrovsk, far beyond the southern neighborhoods where fighting had previously been seen. These images are, in turn, the raw data used by open-source mapping projects that give all of us an understanding of where the front line is. This was not the first time Russian soldiers had broken into Pokrovsk. That incursion into Pokrovsk was on a smaller scale. Although "Fortress Pokrovsk" stood firm through August, September, and early October, the viability of Ukraine's hold on the city was becoming more fraught with every passing week. That drone saturation, as the war has shown us, only becomes denser with time — and Pokrovsk was no exception. For the brigades still holding sectors inside the city and in neighboring Myrnohrad, this meant that each and every logistics and rotation run in and out of the city had a higher chance of being hit by a drone than the last. For Ukraine to survive in this war — and eventually to win it — the staging of brutal but favorable attritional battles around fortresses like Pokrovsk remains crucial. This, in turn, provided more and more openings for Russian infantry groups — having already honed their infiltration-based assault tactics over 2025 — to once again creep past Ukrainian lines into the southern neighborhoods of Pokrovsk. Here, I use the word creep very deliberately, having watched what these assaults look like in real time on Ukrainian drone feeds all across the front line. We are not talking about dramatic breakthroughs, but about groups of Russian soldiers sometimes numbering no more than two or three, sometimes even just single infantrymen advancing alone, using tree lines and other pieces of cover to slowly make their way through the Ukrainian kill zone. Most of them don't make it, but those who do dig in, await reinforcements, and then often begin ambushing Ukrainian soldiers, including drone teams, in the rear. If they make it inside the dense, built-up area of a city like Pokrovsk, with high-rise buildings and endless opportunities for cover and concealment, clearing them out becomes an almost impossible task. The situation reminds me in many ways of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, where Ukrainian forces managed to defend the flanks of the city to prevent a complete encirclement — moments of fierce, heroic fighting — but ultimately, Russian fire control over the roads in and out, combined with advances inside those cities and a refusal by the Ukrainian command to order a timely withdrawal, led to chaotic retreats, unprepared defenses beyond the city, and, worst of all, avoidable losses. But unlike in Bakhmut or Avdiivka, where ground lines of communication were a gauntlet of more traditional direct and indirect fire from nearby Russian positions, Pokrovsk faces its own final act in an environment of asphyxiating drone saturation at a level we have not seen in previous battles. Given this, I worry that the Ukrainian command's common reluctance to order a timely retreat could have even deadlier consequences. For journalists, volunteers — let alone soldiers and residents of the area — the looming fall of Pokrovsk is hard to accept, especially with memories from just over a year ago, when it was a buzzing city in the rear with everyday life still intact, still so fresh. But to end on a positive note, it's worth remembering that this time last year, when Russian forces first reached the outskirts of this proud mining city, few expected Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk to last until the end of the winter, let alone another year. For Ukraine to survive in this war — and eventually to win it — the staging of brutal but favorable attritional battles around fortresses like Pokrovsk remains crucial. The defense of this city over the past year has eaten up immense Russian resources in equipment, ammunition, and especially manpower, and has bought Ukraine precious time at a critical moment when support for Kyiv from its most powerful international partner, the United States, has disintegrated. With that in mind, the ability of Pokrovsk and the Ukrainian brigades defending it to endure for so long will be remembered for centuries, even if anything like the life it once knew never returns to its ruined streets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recently, a whale shark was spotted at several places along the coast of Israel, including Tel Aviv.Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images The first sighting of a fin cutting through the waters off an Israeli beach in late September caused panic. Lifeguards cleared the sand, cautious after a fatal shark attack earlier this year. Within minutes, Aviad Scheinin, chief scientist with the Apex Marine Predator Lab at the University of Haifa, received a message on WhatsApp. He squinted at a shaky cellphone video, intrigued. Usually, Israel sees dusky and sandbar sharks, which tend to aggregate around the warm outflow from power plants. What they sent back confirmed Dr. Scheinin's suspicions: an enormous fish, its skin ornamented with a distinctive pattern of white dots. “It was 100 per cent a whale shark,” he said. Never before had such an animal come to these waters. Israel usually sees dusky sharks or sandbar sharks, like this one swimming near a snorkeler off the coast of Hadera in 2022.Ariel Schalit/The Associated Press Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world, but are filter feeders that largely consume plankton and krill. A moment of meaning had arisen from the depths. “Religious people said it was a sign from God. I would say it was a sign from nature,” said Yaara Grossmark, co-founder of Sharks in Israel, a local non-profit. Soon, the shark had a name: Ofek, or Horizon. Its arrival felt like the sea foretelling “something is coming,” Ms. Grossmark said. Instead, the shark brought a new reminder of the bitter hatreds that war – and, now, tenuous peace – have done nothing to ease. Less than a month after the whale shark first surfaced, it was dragged onto a beach in Gaza – where the UN has frequently described famine-like conditions over the past two years – and carved up for meat as a large crowd watched. Hundreds posted on the Sharks in Israel Facebook page. Writing in Hebrew, they called Gazans criminals, barbarians and savages. In Gaza, too, the whale shark's arrival was freighted with meaning. Their consumption is considered halal but not kosher, and Israel has banned all forms of harvesting. Protected by law, sharks have become a subject of avid local interest. In 2014, Ms. Grossmark helped to launch a project collecting citizen observation of sharks and rays, which later became Sharks in Israel. The group has recorded behaviours not previously documented and organized tours in hopes of making what animals remain a local attraction. Doug Saunders: For those caught in the middle, the path to Middle East peace is a long one Across the Mediterranean, more than 40 per cent of shark and ray species are near extinction. In Gaza, though, sharks have long formed part of the local diet. “I have personally caught a shark that weighed only half a tonne,” said Mr. Elwan, who is known locally as Rambo. “But we had never seen one this big.” It measured at least five metres long – Mr. Elwan believes it was twice that – and weighed well over a tonne. Whale sharks are native to warmer waters, including the Red Sea. It appeared off Gaza just after noon on Oct. 17, as Mr. Elwan fished in calm waters. “Suddenly we saw a huge body moving slowly towards us. He tied a rope around the shark's head, hoping to bring it in. On shore, a huge crowd gathered and helped to drag it ashore, where it was killed and its meat carved off. War has badly damaged fishing in Gaza, Mr. Elwan said. Sewage has poured into local waters, worsening earlier leaks that had already damaged fish stocks. “This has forced fishermen to rely on rare and large catches when possible,” he said. In Israel, meanwhile, those who study and follow sharks are still reckoning with what happened. But, he added, “living in our region is complicated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many people want to prevent another meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump, and until it takes place, numerous leaks and fake news stories will continue to appear, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said, commenting on rumors about the possible cancellation of the Moscow-Washington summit in Budapest. "From the moment the Peace Summit in Budapest was announced, it was obvious that many would do everything possible to stop it from happening. The pro-war political elite and their media always behave this way before events that could prove decisive between war and peace," Szijjarto wrote on Facebook (banned in Russia, owned by Meta, a corporation considered extremist in the country). "It's the same story before almost every European Council meeting, before decisions on sanctions or on the European Peace Facility. Until the Summit actually takes place, expect a wave of leaks, fake news, and statements claiming that it won't happen," Hungary's top diplomat added. The minister did not disclose whom he met with, but prior to his trip, he indicated that he wanted to discuss preparations for Trump's visit to Budapest. Hungary attaches great importance not only to the upcoming US-Russia summit, which may represent a major step toward resolving the conflict in Ukraine, but also to US-Hungarian negotiations, hoping to focus them on economic issues. On October 16, Trump, following a phone conversation with Putin, said that they had agreed to meet in Budapest soon. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov also confirmed that Moscow and Washington would begin preparing for a new meeting between the two leaders, which may take place in the Hungarian capital. In response, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ordered the formation of an organizing committee to facilitate the summit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has "won certain property" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands. "I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to "property" it seizes through strength of arms. "You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal "with property lines being defined by war and guts." In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering "additional" territory to Putin. "We will give nothing to the aggressor," Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19. Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials. The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. "If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you," Trump reportedly told Zelensky. Trump also said the Russian economy is "doing great." According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was "sick" of seeing these maps. Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback. Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire. "I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. They can negotiate something down the line," Trump added. Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. "We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. On Oct. 20, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Congress was "hitting the pause button," on a Senate bill that proposes to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries that buy Russian oil, amid Trump's planned meeting with Putin. Intercepted calls released by Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) suggest a Russian commander ordering his soldiers to shoot civilians near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. "I hope your brave compatriot, Major Magyar, finally succeeds in knocking out the oil pipeline that feeds Putin's war machine and you get your oil via Croatia," Sikorski told Szijjarto on X. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and Zelensky are meeting in the city of Linkoping, home to the defense company Saab, which produces Gripen fighter jets and other arms. Ambassador Steven Pifer discusses recent U-turn in U.S. President Trump's policy on Ukraine following a phone call with Putin. Pifer says that Trump can still end Russia's war if he starts using leverage on Moscow but argues that, regardless, Ukraine and Europe should assume they will have to manage the conflict without U.S. support. Explosions rocked Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities overnight on Oct. 22 as Russia launched a large-scale aerial attack against Ukraine. Russia attacked Kharkiv with drones on Oct. 22, damaging a kindergarten and killing one person, injuring at least six, local authorities reported. Russian air defenses intercepted 44 Ukrainian drones overnight and into the morning of Oct. 22, including eight over Dagestan, according to Russia's Defense Ministry. Explosions took place at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiești, southern Romania, as well as at Hungary's largest oil refinery in Szazhalombatta. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also do not plan to meet in person in the near future, though they held a "productive" call on Oct. 20, a State Department spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent.</p>

On Tuesday, police confirmed that Nicholas Ray, 28, from Spring, Texas, had been arrested and charged with extortion, written threats to kill and unlawful use of a two-way communication device. This has been ongoing for over a week,” Ms Loomer told The Telegraph. “Over the last week, I have been in frequent communication with Law enforcement in Florida... regarding credible threats made against my life and the lives of several other Jewish and pro-Israel conservatives,” she wrote. Mr Ray had allegedly falsely believed the 32-year-old and other influencers were Israeli agents. Seth Dillon of The Babylon Bee, a conservative Christian satirical news website, author Josh Hammer and New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz were also targeted.

Ms Loomer, who hosts a show called Loomer Unleashed on the video platform Rumble, has become one of the few outside voices that Mr Trump and his team pay close attention to, claiming a series of scalps.

BRATISLAVA, October 22. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico believes that the European Union must do everything for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Budapest to happen as soon as possible if the alliance indeed wants peace in Ukraine.

"If the EU really wants a quick peace in Ukraine, which I do not believe in, it should do everything to make the Trump-Putin meeting happen in Budapest without any obstacles and as quickly as possible. The soonest Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, unhindered and with the EU's full support - that is my official position," he wrote on his page on Facebook (prohibited in Russia due to ownership by Meta, which has been designated an extremist organization).

According to him, "the meeting of the American and Russian presidents in Budapest has not yet been agreed on and there is already clear evidence of efforts to prevent it at all costs. It's a sad thing to see." "I have always said that the EU has turned into a war cabinet, that a significant part of EU member states support the war in Ukraine in the naive belief that it is possible to weaken and defeat Russia this way," Fico asserted.</p>
