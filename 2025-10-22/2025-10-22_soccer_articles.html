                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After failing to get an injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing its short-term rental ban in district and appellate court, the city of Dallas is now asking the Texas Supreme Court to rule in its favor before the FIFA World Cup next summer. More than two years ago, the city began looking at ways to regulate short-term rentals, like Airbnb and VRBO, after some STR owners were not as diligent as others in ensuring their guests did not disturb the neighborhood. That ban sought to limit where short-term rentals could legally operate within the city, zoning out STRs in nearly all but a handful of areas. A new ordinance also placed some guardrails on whatever properties remain after the zoning went into effect. That injunction made it through the court system, where it landed at the Fifth District Court of Appeals. Dallas' latest filing, which clocks in at 4,490 words, says that the previous courts “abused their discretion” in ruling for the injunction and later upholding that ruling. It also asserts that it prevents the city from regulating STRs—the second prong of its response—at a time when the city is expecting an influx of visitors looking for places to stay during FIFA World Cup matches next summer. “Such error should not be allowed to stand on the eve of Dallas taking center stage for a worldwide sporting event—a time when STR regulation will be of utmost importance,” the filing says. DSTRA may have formed as a response to the city's actions, but in the intervening years, it's also become a hub for owner education. Sievers said that the members are now preparing for the World Cup by offering a series of classes for first-time hosts. As for the suit itself, it's not entirely clear how that will pan out. Those against STRs have maintained that they are a lodging use, which are prohibited by city code from operating in single-family neighborhoods. Operators and owners of STRs insist the opposite and argue that the courts have set precedents that block bans by way of zoning. There is a hodgepodge of case law in response to how local governments have sought to regulate the industry. Barring some kind of compromise, it looks like Dallas' new ordinance is destined to be sorted out in court, which may or may not happen before the World Cup begins on June 11. AT&T Stadium will host nine games over the World Cup's 56-day tournament. Dallas' Kay Bailey Convention Center will be the site of the tournament's International Broadcast Center, and teams will also be able to choose from four base-camp sites: Dallas Baptist University, Toyota Stadium in Frisco, University of Dallas, and TCU. They will train at Cotton Bowl Stadium or SMU.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens breakdown the success of Morroco's new generation following their U20 final victory. The result, of course, was a disappointment for Argentina, who have won this trophy more times than anyone else, but not since 2007. And it was a disappointment for South America, both because of home advantage -- the tournament took place in Chile -- and because this age level is seen on the continent as an important conveyor belt towards the senior side. Changes in the game -- better pitches and more protection for talent -- have made it easier for teenage players to shine with even the biggest clubs, and those youngsters do not feature in the tournament because clubs are not obliged to release them. This World Cup, then, has become a relatively random collection of players, those whose services the federations have been able to secure, and quality suffers as a consequence. Not one of that team has yet kicked on to play a significant part in Marcelo Bielsa's senior side. The big question, though: Is there anyone here who might be fast-tracked into next year's senior World Cup squad? And who would seem to have the brightest future? Argentina's captain was the Bournemouth left back, who has already featured in the senior squad for World Cup qualification. He was called up for the last two rounds of the campaign, and in a position where Argentina does not have great strength in depth, he must have some chance of making the team at the senior level next year. The U20 World Cup, however, did not make an especially powerful case for promotion. Plenty will probably depend on whether he can get a regular game over the next few months in the Premier League. Soler is undoubtedly neat, but seems sound and steady rather than inspirational. An answer to Argentina's prayers would be a top-class young center back, which is the area of Lionel Scaloni's lineup that they have not been able to refresh since the Qatar World Cup, and the bad news from Chile was that there would not appear to be any solutions in this U20 side. The attacking midfielder was a huge success. However, his move to Portugal has not yet lived up to expectations -- hence his release for this tournament -- and he has yet to appear in the first team. Prestianni arrived in Chile as a reserve, but took advantage of injuries to become the team's leading creative force. Despite being 5-foot-5, he has a big personality and plenty of talent. Delgado wins possession, takes responsibility, links the play and can provide some quality service to the strikers. When Fernando Gago was Boca coach, Delgado was getting plenty of game time and he used it well. A change of command and the arrival of Leandro Paredes have since limited his opportunities, but now that he has shown his value on the global stage, he should soon be back in first-team contention. Does he have a chance of making the 2026 World Cup squad? Probably not, although getting back in the Boca starting lineup would certainly give him a platform. Their star was the center forward Villarreal. Impressive at the start of the year in the qualifying tournament, he suddenly came to life in the knockout stages in Chile, scoring twice against South Africa and then getting all three in a thrilling 3-2 win over Spain. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. With Millonarios in Colombia, he seems on the verge of joining Cruzeiro in Brazil, although he is attracting interest from Europe. Villarreal had to sit out the semifinal after picking up a needless yellow card in the Spain match. Colombia's resources at center forward lack depth, especially since Jhon Durán lost his way, and so it is not unthinkable that Villarreal could be part of a 26-strong squad next year. However, he would need to win the confidence of coach Nestor Lorenzo through some consistent displays at the club level, regardless of which club he finds himself at. Paraguay senior coach Gustavo Alfaro has a reputation for throwing young players in at the deep end. He clearly has an interesting future and, if he can come up with some strong displays at club level and if Alfaro is characteristically looking to give youth a chance, he may even have an outside possibility of creeping into the World Cup squad.</p>

ATLANTA (Oct. 22, 2025) – The U.S. Under-16 Girls' National Team will travel to England from Oct. 22-31 for a training camp and games at St. George's Park, England's National Training Center, located about 120 miles north of London.

The USA will face its counterparts from England on Oct. 28 and Oct. 31, giving this age group valuable international competition.

All players in this camp were born in 2010 and represent the core of the team that will compete to qualify for the 2027 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. As this will be Katie Schoepfer's cycle, and she is currently in Morocco coaching at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, Ronnie Woodward will be the head coach for this camp and matches.

This year marks the beginning of FIFA's annual staging of FIFA U-17 WWC — as opposed to biannually as it was in the past — and the tournament will be held in Morocco for the next five years.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the U.S. Women's National Team claimed gold in the 2024 Paris Olympics, head coach Emma Hayes has used every camp to cap at least one new player. Five players debuted in the last USWNT camp this summer. “This is really the build towards qualification for next year,” Hayes said. Some players who got a first look in the “experimental phase” now have a chance to make their mark in this cycle. Midfielder Claire Hutton earned her first call-up in the January futures camp. She remembers seeing Hayes laying out the next two years and making clear what was ahead. Now, Hutton is not just a young player navigating her first camps and games with the USWNT, she is a part of building toward some of the biggest opportunities in international soccer. “I do feel like there is a lot of pressure to it,” Hutton said. If you stay consistent, it keeps everybody where their feet are at the moment.” This camp features a mix of World Cup champions like Lindsey Heaps and Rose Lavelle to up-and-coming senior team contributors like Hutton and Ally Sentnor, just two younger players among many on the squad. 1 thing that I say to all these players here is, ‘You're here for a reason, you're not just coming in for shenanigans,'” Heaps said. “‘You're here to make this team better, go and do your thing. Hutton has soaked up that knowledge since arriving at her first camp. The 19-year-old midfielder recalls how it felt playing with Heaps and other USWNT veterans. Hutton's excitement is palpable even now as she reflects on the memory. “It was like, ‘Let's go, the Avengers are coming in. “Just playing with Lindsey and some of the older, more experienced players there was just a level of confidence that I think us less experienced, younger players get when they're on the field, it's just having that backup and knowing that they do trust us with the ball.” Heaps, 31, remembers when she was in Hutton's shoes and afraid to ask for advice. “What Emma has done, bringing in so many young players, less experienced players, the caps we're getting — I think is so crucial,” Heaps said. “What makes a winning team, especially in those tournaments, knowing that you need everyone and you might need a less experienced player that maybe doesn't have more than 10 caps, or players to come in and make a massive difference.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by Naomi Girma, San Diego Wave player Wesley, who is also a prominent figure in fighting hunger in her community, could be the next standout centre-back to break into the U.S. national team. Excel is exactly what she has done—Stanford alumna to NWSL rookie, and now a mainstay in the San Diego Wave backline. “She is always some I looked up to in that position, on the field and off it,” the California native revealed. Despite being agemates, Wesley is a huge admirer of Girma's poise and calmness. “She taught me so much between learning [new things] and things that I already had in my toolshed – it's been kind of fun to put everything together,” she added. The Olympic Winter Games are just a TICKET away! 🏂❄️🎿 Sign-up for reminders of ticket releases and all the latest news of your favourite national Olympic teams and athletes trying to qualify! A post shared by San Diego Wave FC (@sandiegowavefc) To that end, the centre-back has been fundraising for local organisations in a bid to combat hunger in the San Diego community. “But it's also really important for people that aren't in athletics, people that are just fuelling themselves for their daily lives.” Kennedy is also at the heart of other volunteer efforts when time permits. “To see what they are doing with food rescuing and supplying for so many different people, of all walks of life, I think it is just so awesome. In order to succeed at the top level, Wesley believes it is important to have tunnel vision—focus solely on playing, block out the noise. “Staying a little bit tunnel vision in terms of how I want my image to be perceived and who I can impact in that way. “I think having a good sense of self and a good idea of who you are as a player and person, and how your circle views you as, is the most important thing.” Wesley isn't just chasing an international debut; she is extending her mark as a footballer—on the pitch and in her community.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have brought back the very early U.S. women's national team roster predictions, ahead of head coach Emma Hayes' first foray into World Cup qualifiers next year. Through 25 matches in charge so far, Hayes has provided 24 players with their first cap for the senior national team. This month, she could make it 25 if San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley gets the nod. The former Chelsea manager has been clear all year that her mission was to identify a core group to build around (an idea we tackled back in April on “Full Time,” too), but player absences due to injury, pregnancy and rest have made reading between the lines of her roster selections a difficult task. “I want to put players in the frying pan and I want you to feel the heat,” Hayes said in April, following a pair of friendlies against Brazil. “This camp was always about expanding and experimenting (with) that player pool. I really feel like that is becoming so clear to me on which players I think are really ready for us right now, which ones are not.” Even October's roster for the upcoming matches against Portugal (twice) and New Zealand does not provide a clear picture. Chelsea center back Naomi Girma is still working through another calf injury. The Athletic attempted this same game for the 2023 World Cup, trying to predict Vlatko Andonovski's final roster — and, out of curiosity, I went back to check our work from our final version compiled in April 2023. We otherwise aligned on our misses: Aubrey Kingsbury in as the third goalkeeper option, no Becky Sauerbrunn due to injury, nor Tierna Davidson as a center-back option, and failing to foresee the surprise first call-up for Savannah DeMelo. Goalkeepers (3): Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United), Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals) Midfielders (7): Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (KC Current), Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns) Goalkeepers (3): Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United), Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals) Midfielders (7): Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (KC Current), Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns) On this week's episode of “Full Time”, Meg said she thought she was providing a spicy take that Swanson felt like “the least certain name” of the forward pool to her, before discovering that Tamerra had actually opted to leave both her and Wilson off her 23 picks entirely. If not building partnerships with other players, at least getting settled into Hayes' style.” Current health versus potential future return also played a factor in our other difference, with Meg opting for center back Tierna Davidson over Orlando Pride's Emily Sams, in part because of her lack of significant minutes under Hayes despite her club performance. “That, to me, is showing that there is this core group taking shape under Hayes, or at least she has been consistent enough in terms of what she has said, her call-ups, and what we have seen out of their play — that even this far out, as of right now, you can mostly predict a roster.” Melanie Anzidei also checks in following U.S. Soccer's 2031 bid event, in which the federation formally announced Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica as fellow hosts of the 2031 World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gyoekeres celebrates scoring Arsenal's fourth with Gabriel Justin Setterfield - UEFA - Getty Images But we need to speak about the best back line in Europe. Much attention will be given this morning to the front end of Arsenal's team. Last night's 4-0 Champions League rout of Atletico Madrid epitomised their attack: set pieces paying off, Gabriel Martinelli scoring again, Viktor Gyokeres (‘Call me Bane') applying the coup de graces. Atletico held out for almost an hour, but once the dam burst at the Emirates, they were swept away in all of 11 minutes. They registered with me last week when The Athletic's alternative Premier League table explained how Arsenal had conceded six fouls in seven league games inside their own defensive third. That's extremely impressive in a division so fast and furious. Here are the numbers that matter in late October: Arsenal have played 12 times across three different competitions. They've conceded three times and, as yet, not once in Europe. Chelsea's seemingly untouchable record of 15 concessions in 38 Premier League fixtures in 2004-05 might not be quite as untouchable as it seems. And it's the ice-cold nature of Arsenal's defensive framework that is making them look a bigger threat than ever — on multiple fronts. We can legitimately classify yesterday in the Champions League as a goalfest. Forty-three finishes in nine matches — no kidding — was an average of almost five a game; basically unprecedented. Barcelona and PSV scored six (PSV gave Napoli such a battering that the Italians are still looking for their teeth). Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Inter helped themselves to four. Ironically, the only blank contest was between Kairat and Pafos, two teams who absolutely did not want a goalless draw. They're lodged in the league stage's elimination places. But the flood of strikes set TAFC the challenge of trying to pick the best of them — and I had to go with Newcastle's second in a 3-0 win over Benfica, polished off by Harvey Barnes after this beast of an assist from goalkeeper Nick Pope, below, set him on his way. Real Madrid versus Juventus is the best of tonight's match-ups, and it got James Horncastle thinking and writing about one of football's more eye-catching transfers: Cristiano Ronaldo from the Bernabeu to Juve for a cool £86m ($115m) in 2018. Ronaldo claims he is owed more than £17m. News arrives from Adam Crafton that the controversial plan to hold a La Liga clash between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami has been shelved, for now. That sounds like a euphemism for “overwhelming opposition in La Liga's own back yard”. Only yesterday, Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois took a dig at La Liga, accusing it of “manipulation” by trying to prevent footage of player protests against the Miami proposal from being broadcast over the weekend. We'll wait to see what its next move is. All that can be said for sure is that La Liga and others pushing league matches in foreign climes have sorely underestimated the strength of feeling about their intentions. The postponement is a win for democratic process. You'd be forgiven for thinking that Major League Soccer is a little predictable. Lionel Messi finished the regular season as leading goalscorer. Lionel Messi, as Tom Bogert rightly says, will be named the league's MVP. But away from he who will not grow old, MLS has enjoyed some healthy underdog spirit. Philadelphia Union's ride to the Supporters' Shield was unexpected. San Diego's inaugural campaign could yet end with an MLS Cup. Vancouver Whitecaps' performance is their best on record, which is why Mr Bogert picked out Jesper Sorensen as his coach of the year. What Tom found challenging was choosing a single MLS XI, given that a solitary line-up with positional limits makes it tough to paint the full story of the season. He thinks the league would do right by naming two or three line-ups. My own suggestion to MLS ahead of tonight's play-in round (and I've banged this drum before) would be to slim down the post-season. MLS: Play-in round: Chicago Fire vs Orlando City, 8.30pm/1.30am; Portland Timbers vs Real Salt Lake, 10.30pm/3.30am — both MLS Season Pass/Apple TV. Back in the day, footballers at all levels would be told to “let them know you're there early”. This was code that meant: plant a first tackle on your opponent with force somewhere between broken bones and amputation. Pafos' Joao Correia went old school in following that advice to the letter last night, poleaxing Kairat's Luis Mata, above, and earning a red card after all of three minutes. Correia is a Cape Verde international, so the Hulk Hogan ‘Big Boot' could be coming to a World Cup venue near you soon… He is now lead writer of The Athletic FC newsletter. He previously worked for the Yorkshire Evening Post as its chief football writer.</p>
