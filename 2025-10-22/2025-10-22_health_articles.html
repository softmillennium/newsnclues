                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this report led by first author Osama Mohiuddin from Ascension At Agnes Healthcare, with corresponding author Rafi Aibani from Charleston Area Medical Center, researchers describe a rare medical case in which Hodgkin lymphoma is presented as a pancreatic mass. The findings emphasize how easily this type of cancer can be misdiagnosed, potentially delaying effective treatment. Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that typically affects the lymphatic system and usually appears in lymph nodes. Its appearance in the pancreas is exceptionally rare. This case involved a 50-year-old man who experienced low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and significant unintentional weight loss, symptoms frequently linked to pancreatic cancer. Imaging showed a sizable mass in the pancreas, initially raising concern for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer. This result was confirmed through staining techniques. The diagnosis shifted the treatment plan from potential surgery or radiation toward chemotherapy specifically designed for Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient began a targeted regimen known as A+AVD. This rare presentation highlights the challenges clinicians face when diagnosing pancreatic tumors. Primary pancreatic lymphoma accounts for less than 1% of all pancreatic cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma is even more uncommon in this location. Because the clinical signs and imaging findings often resemble pancreatic cancer, a biopsy is essential to ensure the correct diagnosis. These differences, when combined with biopsy results, can guide toward more accurate diagnoses. As treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma continue to improve, especially with drugs like brentuximab vedotin, early diagnosis becomes critical. This case report is a reminder that not all pancreatic tumors are what they appear to be. In rare cases, they may reflect a treatable cancer that responds well to targeted therapy if diagnosed in time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antidepressants can differ widely in how they physically affect the body, including around a 4 kg difference in weight change between certain drugs (approximately 2.5 kg weight loss from agomelatine and 2kg weight gain from maprotiline), confirms a systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet. The authors emphasise that these findings should not deter people from taking antidepressants, which remain vital and effective treatments for mental health conditions. This large-scale systematic review and network meta-analysis combined results from 151 clinical trials and 17 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports involving over 58,000 participants to assess the effect of 30 different antidepressants on the body over an average of eight weeks course of treatment. The study found that antidepressants also differ in their effects on heart rate, with a difference of more than a 20 beats-per-minute difference in heart rate (approximately eight BPM decrease for fluvoxamine and a 14 BPM increase for nortriptyline); and blood pressure, with a difference of over 10 mmHg variation in blood pressure (approximately seven mmHg decrease for nortriptyline and a five mmHg increase for doxepin). The study estimates that some antidepressants (e.g., maprotiline and amitriptyline) were associated with weight gain in almost half of individuals prescribed them, while other antidepressants (agomelatine) were associated with weight loss in 55% of patients. Most antidepressants did not show major effects on kidney or liver function, electrolyte levels, or heart rhythm. The authors also note that it is not known if antidepressant-induced physical effects persist or change over time, and more research is needed to understand how antidepressants affect the body over longer time periods. The authors say their results suggest that treatment guidelines should be updated to reflect the differing physical side effects of antidepressants, and decisions about which drug to use should always be made by the doctor and patient on an individual basis. They also note that other effects of antidepressants were not covered in their study, such as sexual or emotional changes and differences in drug effectiveness, and these should also be considered alongside these results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lab-based studies have provided lots of information on the biology of aging, but it's unclear how lab discoveries apply to aging in the real world. The Dog Aging Project (DAP) is designed to identify patterns of aging and how these are shaped by the diversity of genetic and environmental variation among companion dogs. They also discovered that post-translationally modified amino acids, which are generated from protein break-down, are strongly linked with age in dogs. These molecules might be promising indicators of physiological aging. Because dogs age like humans, share our environment, and receive comparable healthcare, they're an ideal model for studying aging. Our hope is that blood metabolites like those studied here have the potential to serve as powerful biomarkers for tracking the processes that drive healthy aging, not only in dogs but in humans as well."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To close this gap, researchers developed the Intelligent Digital Education Tool for Colposcopy (iDECO), an AI-driven platform that blends real clinical cases, gamified learning, and personalized analytics. High-grade lesion identification doubled, and more than 85% of participants rated the program as highly satisfactory. The results highlight how intelligent learning can accelerate global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer. Despite the availability of vaccines and screening programs, cervical cancer remains a major health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The disease causes more than 660,000 new cases and 340,000 deaths annually, with incidence rates nearly three times higher in regions with limited healthcare resources. A critical bottleneck lies in the lack of well-trained colposcopists—specialists who visually assess and diagnose precancerous cervical lesions. Traditional in-person apprenticeships are costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible. Online lectures and theoretical courses, while more scalable, rarely provide hands-on diagnostic experience or interactive feedback. Due to these persistent gaps, innovative, intelligent, and globally adaptable training solutions are urgently needed to strengthen cervical cancer prevention and control. A new international study (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2025.0403) has demonstrated how artificial intelligence can transform the way colposcopists learn to detect cervical cancer. Using the Intelligent Digital Education Tool for Colposcopy (iDECO), researchers from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College and Tencent Sustainable Social Value Inclusive Health Lab trained nearly 400 clinicians from China, Mexico, and Mongolia through a three-week online program. Published in Cancer Biology & Medicine in October 2025, the findings reveal that this intelligent, bilingual platform markedly improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence—offering a powerful boost to global cervical cancer elimination efforts. The research team conducted six online training programs between December 2024 and May 2025, engaging 369 gynecologists and resident physicians from 87 medical centers. The results were striking: diagnostic accuracy increased from 56.5% to 69.1% (odds ratio 1.72), with high-grade lesion detection improving more than twofold. Over 85% of users expressed high satisfaction, citing the system's interactive features and personalized learning pathways as key motivators. The researchers concluded that iDECO not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also reshapes medical education by turning learning into an adaptive, data-driven experience. Our study shows that intelligent digital education can dramatically improve diagnostic skills and confidence, even in resource-limited settings. This model brings global equity to professional training and ensures that expertise is no longer confined to major hospitals or high-income countries. The success of iDECO across three countries suggests that intelligent, cross-language training platforms can revolutionize global medical education. Beyond colposcopy, such tools could be adapted to other clinical disciplines requiring visual diagnosis, including dermatology, endoscopy, and pathology. As healthcare systems embrace AI-driven learning, intelligent education tools like iDECO may play a decisive role in closing the global health training gap, empowering clinicians, and accelerating the elimination of cervical cancer worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society reveals that older inpatients admitted to physicians who prescribe higher amounts of first-generation antihistamines face an elevated risk of delirium while in the hospital. First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), are among the leading causes of medication-related harms in older adults, and although these medications are indicated for histamine-related conditions such as hives and anaphylaxis, they may be prescribed inappropriately. When investigators analyzed data on 328,140 patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted by 755 attending physicians to 17 hospitals in Ontario, Canada in 2015–2022, they found that the overall prevalence of delirium was 34.8%. Patients admitted to physicians who more commonly prescribed first-generation antihistamines had 41% increased odds of experiencing delirium compared with patients admitted to physicians who rarely prescribed first-generation antihistamines. We hope our study raises awareness among hospitalists that sedating antihistamines can be harmful, and should be prescribed with caution." Aaron M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study published in the British Journal of Health Psychology reveals the negative behavioral and psychological consequences of commercial fitness apps reported by users on social media. These impacts may undermine the potential of apps to promote health and wellbeing. When investigators used artificial intelligence (AI) using a method called Machine-Assisted Topic Analysis (MATA), which combines AI-powered topic modelling with human qualitative analysis, to help them analyze 58,881 X posts referring to the 5 most profitable fitness apps, they identified several negative themes-for example, challenges of quantifying diet and physical activity, the complexity of tracking calories and exercise through oversimplified algorithms, technical challenges and malfunctions, and aversive emotional responses to the apps' notifications. The findings highlight the need for a more user-centered and psychologically informed app design that prioritizes wellbeing and intrinsic motivation over rigid, quantitative goals. Fitness apps remain some of the most profitable and widely downloaded health tools globally. While they can benefit health, there's been far less attention to their potential downsides. When health is reduced to calorie counts and step goals, it can leave people feeling demotivated, ashamed, and disconnected from what truly drives lasting wellbeing. Using AI alongside human analysis, we were able to shed light on these often-overlooked impacts by centering the voices of real users."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research uses a noninvasive, nonradioactive imaging-based method to measure the structure and function of the Achilles tendon in professional ballet dancers. The method could potentially be developed to help prevent injuries and improve rehabilitation efforts in athletes, as well as in the general public. The study involved what is called multi-echo ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess collagen and other components of the Achilles tendon. These structural UTE MRI assessments were combined with functional assessments of the Achilles tendon based on sheer wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound, which measures tendon stiffness. UTE MRI measures corresponded with the degree of stiffness from SWE ultrasound. "These findings highlight the potential of integrating UTE and SWE imaging to investigate tendon structure‐function relationships and adaptations to mechanical loading," the authors write. "Enhanced structure‐function assessment of tendon health and injury status could improve rehabilitation protocols or injury prevention strategies for athletes, including professional dancers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent work published in BME Frontiers, a collaborative study by researchers from Griffith University, Queensland University of Technology, University of Queensland, and Nanjing Stomatological Hospital has introduced groundbreaking three-dimensional (3D) dynamic cell co-culture models to simulate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression stages. This innovation addresses limitations of traditional 2D cell cultures in modeling complex liver pathologies. MASLD, a prevalent chronic condition affecting approximately 30% of the global population, progresses through stages including simple steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and fibrosis, ultimately leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Traditional in vitro models, such as 2D hepatocyte monocultures, have failed to replicate the complex interactions among multiple cell types and dynamic environments observed in vivo. Validation against high-fat-diet mouse models confirmed progressive hepatocyte viability decline and lipid accumulation, mirroring in vivo pathology. Key findings highlight pro-inflammatory macrophages as drivers of hepatocyte lipid metabolism disruption. The 3D system allows cell-specific response analysis and accelerates MASLD phenotype onset within 24 hours, significantly enhancing research efficiency. This advancement not only enhances mechanistic understanding but also empowers precision medicine. Future studies may leverage these models to explore personalized treatments, optimizing outcomes for patients across MASLD's spectrum. With its potential to transform therapeutic discovery, this work stands at the forefront of hepatology research, offering renewed hope for millions affected by liver disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first-in-class YAP-TEAD inhibitor VT3989 continued to be well tolerated and demonstrated notable initial antitumor activity, particularly in patients with refractory mesothelioma, according to results from a trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Data from the Phase I/II trial were presented today by Timothy Yap, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics and vice president and head of clinical development of MD Anderson's Therapeutics Discovery division, at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (Abstract 920O) and published simultaneously in Nature Medicine. The trial enrolled 172 patients, including 135 with refractory mesothelioma. Of the 22 mesothelioma patients treated with the optimized dose levels, seven had partial responses and 12 had stable disease – a disease control rate of 86%. This study has multiple important takeaways, including the demonstration of significant disease control even in this heavily pretreated population. The safety profile was also encouraging, with mainly low-grade adverse effects. This trial of VT3989 represents the first clinical proof-of-concept for inhibiting part of an important signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and immune response. In several cancer types, YAP is overexpressed or overactivated due to dysfunction in the pathway, which fuels cancer growth. VT3989 inhibits a specific modification on the TEAD protein, which blocks YAP function. Cancers with NF2 gene mutations are particularly dependent on the YAP-TEAD pathway. Additionally, mesothelioma is a cancer that is very difficult to treat, and there are currently limited options for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments, making this a major unmet clinical need. Initial data from this trial were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023, demonstrating encouraging Phase I results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the goal of community medicine programs offered at medical schools nationwide. At some innovative programs, students are given an up-close look at what life is like for the working poor or underserved either by touring a food desert, living in a poverty simulator for a week, and even learning how to cook when you have limited food options. In fact, when Ainsly Wolfinbarger, now a first-year pediatric resident, was in her third year at OUSCM and treated a patient with several conditions related to undiagnosed diabetes, she saw the power of community medicine firsthand. “As I sat with him and helped him navigate the barriers to his treatment, he said ‘I can't afford this,'” recalls Wolfinbarger who currently works at Saint Francis Children's Hospital in Tulsa. “But here's what makes our program so special: I could care for him clinically and also help him navigate the social services that were critical to his care. When I told him I could help, this gentleman broke down in tears and said it was the first time in a long time he felt hopeful.” For example, Medscape Medical Students Rate Clinical Instruction Report 2025 found that “For example, we do a low economic resource simulation in which students form family units and are given little monetary resources,” said Boyd Burns, DO, professor of emergency medicine and interim dean. “The goal is to show our students that there will be situations where our patients will have to decide ‘Do I buy this medication, or do I buy food.' For the past 2 years at The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus, Ohio, students have been invited to apply directly into a 4-year Community Medicine MD (CMT) track. And, while CMT students spend their first 2 years at Ohio State's Columbus campus, it's in year three that they continue their clinical work at St Rita's Medical Center in Lima, Ohio, which has a higher poverty rate than the national and state averages, where they integrate with clinicians and faculty and learn firsthand about the issues facing the underserved. “They also get to work with our community partners in Lima to identify the needs in the community and work with those partners to solve a particular problem, which could be accomplished by working with a local food bank, center for aging, or center for women's health,” McCallister said. “This is a critical way our students interact with members of the community.” “Our courses go beyond healthcare delivery,” said Theresa Green, PhD, MBA, director of community health education and policy at the University of Rochester Medical Center's Center for Community Health & Prevention. “The goal with our program is for our students to pair working on a community engaged project with learning about the financing of healthcare and policy/advocacy around healthcare,” Green said. No matter if students sign up for a certain slate of courses or specialize in community medicine, focusing on the impact of income inequality and barriers to healthcare benefits all medical students, not just those who will end up serving the underserved, said OUSCM's Burns.
