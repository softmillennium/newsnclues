                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film “Bugonia,” Emma Stone plays a powerful CEO who's abducted by two conspiracy-obsessed men, portrayed by Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis.But when it comes to conspiracy theories off-screen, one in particular has captured Plemons' imagination. “Well, Jesse has one that he's really been harping on,” Stone told Variety on Tuesday night at the New York premiere inside the MoMa. John Oliver Slams Bari Weiss' Takeover of CBS News: She's 'Spent Years Putting Out Work' That 'Is at Best Irresponsible and at Worst Deeply Misleading' 'Matlock' Star David Del Rio Fired Following Sexual Assault Allegation But it is interesting walking around New York now with so many birds and thinking, ‘What if all of pigeons — right here, right now — were little drones? “They're more worried about getting rich than anything else. It's an interesting metaphor trying to explain the evil that's ruining everybody's life by saying, ‘Oh, there must be a different species.' It's like, ‘Nah, they're just kind of shitty people. One warm-blooded creative who continues to rise above the chaos is Lanthimos himself, who's built a reputation as a true actors' director. “Yorgos is someone I'm so inspired by,” said Alicia Silverstone, who reunites with Lanthimos on “Bugonia” for the first time since 2017's “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.” “He's so prolific and talented. All of his films share a quirky, R-rated sensibility — but will Lanthimos ever expand his horizons and make something more family-friendly?“I have done one, it's called ‘Dogtooth,'” Lanthimos laughed. “I don't really think about it in those terms,” Lanthimos explained. “I just make the films I want to make, and you know, they come out the way they come out. “Bugonia” opens in select theaters on Oct. 24 before expanding nationwide Oct. 31.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daisy May & Charlie's NightWatch sees This Country creators and stars Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie reunite on screen to spend the night together in notorious and reportedly haunted buildings across the UK, discovering long hidden secrets about the buildings – and each other. Since childhood, Charlie and Daisy have been fascinated by the paranormal. In NightWatch, they seize the opportunity to prove any existence of spooks, spirits and ghouls. To give themselves the best chance, they visit some of the UK's most reputedly haunted locations and challenge themselves to stay overnight. This is also a chance for the siblings to spend some much-needed time together, to reconnect and once again enjoy their shared sense of humour – whatever the circumstances. Tell us about what led you to doing this new series together? Daisy: Ever since we were kids, we've really been into the paranormal or supernatural, so that always fascinates me. We've also just not had the time to spend together since doing This Country. We've both had kids since and we just don't get to do creative things or spend time with each other without the family around. So this idea came from both of those things really. Like you say, with work and family life at home making it difficult to spend time together, this was a brilliant way of hanging out again, doing what we love – but obviously in a bit of a bizarre and weird environment! What encounters have you had in your life with the paranormal? Daisy: I've spoken about quite a few different times where I've come across the unexplained or had actual encounters with ghosts – like something pulling my duvet up from my bed, and the legs of the little boy running in a bedroom of mine a few years ago. But recently, our nanny was staying the night in our house and she got jabbed in the back and then my dad was staying over and he had a bath in the en-suite there and got jabbed in the neck. And then my mum was in there two days ago and she heard a man's voice in the bathroom, saying ‘honey'. I heard knocking also in the morning again at home recently. Charlie: I personally haven't had any encounters with the paranormal, but that's the reason why I wanted to do the show so much, because I would really love to have an experience. Having said that, it surprised me how spooked I got when we were filming, so I might have to rethink that. But our grandad saw a ghost years ago and I remember vividly him telling us what happened and the way he described it was so captivating. It had me hooked on the paranormal ever since. He lived in this old cottage and there was an alleyway than ran alongside the house into a dead end and he saw a peasant figure with a pickaxe on the shoulder walking down the alley and then disappear into the end wall. He mentioned it to his neighbour, and they had seen the same ghostly figure a few times over the years, which is pretty mad. I had no reason to doubt my grandad – he was a GP and really straightforward reliable guy. Did you look forward to staying there? To have access to these incredible places like that – and be left alone in a building that's known for being haunted... you can't get better than that. Meeting Clive the custodian, who showed us around and talked us through the history, was creepy enough it itself. But he really painted a picture of what used to happen there and all the executions and hangings. Honestly, I did think then, what the hell are we doing getting left in a cell here overnight? I think we were both relieved to be sharing a bunk bed in the end! Daisy: And at Chillingham Castle in Northumberland, they had an actual torture dungeon there! They say there's a 17th century Spanish witch who haunts the place as she loves it so, so much. You see loads of letters from people who've been there and might have taken something from the castle or annoyed the witch. It's crazy and there are so, so many letters that they can't all be wrong, can they? Where do you think your interest in ghosts and the supernatural stuff come from? Charlie: I guess being allowed to watch anything as a kid, probably sort of terrified us. Our parents let us watch whatever we wanted and obviously one of the things we had to do growing up in the countryside was going to the video shop to rent out whatever we could. I swear we watched the entire collection of horror films they had. Daisy: We'd stay up late and watch this stuff. We were so young I realise now! I tell you where mine started – Casper - we loved that VHS! We had the record of Ghostbusters and you used to march around the dining room to it. There was always like, the Ouija board lying around and mum would have friends who'd be spiritual mediums. Daisy: We'd want to play Operation the board game and she'd say 'no, why don't you get the Ouija board out and go have a go on this?' Charlie: It's probably not a good thing, and we weren't cleansing ourselves before we did the game. Daisy: No, absolutely not and we'd just play on the Sega Mega Drive straight after. Charlie: Well, we can't give away too much obviously. Part of what we enjoy with this stuff is the suspense! But I tell you what was weird. One was just swinging and the others were totally still – I had no idea why - but it wasn't on camera. It was so weird seeing how we matched. I was like, surely we're not that similar?! And both of us are still so obsessed with paranormal activity and it's spurred me on to keep looking for evidence. I do it in my life anyway, but even more so now! Charlie: Oh, I'll never stop looking for ghosts. Daisy: If I was a ghost, I'd hate all those people that do the tours or like me asking them how they died and all that. I bet they're like, oh god, are you bringing this up again? Have you learned anything about yourselves or each other? Charlie: Sharing room together again was funny. And I'm not the only person who vapes like that. It's funny that, when you're just an adult version of a kid. But seriously, it has made me realised that after This Country came out, we've kind of been separated again. Working so closely with each other and then nothing near that, is weird. I remembered you're a really lovely brother. Plus we did go off on so many tangents digging up our past and our childhoods – finding out some ridiculous truths from when we were kids about what really happened to my toys. And also we found out we're distant relatives of a very notorious historical figure, which does explain a lot! How do you think audiences will react to the show? Daisy: I mean, I hope they enjoy it – even if it's just us being awful to each other. But honestly you don't have to be as obsessed with the paranormal to enjoy the show – we're just exploring and I think I'm more of a believer than Charlie and he loves it all anyway. Charlie: Yeah – I've gone into this completely open and whether you've had an encounter yourself or not, these places are fascinating, they're creepy. We do have some really eye-opening experiences there and there's a lot that we don't know or understand. Daisy: There are loads of unanswered questions and I won't spoil it but you'll know when you see it, that there's some really crazy stuff in there. Anyway, look, if you like it, say you do and l like it on social media. Help us out and be loud with your praise. You may need to reload again if the build takes longer than expected.</p>

Three police officers in Minneapolis spotted an unidentified flying object that was spherical in shape with six glowing rings that changed colors.

Anonymous witnesses filed a report with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a nonprofit organization led by former US Navy pilot and whistleblower Ryan Graves, saying they observed the object from a parking garage using binoculars.

According to the report, one officer followed the object in a police car, while the other two continued to observe from the garage.

Officers described the object as hanging hundreds of meters high, moving at slow but hypersonic speeds, and generating lift without any noise.

Even more surprising, the report described a very close encounter between the unidentified flying object and a civilian helicopter.

The sighting took place near Minnesota's Prairie Island nuclear power plant, a detail that has raised eyebrows among UFO researchers, given the site's strategic importance.

The incident happened in February, but Graves shared the report on X on Monday. A similar sighting was recorded on July 7 in Anoka, about a mile from the witness. /Telegraph/</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariska Hargitay never set out to play a character like Olivia Benson, the street-smart NYPD captain with a heart of gold on “Law & Order: Special Victim Units.” “How did I end up as America's sweetheart sex cop? Harigtay joked to the former “Saturday Night Live” star as both women laughed. I think, it was so long ago,” she said. After her recurring role as the incompetent desk clerk Cynthia Hooper on Season 4 of “ER” wrapped, Hargitay found herself in a development deal to star in an “Ally McBeal”-style dramedy series. “That's what I felt like my gifts were.” Hargitay, who lived in Los Angeles at the time, recalled how her professional plans changed shortly after she consulted a psychic on a trip to New York. “He started staying all this amazing stuff to me. My grandmother had just died and he said there was going to be an issue with the ring, which there was.” Hargitay said she was listening “really intently” to the psychic with a serious look on her face. “‘You're going to be famous for that face. When Hargitay protested, telling the psychic she was intent on being a “comedian” in LA, the psychic wouldn't hear it. “He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's a-- what you say. You're going to be famous for that face,'” Hargitay recalled. Not long afterward, Hargitay landed the part of Benson on “SVU.” “Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going (imitating Benson interrogating a suspect), ‘Where were you Tuesday night?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK — As Halloween casts its long shadow over October, a new study reveals that many NFL fans believe they aren't just watching the game — they're sharing the stands with spirits, while sensing the divine. Fans can often be seen praying, warding off evil, consulting mediums and even wondering if angels or aliens are silently shaping the fate of their favorite teams, according to a new study. The survey, conducted last month by Free Bets, surveyed over 2,000 fans across all 32 NFL teams to uncover just how many of them believe in the supernatural — and whether the mysterious forces they invoke on game days extends far beyond lucky socks. READ: For Some, Witchcraft Has Its Connections To Religion And Spirituality Pro football fans are notorious for their rituals — laying out jerseys like holy vestments, never moving from their blessed seat during a winning streak and making the sign of the cross before a field goal. But these superstitions may only scratch the surface. For example, over half of Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys fans confess a belief in ghosts. But the survey also uncovered an intriguing paradox: Belief in all these things may be high, but spiritual action is low. While nearly one in three fans believe supernatural forces are at work — though only 10% said they have tried to engage them. For instance, only 10.3% have ever had a psychic reading, while just 6.7% claimed to have ever used a Ouija board. Some fans polled said they believe what happens on the field is more than human. Cowboys, Browns, Broncos and all hover near 53%, perhaps sensing long-dead legends lingering in the end zone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discovery of a mysterious interstellar object called "3I/ATLAS" and its transit through our solar system has set off all kinds of speculation about whether the fairly massive visitor could be some kind of alien probe. But now one NASA scientist has suggested that extraterrestrials might not be able to visit our little corner of the galaxy because, well, their technology may be just as crummy as ours. Mundanity as an Explanation for the Fermi Paradox," NASA and University of Maryland astrophysicist Robin Corbet argues that the reason we haven't closely encountered any aliens is because they actually lack warp drives or access to wormholes. In fact, Corbet says, they likely don't possess any tech that's significantly more advanced that what humans have: The paper's "Less Terrifying" reference is in relation to a comment from sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke, who is said to have once postulated that we are either alone in the universe or we aren't, and that both possibilities are equally scary. At root, Fermi wondered why, if life should be bountiful in a vast universe, we haven't yet encountered any other civilizations. (My personal favorite is that the most intelligent life in the universe is actually aquatic — life on Earth started in the oceans, after all — and so we live in a galaxy of whales who have no interest in leaving their happy watery homes.) Corbet acknowledges that we have spent decades talking about UFOs and have developed a massive subculture around them, but the NASA researcher notes that no one has found any definitive evidence that sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena can be traced to objects not from this planet. That said, controversial Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has been responsible for all manner of interesting theories about why 3I/ATLAS could be a fragment of incredibly sophisticated ET engineering. (Loeb has also been doing real science, of course, undercutting some of the more outrageous speculation about what is probably just a big comet.) He also suggests that even relatively advanced civilizations might send out a bunch of probes, find nothing at all — or nothing remarkable — and give up on exploration. After all, civilizations may all be too far away from each other in space, and too technologically limited, to ever interfere with each others' destinies. Obviously, if the aliens show up, the theory is disproven, as they would need very advanced tech to get to Earth. But even if we did detect a distant extraterrestrial civilization, it could turn out to be just slightly more impressive than our own.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariska Hargitay might be known for her dramatic acting today — but at the beginning of her career, she was set on doing comedy. “I did a lot of comedy auditions,” Hargitay told Poehler. I always thought I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy.” (The role of Monica ended up going to Courteney Cox.) Hargitay shared that even when she auditioned for dramatic parts, she always figured she'd end up doing something funny because: “I'm going to be a comedian because I'm funny and I'm pretty.” Instead, Hargitay found her career-defining role on SVU, playing Benson — who she has played for more than 25 years and is the longest-running character in live-action TV history. She said getting that gig may or may not have to do with the help she got from a psychic. … I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man, and I went there and he started saying all this amazing stuff to me,” she said. “I was listening to him really intently like this. He goes, ‘You're going to be famous for that face. Rina Sawayama Has Notes for the Team Behind Sabrina Carpenter's Japan-Inspired ‘SNL' Set Tyler, the Creator Is Trapped in an Online-Discourse Vortex I Live in L.A. and I'm going to be a comedian.” She continued: “He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you say. You're going to be famous for that face. Call it fate or the psychic's look into the future, but Hargitay concluded: “Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going [imitating Benson interrogating a suspect], ‘Where were you Tuesday night?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We make headlines.Serious questions deserve better than middle school humor. Tucker Carlson is being ripped on social media after he hosted a conversation about a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 was manufactured to make Jewish people immune to it. The bizarre chat kicked off during Tuesday's episode of “The Tucker Carlson Show,” after the disgraced former Fox News host mentioned Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s erroneous claims that COVID could be “tailored” and had “disparate effects on [different] populations.” I have never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews,” Kennedy wrote. Carlson's guest during the episode, author Dr. Andrew Huff, then controversially alleged that a scientific publication, which he did not name, found that one population of people of Jewish ancestry was affected by COVID more than others. Calling RFK Jr.'s unfounded claims “scientifically true,” Huff told Carlson: “There was a finding in a scientific publication that two different populations of people of Jewish ancestry — depending [on] which line they're from — one was more heavily impacted than the others.” Interjecting, Carlson then clarified that Huff was referring to “Sephardic/Ashkenazi” Jewish people. Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, has a history of spreading misinformation about health, and has repeatedly made false claims about topics such as vaccines and autism. Carlson, a conservative political commentator, has also peddled conspiracy theories and far-right extremist ideology on social media. “Nothing to see here just Tucker Carlson pushing the anti semitic lie that Covid was designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews (who were actually affected MORE than other groups in the real world),” one person wrote on X. The user went on to call Carlson and RFK Jr. “two conspiracy cranks.” Someone else slammed Carlson as a “raging antisemite” while questioning why Vice President JD Vance, an ally of his, has not yet “denounced his bigoted views.” We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this episode, Harvard primatologist Christine Webb challenges one of our deepest beliefs: that humans stand apart from the rest of nature. She traces the roots of human exceptionalism from Aristotle and Descartes to modern science, and explains why we still cling to hierarchies of intelligence. While most critiques of human exceptionalism focus on our moral obligation toward other species, Webb argues that they overlook what humanity stands to gain by letting go of its illusions of uniqueness and superiority.
