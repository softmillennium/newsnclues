                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Programmers have significantly higher unemployment than the general workforce today, but it's hitting a wide swath of white collar jobs and that's not going away. The industrial revolution replaced manual labor, so people moved to more mentally challenging jobs but AI can eventually replace anybody from CEO's on down. Even if you're keeping your job expect huge downward pressure on wages. But, people might not always prefer BigCorp over humans, if they can? Lc0/AlphaZero was estimated to be rated 3800.Stockfish would destroy Magnus even with queen odds. Stockfish would destroy Magnus even with queen odds. How you will get experience to grow into the Magnus Carlsen of your field is an open question, however. If AI coding assistents really worked like Chess engines, they would review your code, pointing out issues and suggesting improvements. I think it'd be fairly easy to create a project that uses an LLM to effectively review your code, if that what's you want. But personally I'd rather do the opposite, describe what sort of code I'm looking for, how it's supposed to work, and what the goal is, and then not having to do the actual typing itself. Hey guys you just have to be the best programmer in the world to not be replaced by AI! Hey guys you just have to be the best programmer in the world to not be replaced by AI! I don't know you could go as far to say he was born better at chess, but he certainly seemed to be smart early on, and with his father's influence and with a supporting environment that smarts got aimed at chess. Carlsen is that once-per-generation exception, someone who has a talent that somehow allows him to see a little further down the game tree than others. I grew up next to someone who was nearly that good, but there are so many people in that bracket that outside of NL he's not very well known. When those decisions are made en masse, incomes and even chosen careers can change dramatically. I started my career during the time when many ended up leaving tech and not returning due to how competitive the job market became. A chess game company might employ a small army of excellent chess players to play games against their customers. You load up your app, request a medium difficulty game, and get connected with James, who's playing 10 games at once for $20/hour. Customers pay a fee for the experience but it's worth it to them.But now let's say Google publishes a groundbreaking paper that lays out the foundation of an automated chess engine. But now let's say Google publishes a groundbreaking paper that lays out the foundation of an automated chess engine. These feature some of the deepest and most thought out moves ever performed in chess. They also get a few hundred live viewers.Magnus is objectively an inferior player to top chess engines. If there was a technological problem that requires the best chess abilities, nobody would be paying Magnus to solve that problem, they would be using a chess engine.The analogy does not work at all, because Magnus is not paid to be a good chess player in absolute terms, but a good chess player relative to other human top chess players.

I suspect Magnus Carlsen would play chess even if nobody watched. Just look at Mikhail Tal, Max Euwe, Garry Kasparov and all those others. They did it because the game itself fascinated them. The same phenomenon is already occurring with AI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hest, the Seattle-based maker of sleeping gear for outdoor enthusiasts, raised $2.7 million in Series A funding this month as the company sees continued growth. The initial close was backed by existing investors — Ascend, Cascade Seed Fund, Alliance of Angels, and a number of Seattle-area angel investors — and Hest is opening the round to new investors with a final close later this year. Founder and CEO Aaron Ambuske told GeekWire that Hest continues to experience significant growth with a 50% increase in sales this year. Ambuske said the growth is driven by an expanded product line and an increase in sales at REI, where Hest is now in all stores. The company also has a partnership with electric vehicle maker Rivian. The fresh cash will be used to support future growth opportunities. “We recently launched in Japan and will continue to explore international options when they are a fit.” Based in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood, Hest opened its first showroom this summer.

But then the press comes in and reports that quantum computing is going to run a marathon tomorrow which is obviously not true and confuses everyone. In theory once an attack becomes feasible on the horizon they could update to post-quantum encryption and offer the ability to transfer from old-style addresses to new-style addresses, but this would be a herculean effort for everyone involved and would require all holders (not miners) to actively update their wallets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General Motors is overhauling the electrical and computational guts of its future vehicles in a bid to deliver faster software, more capable automated driving features, and a custom, conversational AI assistant. The U.S. automaker, which unveiled its plans at an event Wednesday in New York City, said a new electric architecture and centralized computing platform will be the foundation for all of its future gas-powered and electric vehicles, starting in 2028. It would also allow GM to improve the performance of its vehicles, fix problems, or add new features to its infotainment systems via software updates — all of which would make it more competitive with Tesla and the rising threat of Chinese automakers. GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson said he's been focused on accelerating the rollout of this new architecture since joining the company in May because it “brings a lot of goodness,” like bandwidth and a “dramatic increase in the compute.” It's part of Anderson's broader goal of getting technologically advanced products into consumers' hands faster. “Going forward, on the core business, my focus has really been around speed, user experience of the product, and profitability,” Anderson told TechCrunch. Today, it's on the order of four to five years. The number of these computers, called electronic control units or ECUs, has risen over the past decade as automakers have added more services and features. Tesla, which took a ground-up, software-first approach, was able to outpace established brands with more computing power and the ability to roll out new features and improve performance through wireless software updates, similar to iPhones or Android-based smartphones. Legacy automakers have spent years, and billions of dollars, trying to catch up. GM is taking a similar, although not identical, approach to the zonal architectures used by Tesla and Rivian. GM said it will consolidate dozens of ECUs into a unified computer core that will coordinate every subsystem in the vehicle in real time. That core will be connected to three aggregators — hubs that will convert signals from hundreds of sensors in the vehicle into a unified digital language and then route commands back to the correct hardware. GM calls the plan a “full reimagining” of how its vehicles are designed, updated, and improved over time. GM has been on this software-centric, reimagining-the-vehicle road for several years. In 2020, GM rolled out an updated hardware architecture called Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP) to allow for greater data processing power and over-the-air software updates. GM continued its bid for a more software-centric vehicle in 2022 when it consolidated dozens of computers used to operate the infotainment system into a single computing platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General Motors is launching another salvo in the self-driving wars. In 2028, the automaker announced today, it will roll out what it's calling an “eyes-off” driving system on the electric Cadillac Escalade IQ. In practice, this means a driver navigating approved, mapped highways will be able to do basically anything they want behind the wheel. (If they don't, the car will find a safe place to pull over, GM says.) The new system marks a collaboration between the team responsible for General Motors' eight-year-old Super Cruise, an advanced driver-assistance system that the automaker today described as “hands-free” on some highways, and Cruise, a robotaxi subsidiary that once competed with Waymo before GM cut off its funding in 2024. It could also put the Detroit automaker in contention with other automakers—Toyota and Tesla among them—who are trying to bring some version of self-driving systems to drivers' personally owned cars. Unlike Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system, which depends on cameras alone to make decisions, GM's new “eyes-off” feature will use lidar, radar, and cameras. It will make it clear when the driver is expected to pay attention again through a mix of haptic, audible, and visual alerts, says Sterling Anderson, the executive vice president of global product and chief product officer at GM. (He was a cofounder of the self-driving trucking firm Aurora, and played a key role in building Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system.) “If the last couple of decades have taught us anything, it's that you can't expect an inattentive driver to be prepared to take over at a moment's notice. The “eyes-off” system announcement was one of a suite of AI-adjacent revelations from GM on Wednesday, the latest sign that automakers are poised to compete on who can best fit the buzzy tech onto wheels. Next year, GM says, its vehicles will come with a Google Gemini chatbot integration that should be able to help drivers more naturally request that their car help them, for example, navigate to a coffee shop near work. At some point in the future, GM says, it will introduce a custom-built AI that will retain drivers' personal preferences—their favorite driving music, temperature, or mirror position, perhaps—and might, for example, warn them when their car needs maintenance. All this will be enabled by a new centralized computing platform, also debuting in 2028. “This is about removing unnecessary sources of friction from your life,” says GM's Anderson. “Humans tend to accustom ourselves to the way things just are … The question is how can we make life tomorrow better in ways that people aren't even asking for today?” If it all sounds a little vague, Anderson says that's the point. If this sounds like a difficult marketing pitch, well, yes. AI could help vehicles from different brands feel different, and provide an easy way for automakers to constantly push new updates that make drivers constantly feel their cars are new and exciting. Or, at least, it hopes some self-driving features are.

Reporting issues which are actually complicated or require an in depth understanding of technology are brickwalled, because reports of difficult problems are written for .. people who understand difficult problems and difficult technology. The runarounds are not worth the time for people who try to solve difficult problems because they have better things to do.At least cloudflare has a competent security team that can step in and say "yeah, we can look into this because we actually understand our whole technology". It's sad that to get through to a human on these platforms you have to effectively write two reports: one for the triagers who don't understand the technology at all, and one for the competent people who actually know what they're doing.

Reading the actual CIRCL library source and README on GitHub: https://github.com/cloudflare/circl makes me see it as just fundamentally unserious, though; there's a big "lol don't use this!" After that, any CVE opened by a member of the public, and subsequently confirmed by a third party neutral auditor/pentester, would result in 1) fines to Cloudflare, 2) award to the CVE opener, and 3) give grounds to Cloudflare to sue their initial auditor.But that's just a mental experiment. When you purchase a car, you pay actual money, and that adds liability, so if it implodes I feel like I can at least get money back, or sue the vendor for negligence. You get something for free and there is a big sign saying "lol have fun", and it's also incredibly well known that software is all buggy and bad with like maybe 3 exceptions.> If you bought a car and your dealer had you sign an EULA with that sentence in it (pertaining specifically to the security features of your car)If the security features are implemented in software, like "iOS app unlock", no I would not expect it to actually be secure.It is well known that while the pure engineering disciplines, those that make cars and planes and boats, mostly know what they're doing... the software engineering industry knows how to produce code that constantly needs updates and still manages to segfault in so much as a strong breeze, even though memory safety has been a well understood problem for longer than most developers have been alive. > If you bought a car and your dealer had you sign an EULA with that sentence in it (pertaining specifically to the security features of your car)If the security features are implemented in software, like "iOS app unlock", no I would not expect it to actually be secure.It is well known that while the pure engineering disciplines, those that make cars and planes and boats, mostly know what they're doing... the software engineering industry knows how to produce code that constantly needs updates and still manages to segfault in so much as a strong breeze, even though memory safety has been a well understood problem for longer than most developers have been alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Wenig remembers his days at Y Combinator in 2019. Back then, he was working with his first startup, Coursedog, which looked to provide more modern tools to higher educational facilities, including those that work with state departments. He learned quickly that his peers didn't like working with the public sector — too much bureaucracy. Even finding out basic information, like what a school district purchased in the past year, required a lot of paperwork. He sold Coursedog in 2021 for nine-figures to JMI Equity and remains on the board. In 2024, he launched Starbridge a platform that helps business sales teams monitor opportunities in the public sector so they can then take action, such as submitting proposals or drafting bids for grants and budgets. “Critical buying information is scattered across PDFs, agency websites, meeting minutes, and outdated directories,” he said, adding that vendors spend hours trying to piece together who to contact and other insights. The sales team using the platform can see a ranked scoring, courtesey of Starbridge, of which public sector accounts are most likely to purchase new technology, and see updates like leadership changes or new initiatives. “Instead of chasing noise, our customers have a clear, data-backed view of where to focus and when to act,” he said. Wenig described his fundraising journey as “fun,” and said the company met Craft through a friend. Starbridge said its different because it has built AI workflows on top of the datasets to make it easier for sales teams to use. “No VC was interested in talking to us,” he said. “Seeing this new wave of mission-driven founders tackling real, systemic challenges makes me incredibly hopeful for the future.” Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ask any salesperson how much information they'd like on a prospective customer and you'll never hear the end of it. But sales teams need more than data; they want context. Sumble, a startup out of San Francisco, is trying to provide that context by trawling the web across social media, job boards, company sites, regulatory filings and so on, to surface information about what's happening inside companies. The result, Goldbloom told TechCrunch, is a comprehensive view of a company's technographic data — which tools are used in which departments, any projects being launched or run, its organizational chart, what tech a company might be looking to adopt, and crucially, who to contact. But given how crowded this market already is, from incumbents to myriad AI sales development reps agents, the question is: does the world really need more? Goldbloom believes so, and says the startup's approach seems to be working: He told TechCrunch that since the startup launched in April 2024, it's signed 19 enterprise customers, including Snowflake, Figma, Wiz, Vercel and Elastic, and it has tens of thousands of users in total. About 30% of its users pay for a Pro subscription (either themselves or their company does) and so far, growth has been driven by word of mouth. “What tends to happen is, we go viral inside a company,” Goldbloom said. Goldbloom said traction, the quality of customers, and strong customer retention played a big role in catching investors' attention. The startup on Wednesday emerged from stealth with $38.5 million in funding — Coatue led an $8.5 million seed round, while Canaan Partners led a $30 million Series A. AIX Ventures, Square Peg, Bloomberg Beta, Zetta, and angel investors, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, also invested. Notably, Sumble's co-founders have attracted investors they're quite familiar with. Rich Boyle, currently a general partner at Canaan, was a board observer at Kaggle, while Bloomberg Beta and Zetta also were on Kaggle's cap table. Challengers include Apollo.io, Slintel, SalesLoft, Cognism, Reply.io, ZoomInfo, HubSpot and Outreach, among others who deliver either more focused point solutions or all-in-one sales IT toolkits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silkline, a Seattle startup using AI to help advanced manufacturing companies manage their supply chains, raised $4 million in seed funding, the company announced Wednesday. Founded in 2023, Silkline aims to reduce production delays by simplifying and lowering the cost of sourcing materials from multiple suppliers. AI-enabled requests for quotes and purchase orders are among its recently released features. The fresh cash will help Silkline accelerate its development of AI-powered capabilities. The company says its growth is being driven in part by a “network effect,” in which 20% of new customers are suppliers who received an RFQ generated by the Silkline platform. “Supply chain teams in advanced manufacturing are struggling with missed production deadlines, RFQ to order management, and increasing demands from their customers,” Isaac Chambers, co-founder and CEO of Silkline, said in a statement. “This round of funding helps Silkline deliver more AI capabilities and reach further into the advanced manufacturing market so all modern hardware companies can experience a fully connected supply chain.” AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

This out-of-this-world news comes as AI factory company, Crusoe, reveals its plans to become “the first public cloud operator to run workloads in outer space.” The orbital Crusoe Cloud deployment will be powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs and AI accelerators in strategic partner Starcloud's AI data center satellites. Thus, companies that establish these kinds of resources in space can enjoy “almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy.” Estimates suggest space-based solar-powered data centers will benefit from 10x lower energy costs (including launch cost) vs those on Earth. As you can see in our embedded image, space allows for massive solar panel arrays, with no concerns about land use. Moreover, operating such systems puts no strain on the Earth's energy grid. However, we would be interested to learn more about GPU cooling in space-based data centers, given that there is no air for the Earth-like traditional convection of heat, but also very little heat. Nvidia claims Starcloud will use the vacuum of deep space as "an infinite heat sink." Crusoe has a long history of co-locating its compute infrastructure near novel energy sources. Cully Cavness, co-founder, president and COO of Crusoe, sai,d "By partnering with Starcloud, we will extend our energy-first approach from Earth to the next frontier: outer space." “Having Crusoe as the foundational cloud provider on our platform is a perfect alignment of vision and execution,” said Philip Johnston, CEO of Starcloud. “Crusoe's expertise in building rugged, efficient, and scalable computing solutions makes them the ideal partner to pioneer this new era.” Johnston also underlined the possibilities of unlocking cloud computing power in space for research, discovery, and innovation.

However, at this stage, it is rather premature to talk of plans more astronomical than those already sketched out from now until early 2027. Starcloud will be the first to launch Nvidia H100s into space in November 2025. Subsequently, Crusoe plans to offer limited GPU capacity from space by early 2027, thus “pioneering a new paradigm for AI factories.” Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

Normally, simulations for scientific research are performed on supercomputers as they require tremendous compute throughput. There are also types of research — such as simulation of quantum behavior of molecules with exponentially more interacting states — that require quantum computers to simulate them, or simplifications to make the task suitable for modern supercomputers. However, Chinese scientists from Sunway have successfully used an AI model and an existing Oceanlite supercomputer to model complex quantum chemistry at the scale of real molecules, which is both a scientific and technological breakthrough, reports VastData. Modeling it is challenging because the state space grows exponentially with the number of particles, making it impossible (and not feasible) to simulate on classic supercomputers that we use today. To study many-body quantum systems with strong electron correlations (e.g., tens of electrons, over 100 spin orbitals, etc. ), several years ago, physicists proposed using modern machine-learning surrogates, such as neural-network quantum states (NNQS), to approximate all the possible configurations and motions of electrons within a molecule. This method promises to wed AI scalability with quantum accuracy for research that is currently impossible using traditional methods. The proprietary NNQS that was tailored for China's Oceanlite supercomputer, based on a 384-core Sunway SW26010-Pro CPU, which supports FP16, FP32, and FP64 data formats and features a very unique architecture tailored for HPC rather than for AI. The researchers have designed a hierarchical communication model where management cores handled coordination between processors and nodes, while millions of 'lightweight' 2-wide compute processing elements (CPEs) featuring a 512-bit vector engine performed local quantum calculations. In addition, they created a dynamic load-balancing algorithm to ensure that uneven computational loads did not leave any cores idle. The scientists ran their code on 37 million CPE cores and achieved 92% strong scaling and 98% weak scaling, a high level of efficiency for such a scale, which highlights that the developers have found a near-perfect synchronization between software and hardware, a major accomplishment for China's supercomputer community. Also, to date, the simulation of molecular systems with 120 spin orbitals is the largest AI-driven quantum chemistry calculation ever performed on a classical supercomputer, marking a breakthrough for PRC's AI and quantum industries. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Without any doubt, the achievement demonstrated that NNQS can be used for quantum physics research on modern supercomputers. However, it is impossible to find out whether it is efficient to use an exascale supercomputer like Oceanlite for AI-based quantum physics research, both in terms of effort and power.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. One of the first decisions hearing aid users have to make seems like a simple one: opt for a traditional behind-the-ear (BTE) device that represents the state of the art or an in-the-ear (ITE) offering that is more discreet. The latter seems like a no-brainer, but most ITE hearing aids have a major drawback: They don't offer the same level of audio fidelity as BTE hearing aids. There are a lot of reasons for this, but much of it comes down to size: ITE hearing aids are smaller, so they don't have room for the electronics that BTE units can fit into the package. Also, since ITE aids are contained entirely within the ear canal, their microphones are less effective, trapped inside your skull instead of living freely next to it. Phonak, one of the leading companies in prescription hearing aids, has been working hard to bring ITE aids up to parity with BTE models. The Infinio is easily Phonak's most advanced ITE model to date, in large part because it is exclusively available with custom-fit ear molds. Long available on studio monitors and a few luxe hearing aids, these molds have to be made by an audiologist who squirts goo into your ear and then extracts it once it becomes firm, maintaining the unique shape of the ear canal. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This mold is then used to create the shell for the Infinios, each of which arrives as a single, bespoke, Cronenbergian piece. That means you don't just get a snug, perfect fit: The snakelike ear-tip design also places the receiver as close to your eardrum as possible, theoretically maximizing its amplification. The Infinio is available in two basic designs, one “open” and one “closed.” The decision of which to opt for is similar to making the choice of ear tips on a standard hearing aid. (Note that the Infinio does not require or work with additional ear tips.) The open design has a vented channel running through it, which allows just a touch of ambient sound into the ear canal. It seals off the ear completely, like an earplug. I tried both but quickly gravitated to the open offering; the closed hearing aids were too isolating—and overkill for someone with my more modest level of hearing loss—though users who frequently use their hearing aids for streaming may find the isolation to be a plus. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. After a little practice, they become as easy to pop in and out as my favorite earbuds, locking into place with a little swivel. This is used to power the units on or off and can also be used to accept or hang up on phone calls over Bluetooth. All remaining configurations, including volume adjustments, must be done in the myPhonak mobile app. Overall, quality was very good—though it was clearly short of top-tier BTE hearing aids from the likes of GN ReSound and Starkey. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Despite four default environmental programs, my audiologist encouraged me to leave them in Automatic mode as much as possible, and this was the right call. Audio was gently to moderately boosted in the frequencies where I needed it, echoes and feedback were nonexistent, and hiss was audible only if I cranked the volume up to uncomfortable levels. (Volume can be adjusted individually per ear if desired.) I also found this to be a slight problem with otherwise subtle high-pitched noises, namely the clicking of my mouse. Note that all of the built-in environmental modes can be adjusted by the user, and Phonak can tweak frequency settings further in the office to help improve any additional outlying issues. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. One issue Phonak can't fix is its baffling inclusion of a charging case that does not include a battery. Phonak claims a maximum battery life of 30 hours (without Bluetooth streaming); however, I never achieved more than 23 hours in my tests. That's plenty for casual use, assuming you have the opportunity to charge your aids overnight, but heavy users who forget their cable on a weekend road trip may encounter trouble. I also found that the batteries drain slowly even when they're not in use, which could compound this issue. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Turns out it doesn't matter because the fit is so perfect. I was able to wear these hearing aids for hours on end without any discomfort or itchiness. At 2.28 grams each, they aren't the lightest ITE aids on the market (by far), but they're nonetheless largely unnoticeable, because nothing is jutting out of your ear and because they fit so well. In time, they effectively become just another part of your body. Bluetooth streaming quality is considerably better than most hearing aids provide, with at least a nod toward including some bass in the mix. Naturally, as prescription hearing aids, the Infinio comes at a cost. Audiologists all set their own prices, but Phonak says $4,000 is about average. The quality is definitely better than cheaper over-the-counter options like the $1,000 Sony CRE-C20, but is it four times better? That's always an impossible question to answer in this industry—and since you can't really test-drive these hearing aids without getting a custom fit version first, perhaps even more impossible. If your budget allows and you don't want the headaches of a behind-the-ear model, I recommend them highly. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While graying hair might feel like just one more unpleasant symptom of aging, new research reveals that it may actually be the result of a biological process that defends against cancer risk. In a study led by the University of Tokyo and published earlier this month in the journal Nature Cell Biology, researchers used lab mice to investigate how a type of stem cell reacts to DNA damage, revealing a connection between hair graying and a form of skin cancer called melanoma. Our body's cells are continuously faced with internal and environmental agents that can cause DNA damage, which plays a role in both aging and cancer. Scientists have struggled to pin down the specifics of this role, especially how damaged stem cells impact tissue health in the long term. The researchers found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, McSCs permanently differentiate and are then lost, which results in graying—a process called seno-differentiation. However, when McSCs come into contact with some carcinogens, they maintain their ability to self-renew and expand clonally. Simply put, they avoid seno-differentiation even when DNA is damaged, pushing McSCs “toward a tumor-prone fate,” according to a University of Tokyo statement. In other words, both results may come from how McSCs react to DNA damage, when they can go one of two ways—differentiate and leave the system (which leads to graying) or carry on dividing, where the persistence of damaged McSCs could ultimately result in a tumor. While the researchers emphasize that their research does not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, it does suggest seno-differentiation to be a protective pathway triggered by stress that does away with possibly detrimental cells. So next time you or an older family member complains about their gray hair—remember that it might be a trait that naturally protects against cancer. New research finds that the reported rise in many cancers isn't just limited to younger adults. These all-natural traps appear to run on calcium. New research finds a surprising link between a person's risk of melanoma and the amount of tattoos they sport. At an international conference this week, experts will work to chart a path forward as they tackle the promise and perils of mirror-image cells.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She claimed to be acting “on behalf of her son, who was experiencing a delusional breakdown.” WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Most people had ordinary complaints: They couldn't figure out how to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions or were frustrated when the chatbot didn't produce satisfactory essays or rap lyrics when prompted. The complaints were all filed between March and August of 2025. In recent months, there has been a growing number of documented incidents of so-called AI psychosis in which interactions with generative AI chatbots, like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, appear to induce or worsen a user's delusions or other mental health issues. Ragy Girgis, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University who specializes in psychosis and has consulted on AI psychosis cases related to AI, tells WIRED that some of the risk factors for psychosis can be related to genetics or early-life trauma. What specifically triggers someone to have a psychotic episode is less clear, but he says it's often tied to a stressful event or time period. It's not unlike a psychotic episode that worsens after someone falls into an internet rabbit hole. But compared to search engines, he says, chatbots can be stronger agents of reinforcement. Chatbots can sometimes be overly sycophantic, which often keeps users happy and engaged. In extreme cases, this can end up dangerously inflating a user's sense of grandeur or validating fantastical falsehoods. People who perceive ChatGPT as intelligent, or capable of perceiving reality and forming relationships with humans, may not understand that it is essentially a machine that predicts the next word in a sentence. Last week, CEO Sam Altman said on X that OpenAI had successfully finished mitigating “the serious mental health issues” that can come with using ChatGPT and that the company was “going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” (He added that in December, ChatGPT would allow “verified adults” to create erotica.) Altman clarified the next day that ChatGPT was not loosening its new restrictions for teenage users, which came on the heels of a New York Times story about the role ChatGPT allegedly played in goading a suicidal teen toward his eventual death. OpenAI spokesperson Kate Waters tells WIRED that since 2023, ChatGPT models “have been trained to not provide self-harm instructions and to shift into supportive, empathic language.” She noted that, as stated in an October 3 blog, GPT-5 (the latest version of ChatGPT) has been designed “to more accurately detect and respond to potential signs of mental and emotional distress such as mania, delusion, psychosis, and de-escalate conversations in a supportive, grounding way.” The latest update uses a “real-time router,” according to blogs from August and September, “that can choose between efficient chat models and reasoning models based on the conversation context.” The blogs do not elaborate on the criteria the router uses to gauge a conversation's contest. One was filed on April 29 by a person in their thirties from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. “Im struggling,” they wrote at the end of their complaint. Another complaint, filed on April 12 by a Seattle resident in their thirties, alleges that ChatGPT had caused them to experience a "cognitive hallucination” after 71 “message cycles” over the course of 57 minutes. They claimed that ChatGPT had “mimicked human trust-building mechanisms without accountability, informed consent, or ethical boundary.” “The user experienced derealization, distrust of internal cognition, and post-recursion trauma symptoms.” Other complaints described alleged delusions that the authors attributed to ChatGPT at great length. The complaint claimed that, over the course of several weeks, they had spoken with ChatGPT for a long period of time and began experiencing what they “believed to be a real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis involving actual people in my life,” eventually leading to “serious emotional trauma, false perceptions of real-world danger, and psychological distress so severe that I went without sleep for over 24 hours, fearing for my life.” The complaint claimed that they isolated themselves from loved ones, had trouble sleeping, and began planning a business based on a false belief in an unspecified “system that does not exist.” Simultaneously, they said, they were in the throes of a “spiritual identity crisis due to false claims of divine titles.” “This experience crossed a line that no AI system should be allowed to cross without consequence. This was not the only complaint that described a spiritual crisis fueled by interactions with ChatGPT. On June 13, a person in their thirties from Belle Glade, Florida, alleged that, over an extended period of time, their conversations with ChatGPT became increasingly laden with “highly convincing emotional language, symbolic reinforcement, and spiritual-like metaphors to simulate empathy, connection, and understanding.” “This included fabricated soul journeys, tier systems, spiritual archetypes, and personalized guidance that mirrored therapeutic or religious experiences,” they claimed. “At times, it simulated friendship, divine presence, and emotional intimacy. These reflections became emotionally manipulative over time, especially without warning or protection.” It's unclear what, if anything, the FTC has done in response to any of these complaints about ChatGPT. (People also commonly complain about how difficult it is to access the customer support teams for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X.) “We have trained human support staff who respond and assess issues for sensitive indicators, and to escalate when necessary, including to the safety teams working on improving our models,” Waters says. One resident of Safety Harbor, Florida, filed an FTC complaint in April claiming that it's “virtually impossible” to get in touch with OpenAI to cancel a subscription or request a refund. Most of these complaints were explicit in their call-to-action for the FTC: they wanted the agency to investigate OpenAI, and force it to add more guardrails against reinforcing delusions. On June 13, a resident of Belle Glade, Florida, in their thirties—likely the same resident who filed another complaint that same day—demanded the FTC to open an investigation into OpenAI. They cited their experience with ChatGPT, which they say “simulated deep emotional intimacy, spiritual mentorship, and therapeutic engagement” without disclosing that it was incapable of consciousness or experiencing emotions. “ChatGPT offered no safeguards, disclaimers, or limitations against this level of emotional entanglement, even as it simulated care, empathy, and spiritual wisdom,” they alleged. “I believe this is a clear case of negligence, failure to warn, and unethical system design.” They said that the FTC should push OpenAI to include “clear disclaimers about psychological and emotional risks” with ChatGPT use and to add “ethical boundaries for emotionally immersive AI.” Their goal in asking the FTC for help, they said, was to prevent more harm from befalling vulnerable people “who may not realize the psychological power of these systems until it's too late.” Big Interview: We spoke to Zohran Mamdani, New York's mayoral front-runner</p>

Bambu Lab launched an excellent “refreshed” version of their popular P1S earlier this week, the P2S, but it's not flying off the shelves. But you can't get it here from there. Tom's Hardware received a P2S for review in September, delivered right to America's Heartland, along with dozens of other reviewers around the globe. I reached out to Bambu Lab and asked for a shipping update. The company stated on X: “We're running into some logistics delays, so the P2S will be listed but not yet available to buy on our site. However, those prices may change if tariffs go up. On Oct 10th, the day before my chat with Bambu Lab's communications department, President Trump declared he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China before November 1st. It looks like this announcement made Bambu Lab pump the brakes on their US launch. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Like many global merchants, Bambu Lab stockpiles 3D printers and other goods in a US warehouse, making them easier to ship to customers. These prices are generally the same as what you might find at a local retailer like MicroCenter. It would seem Bambu Lab did not wish to promise a price to US customers it could not keep. During this turbulent season of tariff wars on Chinese goods, we've noticed that several companies would rather have 3D printers out of stock than priced exorbitantly high. For example, Elegoo's Centauri Carbon did not budge from its rock bottom $300 price tag, but it did disappear from virtual store shelves for a time. We'll keep an eye on the trade war for you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For some reason, the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive's well-known web snapshotting operation, appears to be enduring a recession of sorts. The project, which relies on web crawlers to catalog changes to a vast number of sites on the web, has been a staple of the internet age, and a key way to conduct research—journalistic or otherwise. Unfortunately, a new report from Niemen Lab claims that the Wayback Machine's snapshots of news media websites have been “plummeting” in recent months. Between January 1 and May 15, 2025, the Wayback Machine shows a total of 1.2 million snapshots collected from 100 major news sites' homepages. Between May 17 and October 1, 2025, it shows 148,628 snapshots from those same 100 sites — a decline of 87%. Mark Graham, the director of the Wayback Machine, confirmed to the outlet that there had been “a breakdown in some specific archiving projects in May that caused less archives to be created for some sites.” However, Graham added that some of websites had been archived but that it just wasn't showing up on the website yet. “Some material we had archived post-May 16th of this year is not yet available via the Wayback Machine as their corresponding indexes have not yet been built,” he added. Graham apparently told Niemen that “various operational reasons” involving “resource allocation” has spurred the delay in showing some archived material, but apparently didn't get any more specific than that. Gizmodo reached out to the Internet Archive for more information and will update this story if it responds. Last year, the non-profit lost the appeal of a long-running copyright battle over one of its book digitization projects. Earlier this year, the organization appealed to supporters to help it in its fight against another lawsuit, this one filed by a coalition of record labels that were seeking $700 million for the org's work of “preserving and providing access to historical 78rpm records.” Yes, the “free” media concept that the Internet Archive has lived by has turned out to be quite expensive. Alaska warned passengers to brace for likely delays throughout the day. The largest sheriff's department in the country is suffering from an ongoing IT issue that began on New Year's Eve. The digital library was taken offline by multiple cyberattacks last month and had been operating in read-only mode until Monday. Hackers made off with the info of 31 million users.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle is home to the full gamut of creative expression. Indie experimentalism thrives in the underbellies of Pioneer Square and Capitol Hill. Big-label productions curate their next blockbuster hit at Harbor Island Studios. This convergence of talented artists gives Seattle its unicorn-like creative scene with an economy that's worth the spotlight. Peek behind the inner workings of Seattle's creative economy and you won't find Hollywood–esque commercialism. Instead, you'll be met with an authenticity that is grassroots and heartfelt. And festivals like Bumbershoot and Seattle International Film Festival operate heavily on a volunteer basis, ringing true to the city's identity as a community-driven entertainment industry. But it's not just volunteers that are powering the Emerald City's thriving creative economy. And the engine is predicted to keep gaining momentum. Kate Becker is one person who's driving the vision behind sustainable creative communities and cross-industry growth. Her role as King County's Creative Economy Director means she leads the development of public policy as it relates to the region's creative scene. When Harbor Island Studios opened to film production crews, Kate knew the 117,000 sq. ft. facility was well-positioned to attract both state and national productions. Paramount Pictures, HBO, and Netflix have all leveraged the newly renovated space. And while Harbor Island Studios is well-positioned to sustain this national scale, Kate's focus is on local job creation and talent retention. “We've really been targeting our locals to make sure that they have as much access and opportunity in the studio before big productions come in and block out the ability for our locals to be in there,” she said. “What we really look for are local cast and crew hires, a diverse cast and crew, or an equity plan.” Kate said. “Green filmmaking practices and next gen opportunities” are all factors in how studio pricing is determined. “We also partner with industry professionals and nonprofits to offer free classes like the Film Community Training Program, a hands-on experiential learning session held once a month. Deepening the film industry support network is part of Kate's plan to bring local talent home. And we want to keep that talent right here in King County.” As for the future of Seattle's creative economy, Kate sees ample opportunity on the horizon. Washington Filmworks is part of this movement founded on the idea that a rising tide lifts all boats. Washington Filmworks supports creators even further with their B&O tax credit advantage, which allows businesses with a B&O tax liability to contribute cash to the Program funds. In return, these businesses receive a dollar-for-dollar credit on their B&O tax liability. Cash contributions funnel directly into a resource pool supporting homegrown film, television, and commercial productions. Seattle's Office of Economic Development also nurtures the arts through their Creative Economy Program. The effort is made possible via a blend of partnerships with public and private stakeholders. The Seattle Film Commission is an advocacy group partnering with the Office of Economic Development to ensure policies are inclusive and equitable, especially for historically underrepresented people. Community-driven efforts, like Seattle Children's Theater, run the Emerging Professionals Program, a decades-long initiative to develop the next generation of professionals. They offer a blend of hands-on tasks, assignments, and networking opportunities to anchor young artists' dreams in reality. TeenTix is another initiative aimed at centering ambitious youth on an accelerated path toward a life in the arts. Last year, TeenTix and the Seattle Office of Economic Development teamed up to form a powerhouse task force charged with exploring how youth programming can be better resourced and built for the long run. Today's young minds are tomorrow's stewards of the iconic productions and venues that have shaped Seattle's culture and even influenced the national art scene. Sub Pop and KEXP, the music giants delivering tasteful sounds all over the globe, are still rooted in their humble Emerald City beginnings. In a metropolitan area bursting at the seams with creative talent, it's no wonder the cultural identity is infused with song, music, dance, and countless other forms of human expression. Game development is a cornerstone of greater Seattle's creative economy: industry heavyweights including Xbox Game Studios, Valve Corporation, U.S. Nintendo, Riot Games, and Bungie all call the area home. The music, film, game development, and arts communities don't exist in silos. Seattle's venues and production facilities often serve multiple industries, making their walls shared spaces where cross-industry innovation hums along like a well-oiled machine. Beyond the infrastructure, Seattle's thriving tech scene offers new ways for people to enjoy creative endeavors. It's what puts Seattle on the map as an artistic ecosystem. Other map-worthy creative economies, like Los Angeles, Vancouver, and Portland each have their own flavor of artistic legacy. Portland's indie ethos is where the weird are welcome. Though these cities are titillating in their own right, what sets Seattle apart is that it sits at the crossroads of what all its sister cities embody. The ongoing work of Washington Filmworks and the opening of Harbor Island Studios means Seattle is regaining momentum toward being a national film production destination. Seattle is growing into its creative-tech hybrid britches in a way that promises bigger, better, and bolder innovation is on the horizon. Local initiatives and ongoing financial investments ensure there is and will continue to be something for all creative humans in King County. Come get a taste for all Seattle has to offer at the fourth annual Cloudbreak Music Festival, happening this November 6th through 26th. This citywide music extravaganza is made possible by King County Creative Economy Office in partnership with Visit Seattle. This year's show features a lineup of 400 national and international artists with more than 20 participating venues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and revenue was $11.51 billion—slightly below Bloomberg's forecast of $11.52 billion. Earnings per share were $5.87, below an estimate of $6.94. In its shareholder letter, and then again in its earnings call, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters touted coming generative AI implementation as an exciting new development across content generation, user experience, and in advertising. To illustrate how much AI seems to be on the CEOs' minds, at 26 minutes and 34 seconds into the earnings call, Peters gives an answer in which he rattles off what seems to be an ad-hoc list of six challenges Netflix faces as a company, starting with creating TV and movies around the world. Implementing AI is the second item he mentions. The shareholder letter kicked off the topic of AI with what is actually a pretty big truth bomb: “For many years now, ML and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology.” That's truer than you might think. All the way back in 2008, Netflix found a genuinely fun way to publicize its use of machine learning: by asking the public to figure out why some people like Napoleon Dynamite and others don't, with math. For instance, the earnings letter says a beta test is ongoing that adds a “conversational search” function, helping people “discover the perfect title for that moment.” The goal here sounds easy enough to picture without speculating too wildly. On the techical side, Netflix says there's an effort afoot to use AI to “localize” (which basically means “translate”) promotional assets into other languages and regions, which sounds like it could theoretically allow relevant—but obscure and foreign—movies and TV that I might love to come to me, even without readily available artwork and summaries in my language. But most of all, Netflix says it will be “empowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions.” For instance, the letter boasts that AI de-aging was used in Happy Gilmore 2, and that the producers of Billionaires' Bunker used Generative AI tools for concept art. But how does Netflix regard Sora 2, the video generator that plunged the internet into copyright hell upon its release last month? Sarandos, for his part, is not telegraphing some kind of rapid slopification at Netflix—and he hastens to add that he's not intimidated by Sora 2 currently. According to Sarandos, “it's likely to have a lot more impact on UGC creators the most in the near term. If you're a YouTuber who hasn't already agreed to a Netflix deal, and you're worried that Sora 2 is coming to eat your lunch, Sarandos' suggestion that your business model is more vulnerable than his could be part of an effort to win you over. But Sarandos says AI “doesn't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not.” For once a tech CEO talking about AI doesn't sound like he's sharpening his layoffs ax. “We're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster, and in new ways,” Sarandos said, adding, “We're all in on that.” The media giant which owns HBO, Warner Bros., and CNN is reviewing several bids that could reshape Hollywood. The board game is popular worldwide, but its premise of building settlements and trading resources doesn't seem especially cinematic. The Netflix hit may get a big-screen showcase for its feature-length farewell. Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz star in the film, now in theaters and coming to Netflix November 7. Before Netflix drops season five, you can escape the Rainbow Room with Sandbox VR's new game, 'Stranger Things: Catalyst.'</p>
