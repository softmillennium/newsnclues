Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the U.S. carried out a strike against alleged drug vessel on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in the Eastern Pacific. The U.S. military carried out another strike on a suspected drug vessel, this time in the Eastern Pacific, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday. "Yesterday, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics," Hegseth said. "There were two narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. The suspect drug smuggling vessel is shown at left, moments before it was destroyed in a U.S. strike on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Earlier this week, Hegseth announced that three alleged narco-terrorists were killed in a U.S. strike on a drug smuggling vessel affiliated with Colombia's National Liberation Army. That "lethal kinetic strike" happened Friday in international waters at the direction of President Donald Trump, Hegseth wrote in a post on X. "The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics," Hegseth wrote. The suspect drug smuggling vessel is shown at left, moments before it was destroyed in a U.S. strike on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Colombia's Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) is a designated terrorist organization. Hegseth likened the Colombian rebel group to the al Qaeda terror group founded by Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan. The death toll from the Trump administration's military campaign against suspected drug-smuggling vessels is at least 34. The operations began last month and are part of Trump's broader effort to dismantle transnational cartels by force. Last Thursday, the U.S. military carried out a strike on what Trump later called a "very large drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean, killing two suspected narco-terrorists and capturing two others alive. The U.S. killed six alleged drug traffickers on a boat in international waters near Venezuela, President Donald Trump announced Oct. 14, 2025. A separate strike on Tuesday killed six suspected smugglers aboard a vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president keeps claiming a major American city is burning down. The place is burning down, just burning down.” Trump noted that an appeals court on Monday overturned one of the two rulings that have temporarily blocked his attempt to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, then added: “You look at a place like Portland, it's just — it's ridiculous, when they say that there's no problem. But Portland was nothing remotely resembling “burning down” over the weekend. It still wasn't when Trump made these comments on Tuesday. And it wasn't when Trump made such claims on previous occasions over the last month. It's possible that Trump saw images of small fires that started near the ICE building on Saturday after federal agents deployed tear gas and smoke devices to disperse protesters there. The Oregonian newspaper reported Tuesday in a debunking of Trump's latest “burning down” claims: “Federal agents used tear gas against the crowd and sparks from canisters set several small fires, but rain and a lack of fuel quickly extinguished them.” Leaving aside the matter of why these fires started, the president's categorical declaration that a city of 145 square miles and more than 630,000 residents is “burning down” is clearly not substantiated by the brief existence of small fires on one block. He said the department responded to about nine total fires a day from Friday to Monday, “significantly fewer” than during the same period last year, and that about half of them were trash fires. The Oregonian reported that a business was damaged by an “explosive” Friday afternoon fire in an RV that had been parked beside it. You can check out live video shots of Portland yourself to see how far from the truth the president's claims were as of this article's publication on Wednesday. Trump has made similarly baseless assertions about Portland on multiple occasions in September and October. He has falsely said that “Portland is burning to the ground” and that “Portland's been on fire for years”; falsely said the city doesn't “even have stores anymore” and that people “don't even put glass up” on windows, only plywood; and groundlessly referred to “War ravaged Portland.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump's comments on October 6 by encouraging reporters “to go on the ground and to take a look at for yourself.” The next day, CNN correspondent Shimon Prokupecz made clear from the ground in Portland that the president's descriptions are detached from reality. “Keep in mind, this is all happening on less than a single block, not even in the city center,” Prokupecz said of the protest clashes around the ICE building, which have included occasional flag-burning by protesters. If you weren't looking for it, you'd never know anything was happening on that one city block outside the ICE building.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At this moment, a panel of judges is hearing arguments related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. • While Trump leans on a new federal appeals court ruling backing his deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, he's urging the US Supreme Court to allow a similar effort in Chicago. • Immigration raids, meanwhile, keep flaring up across the country. Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh, who said federal agents pulled a gun on him during an encounter Tuesday in Chicago, wants Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release its own video of the incident. “I think what they said is an absolute lie,” Huynh, a Democrat, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Wednesday. Video posted on social media by Huynh shows multiple agents in fatigues and wearing face coverings surrounding a car he was traveling in. The agents appear to be carrying body cameras, although it is not clear whether they were in operation. Another agent was seen pointing a cell phone camera into the vehicle. The Department of Homeland Security has not commented on whether a gun was drawn, but spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Huynh, who has not been charged with a crime, was “stalking law enforcement and attempting to interfere with operations.” Huynh denies that claim, saying he is part of a “rapid response” group that goes to communities where ICE is operating in order to inform residents of their legal rights. In June, US District Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, handed California Gov. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel allowed the troops to remain in federal hands while the lawsuit unfolds. The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Judge Breyer's June order. ICE agents arrested street vendors in New York's Chinatown. The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that nine people in the country illegally were arrested during a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown's Canal Street in Manhattan Tuesday. The popular and highly trafficked area is well-known for its street vendors who sell counterfeit designer goods. In a social media post, DHS said those arrested had “violent rap sheets” including “robbery, burglary, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, drug possession and forgery.” The nine men arrested were originally from Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania, according to DHS. In video obtained by CNN, people could be seen protesting the arrest of the street vendors, and trying to intervene by stopping traffic. Many of the ICE officers were masked and armed, video shows. City and state leaders have condemned the operation, including New York Gov. Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at gunpoint while he was patrolling the community on Tuesday. “Today I was stopped by ICE at gunpoint,” Huynh wrote on X. We might fight back against this regime that has no place in America,” Huynh added. “I'm State Representative Hoan Huynh,” he said multiple times in the video. Huynh and the driver explained in the video they were following an ICE vehicle as another one appeared to follow them behind. The video doesn't show what happened when they were initially stopped, and later they are heard talking about seeing a weapon. CNN asked Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin about Huynh's claim that he was held at gunpoint, but she did not immediately comment on that allegation. In a statement McLaughlin said Huynh was stopped twice “for stalking law enforcement and attempting to interfere with operations.” This behavior is unbecoming of a public servant and is just another example of sanctuary politicians putting our officers at risk,” McLaughlin said. As President Trump's plan to deploy members of the National Guard to Chicago remains hung up in court challenges, a former mayor of the city says having military troops on city streets would not help law enforcement. Sending the National Guard is even dumber than dumb,” Rahm Emanuel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Although guardsmen are primarily slated to provide security for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in suburban Chicago that has been the site of regular protests, President Trump has cited crime in Chicago more broadly as a reason for deployment, calling the city a “hellhole” last month. Military intervention – even if constitutional – would be an ineffective stopgap, Emanuel said. The American Civil Liberties Union Wednesday called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing. ﻿The nonprofit and its partner organizations said they have met with more than 12 women held in ICE processing centers in Basile, Louisiana, and Lumpkin, Georgia, including some of whom were pregnant, or who had recent miscarriages while in detention. In a letter to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons an﻿d other agency officials, the ACLU described what the woman said they have experienced. “Our interviews indicate that ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” the ACLU and other organizations said. For context:﻿ A 2021 ICE policy states “individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing” should not be detained, arrested or taken into custody for violating immigration laws, except in “exceptional circumstances.” In August, DHS responded to allegations about the treatment of pregnant women in immigration detention, saying they “receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care.” Ruben Torres Maldonado's partner shared that she now has to care for the couple's 4-year-old son as well as act as the main caretaker for Ofelia, which includes draining her abdomen to relieve fluid at least twice a day. “During his arrest he did not comply with instructions from the officers and attempted to flee in his vehicle and backed into a government vehicle. Torres Maldonado has a hearing tomorrow where he will seek an order to be released by ICE on his own recognizance or to be provided with a bond hearing before an immigration judge, family attorney Kalman Resnick said. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, speaking with FOX news today, said the public will see “an increase in ICE arrests,” in New York City, “because there are so many criminal illegal aliens that have been released in New York.” There was a specific reason, based on criminal intelligence and criminal activity, that we showed up on Canal Street,” Lyons said. “You will see us making those criminal arrests to make New York safe again,” he added. US District Judge April Perry told the plaintiffs and defendants there are “three options” at today's hearing over deploying the National Guard to Chicago. US District Court Judge April Perry is holding a hearing on whether to extend an order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. Perry temporarily blocked the deployment in Illinois earlier this month. Her decision could be moot depending on the Supreme Court, which the Trump administration has asked to intervene and allow Guard troops to be deployed. The Supreme Court could rule quickly, possibly within days. A CNN producer is in the courtroom and will provide updates. Gavin Newsom will deploy the California National Guard under his command on a “humanitarian mission” to support food banks amid food benefits delays during the federal government shutdown, his office announced on Wednesday. “Millions of Americans rely on food benefits to feed their families, and while Republicans in Washington drag their feet, California is stepping up once again to fill in the gaps. I'm expediting state funds for food banks and directing the California National Guard and California Volunteers to help distribute this food to families,” Newsom said. A chaotic scene unfolded on Tuesday afternoon when ICE agents began arresting illegal street vendors on Canal Street in downtown Manhattan, a law enforcement official told CNN. An “emergency protest” has been organized for tonight at Manhattan's Foley Square. On Monday, a judge in Tennessee district court denied Harris' and other plaintiffs' request to temporarily prevent the National Guard deployment before the hearing, according to CNN affiliate WMC, but set a hearing for November 3 in Nashville. The deployment comes as the city has grappled with violent crime, including persistently high rates of homicides and carjackings, in recent years. Even so, both Democratic and Republican officials have pointed to declines in some crime categories this year. In June, US District Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, handed California Gov. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel allowed the troops to remain in federal hands while the lawsuit unfolds. Today the appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Judge Breyer's June order. Attorneys for the city of Chicago will speak to a federal judge this morning, urging her to extend the temporary restraining order that prevents National Guard troops from being deployed in Chicago. The Supreme Court has not given a deadline for making its decision. Speaking from the White House yesterday, President Trump said he feels empowered to send the National Guard into any city he sees fit, on the heels of a ruling by an appeals court  that endorsed his deployment into Portland, Oregon. I can send the National Guard if I see problems,” Trump told reporters after a Diwali event in the Oval Office. “You would think that would be common sense: We have the right to use the National Guard to put out trouble. The justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of National Guard members to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city's suburbs.</p>

Michigan State men's basketball coach Tom Izzo ripped the NCAA's recent decision to allow former NBA G League players to play college ball. Thierry Darlan, 21, committed to Santa Clara last month after spending parts of two seasons in the G League, while London Johnson, who spent three seasons in the league, will attend Louisville. Izzo said today's college basketball has "no rules," and "kids aren't the problem, we're the problem." Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo exits the court after a 70-64 loss to Auburn in the Elite Eight round of the NCAA tournament at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, on Sunday, March 30, 2025. (Junfu Han / USA Today Network via Imagn Images) "I am going to get myself in trouble. … I'm not real excited about the NCAA or whoever is making these decisions, without talking to us, just letting it go. "Someone is going to say, 'Well, if they go pro and it doesn't work out, they should be able to come back.' Well, what about the freshmen you recruited there? That's somebody's son and he thinks he's got himself a good place, and all of a sudden, shazam, they pull out of their hat and bring a 21- or 22-year-old in (from the G League). Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo gestures in the second half of a game against New Mexico in the second round of the NCAA men's college basketball tournament Sunday, March 23, 2025, in Cleveland. Whoever made those decisions because they're afraid that a lawyer is going to sue them, sooner or later, you've got to fight the fight. Izzo said that the NCAA has "got to regroup" and again absolve the players themselves of any blame. Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo looks on during practice day ahead of the NCAA men's basketball tournament at Spectrum Center on March 20, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I'm not going to be mad at the players. "So don't blame the players anymore. And then the unintended consequences hurt kids that are trying to do it the right way with a process, not jumping around." Izzo's Spartans made the Elite Eight last season but lost to Auburn.

Former California Democratic state Senate leader Gloria Romero reacts to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's decision to withhold federal funding from California over the state's failure to enforce English-language requirements for truck drivers. Republicans in California are launching an effort to require voters to show ID before casting their ballots. Assemblymember Carl DeMaio is raising funds for the initiative through his grassroots organization Reform California. "Voter ID is about restoring not only internal controls to improve the process but restoring public trust and confidence in our democracy," DeMaio told NBC Bay Area. "People are harboring concerns about how our elections are being conducted, and it's hard to show and prove voter fraud because you don't know how many votes are being fraudulently cast because there are no internal controls or checks," he said. Republicans in California are pushing to require voter ID with a ballot initiative. As of Wednesday, the petition has collected over 300,000 signatures. Across the U.S., 36 states have laws that require voters to present some form of identification to cast a ballot on Election Day. Of those, 24 require photo IDs, according to Ballotpedia. President Donald Trump signed an election integrity executive order earlier this year that, among other things, required voters to provide proof of citizenship. In April, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down the portions of that order that related to voter identification requirements. U.S. President Donald Trump tries to enact voter ID requirements through an executive order. Kollar-Kotelly maintained that Trump did not have the authority to issue such an order, as the Constitution delegates control of election regulations to Congress and states. "Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would affect many of the changes the President purports to order," Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee, wrote in her order. "No statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order." A poll from Gallup taken just before the 2024 elections found that 84% of U.S. adults were in favor of requiring voters to show identification and 83% supported requiring proof of citizenship when registering for the first time.

Federal agents walk down Lafayette Street as demonstrators follow along after an immigration sweep on Canal Street through Chinatown, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — An immigration enforcement operation that sparked spontaneous protests on Manhattan's Canal Street led to the arrests of 14 people, federal authorities said Wednesday, including several demonstrators accused of assaulting or obstructing agents. Droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded a group of federal agents Tuesday afternoon after they began questioning and detaining street vendors on the busy commercial strip, known for its sidewalk bazaars and shops selling knock-off designer goods. Law enforcement raids aimed at combating counterfeiting are relatively frequent on Canal Street, but the sight of dozens of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents making arrests drew instant protests. Activists who rushed to the scene joined with bystanders, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, and shouted at the agents, at one point blocking their vehicle. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with stun guns or pepper spray before detaining them. Four more people were arrested for allegedly assaulting federal law enforcement officers, she said. McLaughlin called the initial sweep “a targeted, intelligence-driven” operation “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.” She said some of the people arrested by authorities had previously been accused of crimes, including “robbery, burglary, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, drug possession, and forgery.” “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. Andrew Cuomo, similarly, said it was “more about fear than justice.” Canal Street is famous globally as a place to buy counterfeit designer and bootlegged goods, and federal authorities often partner with the city's police department and luxury brands on crackdowns aimed at shutting down the illicit trade. Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said the police department had no involvement in Tuesday's sweep. “Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said. This story was corrected to reflect that the arrests happened Tuesday, not Thursday.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From Maldives to the Democratic Republic of Congo, there has been stunning progress in tackling diseases. It's not an exaggeration to say that hope is in short supply these days in global health. Across Southeast Asia, thousands of pregnant women still pass on these infections to their babies each year. Hepatitis B alone affects more than 42 million people in the region, according to the World Health Organization. For one country to shut down the transmission of all three is a genuine public-health moonshot. That was possible because of the country's universal health coverage, which has enabled almost every expectant mother to receive antenatal care during her pregnancy that includes a test for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B. (Meanwhile, the US is pushing to delay that childhood dose of hepatitis B.) The Maldives also spends about 10 percent of its GDP on health — among the highest in Asia — a number that's climbed steadily since it introduced universal health coverage in 2012. (My colleague, Dylan Scott, has written about how other countries make universal health care work, and what the US can learn from it.) “This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal,” WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press release. But even countries that don't spend 10 percent of their GDP on health are making meaningful progress to stop deadly infectious diseases. The Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has faced recurring Ebola outbreaks since the late 1970s, has managed to swiftly get its latest one under control. The latest outbreak, declared on September 4, infected 64 people and killed 43. There have been no new cases since September 25 — a notably quick containment for a virus that, in past outbreaks, has lingered for months. Now, a 42-day countdown — twice Ebola's 21-day incubation period, long enough to be sure no new infections emerge — is underway. If no new cases emerge during that window, the outbreak will be officially declared over. There's progress too, against lesser-known but equally consequential infectious diseases. Fiji, an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, recently became the 26th country to eliminate trachoma, a bacterial infection that affects the inner layer of the eyelid and can lead to permanent blindness if untreated. (In 2021, trachoma blinded an estimated 400,000 people globally.) The win didn't come out of nowhere. Since 2012, researchers with the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, funded in part by USAID, have surveyed over 2.6 million people across 35 countries to pinpoint where trachoma infections still persist. Maldives, Congo, and Fiji are vastly different countries — in geography, resources, and the diseases they face — but together they tell a hopeful story in global public health: With a sustained investment in health, the political will to match, and relentless community-level work, progress against even the most persistent problems is possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Finalizing a $20 billion lifeline for Argentina using taxpayers' funds during the government shutdown was an essential action for the agency, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources. “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN. The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent announced earlier this month is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina's central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it's a loan from the US government. The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he'll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful. FAQ: Why America just bailed out Argentina with a $20 billion lifeline While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent's announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it. Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement. The Treasury Department didn't respond to CNN's inquiry. Bessent has spent much of this week meeting with foreign finance ministers in Malaysia. Last week, Bessent said he'd be meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have recently escalated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until recently, these businesses had significant losses and floundering stock prices in common. So far this year, billions of dollars have flowed into companies that have reinvented themselves by making the buying and holding of cryptocurrency their main focus. More than 200 public companies have announced plans to hold crypto on their balance sheets as so-called digital asset treasury companies, or DATs. The rebranding as crypto companies came after years of losses in a variety of niche enterprises that include making lavender-flavored vodka, manufacturing materials for indoor marijuana growers, and selling ozone-infused water as part of a “nanobubble” cleaning technology. The trend has attracted a wide range of people, from obscure to more well-known investors. “We're going to change finance forever, it's that simple,” President Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, said in August at a Nasdaq opening bell ringing ceremony for a new DAT focused on a cryptocurrency founded by the Trump family. But just how transformative the DAT craze will be remains to be seen, as questions mount about the sustainability of this trend. Many new DATs have seen prolonged stock slides after receiving an initial bump. “We are probably past peak DAT, if we're being honest about it,” said Austin Campbell, the founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting and an adjunct professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. Publicly traded companies turn themselves into DATs by raising money through the sale of stocks and then use that money to buy types of crypto. The first wave of crypto treasury companies focused on bitcoin while more recently companies have started buying large stakes in more niche and unproven forms of cryptocurrency. One reason DATs are booming is that buying and managing crypto holdings—especially newer tokens—can be daunting for newcomers. Lee, founder of the crypto project Story, said even sophisticated investors hesitate to manage digital wallets. “Here you just go to your brokerage account … you just buy the shares,” Lee said in an interview with CoinDesk. His crypto company, which focuses on trying to monetize intellectual property, has been backed by the heavy-hitting venture capital fund a16z crypto. Story recently partnered with Heritage Distilling, a Washington-based maker of chocolate-flavored whiskey and lavender vodka, to form a new DAT. It can also mean big payouts to some of the company executives and others involved. Justin Sun is one of the most visible figures in crypto. The founder of the Tron blockchain, Sun is a billionaire who has been a key investor in Trump family crypto projects and was invited earlier this year to a dinner with the president. Sun has also been in legal fights with former employees who alleged abuse, the media mogul David Geffen, who alleged Sun committed fraud related to the sale of a pricey sculpture, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused of him of market manipulation and improperly paying celebrities like Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul to tout Sun's crypto. That case was paused shortly after Trump took office and Sun made a triumphant appearance on Wall Street in July when he wore a tuxedo to help ring Nasdaq's opening bell to mark a new Tron-focused DAT. The company that turned to Sun's crypto for its treasury is SRM Entertainment, a firm with a history of losses that sells theme park knickknacks. He cut his teeth as a broker at Stratton Oakmont, an infamous boiler room brokerage featured in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” where he once agreed to pay $125,000 to settle customer complaints of wrongdoing, according to regulatory documents. In the days after the company announced it was transitioning to a Tron-focused DAT, Miller exercised stock options that allowed him to buy shares for 56 cents each and then sell them just as the stock was peaking for more than $10. Miller's total stock sales totaled more than $1 million. The stock price has fallen significantly since then. Safety Shot and its predecessors' product history include health products meant to address herpes cold sores, hair loss and “women's sexual wellness.” The company has been accused of taking unethical steps to try to boost flagging stock prices. Organizers for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival sued the company last year after alleging it released a “bogus press release” indicating it was a festival sponsor. A judge later issued an injunction against Safety Shot. Alt5 Sigma was a little-known fintech company before it pledged in August to buy $1.5 billion worth of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial tokens. Its predecessor, JanOne, was sued by the SEC in 2021 for allegedly conspiring to issue false financial reports. The SEC continues to pursue a case against former CEO Jon Isaac, whose father now serves as Alt5's president. Alt5's Canadian subsidiary was recently convicted of money laundering in Rwanda, and the company has also been accused of conspiring with its former chief financial officer to hide stock from creditors, according to its SEC filings. Eric Trump was initially set to join Alt5's board of directors, but the company said that he would instead be an “observer” in order “to comply with Nasdaq's listing rules.” During a crypto boom in 2017 and 2018, several companies rebranded as firms focused on blockchains, the technology that powers crypto transactions. Photo company Kodak launched a crypto token called KodakCoin while a company called Long Island Iced Tea rebranded as Long Blockchain Corp. Several companies that underwent a crypto rebrand back then enjoyed short increases in their stock prices but did not find lasting success. The Long Island tea company's shift to crypto, for example, led to it being delisted from Nasdaq and several individuals being charged with insider trading. But Jason Rozovsky, who is head of policy at the crypto firm Axelar, said the SEC's move isn't “necessarily bad news.” “Investor interest in bitcoin DATs has continued to grow, even as ETFs and other compliant options have become available, which suggests these structures may remain a durable part of the market.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Jeff Merkley has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than 18 hours after announcing he would protest what he called President Donald Trump's “grave threats to democracy.” President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. Bending his legs at times, highlighting the physical strain that comes with committing to standing for so long, Merkley had delivered the sixth longest floor speech in modern history as he continued speaking into the afternoon. Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again. Merkley's marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 11 times until their demands are met. There is expected to be another procedural vote on the Republican proposal once Merkley finishes speaking. The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration's previous halting of research grants for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the recent indictments of several of the president's political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland. “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion. Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement. His comments on the situation in Oregon come after an appeals court on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so. “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court's permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.” This was also not Merkley's first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017 against Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court. In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and his administration informed Congress last month that the United States is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels that are smuggling narcotics into the country, using it as justification for the strike campaign that began last month. Since the strikes began, U.S. forces have killed more than two dozen people but have not shown evidence to prove there were drugs aboard the targeted vessels. Trump announced the two would be repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. Ecuador has decided not to pursue charges against one of the survivors. In previous armed conflicts, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. troops would take enemy fighters prisoner if the situation arose, while historically, drug smugglers who were caught in Central America prior to this campaign would be detained by U.S. law enforcement and often charged. “We've been told that these attacks have been directed against people that the administration is absolutely certain are what they call unlawful combatants,” professor Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University, told the Washington Examiner. “Well, if they were so certain about that, then why would you let these people go?” The administration has not provided any evidence to prove that these vessels were carrying drugs. There has been little public congressional oversight while lawmakers seek additional information from the administration. “There really is pretty widespread bipartisan skepticism [and] concern about the operation thus far. “I think that has really just become more and more clear, it's about regime change in Venezuela and applying maximum pressure on the regime there.” Trump is also taking further action against Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he called an “illegal drug leader” on Sunday, by cutting U.S. subsidies to the South American country. Petro accused the U.S. of killing an innocent Colombian fisherman in a strike last month. Hegseth announced over the weekend that the U.S. killed three people last Friday on a vessel that he said had ties to a Colombian terrorist organization, Ejército de Liberación Nacional, or National Liberation Army.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alvaro had been found guilty in July of bribing a paramilitary witness to lie about alleged links to him, but a Colombian appeals court overturned that conviction. Petro decried the latest ruling on social media, accusing Uribe of being aligned with Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups. In recent days, tensions between the U.S. and Colombia have escalated as the U.S. military continues to strike Venezuelan and Colombian vessels that President Donald Trump alleges are carrying drugs. He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. for allegedly murdering a Colombian fisherman in one of its Caribbean strikes last month. At least 32 people have been killed in these strikes since early September. Maduro faces federal charges in the U.S. related to his alleged narcoterrorism and drug-trafficking ties. In an interview with Univision on Monday, Petro suggested Trump should be overthrown because of his threats against Colombia's sovereignty. After his comments sparked backlash from Latino Republicans in Congress, he rushed to defend himself. “I didn't threaten Trump,” the Colombian president wrote on X. Following Uribe's acquittal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated the news. “Colombia's justice has prevailed as former President Uribe is absolved after years of the political witch hunt against him and his family,” Rubio said in a statement. Rubio has been particularly vocal against Uribe's prior conviction, which he once condemned as “the weaponization of Colombia's judicial branch.”</p>

HELODRANON'NY RANOBE, Madagasikara — Ny haran-dranomasina (vatohara) izy tenany dia tena tsara tokoa. Miaina any amin'ny dimy kilaometatra miala ny morontsiraka izy ireo, any amin'ny rano lalina manodidina ny dimy ambin'ny folo metatra, ary dia toy ny tany mikitoantoana misy loko mavokely, manga, ary volomboasary, mipetraka ao anatin'ny ranomasina manga lalina. Fa nisy zavatra iray mazava tsara tsy hita tao: trondro. Maraina mazava tamin'ny volana Septambra ny andro, ary tamin'izay no nanaovako fijibihana (plongée) tao amin'ny haran-dranomasina iray tao atsimon'ny andrefan'i Madagasikara, firenena nosy iray ao atsinanan'i Afrika. Ary toy ny haran-dranomasina maro amin'ny faritra manodidina sy ny hafa maneran-tany, dia efa eo andalam-pahasimbana izy ireo. Ny fitomboan'ny hafananan'ny ranomasina sy ny hamafin'ny rivodoza, miampy ny fandripahana ala any an-tanety, dia anisan'ny loza ho an'ny haran-dranomasin'io firenena io, izay isan'ny manana karazana biby sy zavamaniry maro indrindra eto amin'izao tontolo izao. Olana lehibe izany ho an'ny olona manamorona ny morontsiraka eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara. Ao amin'ny haran-dranomasina ny trondro no matory, no mihinana, no miafina ny ireo biby mpihaza, ka raha tsy eo intsony izany dia sahirana izy ireo amin'ny fahavelomany. Io fifanoherana eo amin'ny fiainan'olombelona sy ny fiainan'ny biby io dia tsy eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara ihany no misy azy. Ity nosy ity, izay onenan'ny olona manodidina ny 33 tapitrisa, dia isan'ireo firenena mahantra indrindra eran-tany, ka manodidina ny 80 isanjaton'ny mponina no miaina amin'ny vola latsaky ny 12 000 ariary isan'andro. Matetika tsy manan-tsafidy hafa ny olona afa-tsy ny miankina mivantana amin'ny tontolo iainana mba hahazoana izay ilaina amin'ny fiainana. Ao anatin'izany anefa, ny fanjakana dia tsy nahavita nanome akory ny tolotra fototra toy ny jiro azo antoka sy rano madio — mainka moa fa na dia lalana hivoahana amin'ny fahantrana sy amin'ny fiankinana amin'ny fitrandrahana. Tamin'ity vanim-potoana fararano ity, izany tsy fahombiazan'ny fanjakana izany dia niteraka fihetsiketsehana tao anatin'ny herinandro maromaro izay notarihin'ny tanora manerana an'i Madagasikara, izay eo amin'ny 20 taona eo ho eo ny salan-taonany. Noho ny filàna mavesatra misy amin'ny maha olombelona, tsy mahagaga raha maro amin'ireo tontolo iainana malaza eto amin'ny firenena no mihasimba ihany koa. Saika ny karazana gidro rehetra, biby izay hita eto Madagasikara ihany — dia tandindomin-doza ho lany tamingana. Ny fanjakana sy ireo fikambanana tsy miankina dia nandany am-polony taona maro — sy vola an-jatony tapitrisa dolara avy amin'ny fanampiana avy any ivelany — mba hiatrehana ireo olana ireo amin'ny fomba izay efa nahazatra, toy ny fananganana faritra arovana izay mandrara ny fanjonoana. Ary hita mazava fa io no antony lehibe nahatonga ireo tetikasa fiarovana maro tsy nahomby any amin'ireo toerana manankarena biby sy zavamaniry, izay matetika hita any amin'ireo firenena mahantra. Ny toerana toy Madagasikara dia mampiseho fa ilaina ny fomba fiarovana amin'ny fomba hafa — fomba izay tena mametraka ny olona sy izay ilainy ho fototra iaingana, mba hiaina tsara sy ho feno fahatanterahana. Izay indrindra no nahatonga ahy nakany amin'ny Helodranon'ny Ranobe, toerana nandalovako herinandro tamin'ny volana Septambra. Niaraka tamin'ny mpanjono sy ekipa mpikaroka iraisam-pirenena aho, nitsidika fikambanana kely iray izay manandrana mamerina amin'ny laoniny ny jono sy ny vokatra azo avy aminy, nefa tsy manakana ny jono mihitsy. Tony ny ranomasina ary feno sambo kely misy lay rehefa tonga indray maraina aho teo amoron-dranomasina tao Ambolimailaky, tanàna mpanjono iray. Ireo lay tsofin-drivotra — maro amin'izy ireo vita amin'ny gonim-bary efa nampiasaina ary nozairina miaraka — no nitondra ny lakana hazon'ireo mpanjono, izay antsoin'izy ireo hoe lakan-day na lakam-boaly, ho eny amin'ny morontsiraka. Eto Madagasikara sy amin'ny faritra hafa eto Afrika, tsy zava-baovao ny mahita mpanjono mampiasa ireo lay fiaro amin'ny moka (moustiquaire) ireo — izay matetika omen'ny fikambanana mpanampy hiarovana amin'ny tazomoka — mba hanjonona trondro. Ny hafa kosa nanana vata feno eo amin'ny antsasany misy trondro toy ny Votrandra, Lafo, Bodoloha, ary zanaka Mandrandovoke. Nisy ankizy vitsivitsy nametraka trondro vitsivitsy mbola velona, toy ny Fia maintsy, tao anaty vilany vy mba hilalaovany. Nisy zaza roa lahy, tokony mbola mpianatra raha ny taonany, nampiseho tamiko siny plastika iray nisy zanaka horita (poulpe) roa ambin'ny folo izay nosamboriny. Nifangaro ny tanan'ireo horita (poulpe) ireo ary tototrin'ny ranomaintiny. Amin'ny maha olona avy any Etazonia ahy izay tsy mpanjono, nahatsapa alahelo aho nahita ireo biby marobe maty sy mbola niala aina. Fa ho an'ireo mpanjono eto dia hafa tanteraka ny fifandraisany amin'ireo biby ireo — ary manana ny antony tsara izany. Izany no fomba ahazoan'ny olona vola hividianana sakafo, fitaovam-pianarana, sy fitaterana. Ary amin'ny foko sasany — indrindra ny Vezo, foko iray manana fifamatorana lalina amin'ny ranomasina hatramin'ny razany — ny jono dia efa fomba fiainana hatramin'ny taranaka maro. “Raha tsy manjono aho, tsy mihinana,” hoy Nambokely, mpanjono iray nihaona tamiko teo amoron-dranomasina tao Ambolimailaky, tamin'ny alalan'ny mpandika teny. Ny mpanjono eto helodranon'ny Ranobe dia miasa tsy ankiato andro aman'alina. Feno zavamiaina madinika mamirapiratra teo ambonin'ny ranomasina, ary nirehitra izy ireo rehefa nosarihin'ny onja ny lohan'ny sambo, toy ny hoe nandeha teo ambonin'ny vovoka manjelanjelatra izahay. Fa ny tena nisy firantiana fahazavana lehibe dia tao anaty rano. Rehefa niala lavidavitra amin'ny morona izahay, dia niseho teo ambanin'ny onjan-dranomasina ireo tara-pahazavana samy mandeha haingana amin'izay halehany — mpanjono amin'ny alina ireo. Ireo mpanjono dia mitady ny haza tiany hohazana amin'ny fampiasana jiro tsy mataho-drano, izay indraindray dia jiro tsotra nofonosina amin'ny kapôty maromaro. Rehefa nipoitra avy anaty rano nitondra lamaira (murène) voatsatoka tamin'ny voloso (na lefona), ny mpanjono lehilahy Vezo iray antsoina hoe Jean Batiste, dia nilaza tamiko fa manjono amin'ny alina izy satria mahazo trondro betsaka kokoa noho ny amin'ny atoandro. Saingy, hoy i Jean Batiste — ary toy izany koa ny mpanjono rehetra niresaka tamiko tao Ranobe — mihamafy sy mihasarotra hatrany ny mahazo zavatra, ka lasa mihasarotra ihany koa ny mahazo vola. “Tena mampanahy” hoy i Jean Batiste tamiko tamin'iny alina iny teny an-dranomasina. Ao amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe sy amin'ny faritra maro eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara, miharatsy be ny jono, ary mety ho potika mihitsy aza. Fikarohana maro avy amin'ity faritra ity no manaporofo fa mihena ny trondro azon'ny olona sy ny isan'ny karaza-trondro azo raha oharina amin'ny telopolo na efapolo taona lasa. “Tafidina amin'ny taha tsy mbola nisy toy izany teo aloha,” hoy i Gildas Todinanahary, izay mpikaroka momba ny ranomasina, sady talen'ny IHSM. Nambaran'i Nambokely tamiko fa taloha, tamin'ny andro tsara, dia afaka nahazo 40 000 na 60 000 ariary ny mpanjono iray amin'ny andro iray monja. Fa amin'izao fotoana izao, vondrona misy mpanjono efatra na dimy no mandeha manjono mandritra ny ora maro eny an-dranomasina, kanefa trondro vitsivitsy fotsiny no mety azony, manodidina ny antsasaky ny siny plastika iray. Izany dia manodidina ny 20 000 ka hatramin'ny 40 000 ariary, hoy izy tamiko, ary tsy maintsy zarain'izy ireo mitovy. “Tsy ampy ny sakafo azon'olona anatin'ny indray andro,” hoy i Marcel Sebastian, mpanjono zokiny iray nihaona tamiko tao amin'ilay tanàna. Fa amin'ny fotoana henaniky zao, tsy mihina hany midi fa mihina hany hariva, izay izany ty fisehony.” Fa ny fanjonoana mihoapapana — tsindry izay mahatonga ny jono ho tafahoatra be ka tsy manome fotoana ho an'ny haran-dranomasina sy ny zava-manan'aina ao aminy mba hiverenan'ny ainy amin'ny laony. Izay no mitranga amin'izao fotoana izao eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara. Antony iray amin'izany dia ny fiovan'ny toetrandro. Rehefa tsy mahomby ny fambolena any an-tanety, dia mitombo ny isan'ny tantsaha eto Madagasikara izay mifindra any amin'ny morontsiraka mitady vola amin'ny alalan'ny jono. Sarotra ny mahita tarehimarika marina amin'ny isan'ny olona eto amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe, fa araka ny asa fikarohana iray tamin'ny taona 2019, dia nitombo 4,5 isan-jato isan-taona eo ho eo ny tanàna eto — midika izany fa mitombo avo roa heny ny mponina eto afaka 15 taona. “Maro amin'ireo olona tonga avy any an-tanety no tsy te honina eto,” hoy i Quinn Mitsuko Parker, mpikaroka manovo ny mari-pahaizana doctorat ao amin'ny Oniversiten'i Stanford, izay mianatra momba ny vondrom-piarahamonina mpanjono eto amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe. “Tsy te hanao asa fanjonoana izy ireo. Na dia tsy ampy intsony aza izany. Nanomboka nihalalina ny rano tamin'ny voalohany fa rehefa nandeha lavitra izahay dia nanomboka narivo indray — mandra-pahatongan'ny fotoana izay namparivo ny rano ka afaka nandehanay an-tongotra. Zavatra hafahafa be izany: eto izahay, kilaometatra vitsivitsy miala ny morontsiraka, nefa dia mandeha an-tongotra ety ambonin'ny faritra tokony hisy ranomasina. Mandeha eny ambonin'ny haran-dranomasina izy ireo mitady horita (poulpe), soky (oursin), ary biby madinika hafa hohanina na hamidy, lazaina amin'ny fomba fiteny hoe “mihaky” (pêche à pied) izany. Farafahakeliny vehivavy eo amin'ny roambinifolo eo no nihaky (pêche à pied) tamin'ny fotoana nahatongavanay teny, ary samy niondrika nijery ambany izy ireo no sady nandeha. Ny sasany nitondra voloso (na lefona), hanindromana horita (poulpe), ary ny hafa nitondra akorandriaka lehibe sahala amin'ny boziky (conque), izay ampiasainy hanokafana soky (oursin). Nankeo amin'ny vehivavy iray antsoina hoe Doseline aho, izay nanao kiraro tsy mitovy sy satroka be manarona masoandro. Sady niresaka izahay no sady nanindrona ny volosony tao anaty hara izy nitady horita (poulpe), ary indraindray izy nijanona naka akorandriaka kely sy nametraka izany tao anatin'ny kitapony. Nilaza tamiko i Doseline fa amin'izao fotoana izao dia antsasaky ny horita (poulpe) no azony raha oharina tamin'ny 10 na 20 taona lasa izay. Doseline dia renim-pianakaviana mpitondra-tena, ary izy no miandraikitra ny zanany lahy iray izay mbola mianatra. Nandalo teo ambonin'ny “étoile de mer” misy tsilo sy biby madinika miloko antsoina hoe limaces de mer izahay. Nahita aho akorandriaka foana izay nipetrahan'ny drakaka, biby toa avy amin'ny tontolo hafa izany. Doseline, izay manao bango mifity roa, dia tsy dia nahomby loatra “Malahelo aho fa tsy nahita horita ka holy” hoy izy tamiko. Tao anatin'ny telopolo taona izay, nanintona ny sain'ny maro avy amin'ny fikambanana iraisam-pirenena mpiaro tontolo iainana sy ny mpamatsy vola vahiny i Madagasikara.Ny biby eto amin'ny nosy dia tsy vitan'ny hoe manintona — Gidro! Satria efa ela be i Madagasikara no voasaraka tamin'ny tany hafa, dia nanana fotoana ampy ny biby sy zavamaniry ao hampivoatra ny karazany (espèce) ho karazana (espèce) hafa vaovao. Noho izany zava-dehibe izany, dia ny fikambanana lehibe iraisam-pirenena toa an'i Conservation International sy WWF dia efa niasa teto amin'ny nosy mba hiezaka hanakana ny fahapotehan'ny ala, ny fanjonoana mihoapapana, ary ny fahasimban'ny tontolo iainana amin'ny endriny rehetra. Ary ireo fikambanana mpanome fanampiana dia efa nandefa vola an-jatony tapitrisa dolara teto amin'ny nosy ho an'ny fiarovana. Ny olana lehibe indrindra dia ny fahantrana — izany dia tsindry mavesatra amin'ny tontolo iainana — izay mifamatotra akaiky amin'ny korontana ara-politika. Ny helodranon'ny Ranobe, ohatra, dia isan'ny faritra an-dranomasina voaaro amin'ny fomba ofisialy. Amin'ny tranga sasany, dia manavesatra manokana amin'ny vehivavy mpanjono ihany koa ireo fepetra ireo, satria manakana ny fidirany amin'ireo faritra anjonoana amin'ny fakan-javaboahary, araka ny nosoratan'i Merrill Baker-Médard tao amin'ny bokiny Feminist Conservation: Politics and Power in Madagascar's Marine Commons. Olana iray hafa eto Madagasikara, ary hita maneran-tany ihany koa, dia ny hoe ny ONG dia matetika tompon'andraikitra kokoa amin'ny mpamatsy vola noho amin'ny vondrom-piarahamonina misy azy, hoy i Emma Gibbons, mpitantana ny ReefDoctor, fikambanana kely iray ao amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe. Ireo mpamatsy vola, amin'ny ankapobeny, dia manohana tetikasa vitaina anaty fotoana fohy. Ary tsy dia ahitana fepetra raha tsy tena manampy ny olona na ny tontolo iainana ireo tetikasa ireo, hoy ihany izy. Ireo olana ireo dia hita mazava tsara indrindra eto atsimon'i Madagasikara, izay nantsoina mihitsy hoe “fasan'ny tetikasa” (cimetière de projet) satria maro be ireo tetikasa tsy nahomby. Raha te hahomby ny fiarovana, dia tsy maintsy avy amin'ny olona eny ifotony sy tarihin'izy ireo izany, ary mifototra amin'ny fahatakarana lalina ny kolontsaina sy ny zavatra tian'ny olona, hoy i Gibbons, izay teratany britanika izay nipetraka teto Madagasikara nandritry ny 20 taona. “Tsy azo tenenina olona hoe aza mihinana,” hoy i Gibbons. Tsy nanakana ny jono, toy ny fanao araky fomba fiarovana taloha izy, fa — miaraka amin'ny olona ao amin'ny fiarahamonina sy ekipa iray misy mpikaroka eo an-toerana sy vahiny — manandrana mamorona toerana maro kokoa azo anjonoana. Fa tsy manandrana manakana ny jono toy ny fomba fanao taloha amin'ny fiarovana, izy — miaraka amin'ny olona ao amin'ny fiarahamonina sy ekipa iray misy mpikaroka eo an-toerana sy vahiny — dia manandrana mamorona toerana maro kokoa azo anjonoana. Ary mba hanaovana izany, dia manangana haran-dranomasina vaovao tanteraka izy ireo.“Manantena izahay,” hoy i Gibbons, “fa afaka mampitombo ny velaran-tany azo anjonoana.” Izany dia mitovy amin'ny halavan'ny fiaramanidina mpitondra olona iray. Avy eo, avela hifindran'ny karazam-biby sy zava-maniry samihafa ireo vato ireo amin'ny alalan'ny fitaovana antsoina hoe ARMS (fanafohezana ny hoe autonomous reef monitoring structures) izay efa nijanona volana maro teo amin'ny hara voajanahary hanangona vatohara, eponge, ary biby madinika an-dranomasina hafa. Ireo fitaovana ireo, vita amin'ny takelaka vato maromaro mipetaka, dia toy ny fintambaran-javatra entina amelomana ny haran-dranomasina. Ny tsirairay amin'ireo dia misy andalana vato efatra, antsoina hoe spurs, izay feno ARMS efa misy karazam-biby sy zava-maniry samihafa. Nilamina ny ranomasina ary maitso kokoa fa tsy dia manga tamin'ny fotoana nahatongavako teo ambonin'ny iray amin'ireo hara artifisialy, manodidina ny iray kilaometatra miala amin'ny morontsiraka, niaraka tamin'i Mark Little, izay mpikaroka an-dranomasina. Mikaroka momba ny mikraoba ao amin'ilay hara izy. Nefa, na izany aza, dia nametaka “bouteille de plongée” aho ary niditra anaty rano. Rehefa nidina aho, dia niseho tsikelikely manoloana ahy miaraka amin'ilay maska manjavonjavona ireo vato, tahaka ny hoe midina anaty tanàna haolo sy very iny aho. Sendra nisy fay (raie) niseho avy tao amin'ny rano manjavozavo iny ary nandalo teo anoloako, dia nanjavona indray avy eo. Tamin'io fotoana io, nahatsapa aho fa simba loatra ny tontolo iainana ka tsy maintsy manomboka manangana izay efa rava indray isika. “Manao tsara ny asany izy,” hoy i Little, mpikaroka efa nahavite ‘doctorat' ao amin'ny Oniversiten'i Harvard sy ao amin'ny Scripps Institute of Oceanography, rehefa tafakatra teo amin'ny vedety izahay. Amin'ny taona ho avy vitsivitsy, ekipa iray ahitana mpikaroka eto an-toerana sy vahiny no hanao fikarohana momba ny fiantraikan'ireo haran-dranomasina noforonina amin'ny fiainan'ny zavaboary an-dranomasina sy ny asa fanjonoana eto — ary koa ny fiantraikan'izany amin'ny fahasalamana ara-batana sy ara-tsaina amin'ny olona monina amin'ireo tanàna manodidina. Chan School of Public Health sady anisan'ireo mandray anjara akaiky amin'ny tetikasa, dia isan'ny fikarohana lehibe indrindra eran-tany mampifandray ny fahasalaman'ny tontolo iainana sy ny fahasalaman'olombelona izany. Na koa hoe, ny fananganana indostria hafa izay tsy miankina amin'ny fitrandrahana. Mila fiovana lehibe be ny firenena mba hahombiazan'ny fiarovana. Mila fitantanana tsara izany, ary amin'izao fotoana izao dia mbola tsy manana govrnementa akory i Madagasikara. Saingy hoy ihany i Todinanahary, efa nampiditra vola an-tapitrisany dolara ho an'ny tetikasa fiarovana tontolo iainana ny ONG sy ny fikambanana mpanampy. Indraindray dia toy ny nijery krizy ara-tontolo iainana sy ara-pivelomana mitranga mivantana. Saingy i Gibbons, i Gildas, ary ireo siantifika Malagasy marobe manan-talenta dia mbola manam-panantenana sy miezaka manarina ny jono — satria tena efa atahorana ny toe-javatra. Rehefa anisan'io fiarahamonina io ianao, dia mahatsiaro ho tompon'andraikitra ao, ary izany no mahatonga ny tena tsy mahavita ny fitazanam-potsiny. Rehefa avy nijibika tao amin'ny hara artifisialy izahay, dia nitondra ahy tao amin'ny hara voajanahary iray, antsoina hoe Vatosoa, i Little. Taona vitsivitsy lasa izay, ny ReefDoctor dia nanangana hara artifisialy kely iray teo akaikin'ity hara voajanahary ity mba hanjonoan'olona. Tambin'izany anefa, ireo mpanjono eo an-toerana dia nanaiky tsy hanjono ao amin'ny Vatosoa, hoy i Gibbons tamiko. Kely ny fanantenako, indrindra rehefa avy nijibika tamin'ireo hara tsy nisy trondro. Ilay haran-dranomasina dia fitambaran'ny hara izay, rehefa mitombo dia manana endrika takelaka manify mifanindry toy ny ravin'ny voninkazo raozy. Ary nisy an-jatony teo amin'izy ireny nifampitohitohy, ka toy ny hoe nilomano teo ambonin'ny voninkazo lehibe iray izahay. Nanjavonjavona hatrany ny maska nanaovako, izay tena manelingelina, ka nofenoiko ranomasina tao anatiny ary nodioviko matetika. Rehefa afaka nijery mazava indray aho, dia nahita zavatra nitsingevana teo anoloako. Toy ny ahi-dranomasina ilay izy, saingy toa nifatotra tamin'ny vatana Angisy (calmar), biby an-dranomasina iray misy tanana valo sy “tentacule” roa. Rehefa nanakaiky aho dia nihemotra tsikelikely izy. “Ny fanantenana mba hiverenan'ny hatsarany dia mbola misy,” hoy i Gibbons tamiko indray hariva, raha nandeha teny amoron-dranomasina izahay tamin'ny filentehan'ny masoandro, sady nijery tsara ny lalana mba tsy hanitsaka akorandriaka maranitra. But there's another problem that no one's talking about. Consumers are finally pushing back on AI-driven data expansion. Clean energy expansion could destroy this crucial climate solution. This technology could feed a world of 10 billion. What the climate movement is getting dead wrong.</p>

NEW YORK (AP) — An immigration enforcement sweep targeting vendors on Manhattan's famed Canal Street turned chaotic on Tuesday after droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded federal agents and attempted to block them from driving off, prompting arrests and fierce standoffs along a bustling downtown corridor. The confrontation began shortly after 4 p.m., as federal agents fanned out across a section of Chinatown that has long served as a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes, electronics and other goods. In response, a contingent of protesters, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, surrounded the masked officers, attempting to block their vehicle as they shouted “ICE out of New York” and called on other pedestrians to join them. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with pepper spray before detaining them. As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agents were conducting an enforcement operation against sellers of “counterfeit goods” A woman stands in front of an armored vehicle operated by federal agents on Lafayette Street as demonstrators follow along after an immigration sweep on Canal Street through Chinatown, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in New York. At least one person was arrested for assaulting an officer, McLaughlin said. She did not respond to a request about how many vendors were detained. While clashes between immigration authorities and protesters have played out in Los Angeles and other cities, such scenes have been rarer on New York City streets, which Mayor Eric Adams has attributed in part to his working relationship with President Donald Trump's administration. Trump has threatened to send federal troops to the city if Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, wins election in two weeks. An FBI spokesperson said Tuesday that special agents were involved with immigration enforcement efforts in New York in response to a request from DHS to help with “major operations.” Federal agents walk down Lafayette Street as demonstrators follow along after an immigration sweep on Canal Street through Chinatown, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in New York. “Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said. “This operation had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with terrorizing immigrant families and communities,” he said.</p>

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) WASHINGTON (AP) — Leaders at the Pentagon have significantly altered how military officials will speak with Congress after a pair of new memos issued last week. In an Oct. 15 memo, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his deputy, Steve Feinberg, ordered Pentagon officials — including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to obtain permission from the department's main legislative affairs office before they have any communication with Capitol Hill. The memo was issued the same day the vast majority of Pentagon reporters exited the building rather than agree to the Defense Department's new restrictions on their work, and it appears to be part of a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over what the department communicates to the outside world. According to the memo, a copy of which was authenticated by a Pentagon official, “unauthorized engagements with Congress by (Pentagon) personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives.” Sean Parnell, the top Pentagon spokesman, called the move a “pragmatic step” that's part of an effort “to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency.” Previously, individual agencies and military branches within the Pentagon were able to manage their own communications with Congress. A second memo, issued Oct. 17, directed a “working group to further define the guidance on legislative engagements.” The memos were first reported by the website Breaking Defense.</p>
