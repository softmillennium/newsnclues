This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Struan, a 36-year-old consultant and résumé writer based in Scotland. Struan went viral when he worked at an Apple store in Vancouver, using his birth name, Sam Sung. He left the job due to a career switch. His words have been edited for length and clarity. Growing up, I received a few silly comments or playground chants about my name, Sam Sung, but nothing like what happened in my early 20s. During that time, I worked at an Apple store in Glasgow, Scotland. There were friendly jokes about Sam Sung working for Apple, but it wasn't a big deal. Then I moved to Vancouver and started working at an Apple retail store there. I peeked and saw a text from someone saying I'd gone viral on Reddit, and they sent me a link. It was 2012, and I had never heard of Reddit. I wasn't on social media, apart from LinkedIn, so I thought the link was a scam and ignored it. A few hours later, I received several missed calls from the Apple store. Someone had posted a picture of my Apple business card online, and it actually went viral. I had just moved to a new country. If Apple had fired me, it would've caused even more commotion. On my first shift back, a reporter came in to talk to me, and after that, Apple pulled me off the shop floor for a little while. Colleagues were told not to identify me when people came in and asked. Soon after, I lost access to my business cards. People came in and called asking if Sam Sung worked at the store, and I just pretended it wasn't me. I have a Scottish accent, and assumptions about what I would sound like based on my appearance meant that they didn't recognize me on the phone. I was ready to move on from retail and start a new career in recruitment. In 2014, I auctioned off one of my old business cards and other pieces of my old uniform for charity. It wasn't major by any means, but we ultimately auctioned the card off for over $2,500. That was the best part of this experience. It's not like being known for doing great work or being a philanthropist; it was just an online joke. Also, Samsung, the Big Tech company, has its own brand. I was early in my career, trying to establish myself, and from a social media and email perspective, all the handles were taken. This was especially true once I moved into recruitment, where an online presence and professional brand matter. I had already moved on from working at Apple and begun a new job search. After some consideration, I chose to adopt the last name Struan because it's the name of one of my favorite places in Scotland — a village on the Isle of Skye. Even though it's been over 10 years, people still call me Sam Sung in their phones. They just refuse to change it, including my sister. To be honest, my parents don't care too much. But sometimes, if it comes up in conversation that I worked at Apple, the moment arrives, and they'll be like, "Oh my god, are you that guy?" The reality is that I adopted a new name because I didn't want my name to be a joke, which it had already been. Studies have shown that your name can influence the number of opportunities you have and the likelihood of receiving interviews. Not to stress out about my job because it was fine, and maybe even go on LinkedIn and thank people for reaching out instead of deactivating my account. Do you have a story to share about going viral or changing your name in the workplace?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter The National Football League on Wednesday approved the purchase of a 10% stake in the New York Giants by Julia Koch in a transaction that values the team at $10.3 billion, according to two people who are close to the deal but not authorized to speak publicly. The deal marks the highest valuation placed on an NFL team for a team sale. CNBC broke the news in May that Koch was looking to buy a limited partnership piece of the Giants. The league also approved the sale of two other limited partner stakes, according to a person who is close to the approvals but does not have permission from the NFL to speak about them publicly. The person confirmed that Dean Metropoulos and private equity firm Sixth Street Partners bought an 8% stake in the New England Patriots in a deal that values the team at $9 billion, and that Fortress Investment Group Executive Chairman Pete Briger Jr. picked up a 3.2% stake in the San Francisco 49ers in a deal that values the team at about $8.6 billion. All three limited partner sales had to be approved by at least three-quarters of the NFL's owners. A person who is familiar with the deal but not authorized to speak about it publicly said the post-money valuation for the Patriots is $9.5 billion. The York family, which owns the 49ers, also sold a 6.2% stake in the team in May at an $8.6 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with that deal. Last month, a small piece of the Chicago Bears was sold at an $8.9 billion valuation; that deal set the previous record for a valuation in the sale of a minority stake in an NFL team. The last control purchase of an NFL team was when Josh Harris paid $6.05 billion to buy the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder in 2023. One reason NFL team values have been going up sharply is the expectation of much higher media rights. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC's Alex Sherman last month that the league could begin renegotiating its 11-year, $111 billion media rights deals as soon as next year. Another reason values are escalating is the introduction of private equity investors a year ago. Private equity firms are showing a great interest in buying into the NFL — the biggest and most profitable sports league in the world — and are boosting values by setting a floor on valuations and erasing concerns other limited partners may have had over liquidity, CNBC reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech giant Alphabet is contributing $22 million to help build the White House ballroom under a legal settlement reached with President Donald Trump last month over his being banned from the company's YouTube platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by his supporters. Images showing the demolition of part of the White House's East Wing to prepare for building the ballroom triggered public anger this week. Trump, who in July promised that the East Wing's structure would not be touched to build the ballroom, has promised that American taxpayers will not pay for the ballroom. Trump has said that he and private donors will cover the costs. "The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly," the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social Monday. But it is still unclear who all the other contributors are and how much they have agreed to pay for the ballroom's construction. Sources told CBS News in September that R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated. CNBC has reached out to these companies for comment. Trump chose McCrery Architects to design the ballroom. The construction team is led by Clark Construction and the engineering team is headed by AECOM, according to a White House statement from July. In July, Trump promised construction of the ballroom "won't interfere with the current building." "It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of," Trump said of the East Wing at the time. The Treasury Department banned its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing, saying this would pose a potential security risk. Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK — General Motors is targeting a suite of new software initiatives for its vehicles over the next three years, including an in-vehicle artificial intelligence assistant from Google and a driver-assistance system that can largely control the vehicle without human interaction or monitoring. GM said the conversational Google Gemini AI will begin launching in its vehicles next year, followed by the new driver-assistance system, which will allow drivers to be hands-free and take their eyes off the road under certain circumstances, in 2028. GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives made the announcements Wednesday as part of a "GM Forward" software event that also showcased other initiatives designed to "transform the car from a mode of transportation into an intelligent assistant," the automaker said. The company also announced that it is working on a new centralized computing platform, which is planned to roll out starting with the Escalade IQ in 2028; increased use of collaborative robots, also known as cobots, that can work alongside humans; and expanding availability of products from its GM Energy business. Its previous efforts at moving forward include announcing plans in 2021 to double revenue by 2030, led by many now-defunct growth businesses, as well as growing annual software and services revenue to between $20 billion to $25 billion. In recent years, it also killed an "Ultra Cruise" system meant to be able to drive in 95% of circumstances that was initially due to come out in 2023 and folded its Cruise robotaxi business. GM executives on Wednesday declined to discuss revenue potential of the new announcements. CFO Paul Jacobson has previously walked back the doubling revenue goal, but has noted the company's growing revenue, up 9.1% last year to $187.44 billion. GM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday said the company's revenue plans are "pretty much on track … maybe a year or two different" as it plans to continue to grow revenue, especially with the technologies announced Wednesday. He also said these initiatives are "very different" than prior announcements, as they're tangible products that are entering the market shortly. That's up from 2021, when the plans were announced, when it took the full year to hit that mark. It also cited $5 billion in deferred revenue, up 90% from a year earlier, to end the third quarter. The event comes a day after GM reported standout third-quarter earnings and upped its guidance, pushing the stock to have its second-best day on record since the automaker's 2009 emergence from bankruptcy. GM stock on Wednesday was trading relatively flat. GM said the AI system from Google, which its infotainment system is developed on, will make "it possible to talk to your car as naturally as you would to a fellow passenger." "Our vision is to create a car that knows you, that looks out for you, and just meets your needs, even before you say," Sterling Anderson, GM chief product officer, said during the event. GM also said it plans to develop its own "AI, custom-built" technology in the years to come but did not provide an exact timeframe. "In the future, we will introduce our own AI fine-tuned to your vehicle," said David Richardson, a former Apple executive who is now GM vice president of software and services engineering. It's going to anticipate your needs, offer timely help and make every journey more personable and more enjoyable." GM said it plans for its upgraded advanced driver-assistance system, also known as ADAS, to feature hands-free, "eyes-off" driving technology, beginning on the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV, which currently starts around $127,500, in 2028. They'll give customers back their most valuable asset: time. It'll be a cornerstone of GM product portfolio going forward," Anderson said. The vehicle will use lidar, or light detection and ranging, systems that allow the vehicle to better detect or "see" its surroundings. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has notably been a critic of the technology, and his company's vehicles rely on camera-based systems and computer vision. As it relates to use of lidar in it, your product will be better with multiple modes of sensing, period. GM declined to say whether the new technology will be called "Super Cruise," which is its current system that allows drivers to be hands-free on 600,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in North America. GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016, but it was slow to roll out the technology until recent years. Starting in 2026, GM said it will make its "Energy Home System" — which includes bi-directional electric vehicle charging and a stationary home battery — available via leasing, compared with outright purchasing the equipment. The leasing will begin with GM all-electric vehicles owners and later roll out to other homeowners interested in backup power and solar integration, the company said. GM Energy launched in 2022 as one of the automaker's growth initiatives involving EVs. GM has not disclosed the size or revenue of its GM Energy business other than a blog by Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, that said momentum for its services are growing. "It's really incredible to see all the great things that are right on the horizon, and I know we will deliver for our customers, and that's what matters most," Barra said.

When Nikki Ashkar and her husband Mike baked her grandmother's cinnamon buns for the first time, they didn't plan to start a million-dollar business. Since the start of 2024, it has generated more than $1 million, according to sales report records reviewed by Business Insider. Today, they bake the buns at a bakery in New Jersey. The frosting, a secret ratio of vanilla bean to cream cheese, is applied twice. "We ice every single nook and cranny," Nikki said, adding, "So that you never miss a good bite." She didn't want to call the business "Mike and Nikki's buns." Ultimately, they chose the name "Mav's Top Buns," named after her firstborn son, Maverick. Nikki said they have never paid for marketing or influencer promotions. For example, Nikki began posting photos and videos on the business's Instagram account in 2020, some of which have since gone viral. "But as we grew and as we got more viral, it just became one of those things where the more viral you get, the more people are going to comment whatever they want to comment, and it's good for the algorithm, it's good for us." One of the account's most viral posts features standard visuals but pairs them with an edgy audio clip that includes some profanity. "People related to things a lot when we were just authentically ourselves." It's not like the Insta page is filled with edgy content, however. Nikki opened the bakery while eight months pregnant, balancing a newborn, late-night bakes, and long lines of customers. "I think that's what people really grabbed onto, and that's why they love to support us because they know how hard a mom and dad work," Nikki said. "Sometimes we'd lose power and we'd roll buns by candlelight, but it was those times where it really separated the men from the boys, where if you keep going, you will succeed," she said. Nikki said their three children are already mimicking the family trade, rolling Play-Doh into miniature buns at home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery has rejected three Paramount Skydance takeover offers as it fields broad buyout interest, CNBC's David Faber reported Wednesday, citing sources. Paramount's last offer was for just under $24 per share and was comprised of 80% cash, according to Faber, who previously reported a bid could come in at between $22 and $24 per share. Reuters on Tuesday reported WBD had rejected a bid for nearly $24 per share. WBD said on Tuesday that it had received "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties and that it would expand its strategic review process to review all bids. At the same time, the company is moving ahead with previously announced plans to separate into two entities: a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. Faber reported Tuesday that Netflix and Comcast were among the interested parties. "It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market," Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in a statement Tuesday. "After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets," he said. Shares of WBD gained almost 11% on Tuesday. They were up another 1% in morning trading Wednesday. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beyond Meat shares slashed gains Wednesday, briefly dipping into negative territory as the meme stock rally faltered. The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages rose just 15% in midday trading Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME). That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short. On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores. Shares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the name soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The name is down more than 3% in 2025. The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal. This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took on online message boards such as Reddit's WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades. In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses. The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible artificial intelligence bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. In response to someone on WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote Wednesday, "Youre already down 7k, impressive."

For Amazon Web Services, these "solopreneurs" and bootstrapped startups have emerged as a "blind spot" in its customer discovery process, which heavily relies on connections with venture capital firms, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider. This has caused AWS to miss out on several high-growth startups as early customers, including SurgeAI and Base44. "This blind spot poses increasing risk to cloud market share," Amazon employees warned in the internal document. Amazon became the dominant cloud provider by working with early startups. Some of these nascent businesses grew into huge tech companies that spent heavily on compute, which drove demand for Amazon Web Services. The rise of generative AI is messing with this successful formula. This new technology helps some startups get going with fewer employees. These smaller, often self-funded, businesses look from the outside like less interesting cloud customers, when in fact they may retain the ability to grow into substantial enterprises. This is part of a broader challenge for AWS, which is seeing a "fundamental" shift in how AI startups spend on cloud computing, Business Insider previously reported. An Amazon spokesperson said it's "not true" that the company is missing early signals of fast-growth startups, adding that the company continues to "engage founders as early as we can, in collaboration with VCs, via programs like AWS GenAI Accelerator and AWS Activate." Replit's CEO Amjad Masad previously said the era of solo software creation has arrived, saying anyone can build an app in a few hours with the right AI prompt. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted last year that a "one-person billion-dollar company" would emerge because of AI. David Levy, a former manager on AWS' startup business development team, wrote in a blog post this week that AWS intentionally focused on founders early in their journeys to secure them as long-term customers. That approach accelerated AWS growth and led to roughly 70% adoption among startups backed by top-tier venture capital firms, he noted. Levy wrote that AI startups are now directing their initial spending toward GPUs, AI models, and inference tools, rather than traditional cloud compute or storage services, citing Business Insider's earlier report. Those are areas where no single cloud provider holds dominance, creating fresh challenges for vendors such as AWS. "AWS built an empire by chasing startups everyone else ignored," Levy wrote.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 2022, when Yoni Rechtman's boss asked where he wanted to be in five years, the newly hired venture capitalist told him, "Not here." It keeps funds small — "easier to return many multiples of success," Colleran said — and so the firm needs fewer investors. This month, Slow made an exception to its rule, giving Rechtman, 30, a seat at the partners' table. The firm, now nearing $1 billion in investor capital, has four partners investing out of its core seed funds. Many came of age during the frothy post-pandemic boom, when deal flow was brisk, valuations soared, and portfolio companies seemed to double in value every few months. Suddenly, midlevel investors had fewer chances to prove themselves, and some of their once-glittering deals now looked painfully overpriced. The path to partnership, already murky, became even narrower. Back in 2022, Rechtman assumed he'd eventually leave Slow to raise his own fund. Plans changed, and not, he says, because the market soured. Through September, 68 debut funds closed, versus 183 in all of last year, per PitchBook. Emerging managers are also taking twice as long to raise their next funds — a headwind that would give any investor pause. Early on, Slow general partner and early Facebook executive Sam Lessin gave Rechtman this advice: "Fish in waters where other firms aren't fishing." This year, he grabbed a last-minute flight to Tampa to reconnect with a startup billing itself as "Uber for heavy-equipment repair." Founded in 2020, Heave has quietly assembled a network that it claims covers nearly a third of the country's heavy-machinery mechanics. Rechtman closed a handshake deal with the founder over smoked fish, and Slow joined its $7 million seed round, which was announced in August. It's the kind of off-beat, unsexy bet that has become Rechtman's calling card. That approach has nudged Slow into areas it might have otherwise overlooked, such as healthcare, growth buyouts, and what Rechtman calls "real-world businesses." This spring, Slow backed SuperDial, which builds voice agents for healthcare organizations and has already handled more than 1 million calls. Colleran said Rechtman also worked with him to close Journey, a travel rewards platform created by Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy. "Because we are small and we trust each other, if two people like an idea, that's good enough," Colleran said. Colleran, now in his forties, calls Rechtman a "younger and hungrier" network-builder. Rechtman hosts a twice-yearly mini-conference for young partners, principals, and emerging managers, and says a meaningful share of his deals now come through that circle. Rechtman said if investors want credibility with founders on weird, non-consensus ideas, they have to put their thinking in public. "Frankly, I have a style that either attracts or repels founders," he said. As a Brooklyn native, he wants to do it from New York. The city is awash in seed checks, he says, but starved for growth capital to scale the most promising hometown companies. Slow has raised three opportunity funds, totaling $295 million, to join later rounds for its top performers. "When something takes off in New York, other people make the money," Rechtman said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameroon's long-serving leader Paul Biya is edging closer to an unprecedented milestone that could see him become the first sitting president in modern history to celebrate his 100th birthday while still in office As Cameroon awaits its official presidential election results, Paul Biya appears on track to secure yet another seven-year term, one that could see him become the first president in modern history to reach 100 years old while still in office. Though not officially released, sources from the commission and Jeune Afrique indicated that President Paul Biya led with 53–54% of the votes, ahead of opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who secured about 35%. Born on February 13, 1933, Biya has ruled Cameroon since 1982, a tenure spanning over four decades. His current term, which began after the 2018 election, officially ends later this year. Should he win re-election, his next term would run from late 2025 through late 2032, meaning he would be 99 years old when it concludes and just months shy of turning 100 in February 2033. However, if the inauguration or term timeline extends into early 2026, Biya could remain in office long enough to mark his 100th birthday while still president; otherwise, he would turn 100 shortly after leaving office. Tchiroma's declaration, made in a five-minute video posted on social media, drew swift condemnation from the government and Biya's ruling party, who described the move as “illegal.” “Do not vote for Paul Biya, not because of me, but because he has made too many people suffer,” she said, adding, “I hope we will have another president,” before announcing she was cutting ties with her family and their financial support. Tchiroma, 76, vowed to “defend” what he called his victory, raising fears of unrest in the Central African nation. Under his watch, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) has maintained an iron grip on power, thanks to constitutional amendments, strong state control, and a fragmented opposition. In 2008, Cameroon's parliament abolished presidential term limits, paving the way for Biya to contest indefinitely. Supporters describe him as a symbol of stability in a volatile region, while critics argue that his extended rule has come at the cost of democratic renewal and economic innovation. Biya's possible re-election would carry global symbolism, a 92-year-old leader extending his mandate into his late 90s, governing a youthful nation where the median age is just 18. For many Cameroonians, the moment is both historic and uncertain, raising questions about the future of leadership in one of Africa's longest-standing regimes.
