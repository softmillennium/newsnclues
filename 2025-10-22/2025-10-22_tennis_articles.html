At 40 years old, the three-time Grand Slam champion pulled off an impressive win over Miomir Kecmanovic for his first ATP win since this summer in Umag. Wawrinka won his only previous match with Ruud at this very tournament in 2022.After Ruud came Auger-Aliassme, who is in the hunt for his first ATP Finals berth since 2022. The Canadian has enjoyed a solid surge back up the ATP rankings after reaching the US Open semifinals and a pair of Masters 1000 quarterfinals in Canada and Shanghai. Like Ruud, Auger-Aliassime arrived to Basel fresh off a title run, lifting the trophy at the BNP Paribas Fortis European Open and, like Ruud, booked a second round against a former US Open champion in Marin Cilic. Cilic leads their head-to-head, 3-2, but Auger-Aliassime has won their last two meetings, including one in Dubai earlier this year.

Finally, Daniil Medvedev took the court in Vienna in the hopes of reaching a seventh straight ATP Finals. The 2021 US Open champion looked out of the hunt for Turin after enduring a third consecutive Grand Slam first-round loss in Flushing Meadows, but Medvedev has showed massive improvements since shaking up his coaching team. Medvedev parted ways with longtime coach Gilles Cervara and took on former Australian Open Tomas Johansson; from there, he reached back-to-back semifinals in Beijing and Shanghai and won his first title in 882 days at the Almaty Open.Medvedev appeared on course for another solid win over Borges when the Portuguese 28-year-old edged through a second-set tiebreaker. Undaunted, Medvedev raced ahead two breaks to kick off the deciding set and never looked back, serving out the win to book a second-round clash with Frenchman Corentin Moutet. Medvedev and Moutet just faced off last week in the Almaty final, with Medvedev earning a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I took three weeks off, rested, regained freshness, and that brought me the victory in Genoa," the 30-year-old doubles specialist reflects.ByFlorian HeerPublished Oct 22, 2025 copy_link At 30 years old, Szymon Walków has built a reputation as one of Poland's most accomplished doubles players on the ATP Challenger Tour.Currently ranked world No. From there, he traveled straight to his home tournament in Szczecin, eager to improve on his runner-up finish at last year's Invest in Szczecin Open. From there, he traveled straight to his home tournament in Szczecin, eager to improve on his runner-up finish at last year's Invest in Szczecin Open. A post shared by ESTESS Tennis Academy (@estesstennisacademy) “The season has been up and down—some good moments, some weaker. I took three weeks off, rested, regained freshness, and that brought me the victory in Genoa,” Walków said in Szczecin.During that break he mixed light training with quality time at home. During that break he mixed light training with quality time at home. The best teams maintain a high level all year, but that doesn't mean a lower-ranked team can't beat the top. “It's something a lot of players face, especially around rankings 130 to 150,” Walków explained. “I entered the Top 100 with Jan Zieliński. Stability is important: you plan tournaments together, improve what's not working, win and lose as a pair.”Zieliński has since become a fixture on the ATP Tour. “Janek had a great run with Hubert [Hurkacz], won an ATP 250 in Metz, then teamed with Hugo Nys, got into the Grand Slams, and they made it work. There was some luck, but also quality tennis. That's why he went higher.”Walków himself has played Grand Slams and big events and insists the gap between players ranked 100 to 150 and the elite is small. The best teams maintain a high level all year, but that doesn't mean a lower-ranked team can't beat the top. We served well, got one or two breaks—that was enough.”Still, the format can be frustrating. “You can lose several matches in a row on match tiebreaks. With advantage scoring and a full third set, maybe the better team would win more often. But the rules are set by others, and our job is to adapt.”He also feels doubles deserves more respect. “Sometimes at the Grand Slams, it feels like doubles is treated second-class. From the organizers' point of view, big names like Świątek, Sabalenka, Sinner or Alcaraz draw crowds. Doubles play is dynamic, spectacular, and full of twists. Maybe it could be promoted better—but that's for the federations to decide.” Zieliński has since become a fixture on the ATP Tour. “Janek had a great run with Hubert [Hurkacz], won an ATP 250 in Metz, then teamed with Hugo Nys, got into the Grand Slams, and they made it work.

Maybe it could be promoted better—but that's for the federations to decide.” Away from tennis, Walków's big sporting love is basketball. I go to games, follow transfers, know the league,” he says. He even runs an NBA fantasy league with fellow tennis players.Walków has attended two NBA games: the first more than a decade ago, when he was a hitting partner for CoCo Vandeweghe. “She comes from a family deeply connected to the NBA—her uncle played for the New York Knicks and later was a vice-commissioner. I went to a Clippers game at Staples Center. I visited my friend Bartek Witke in Stamford and we went to a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.”His love of basketball goes back to childhood. “My dad played as a youth and later at university. He taught my brother and me to play, so basketball was always with us. It's one of my favorite sports, if not the favorite.” Ultimately both brothers chose tennis. Dad became passionate about tennis too and helped at the club. We spent whole days there and that's how we went into tennis.”Does he regret not choosing basketball? “It would have been a great gift, but organizational issues got in the way. Hopefully there will be more chances, though I'm not sure Dončić will come to Poland again. Maybe someday I can arrange my tournaments to take the family to a basketball game.”For now, Szymon Walków continues to chase success on the doubles court, refreshed after his Genoa triumph and motivated to go one step further.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Coco Gauff was only 14 years old, and China's Zheng Qinwen a savvy 16. Gauff came from behind to win the Orange Bowl girls' 18s singles title in three sets. In a tournament that showcases the world's best juniors, Gauff was the youngest champion in 15 years. Their combined age (42) made them the youngest finalists in the year-end championship, two decades after Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. “Six years later,” Gauff said, “here we are.” Gauff was a champion in Auckland and Beijing, but the year after breaking through with a title at the US Open, she failed to defend her title. 2-ranked players, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, in a span of three days, both times in straight sets. Zheng also had won two titles on the Hologic WTA Tour, and picked up a singles gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The 22-year-old arrived in Riyadh on a tear, winning 12 of 15 matches at the US Open, Beijing and Wuhan. The momentum carried her to group wins over Elena Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini before a loss to Sabalenka. In the semifinal, Zheng handed Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova a straight-sets defeat, vaulting her to the final in her first year-end appearance. After 55 Hologic WTA Tour tournaments across 25 countries -- with 35 different champions -- the season came down to a single match. She took the first set, saving all five break points, in just under an hour and was up 3-1 in the second when Gauff crept back into the match. Reading Zheng's serve increasingly better, Gauff broke her in the sixth (at love) and eighth games to take the frame. Match time: An exhausting, exhilarating 3 hours and 4 minutes. Six years after the Orange Bowl, Gauff was again the winner in a deciding set -- and took home the Billie Jean King Trophy and nearly $5 million. In the end, Gauff outserved Zheng, hitting more aces (6) and unreturned serves (29) and winning 70 percent of her first-serve points. “Just staying resilient, fighting for every point,” Gauff said afterward. This ultimate match made all kinds of history. Zheng had become only the second Chinese player to reach the WTA Finals final, after Li Na in 2013. “This match is very [much about] endurance, instead of explosive tennis,” Zheng said. “Yes, a lot of physical, but I would say sometimes, maybe in this match, I wasn't that patient.” When the last shot dropped, so, too, did Gauff. I just want to lay on the ground. After all that running, the brief moment of stillness felt earned.</p>
