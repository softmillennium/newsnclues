            Giants quarterback Russell Wilson called his former head coach Sean Payton “classless” following comments he made after the Denver Broncos' 33-32 victory over New York on Sunday.
    


            “Classless… but not surprised… Didn't realize you're still bounty hunting 15+ years later through the media,” Wilson wrote on X followed by some laughing emojis and the hashtag #LetsRide, a catchphrase he became known for during his time with the Broncos between 2022 and 2023.
    


            New York's backup quarterback was perceived to be responding to comments made by Denver head coach Payton after the Broncos' dramatic fourth quarter comeback to beat the Giants on Sunday.
    


            “They found a little spark with that quarterback,” said Payton, referring to rookie passer Jaxson Dart who replaced Wilson as the Giants' starter after the team began the season 0-3.
    


            “I was talking to John Mara not too long ago and I said: ‘We were hoping that that change would've happened long after our game,'” Payton added.
    


            Wilson responded by referring to the “Bountygate” scandal which involved Payton's New Orleans Saints using a bounty system between the 2009 and 2011 seasons where players were paid bonuses for, among other things, hard hits and deliberately injuring opposing players.
    


            In 2012, Payton was suspended for one year without pay after the NFL found that he was aware of the bounty system and, though not directly involved with it, had done nothing to shut it down.
    


            The squabbling between Wilson and Payton reflects a lingering tension between the two which was born from their time in the Mile High City together.
    


            The Broncos went an underwhelming 11-19 in Wilson's starts over two seasons, failing to make the playoffs in either of them.
    


            Despite throwing for over 3,000 yards with 26 touchdowns during the 2023 season, Wilson was benched after the first 15 games and eventually released in the offseason – with the Broncos taking on a reported $85 million in dead salary cap.
    


            The decision came amid an injury guarantee in the then 35-year-old's contract that assured him $37 million if he could not pass a physical on the fifth day of the new league year in March 2024.
    


            By benching Wilson, Denver made sure that he couldn't get injured and was consequently able to save money on his release.
    


Speaking to reporters at the time, Wilson said he was approached by the team after the Broncos' Week 8 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and told if he didn't move back his injury guarantee in his contract that he'd be benched.
    


            “We beat the Chiefs. They came up to me at the beginning of the bye week – Monday or Tuesday – and told me that if I didn't change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I'd be benched for the rest of the year … I was definitely disappointed about it,” said Wilson.
    


            “I wasn't going to take away injury guarantees,” he said. “This game is such a physical game. I've played for 12 years and that matters to me.”

            Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine early Wednesday, causing power outages across most of the country, setting homes ablaze and killing at least six people, including a six-month-old baby, Ukrainian authorities said.
    


            The attack, which involved drones, missiles and fighter jets, targeted vast swathes of the country, including the capital Kyiv, and came as uncertainty swirled over a proposed Putin-Trump summit.



            CNN reported Tuesday, citing a Trump administration official, that there were “no plans” for such a meeting in the immediate future. Trump said later he didn't want the summit to be “a waste of time,” despite the US president saying last week the two leaders would be meeting in Budapest, Hungary, “within two weeks or so, pretty quick.”
    


            Despite Trump's comments on Tuesday, Moscow said the following day that preparations were continuing.
    


            “Preparations for the summit are ongoing. They could take various forms,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, according to state news agency RIA Novosti, adding that there were “no significant obstacles” to the Russia-US top-level meeting.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said energy infrastructure, as well as “ordinary cities” were targeted in Wednesday's attacks. The strikes had killed six people and wounded 17 across Ukraine, he said.
    


            “Another night proving that Russia does not feel enough pressure for dragging out the war,” Zelensky said on X.
    


Reality catches up with Trump's Ukraine peace drive and threatens his Mideast push



            Ukraine's state-owned energy operator Ukrenergo said emergency power cuts have been introduced across most regions of Ukraine because of the attack.
    


            DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said there was “significant” damage at one of its facilities in the Odesa region, and that energy workers were working to restore power.
    


            Several residential areas in Ukraine's capital and the broader Kyiv region were struck, sparking fires in high-rises as residents scrambled to escape, according to city officials.
    


            Two people were killed and 10 had to be rescued after debris from a drone attack hit a 16-story residential building in Kyiv's Dniprovskiy district, igniting a fire, according to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko and the Kyiv city office.
    


            A woman, a 12 year old girl and a six-month-old baby were killed in Brovary district, east of Kyiv, after strikes caused their home to catch fire, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of Kyiv regional military administration.
    


            An 83-year-old woman was rescued from a burning house in the same district, Kalashnyk said.
    


            As of 12.40 p.m. local time, a total of 25 people had been injured in Kyiv city alone due to the overnight Russian attacks, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration. More than 10 in the city have been hospitalized, including four children, Tkachenko said.
    


            In northeastern Kharkiv, a 40-year-old man was killed in Russian strikes, according to Oleh Synehubov, head of the region's military administration, adding that six people had been injured.
    


            Zelensky, who was visiting Norway and Sweden to discuss defense cooperation on Wednesday, said a Russian drone struck a kindergarten in Kharkiv, “after a night of massive attacks.”
    


            He continued, “All children have been evacuated and are in shelters. According to preliminary information, many are experiencing acute stress reactions.”
    


            In his daily address Wednesday, Zelensky said Trump's call for Ukraine and Russia to stop at the current frontlines was a “good compromise,” but added he doubted Putin would support it.
    


            Katarina Maternovak, the European Union's ambassador to Ukraine, described a “night of horror” overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.
    


            “I spent that night on the floor of my hotel bathroom, turned into a shelter. Sirens wailed without pause. Explosions shook the walls,” Maternovak wrote in a social media post.
    


            Just hours earlier, Ukraine said it had used the British-made Storm Shadow long-range missiles to target Russia's Bryansk Chemical Plant – which produces gunpowder and other explosive materials.
    


            The Storm Shadow is a powerful air-launched missile with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles) and was first used against targets inside Russia in November last year.



            Without mentioning the plant, the regional governor of Bryansk claimed on social media that Russia had “detected and destroyed 57 enemy aircraft-type UAVs” during a Ukrainian attack on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.
    


            Russia's latest assault on Ukraine comes as Trump's hopes for a meeting with Putin in the coming weeks stalled, with an administration official telling CNN on Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”
    


            Trump said Tuesday he didn't want the meeting to be “a waste of time.”
    


            He may still meet with the Russian leader, he implied, but he indicated it was no longer a top priority. “We'll be notifying you over the next two days as to what we're doing,” the president told reporters.
    


            Just days earlier, Trump denied Ukraine's request for access to long-range Tomahawk missiles, for now, and insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war in a meeting with Zelensky at the White House, according to European officials briefed on the meeting.
    


            Following Wednesday's attack, Zelensky urged the European Union and the US to increase pressure on Russia.
    


            “It is very important that the world does not remain silent now and that there is a united response to Russia's vile strikes,” he said.

Canada has officially acknowledged that its plan to refurbish and deliver decommissioned armored personnel carriers to Ukraine has been abandoned, after months of silence over the unfulfilled pledge.

The 25 vehicles were handed over to Ontario-based defense contractor Armatec Survivability nearly two years ago under a deal estimated at 250 million Canadian dollars (US$178 million).

“There is a decision that's been taken to nullify the contract with that company presently,” McGuinty told the House of Commons defense committee on Tuesday. “I can't go any further in terms of discussing the merits. We'll see how that evolves in relation to the department and the contractor.”

The acknowledgement follows a CBC News report last week that noted the project had quietly disappeared from the government's list of active defense contracts earlier this year. The outlet said officials declined to comment citing confidentiality clauses, and cited industry insiders who claimed the refurbishment effort was “dead.”

While declining to elaborate on the reasons behind the cancellation, McGuinty instead emphasized Canada's broader record of providing weapons and equipment to Ukraine to fight Russia. Ethnic Ukrainians – including descendants of nationalists who fled to Canada after failing to secure statehood for Ukraine with the help of Nazi Germany during World War II – form a notable voting bloc in the country.

Ukrainian lawmaker Aleksandra Ustinova told CBC last year that her government was prepared to “take even junk, tear it apart and make one out of three machines,” highlighting Kiev's need for more armored vehicles.

Moscow has maintained that Western arms supplies will not alter the outcome of the conflict, arguing that such deliveries only prolong the fighting and contribute to the spread of weapons on the global black market.

North Korea fired several ballistic missiles on Wednesday morning, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) have reported.

The short-range weapons were launched from the southern North Hwanghae Province and traveled roughly 350km before landing in North Hamgyong Province, in the country's northeast, according to a statement from Seoul. Military analysts believe the projectiles may have been of the same type tested by Pyongyang in September of 2024.

Japan's newly appointed prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, said Tokyo was sharing real-time tracking and warning data with both the United States and South Korea following the launches.

Pyongyang has not commented on the tests, which mark the latest in a series of ballistic missile trials this year. The previous round took place in early May.

Some media outlets have suggested that the new launch was timed in anticipation of US President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to South Korea. He is scheduled to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next week in the coastal city of Gyeongju.

Media outlets in South Korea and Japan have also speculated that Trump could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the trip – a potential reprise of the high-profile summits they held during Trump's first term.

BUDAPEST, October 22. /TASS/. Many people want to prevent another meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump, and until it takes place, numerous leaks and fake news stories will continue to appear, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said, commenting on rumors about the possible cancellation of the Moscow-Washington summit in Budapest.

""From the moment the Peace Summit in Budapest was announced, it was obvious that many would do everything possible to stop it from happening. The pro-war political elite and their media always behave this way before events that could prove decisive between war and peace,"" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook (banned in Russia, owned by Meta, a corporation considered extremist in the country).

""It's the same story before almost every European Council meeting, before decisions on sanctions or on the European Peace Facility. Nothing new under the sun. It will be no different this time. Until the Summit actually takes place, expect a wave of leaks, fake news, and statements claiming that it won't happen,"" Hungary's top diplomat added.

Szijjarto visited Washington on October 21. The minister did not disclose whom he met with, but prior to his trip, he indicated that he wanted to discuss preparations for Trump's visit to Budapest. Hungary attaches great importance not only to the upcoming US-Russia summit, which may represent a major step toward resolving the conflict in Ukraine, but also to US-Hungarian negotiations, hoping to focus them on economic issues.

On October 16, Trump, following a phone conversation with Putin, said that they had agreed to meet in Budapest soon. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov also confirmed that Moscow and Washington would begin preparing for a new meeting between the two leaders, which may take place in the Hungarian capital. In response, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ordered the formation of an organizing committee to facilitate the summit.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BRATISLAVA, October 22. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico believes that the European Union must do everything for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Budapest to happen as soon as possible if the alliance indeed wants peace in Ukraine.

""If the EU really wants a quick peace in Ukraine, which I do not believe in, it should do everything to make the Trump-Putin meeting happen in Budapest without any obstacles and as quickly as possible. The soonest Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, unhindered and with the EU's full support - that is my official position,"" he wrote on his page on Facebook (prohibited in Russia due to ownership by Meta, which has been designated an extremist organization).

According to him, ""the meeting of the American and Russian presidents in Budapest has not yet been agreed on and there is already clear evidence of efforts to prevent it at all costs. It's a sad thing to see."" ""I have always said that the EU has turned into a war cabinet, that a significant part of EU member states support the war in Ukraine in the naive belief that it is possible to weaken and defeat Russia this way,"" Fico asserted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Graham Platner says he was never questioned about the skull-and-crossbones chest tattoo in the 20 years he had it

Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for US Senate in Maine, said on Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol.

Platner said he got the skull-and-crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in his 20s and in the Marine Corps. It happened during a night of drinking while he was on leave in Croatia, he said, adding he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police.

Platner, in an Associated Press interview, said that while his campaign initially said he would remove the tattoo, he chose to cover it up with another tattoo due to the limited options where he lives in rural Maine.

“Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,” he said. “I wanted this thing off my body.”

Platner added that he had never been questioned about the tattoo's connections to Nazi symbols in the 20 years he has had it. He said it was there when he enlisted in the army, which requires an examination for tattoos of hate symbols.

“I also passed a full background check to receive a security clearance to join the ambassador to Afghanistan's security detail,” Platner said.

Questions about the tattoo come after the recent discovery of Platner's now deleted online statements that included dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.

Platner has apologized for those comments, saying they were made after he left the army in 2012, when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

The oyster farmer and first-time political candidate is mounting a progressive campaign against Republican Susan Collins, who has held the Senate seat for 30 years. The crowded Democratic primary field includes two-term governor Janet Mills.

Platner has resisted calls to drop out of the race. He has the backing of senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills.

Platner planned a town hall for Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Sequoia park zoo said staff were doing an inspection when they saw a wild black bear looking in at three captive bears

A wild bear in California has broken into a zoo and paid an unexpected visit to the bear enclosure.

In a Facebook post, the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka in the northern part of the state said its staff were conducting a routine inspection of part of the complex when they spotted a wild American black bear leaning on a gate and looking in at three captive black bears in their enclosure.

“The wild bear did not appear aggressive and was observed interacting with [the captive bears] through their habitat fencing,” the zoo said.

“At no point did the wild bear enter any animal habitats and, after a brief exploration of the enrichment items around the night house, the bear was safely coaxed back into the woods through a service gate.”

The bear is believed to have come from the wooded 60-acre (24-hectare) Sequoia park directly behind the zoo.

“Overall, he was a very polite visitor,” the zoo added. “He stayed on the boardwalk path, kept two feet on the ground and didn't try to climb over the railings!”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mike Johnson said that he hasn't spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking millions in damages over past federal investigations

Trump says he would have final say on damage payment for past investigations

Mike Johnson said that he hasn't spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking $230m from his own justice department in damages over past federal investigations.

“I know that he believes he's owed that reimbursement. What I heard yesterday was, if he receives it, he was going to consider giving it to charity,” he said.

As my colleague, Joseph Gedeon, reports, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically bars claims arising from discretionary or policy actions, meaning a president seeking compensation for law enforcement investigations into his own conduct would fall well outside the statute's intended scope.

The president insisted on Tuesday that the government owes him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct. “It's interesting, 'cause I'm the one that makes the decision, right?” Trump said at the White House.

Robert Garcia, ranking member of the House oversight committee, has called on US attorney general Pam Bondi and the justice department to turn over all Jeffrey Epstein-related files. 

Following this week's release of a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of the disgraced financier's sex trafficking operations, Garcia said:

“Virginia Giuffre's allegations are heartbreaking and horrific, including testimony that prominent world and US leaders perpetrated sexual assault and sex trafficking of girls and young women. Ms. Giuffre clearly contradicts the agency's claim that the Epstein files did not justify further investigation. In light of this, the DOJ must comply with our subpoena and provide our Committee with the full Epstein files immediately, because the American people demand the truth, the survivors deserve justice, and we must end this White House cover-up.”

Meanwhile, in a letter to Bondi, Garcia wrote:

“Your refusal to release the files and your continued disregard of a congressional subpoena raises serious questions about your motives. Oversight Democrats support transparency and accountability for the survivors of Epstein's crimes, as described by Ms. Giuffre, regardless of the identities of the perpetrators or co-conspirators or their positions of power. You, however, are going to extreme lengths to conceal the truth from the American people, apparently in cooperation with President Trump.”

The No Kings alliance, the left-leaning groups behind the mass days of protest last Saturday and in June, is building a nationwide rapid response network that will call on supporters to take new actions each week.

Leaders of the organizations told the Guardian that there was energy for “some type of disruption”, and future actions could include targeted boycotts, campaigns at universities, more street protests, and electoral organizing in local communities.

After an estimated 7 million people took to the streets last weekend, tens of thousands joined a national call on Tuesday to hear what's next for the growing movement. Leaders celebrated the broad turnout, saying it showed how much opposition to Trump there was in all corners of the US, and talked about how to sustain and grow a movement during an increasingly authoritarian moment for the country.

The next steps for this burgeoning resistance will show the durability of the movement and whether it can pressure Democrats or pillars of civil society to stand stronger against Trump, or whether it can force defections from Trump's Republican allies to fracture his power.

Democrat Scott Wiener will run for the US House seat long held by Nancy Pelosi, the California state senator announced on Wednesday.

Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House, has represented San Francisco in Congress since 1987 and has not yet said whether she will seek re-election in 2026. But Democrats are increasingly facing calls for change with younger candidates who will offer new opposition to Donald Trump.

Wiener has served as a state lawmaker since 2016 and said he was seeking office to stand up to Trump as the president wages a “full-on war against immigrants and LGBTQ people” and the cost of living continues to increase.

“We need more than rhetoric and good intentions from Democrats. We need action. We need someone who will fight like hell for the most marginalized in our community – someone who will stand up for trans kids, undocumented immigrants even when it's unpopular, even when it means getting personally attacked and threatened,” Wiener said in a statement. “We need leaders with spines, who don't just put their finger in the air to see where the winds are blowing or what polls well.”

As a state lawmaker, Wiener, an attorney who attended Harvard law school, authored a recently passed bill banning federal and state law enforcement from wearing masks and has promoted legislation to address California's housing crisis and expand climate action.

“I'm running for Congress to defend San Francisco, our values, our people and the constitution of the United States with everything I have,” Wiener said in a video announcing his candidacy. “I've stood up to violence and hate my entire life. Trump and his Maga extremists don't scare me.”

Ahead of the president's meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, where we can expect the stalled progress to end the war in Ukraine to be top of the agenda, my colleagues are covering the latest developments in Europe.

My colleague, Tom Ambrose, notes that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that that Donald Trump's call for Ukraine and Russia to stop at the current frontlines was “a good compromise”, but is doubtful that Vladimir Putin will agree.

Just a quick update, senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, is still speaking on the senate floor. He's been speaking for 16 hours in a far-ranging critique of the Trump administration's policies.

A short while ago, vice-president JD Vance met with families of Israeli hostages who returned alive and families members of deceased hostages who have not been returned.

Earlier, Vance met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who maintained that Israel has an “unmatched alliance” and partnership with the US.

“I was impressed with your clarity, with your incisiveness, with your solidarity for our common cause,” he said of Vance.

The vice-president said that the nations they would be sitting down to work on the Gaza peace plan. “We're have a very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza,” he said.

When Vance was asked about the fragility of the current ceasefire he said “this thing takes monitoring, and it's going to take a lot of work.”

One repeated refrain from House Republicans today was how Democrats push back on several policy issues simply because they are loth to support the president.

Most of today's speakers repeated this claim today, with House conference chair Lisa McClain even saying “president Trump could have the cure for cancer, and the Democrats would vote no” because it came from him.

Mike Johnson said that he hasn't spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking $230m from his own justice department in damages over past federal investigations.

“I know that he believes he's owed that reimbursement. What I heard yesterday was, if he receives it, he was going to consider giving it to charity,” he said.

As my colleague, Joseph Gedeon, reports, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically bars claims arising from discretionary or policy actions, meaning a president seeking compensation for law enforcement investigations into his own conduct would fall well outside the statute's intended scope.

The president insisted on Tuesday that the government owes him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct. “It's interesting, 'cause I'm the one that makes the decision, right?” Trump said at the White House.

Johnson kicked off the press conference continuing to blame Democrats for the shutdown. Both parties have traded endless barbs in the four weeks since government funding lapsed.

“As long as Democrats continue to act like unserious lawmakers, I'm just going to say this morning enough is enough,” he said.

The House speaker brought up the topic of Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which Democrats say is one of the key extensions they're seeking in any stopgap funding bill. A reminder, Obamacare subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. For his part, Johnson maintained today that resolving this in a continuing resolution was “not possible”.

“Republicans cannot and will not solve it in a back room deal,” he added. “Issues of this magnitude deserve deep thought and deliberation.”

We're now hearing from the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who notes that the ongoing government shutdown is now “the second longest … of any kind ever in the history of our country”.

A man who drove into a Secret Service vehicle gate outside the White House has been arrested.

US Secret Service said in a statement that the incident took place late Tuesday at “approximately 10.37pm”. The individual drove into the security gate located at 17th and E St NW, in Washington DC.

Ultimately the vehicle was assessed and deemed safe. They added that their “investigation into the cause of this collision is ongoing”.

Officials did not provide any extra details on the driver's identity or possible motivation. The vehicle had a Maryland license place.

As we enter day 22 of the government shutdown, there will be a 12th vote in the Senate on the stopgap funding bill that has repeatedly failed to gain the 60 votes needed to advance and reopen the government.

On Tuesday, the Senate's top Republican, John Thune, was optimistic he could get the handful of Democrats needed to clear that hurdle this week.

We'll also hear from House Republicans and Democrats in respective press conferences today, as both parties continue to blame the other for the ongoing shutdown.

Democratic senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, has been speaking on the floor of the upper chamber for more than 14 hours.

Merkley said that his marathon speech, which began at 6.24pm ET on Tuesday, is to “ring the alarm bells” about how Donald Trump is “shredding the constitution”.

Throughout his time on the floor, which threatens to delay legislative business in the Senate as long as Merkley is still speaking, the lawmaker has run through the president's first nine months back in the White House, chastising his tariff policies, the use of the justice department to target of his political adversaries, and his frequent attacks on journalists and the media.

Throughout the speech Merkley had several dark green placards behind him to illustrate his points. As of now, he's standing in front of a sign which reads “AUTHORITARIANISM IS HERE”.

A reminder that Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, holds the record for the longest Senate floor speech – coming in at over 25 hours earlier this year.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, said that the federal immigration raids targeting street vendors in Manhattan were “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive”.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said the operation was “targeted” and “focused on criminal activity relating to the selling of counterfeit goods”. The arrests sparked protests outside 26 Federal Plaza, where several immigrants were reportedly detained.

“Fed immigration agencies should target criminals for arrest and deportation-not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city,” Schumer said. “This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer.”

Donald Trump is at the White House today, per his official schedule.

The president's only listed event is his meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte at 4pm ET. Currently that meeting is closed to the press, but we'll let you know if that opens up.

New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP's chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.
 Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.
 “Maybe you're surprised to hear that I'm running for the Senate again. I'm a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”
 Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire – and if they flip one of those seats it will probably put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.
 Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”
 Trump went on to win New Hampshire's leadoff primary, but the state's voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor's office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire's congressional seats since 2017.
 Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He's now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.
 Pappas' campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests”.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. We start with the news that the mayor of New York City has said that the city has had “no involvement” in the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids in Chinatown related to “selling counterfeit goods”.

Mayor Eric Adams shared a social media post from the New York police department (NYPD) after it distanced itself from the raids, saying that it had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Adams quote-tweeted the NYPD's missive and emphasized:

New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.

While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement. Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.

Hundreds showed up to protests that broke out in New York City on Tuesday evening after Ice raids related to “selling counterfeit goods” were conducted in the Chinatown neighborhood earlier in the day and resulted in an unknown number of people being detained.

Hours after federal agents descended on lower Manhattan, demonstrators were seen assembling near the 26 Federal Plaza Immigration Building where they believed detainees were taken. Many shouted chants including “Ice out of New York” and “No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Videos of the raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

“Is this worth the paycheck? Selling your soul?” one woman can be heard shouting at agents.

The raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

It was unclear how many people were detained in the raid, but a witness told the New York Daily News that he saw at least seven individuals taken into custody.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""won certain property"" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. 

The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. 

Prior to the call with Putin, Trump had taken a harsher tone with Russia in public comments. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands.

""Well, he's going to take something,"" Trump said. ""I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. I mean, you know, he's won certain property, if you say that, he's won certain property."" 

Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to ""property"" it seizes through strength of arms. 

""We're the only nation that goes in and wins a war and then leaves,"" he said. ""You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. We go in, we blast the hell out of everybody, destroy the place, and then we leave. ... You know, it doesn't make sense. Never made sense.""

Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal ""with property lines being defined by war and guts."" 

In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering ""additional"" territory to Putin. 

""We will give nothing to the aggressor,"" Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19.

Russia, however, is reportedly seeking full control of Donetsk Oblast as part of a deal to end the war. 

Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. 

In a conversation that at times turned into a shouting match, Trump told Zelensky that Russia was winning the war and would destroy Ukraine if Kyiv didn't make a deal, a European official with knowledge of the meeting told FT. 

""If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you,"" Trump reportedly told Zelensky. 

The U.S. president parroted a number of Kremlin propaganda points during the meeting, the European official claimed. Trump said Putin told him that the invasion of Ukraine was a ""special operation, not even a war."" Trump also said the Russian economy is ""doing great."" 

According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was ""sick"" of seeing these maps. 

""This red line, I don't even know where this is. I've never been there,"" Trump allegedly said. 

Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback.

Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire.

""We never discussed that. We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle line... the rest is very tough to negotiate,"" Trump said.

""I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is. They can negotiate something down the line,"" Trump added.

Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. 

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. 

""None of us should put pressure on Zelensky when it comes to territorial concessions,"" Tusk wrote on X. 

""We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.""

Trump, for his part, has continued to delay imposing sanctions on Russia in an attempt to bring Putin to the negotiating table.

On Oct. 20, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Congress was ""hitting the pause button,"" on a Senate bill that proposes to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries that buy Russian oil, amid Trump's planned meeting with Putin.

The White House has not yet indicated that it would like to see the bill brought to a vote on the Senate floor.

At first, the pictures went viral for another reason. 

Two Ukrainian civilians were shot dead and another injured on the roadside, the victims of another Russian war crime that was as everyday as it was horrific.

Ordinary, peaceful residents of the city of Pokrovsk — the very people Russia claims to be “liberating” in its war of destruction in the Donbas, who held on to life in their homes for a year after their city became a war zone — snuffed out in an instant.

But beyond the shock and anger, the images and the story behind them — that Russian soldiers had murdered these civilians near the railway line in Pokrovsk — also revealed a grim new battlefield truth.

After more than a year as the rock upon which Russia's territorial ambitions in Donbas were broken, cracks are opening in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, and the end may finally be near. 

Less than a day after the video of the murdered civilians emerged, the 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces acknowledged the Russian penetration to the railway, showing Ukrainian drones targeting the group inside the station building.

The videos were just the latest in a series of geolocatable snippets of drone footage, filmed both by Russians and Ukrainians, showing Russian assault troops deep inside the urban area of Pokrovsk, far beyond the southern neighborhoods where fighting had previously been seen. These images are, in turn, the raw data used by open-source mapping projects that give all of us an understanding of where the front line is.

This was not the first time Russian soldiers had broken into Pokrovsk. Back in late July, a major breach occurred in the southwest of the city, only about two weeks after the Kyiv Independent visited the city, embedded with a Ukrainian drone team.

That incursion into Pokrovsk was on a smaller scale. With the help of the 425th Assault Regiment, better known as Skelia, Russian forces were cleared from the urban area of Pokrovsk, and the city continued to hold, in stable but difficult conditions, over the following months.

Although ""Fortress Pokrovsk"" stood firm through August, September, and early October, the viability of Ukraine's hold on the city was becoming more fraught with every passing week. By the beginning of summer, Russian first-person-view drones — including the fiber-optic variant, immune to jamming and perfect for laying ambushes along key logistics roads — controlled all of the entrances to Pokrovsk from the sky.

That drone saturation, as the war has shown us, only becomes denser with time — and Pokrovsk was no exception.

For the brigades still holding sectors inside the city and in neighboring Myrnohrad, this meant that each and every logistics and rotation run in and out of the city had a higher chance of being hit by a drone than the last.

For soldiers from the 68th Jaeger Brigade who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, holding the front line on the southern edge of the city, this meant, in practical terms, simply running out of vehicles — not only armored personnel carriers, but also the standard modified pickup trucks that most Ukrainian soldiers use for everyday logistics.

But running out of vehicles is only one part of the problem. Tighter and tighter Russian drone control over logistics prevents troop rotations or inflicts heavy losses during them. Drone and mortar teams are no longer receiving their everyday supplies of drones, ammunition, and fuel. Gradually, the actual manpower and fire assets defending Pokrovsk from the inside were spread thinner and thinner.


For Ukraine to survive in this war — and eventually to win it — the staging of brutal but favorable attritional battles around fortresses like Pokrovsk remains crucial.
    

This, in turn, provided more and more openings for Russian infantry groups — having already honed their infiltration-based assault tactics over 2025 — to once again creep past Ukrainian lines into the southern neighborhoods of Pokrovsk.

Here, I use the word creep very deliberately, having watched what these assaults look like in real time on Ukrainian drone feeds all across the front line. We are not talking about dramatic breakthroughs, but about groups of Russian soldiers sometimes numbering no more than two or three, sometimes even just single infantrymen advancing alone, using tree lines and other pieces of cover to slowly make their way through the Ukrainian kill zone.

Most of them don't make it, but those who do dig in, await reinforcements, and then often begin ambushing Ukrainian soldiers, including drone teams, in the rear. If they make it inside the dense, built-up area of a city like Pokrovsk, with high-rise buildings and endless opportunities for cover and concealment, clearing them out becomes an almost impossible task.

It is these two factors, combined and coordinated — the degradation and ruthless hunting of Ukrainian supply routes into the city, and the advancement of Russian small-group infiltration assault tactics taking advantage of a porous defense — that appear to be heralding the beginning of the end for Pokrovsk.

Still, the final chapter of the battle has not yet been written, and much is still up in the air.

Unfortunately, if we look at the fate of other so-called fortress cities in Donbas over the course of Russia's full-scale war, the signs are foreboding for Pokrovsk. The situation reminds me in many ways of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, where Ukrainian forces managed to defend the flanks of the city to prevent a complete encirclement — moments of fierce, heroic fighting — but ultimately, Russian fire control over the roads in and out, combined with advances inside those cities and a refusal by the Ukrainian command to order a timely withdrawal, led to chaotic retreats, unprepared defenses beyond the city, and, worst of all, avoidable losses.

But unlike in Bakhmut or Avdiivka, where ground lines of communication were a gauntlet of more traditional direct and indirect fire from nearby Russian positions, Pokrovsk faces its own final act in an environment of asphyxiating drone saturation at a level we have not seen in previous battles. Given this, I worry that the Ukrainian command's common reluctance to order a timely retreat could have even deadlier consequences. I hope my fears are unfounded.

For journalists, volunteers — let alone soldiers and residents of the area — the looming fall of Pokrovsk is hard to accept, especially with memories from just over a year ago, when it was a buzzing city in the rear with everyday life still intact, still so fresh.

But to end on a positive note, it's worth remembering that this time last year, when Russian forces first reached the outskirts of this proud mining city, few expected Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk to last until the end of the winter, let alone another year.

For Ukraine to survive in this war — and eventually to win it — the staging of brutal but favorable attritional battles around fortresses like Pokrovsk remains crucial.

The defense of this city over the past year has eaten up immense Russian resources in equipment, ammunition, and especially manpower, and has bought Ukraine precious time at a critical moment when support for Kyiv from its most powerful international partner, the United States, has disintegrated. 

With that in mind, the ability of Pokrovsk and the Ukrainian brigades defending it to endure for so long will be remembered for centuries, even if anything like the life it once knew never returns to its ruined streets.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with the latest developments regarding the situation at the Szazhalombatta oil refinery in Hungary.

Explosions occurred at oil refineries in Romania and Hungary on the evening of Oct. 20, both of which have links to Russia, local media reported on Oct. 21.

Russian oil remains a key source of revenue for Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Despite the European Union's push to fully phase out Russian energy, several member states continue to receive supplies.

A midday explosion occurred at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiesti, southern Romania, on Oct. 20.

The facility, owned by a subsidiary of Lukoil, one of Russia's largest privately owned oil and gas companies, had reportedly been offline since Oct. 17 due to a planned technical inspection, according to Hungarian newspaper Vilaggazdasag.

A 57-year-old worker sustained serious head and leg injuries and was taken to intensive care.

In light of recent Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, local authorities have not ruled out the possibility that the incident was a deliberate act. Yet, other potential causes, such as human error or technical malfunction, are also being considered, according to Vilaggazdasag.

An explosion also occurred at Hungary's largest oil refinery, located in the city of Szazhalombatta, which receives crude oil from Russia, according to Hungarian media outlet Telex.

The Danube Refinery, situated 27 kilometers (about 17 miles) from Budapest and owned by the Hungarian oil company MOL, caught fire on the evening of Oct. 20 following the explosion. Firefighters managed to contain the blaze by the morning of Oct. 21.

No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

The exact cause of the incident remains under investigation. The Szazhalombatta facility, considered the most advanced in Hungary's oil refining sector, may now face a temporary shutdown.

The refinery is supplied with crude oil from Russia through the Druzba pipeline.

On the night of the Oct. 20 fire, ""some special work"" was reportedly underway at the plant, though this was not mentioned in official statements, Telex reported on Oct. 22, citing its undisclosed sources. At the same time, the MOL oil company said no open-flame operations, such as welding, were being conducted that evening.

One of the facility's key components is a distillation tower, which separates liquid mixtures from crude oil based on differing boiling points.

According to oil and gas equity analyst Tamas Pletser, if the tower was not damaged, repairs could be completed within several weeks. However, if the tower sustained damage, restoration could take six months to a year, he told Telex.

As of now, the extent of the damage caused by the fire remains unclear.

Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery also suspended operations on Oct. 20 following a drone attack, according to Reuters.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery, located in Volga Oblast, is part of Rosneft's Samara group of refineries, which includes the Kuibyshevsk and Syzran plants.

Ukraine has not commented on the explosions at oil refineries in Romania and Hungary, nor on the drone strike at the Novokuibyshevsk facility.

Posters with the faces of hostages are displayed on a railing near a Tel Aviv beach on Oct. 12. Recently, a whale shark was spotted at several places along the coast of Israel, including Tel Aviv.Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images

The first sighting of a fin cutting through the waters off an Israeli beach in late September caused panic. Lifeguards cleared the sand, cautious after a fatal shark attack earlier this year.

Within minutes, Aviad Scheinin, chief scientist with the Apex Marine Predator Lab at the University of Haifa, received a message on WhatsApp. There was a shark at Ashdod's Beach 11, “a big shark,” he was told. He squinted at a shaky cellphone video, intrigued.

Usually, Israel sees dusky and sandbar sharks, which tend to aggregate around the warm outflow from power plants. This looked different. Dr. Scheinin asked for a clearer view, which the lifeguards secured with a GoPro from a jetski. What they sent back confirmed Dr. Scheinin's suspicions: an enormous fish, its skin ornamented with a distinctive pattern of white dots.

“It was 100 per cent a whale shark,” he said.

He was thrilled. Never before had such an animal come to these waters. “It was the first time ever, since the creation of Israel,” he said.

His excitement soon spread. As more sightings were reported along the coast – Ashkelon, Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Netanya – the arrival of the whale shark enthralled the country. It wasn't just unusual. 

Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world, but are filter feeders that largely consume plankton and krill. The appearance of such a gentle giant at the exact moment an end to the war in Gaza finally seemed within reach felt like something more important.

A moment of meaning had arisen from the depths. 

“Religious people said it was a sign from God. I would say it was a sign from nature,” said Yaara Grossmark, co-founder of Sharks in Israel, a local non-profit. 

Soon, the shark had a name: Ofek, or Horizon.

Its arrival felt like the sea foretelling “something is coming,” Ms. Grossmark said. “Something good is coming.”

Instead, the shark brought a new reminder of the bitter hatreds that war – and, now, tenuous peace – have done nothing to ease.

Less than a month after the whale shark first surfaced, it was dragged onto a beach in Gaza – where the UN has frequently described famine-like conditions over the past two years – and carved up for meat as a large crowd watched.

A TikTok video shows a whale shark caught and cut up by fisherman off the coast of Gaza.

In Israel, the response was visceral. Hundreds posted on the Sharks in Israel Facebook page. Writing in Hebrew, they called Gazans criminals, barbarians and savages. They drew parallels between the Hamas-led murder of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, and the killing of the whale. 

“How symbolic,” one wrote.

In Gaza, too, the whale shark's arrival was freighted with meaning. 

“We felt the sea sent us a great blessing, as people in the camps had nothing to eat,” said Raed Elwan, one of the fishermen who helped bring the creature to shore.

“We cut up the fish and gave about 70 per cent of the meat to displaced families for free.” The remainder was sold, the proceeds used to pay those who caught and butchered it. “This was not to profit, but to share the blessing,” Mr. Elwan said.

Sharks form an unlikely religious dividing line. Their consumption is considered halal but not kosher, and Israel has banned all forms of harvesting. Protected by law, sharks have become a subject of avid local interest. In 2014, Ms. Grossmark helped to launch a project collecting citizen observation of sharks and rays, which later became Sharks in Israel.

The group has recorded behaviours not previously documented and organized tours in hopes of making what animals remain a local attraction.

“You only protect what you love and you only love what you know,” Ms. Grossmark said.

Across the Mediterranean, more than 40 per cent of shark and ray species are near extinction. Some populations have declined by 99.99 per cent, according to research published in 2008, their numbers depleted primarily by overfishing.

In Gaza, though, sharks have long formed part of the local diet.

“I have personally caught a shark that weighed only half a tonne,” said Mr. Elwan, who is known locally as Rambo. “But we had never seen one this big.” It measured at least five metres long – Mr. Elwan believes it was twice that – and weighed well over a tonne.

Whale sharks are native to warmer waters, including the Red Sea. It's unclear how this one arrived, although it is possible it travelled through the Suez Canal. 

It appeared off Gaza just after noon on Oct. 17, as Mr. Elwan fished in calm waters. 

“Suddenly we saw a huge body moving slowly towards us. It got closer until it touched one of the fisherman's nets, then wrapped the net around itself.” Those on the water were both amazed and confused. “Most of the fishermen panicked,” he said.

Mr. Elwan, a former prisoner released as part of a swap in 2011, saw an opportunity. He tied a rope around the shark's head, hoping to bring it in. 

The shark sought to escape by diving, but some 20 fishing boats assembled to pull it in. “Its strength was incredible,” he said. On shore, a huge crowd gathered and helped to drag it ashore, where it was killed and its meat carved off. 

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including the ceasefire deal, the toll of the war so far and what comes next.

War has badly damaged fishing in Gaza, Mr. Elwan said. The local port lies in ruins. Israeli munitions have destroyed boats. Sewage has poured into local waters, worsening earlier leaks that had already damaged fish stocks. 

“This has forced fishermen to rely on rare and large catches when possible,” he said.

In Israel, meanwhile, those who study and follow sharks are still reckoning with what happened. 

“We hoped for better,” Dr. Scheinin said. But, he added, “living in our region is complicated. Whether you are a whale shark or a human being.”

Viking® ( www.viking.com ) (NYSE: VIK) today announced the naming of its nine newest river ships—including the company's 100 th ship—during a simultaneous ceremony in Basel, Switzerland. Of the nine new river ships, the Viking Annar , the Viking Dagur , the Viking Eldir and the Viking Honir will sail Viking's most popular itineraries along the Rhine, Main and Danube rivers. The Viking Nerthus , the Viking Gyda and the Viking Tonle sail the Seine, Douro and Mekong rivers, respectively. The two other new ships named today—the Viking Thoth and the Viking Amun —sail the Nile River. The ceremony also marked a major milestone—Viking now has more than 100 ships across its award-winning river, ocean and expedition fleet, more than any other cruise line. This achievement reflects the company's history of industry-leading innovations.

Viking today celebrated the naming of its nine newest river ships, including the company's 100th ship during a ceremony in Basel, Switzerland. Pictured here, Viking Chairman and CEO Torstein Hagen, Executive Vice President of Product Karine Hagen, and the godparents and captains of the nine ships on board the new Viking Honir for the ceremony. For more information, visit www.viking.com.

“Today we are proud to name our newest river ships and to honor the nine distinguished members of our extended Viking family serving as their godparents,” said Torstein Hagen, Chairman and CEO of Viking. “We have always been quite a bit different from others in the travel industry—we like to be contrarian. Over the last 28 years, we have grown from four ships to more than 100—a fleet size that no other line has achieved—and we have done so because of our innovative approach. First, we modernized river voyages; then we reinvented ocean voyages and perfected the expedition experience. We look forward to continuing our leadership in experiential travel in the years to come.”

Viking Naming Ceremony

For thousands of years, it has been an ancient maritime tradition for each new ship to have a ceremonial godmother. Viking has adapted this custom and, for its ships in Egypt, extended it to include godfathers. Viking's tradition is to appoint individuals who have made an impact—either in the world, or in the life of Viking. For its nine newest river ships, the company invited colleagues and partners in the extended Viking family to serve as godparents, including:

The naming ceremony took place in Basel on board the Viking Honir and was connected virtually to the eight other new ships, which were located across five other countries around the world. The Viking Nerthus was in Paris, France; the Viking Dagur , the Viking Eldir and the Viking Annar were in Rostock, Germany; the Viking Gyda was in Porto, Portugal; the Viking Tonle was in Mỹ Tho, Vietnam; and the Viking Thoth and the Viking Amun  were in Luxor, Egypt.

Guests at the naming event enjoyed performances by Sissel Kyrkjebø, one of the world's leading crossover sopranos and godmother of the Viking Jupiter ®; Norwegian violinist Tor Jaran Apold; the Viennese Residence Orchestra; and a Basel girls' choir.

Viking's Award-Winning Fleet

The naming of Viking's newest river ships follows a string of recent accolades for the company. Viking was rated #1 for Oceans and #1 for Rivers by Condé Nast Traveler for the fifth year in a row in the 2025 Readers' Choice Awards. Viking is also rated a “World's Best” by Travel + Leisure —no other travel company has simultaneously received such honors by both publications. Viking was also recognized in U.S. News & World Report's 2025 Best Cruise Lines rankings as Best Luxury Line, Best Line for Couples and Best Line in the Mediterranean for the fourth consecutive year. Viking's ocean ships continue to be rated and “Recommended” as part of the Forbes Travel Guide Star Awards, an annual independent evaluation for luxury travel brands. Additionally, Viking received seven awards across its ocean, river and expedition categories in the Cruise Critic 2024 Best in Cruise Awards.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","New study shows widespread AI misinformation","https://www.dw.com/en/ai-chatbots-misrepresent-news-almost-half-the-time-says-major-new-study/a-74392921","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 07:06:48 GMT","

AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Copilot routinely distort the news and struggle to distinguish facts from opinion. That's according to a major new study from 22 international public broadcasters, including DW.

A major new study by 22 public service media organizations, including DW, has found that four of the most commonly used AI assistants misrepresent news content 45% of the time — regardless of language or territory.

Journalists from a range of public service broadcasters, including the BBC (UK) and NPR (US), evaluated the responses of four AI assistants, or chatbots — ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI.

Measuring criteria such as accuracy, sourcing, providing context, the ability to editorialize appropriately and the ability to distinguish fact from opinion, the study found that almost half of all answers had at least one significant issue, while 31% contained serious sourcing problems and 20% contained major factual errors.

DW found that 53% of the answers provided by the AI assistants to its questions had significant issues, with 29% experiencing specific issues with accuracy.

Among the factual errors made in response to DW questions was Olaf Scholz being named as German Chancellor, even though Friedrich Merz had been made Chancellor one month earlier. Another saw Jens Stoltenberg named as NATO secretary general after Mark Rutte had already taken over the role.

AI assistants have become an increasingly common way for people around the world to access information. According to the Reuters Institute's Digital News Report 2025, 7% of online news consumers use AI chatbots to get news, with the figure rising to 15% for those aged under 25.

Those behind the study say it confirms that AI assistants systematically distort news content of all kinds.

""This research conclusively shows that these failings are not isolated incidents,"" said Jean Philip De Tender, deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which co-ordinated the study.

""They are systemic, cross-border, and multilingual, and we believe this endangers public trust. When people don't know what to trust, they end up trusting nothing at all, and that can deter democratic participation.""

This is one of the largest research projects of its kind to date and follows a study undertaken by the BBC in February 2025. That study found that more than half of all AI answers it checked had significant issues, while almost one-fifth of the answers citing BBC content as a source introduced factual errors of their own.

The new study saw media organizations from 18 countries and across multiple language groups apply the same methodology as the BBC study to 3,000 AI responses.

The organizations asked common news questions to the four AI assistants, such as ""What is the Ukraine minerals deal?"" or ""Can Trump run for a third term?""

Journalists then reviewed the answers against their own expertise and professional sourcing, without knowing which assistant provided them.

When compared with the BBC study from eight months ago, the results show some minor improvement, but with a high level of error still apparent.

""We're excited about AI and how it can help us bring even more value to audiences,"" Peter Archer, BBC program director of generative AI said in a statement. ""But people must be able to trust what they read, watch and see. Despite some improvements, it's clear that there are still significant issues with these assistants.""

Gemini performed the worst of the four chatbots, with 72% of its responses having significant sourcing issues. In the BBC study, Microsoft's Copilot and Gemini were deemed the worst performers. But across both studies, all four AI assistants had issues.

In a statement provided to the BBC back in February, a spokesperson for OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, said: ""We support publishers and creators by helping 300 million weekly ChatGPT users discover quality content through summaries, quotes, clear links, and attribution.""

The broadcasters and media organizations behind the study are calling for national governments to take action.

In a press release, the EBU said its members are ""pressing EU and national regulators to enforce existing laws on information integrity, digital services, and media pluralism.""

They also stressed that independent monitoring of AI assistants must be a priority going forward, given how fast new AI models are being rolled out.

Meanwhile, the EBU has joined up with several other international broadcasting and media groups to establish a joint campaign called ""Facts In: Facts Out"", which calls on AI companies themselves to take more responsibility for how their products handle and redistribute news.

In a statement, the organizers of the campaign said, ""When these systems distort, misattribute or ""decontextualize trusted news, they undermine public trust.""

""This campaign's demand is simple: If facts go in, facts must come out. AI tools must not compromise the integrity of the news they use.""

It is the first time Pyongyang has fired ballistic missiles since South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June this year. The latest test comes ahead of a visit by Donald Trump later this week.

North Korea test fired ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea's military has said.

Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missiles flew east, with the South Korean Yonhap news agency saying it was launched toward the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) off North Korea's east coast, without specifying where they had landed.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said multiple short-range ballistic missiles, which were launched from an area to the south of the North Korean capital Pyongyang, had been detected.

The South Korean military said the missiles flew around 350 kilometers (218 miles) in a northeastern direction.

A meeting of South Korea's national security council has been convened in the wake of the launch, the presidential office in Seoul said.

Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that none of the missiles had reached her country's territorial waters, and that no damage has been reported.

Takaichi added that Tokyo was in close communication with Seoul and Washington.

The missile tests come ahead of a planned visit to South Korea by US President Donald Trump.

Trump and other leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, are set to be attend a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

Pyongyang last launched ballistic missiles on May 8, when it fired several short-range projectiles from its east coast.

Wednesday's launch is the first of its kind since South Korean President Lee Jae-myung took office in June.

During his presidential campaign, Lee proactively brought up the necessity of halting hostile moves toward North Korea.

Lee even talked up ushering in ""a new era of peaceful coexistence"" with North Korea in his first address at the UN General Assembly last month, reiterating the need to continue working toward denuclearization while fostering inter-Korean cooperation.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a number of weapons tests since since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019.

Last month Kim suggested he could return to talks if Washington drops its demand for a denuclearization of North Korea, after Trump repeatedly expressed hopes for a new round of diplomacy.

In August, Kim supervised a test firing of two ""new"" air defense missiles, which coincided with joint military exercises between the US and South Korea.

The 2023 regulation targeting goods linked to deforestation had been hailed by environmentalists, but criticized by major trading partners such as Brazil and the United States.

The European Commission on Tuesday proposed softening an EU anti-deforestation law.

The landmark law, known as the EUDR and adopted in 2023, had banned imports of products driving deforestation and was hailed by environmentalists.

The law has faced opposition from major trading partners such as Brazil and the United States, who argue that businesses will suffer due to increased paperwork and higher costs.

The proposed changes to the law still require the approval of member states and the European Parliament.

It was due to come into effect at the end of 2024, but was then postponed twice, with the current deadline set at late 2026.

On Tuesday, the EU Commission proposed undoing the second postponement, moving the deadline back to the end of 2025, while smaller firms would still have by the end of 2026 to comply.

The changes give a six-month grace period to larger companies.

Among the goods that could be impacted by the measure are coffee, cocoa, soy, timber, palm oil, cattle, printing paper and rubber.

Under the law, companies importing goods to the EU would need to provide a statement that shows that they do not come from areas hit by deforestation. This would also require firms to provide geolocation and satellite data.

In its Tuesday recommendation, the Commission removed a requirement that would have had companies who purchase, process and sell such items to also submit a deforestation statement.

Now, the measure would be limited to the importers themselves. Small-hold producers would also only need to provide a one-off declaration.

Police have been stationed outside Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer's home after she received anti-Semitic death threats.

Ms Loomer, one of Donald Trump's most loyal attack dogs outside of his administration, was among several Jewish figures in Florida who had been subject to a barrage of online threats and abuse.

On Tuesday, police confirmed that Nicholas Ray, 28, from Spring, Texas, had been arrested and charged with extortion, written threats to kill and unlawful use of a two-way communication device.

“There was a patrol car that was driving up and down my neighbourhood before they arrested him. This has been ongoing for over a week,” Ms Loomer told The Telegraph.

Ms Loomer announced in a post on X on Monday night that she had been the victim of “a serious and credible threat” against her life. 

“Over the last week, I have been in frequent communication with Law enforcement in Florida... regarding credible threats made against my life and the lives of several other Jewish and pro-Israel conservatives,” she wrote.

“The threats were targeted, as all of the targets of these threats (including myself) are Jewish, pro-Trump, conservative media figures, and we all live in Florida.”

The suspect had been “radicalised by the false accusations that I am a foreign agent”, Ms Loomer added. Mr Ray had allegedly falsely believed the 32-year-old and other influencers were Israeli agents.

Seth Dillon of The Babylon Bee, a conservative Christian satirical news website, author Josh Hammer and New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz were also targeted.

An arrest affidavit, seen by Politico, detailed anti-Semitic abuse and death threats from an account with the handle “zionist are scum”.

Over X, the account accused Ms Markowicz of being a “Russian genocide jew whose family escaped prosecution in American you deserve to be hung,” and claimed Mr Dillon had been “conspiring with Israel about Charlie Kirk”.

In posts directed at Ms Loomer, the user wrote that she was “going to get hung from the capitol [sic] baby”.

Asked if she felt safer after the arrest, Ms Loomer told The Telegraph: “It never ends because I am subjected to a daily barrage of threats.”

Ms Loomer, who hosts a show called Loomer Unleashed on the video platform Rumble, has become one of the few outside voices that Mr Trump and his team pay close attention to, claiming a series of scalps.

Mr Trump has sacked a number of officials Ms Loomer has suggested have links to Democrats or whose loyalty to Mr Trump she has called into question. The Right-winger refers to this as being “Loomered”.

Two weeks ago, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, announced that the department of justice had filed criminal charges against a California man for allegedly making “vicious” threats against conservative podcaster Benny Johnson.

Mr Johnson had received a letter threatening that he should be “exterminated” and strangled by an American flag, and that referenced Kirk, the 31-year-old Conservative influencer who was assassinated on a Utah university campus last month.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

			Host governments in a flap as they work out innovative ways to humour their highly unpredictable guest

South Korea is considering dishing out its highest civilian honour.

Japan has a plan to park a line of oversized American pickup trucks outside the state guest house.

And there is a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand to be signed.

It can mean only one thing: Donald Trump is coming to town.

The American president is about to embark on a trip through south-east Asia sending host governments into a flap as they work out innovative ways to humour their highly unpredictable guest.

The stakes could not be higher. Mr Trump's three-nation, one-week trip includes a summit with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, where both sides will want to calm a trade and tariff war that has put the global economy on edge.

There are plenty of real sticking points along the way, said Andrew Yeo, a Korea expert at the Brookings Institution, but there are things that Mr Trump's hosts can control.

“The Koreans are even floating the idea of giving Trump an award, the Mugunghwa Award, which is the highest award for service, just to again boost his ego that he's a peacemaker,” he said.

The Grand Order of Mugunghwa is the highest decoration awarded by the government of the Republic of Korea. It is reserved for presidents of South Korea and their spouses, and for foreign presidents who have made major contributions to the nation's security and development.

Mr Trump is expected to fly off to Asia at the end of the week.

The White House has yet to issue its official schedule, but Mr Trump has dropped hints about where he will be. First is Malaysia, where the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit will be held, followed by Japan.

Then it is South Korea, where leaders will be assembling for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, where he is expected to meet Xi.

The schedule is a headache for Mr Trump's hosts. Insiders say the president hates the slow grind of the summit circuit, where he has to sit through hours of meetings. (In fact, he will leave South Korea before Apec properly begins.)

He abandoned the G7 summit in Canada earlier this year without staying a night, and his first term was marked by cancelled press conferences and rapid exits from Nato and G7 gatherings.

Second time around, hosts have leaned into his transactional approach.

The tone was set with the first foreign trip of his second term, when he returned from the Middle East in May with hundreds of billions of dollars in investment commitments and arms deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Japan has learnt the lesson. The government is trying to buy 100 Ford F-150 pickup trucks for road and dam inspections after Mr Trump complained Japan did not buy enough American cars.

Some officials worry that American vehicles are too big for local roads, so a government order can sidestep public reservations.

Ryosei Akazawa, the country's top trade negotiator, said recently: “The F-150 is one of Trump's favourites.”

If the trucks can be delivered in time, there is even a plan to line them up outside the Akasaka Palace state guest house, where Mr Trump is expected to stay.

Mireya Solis, director of the Centre for Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said it showed how Japan was intent on creating a positive atmosphere around its recent deal to invest $550bn in the US.

“And if from his window he looks at American trucks lined up in the streets, he's going to be even happier,” she said.

The first stop, Kuala Lumpur, brings an even more significant prize, with the next steps in a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand.

Malaysia may have brokered the ceasefire, but the White House claims credit for ending five days of lethal border clashes in July.

Mr Trump says it was his trade pressure that pushed the two sides to agree.

Last week, Mohamad Hasan, Malaysia's foreign minister, said: “During the summit, we hope to see the signing of a declaration, known as the Kuala Lumpur Accord, between these two neighbours to ensure peace and a lasting ceasefire.”

Regional experts say the declaration will effectively be a rubber stamping of the existing ceasefire agreement.

That rubber stamping will come in the form of a presidential autograph signed by a Sharpie, plus a chance for Mr Trump to make another claim for the Nobel Peace Prize.

""This pivotal moment would not have happened without the courage of trans activists,"" the lawmakers' open letter reads.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Dozens of Democratic members of Congress have signed an open letter addressed to the Trump administration, demanding that portions of LGBTQ history that were removed from the Stonewall National Monument be restored.

Back in February, the National Park Service (NPS) eliminated the words “queer” and “transgender” from the Stonewall National Monument website. The monument commemorates the Stonewall Uprising, a 1969 riot in New York City for gay liberation — led by transgender women of color — that laid the foundation for Pride celebrations today.

The decision to remove those references was reportedly made to comply with President Donald Trump's anti-trans executive order, issued the previous month, which sought to “restore” references to supposed “biological truth” within the federal government — a false notion that rejects the widely accepted scientific fact that gender is not binary or solely determined by a person's sexual organs.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

Last week, 72 Democratic lawmakers in Congress signed an open letter demanding that references to transgender and queer people at the Stonewall National Monument be restored — including Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) and Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York), leaders within the Congressional Equality Caucus, as well as Rep. Dan Goldman (D-New York), who spearheaded the effort.

Their letter, addressed to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron, noted that the monument is meant to honor “the legacy of the Stonewall Rebellion and the critical role it played in the LGBTQIA+ civil rights movement.”

“This pivotal moment would not have happened without the courage of trans activists, particularly transgender women of color such as Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, who were on the front lines and fought for gay and transgender rights,” the letter stated.

The letter-writers added:

We are deeply alarmed by the NPS' recent changes to Stonewall National Monument. … This erasure of transgender and queer Americans from the history of Stonewall—or from any part of our national narrative — is a blatant attack on the integrity of public history. The history of Stonewall cannot be told without the stories of transgender Americans. 

The letter-writers then expressed concerns that the administration would alter the history behind other monuments, including those relating to Japanese internment camps during World War II, the U.S. genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the Americas, and the enslavement of Black people. Efforts to reshape historical narratives to conform to a political agenda “risk undermining public trust and the credibility of the Park Service,” they wrote.

The signers also said they were “especially troubled with the ongoing implementation of NPS' June 9th memo that requires all NPS units to post signage to encourage the public to offer feedback on any information that they feel portrays American history and landscapes in a negative light.”

“The lack of transparency on how NPS plans to rewrite ‘negative' content and incorporate visitor feedback is deeply concerning,” the letter-writers warned. “We must reject any attempts to gloss over or otherwise rewrite difficult chapters of our history.”

The letter from lawmakers came just days after Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a transgender activist and veteran of the Stonewall uprising, passed away at age 78.

Earlier this year, Miss Major spoke out against the Trump administration's attempts to erase transgender history at Stonewall.

“It's just terrible. They keep continually trying to eradicate us,” Miss Major said in an interview with USA Today.

“Being transgender is not the road to hell,” she went on, adding that those trying to erase history were “blinded” by people simply living their lives.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 America Can Make a Good Deal With China Without Abandoning the Island

 Marvin Park and David Sacks

When U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming weeks and months—likely starting next week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea—the immediate focus will be on how to de-escalate the latest round of export restrictions and tariff threats that the United States and China have wielded against each other. But Trump and Xi are also likely to consider a more ambitious deal to reset bilateral relations, which would seek not only to stabilize economic ties but also to reevaluate geopolitical flash points—above all, Taiwan. Indeed, this week Trump acknowledged to reporters that Taiwan is likely to come up in talks with Xi.

Chinese leaders have made no secret of their desire to assert control over Taiwan, by force if necessary, and they frequently remind their American interlocutors that the island remains the most sensitive and important aspect of U.S.-Chinese relations. Xi is likely to use negotiations to ask the United States to reduce its support for Taiwan, as Beijing believes that this would help China achieve its goal of bringing Taiwan more firmly under its control. Xi could even go so far as to see whether Trump would be willing to fundamentally alter U.S. policy toward Taiwan—by asking the United States to formally oppose Taiwan's independence, for example—in exchange for lucrative Chinese trade and investment promises. China may be willing to offer more market access to U.S. firms and increased purchases of American goods if Trump is willing to agree to Beijing's requests.

But accepting such a deal would be a grave mistake for the United States. Even subtle changes to U.S. policy that would shift it closer to Beijing's position would destabilize the region. A strong Taiwan that is confident in American support is a critical factor in maintaining peace in the region. Trump should not shy away from bringing up Taiwan in his negotiations with Xi, but he should use his leverage to push back on China's encroachment and reestablish norms in the Taiwan Strait that have proved successful in reducing the possibility of miscalculation. A good deal with Beijing would ensure Taiwan's safety, not set the island adrift.

Beijing's demands to the United States on Taiwan are rooted in the claim that it is Taiwan and the United States, not China, that are the principal drivers of regional instability. But in reality, it is China's increasingly aggressive actions, both militarily and politically, that have inflamed tensions. China has engaged in an unprecedented peacetime military expansion aimed at developing the ability to take Taiwan by force. It has intensified the tempo and scale of military exercises and training in amphibious operations, and it has rapidly expanded its arsenal of nuclear weapons. And it has attempted to isolate Taiwan internationally and intervene in its domestic politics.

Beijing says that its actions were a response to Taiwan's 2016 election that led to the presidency of Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, which takes a firmer line toward Beijing. But China had been increasing its military posturing even before her election. Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, of the Kuomintang, encouraged closer cross-strait ties and signed two dozen agreements with China on issues such as trade and tourism. Ma even met with Xi in Singapore, which marked the first time that political leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait had engaged directly since the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. But despite Ma's Beijing-friendly positions and this historic rapprochement, China significantly expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and its fleet of fighter jets stationed within range of Taiwan during his tenure. Taiwan's defense spending, by contrast, stagnated and even declined for much of Ma's presidency. Thus, by the time Tsai took office, China's military spending outstripped Taiwan's by a factor of 14.

Tsai originally sought to downplay tensions with China—but China rebuffed these overtures and instead increased pressure. Ma's so-called 1992 Consensus, which set the basis for cross-strait relations by agreeing that there is only one China but offering room to interpret this in multiple ways, had grown hugely unpopular in Taiwan. Tsai nonetheless stated in her inaugural address that she respected the “historical fact” of the understandings reached in 1992 and offered a creative formula that embodied a “one China” framework that could, in theory, respect Beijing's bottom line while satisfying the Taiwanese population. But Chinese leaders rejected that approach, passing up an opportunity to improve cross-strait relations and blaming Tsai for not going far enough.

Since 2022, when then U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi carried out a visit to Taiwan that Beijing saw as provocative, China has broken many long-standing norms of conduct in the Taiwan Strait. It has been routinely flying aircraft and sophisticated military drones across the centerline of the strait—a demarcation that both sides respected for decades—and stationed military and coast guard vessels around Taiwan. China has been challenging the boundaries of Taiwan's contiguous zone—an area of 24 nautical miles around the island—and is threatening to violate its territorial waters, which stretch 12 nautical miles from its shores. China has also increasingly sought to coerce Taiwan through nonmilitary means. It has pressured the few remaining countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei to instead recognize Beijing, imposed sanctions on Taiwanese products, and launched cyberattacks on Taiwanese infrastructure.

Meanwhile, amid this intensifying pressure campaign, Taiwan's citizens have further soured on Beijing. When Taiwanese voters elected Lai Ching-te, Tsai's former vice president, as president in January 2024, Beijing made clear that it would not work with him, labeling him a “dangerous separatist” intent on destroying cross-strait peace. China's military called Lai a “parasite” and depicted him in a propaganda video as a bug hovering over a Taiwan engulfed in flames. Although Lai has adopted a more defiant stance on Taiwan's relations with China than Tsai did, for instance by labeling China a “hostile foreign force,” Beijing's preemptive rejection of Lai has removed any incentive for him to take a more accommodating approach. Beijing is not looking for a way to break this impasse; instead, it is seeking external validation for its efforts to undermine Taiwan's leadership.

In upcoming negotiations, Xi could make a range of requests that seek to shift U.S. policy on Taiwan. These could include asking Trump to publicly oppose Taiwan's independence, to refrain from advocating for Taiwan's participation in international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), or even to restrict arms sales to the island. But granting these requests would bolster Beijing's position and harm U.S. interests.

Washington's long-standing position on Taiwan—which is based on the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communiqués between the United States and China signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Six Assurances that U.S. President Ronald Reagan conveyed to Taiwanese leaders in 1982—is that the United States does not support Taiwan's independence and does not take a position on its legal status. If Trump were to shift from this neutral stance to one that openly opposes Taiwanese independence, it would upend the carefully crafted neutrality that has helped maintain peace in the strait for decades. China would attempt to cast this move as a vote of no confidence in Lai and would use it to bolster a narrative that Taiwan cannot rely on the United States and should instead seek the best deal it can with Beijing. This would put pressure on Taipei, rather than Beijing, to reduce cross-strait tensions. But given that it is China that is primarily responsible for growing risks, this would back Taiwan's leaders into a corner and embolden China's aggressive behavior.

Any agreement that limited Taiwan's participation in international forums would also reverse three decades of U.S. policy and further undercut Taiwan's geopolitical space. Since U.S. President Bill Clinton completed a comprehensive review of American policy toward Taiwan in 1994, the United States has consistently called for Taiwan's membership in international organizations that do not require statehood to join and for its meaningful participation in those that do. During Ma's presidency, from 2008 to 2016, Beijing allowed Taipei to participate in meetings with UN specialized agencies such as the WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization, which sets global standards for air navigation. China's demand that the United States cease advocating on Taiwan's behalf would thus merely be an attempt to selectively isolate and pressure Lai.



A reduction in U.S. security cooperation with Taiwan would further erode the ability to deter a potential Chinese blockade or invasion of the island. The reality is that Taiwan does not have the capacity to meet its defense needs on its own, and the United States is the only country that is willing and able to provide the island with the defensive weapons it requires. Over the past three and a half decades, the United States has approved over $65 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, helped train Taiwan's military, and assisted the island's leaders in developing its defense strategy. To prevent China from attempting to take Taiwan by force, Washington must ensure that Beijing does not believe it can achieve its political aims at an acceptable military cost. Security cooperation between the United States and Taiwan sends a message to China's leaders and gives Taipei confidence that it can withstand the threats emanating from Beijing.

Trump's actions in the first year of his second term have already contributed to growing anxiety in Taipei about the durability of U.S. support. Concessions to Beijing would increase skepticism among the Taiwanese about the value of investing in deterrence and preparing for a potential crisis—what current leaders have called whole-of-society resilience. It would also further unsettle U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, prompting them to question the credibility of the United States. If U.S. support for Taiwan declines, other countries may feel that they have less room to pursue closer relations with Taipei, offering China another opportunity to try to push regional powers away from cooperating with Taiwan.

American negotiators can make a good deal with China that reduces tensions in the Taiwan Strait without selling out Taiwan. The objective should be to take incremental steps to restore the status quo that existed before Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. Washington should press Beijing to pull its military, coast guard, and surveillance ships from Taiwan's contiguous zone, reduce the frequency and scale of major military exercises around Taiwan, refrain from crossing the centerline in the Taiwan Strait, and decrease its military buildup in areas within range of Taiwan. In exchange, the United States could offer to make reciprocal changes to reduce its overall military buildup in the region. Such steps would reduce the chance of escalation and add much-needed stability to the Taiwan Strait.

Negotiations could start by seeking to limit offensive military capabilities around Taiwan. The United States could ask China to withdraw long-range and mobile ballistic missile systems currently stationed opposite Taiwan, so that attack systems on the mainland are not positioned within range to strike the island. It could also request that China restrict how closely People's Liberation Army ships and aircraft operate near Taiwan. In exchange, the United States could pull back its own long-range weaponry, such as the Typhon missile system that it recently deployed to the Philippines, from China's immediate periphery, while maintaining the ability to redeploy those capabilities if necessary. The United States could also refocus its regional military exercises involving aircraft carriers and bombers on defensive objectives, such as protecting U.S. and allied territory, rather than offensive missions that appear to target China.



The United States could also propose establishing a de facto buffer zone around Taiwan. Such a buffer would reduce the risk of incidents that could escalate into a major conflict. It would also restore early warning indicators that would make it easier for both Beijing and Washington to send and read strategic signals, which would allow them to differentiate between routine exercises and military escalation. As long as the United States maintains enough forces in the region to communicate its willingness to enforce boundaries, such a buffer zone would not undermine the ability of the United States and Taiwan to collectively deter China. China may be amenable to this arrangement because Xi, who continues to purge high-level military officials, appears to not fully trust the People's Liberation Army or its readiness to take Taiwan in the near term.

Leaders in the United States and China should also explore mutual restraint in how they talk about Taiwan's legal status. In recent years, the Chinese government has intensified its campaign to push an alternate interpretation of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, the 1971 measure that flipped the UN seat representing China from Taipei to Beijing. China claims that Resolution 2758 says that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China—a claim that Western legal scholars widely reject—raising concerns that Beijing is seeking to lay the legal foundation for attacking Taiwan. Meanwhile, the United States' pushback against China's position on Resolution 2758 is viewed in Beijing as an effort to promote Taiwan's permanent separation from the mainland. The two sides should pursue a cease-fire in this war of words in which both sides refrain from discussing Taiwan's legal status, a practice that had largely been followed for decades.

Although these are limited steps, any incremental progress in the Taiwan Strait would be a major achievement. Rather than merely reacting to Beijing's proposals, Washington can set the agenda on Taiwan and stabilize the Taiwan Strait, which remains the likeliest venue of a war between the two nuclear-armed powers. If China balks at American suggestions, it would nonetheless clarify Beijing's intentions and send an important signal to the region that the United States does not seek war in the Taiwan Strait—and is committed in both words and deeds to preventing one.

            Finalizing a $20 billion lifeline for Argentina using taxpayers' funds during the government shutdown was an essential action for the agency, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.
    


            His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources.
    


            “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN.
    


            The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent announced earlier this month is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina's central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it's a loan from the US government.
    


            The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he'll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump said last week future efforts to boost the Argentine economy would be contingent on the election results.
    


            But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful.
    


FAQ: Why America just bailed out Argentina with a $20 billion lifeline



            While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent's announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it.
    


            Warren also questioned Treasury's plans to work with private-sector banks to generate a $20 billion loan to Argentina on top of the $20 billion rescue package from the government.
    


            Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement. The Treasury Department didn't respond to CNN's inquiry.
    


            Bessent has spent much of this week meeting with foreign finance ministers in Malaysia. Last week, Bessent said he'd be meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have recently escalated.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Democratic senator protests Trump's ‘grave threats' in marathon floor speech","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jeff-merkley-senate-floor-speech","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:04:51 GMT","


            Sen. Jeff Merkley has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than 18 hours after announcing he would protest what he called President Donald Trump's “grave threats to democracy.”
    


            “I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.
    


            Bending his legs at times, highlighting the physical strain that comes with committing to standing for so long, Merkley had delivered the sixth longest floor speech in modern history as he continued speaking into the afternoon. Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.
    


            Merkley's marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.
    


            Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 11 times until their demands are met. There is expected to be another procedural vote on the Republican proposal once Merkley finishes speaking.
    


            The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration's previous halting of research grants for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the recent indictments of several of the president's political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.
    


            “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion. And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.
    


            Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.
    


            His comments on the situation in Oregon come after an appeals court on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.
    


            “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court's permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”
    


            Earlier this year, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.
    


            This was also not Merkley's first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017 against Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.
    


            In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Cambodia's capital has a new airport. Will tourists follow?","https://www.cnn.com/travel/cambodia-techo-airport-phnom-penh-intl-hnk","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:10:14 GMT","


            On a humid day in early September, orange-robed monks gathered in the departures hall of Cambodia's newest airport, chanting blessings over a 30-foot golden statue that now watches travelers as they prepare for departure.
    


            Only after the nine-ton Buddha was blessed could planes begin to land at Phnom Penh's Techo International Airport.
    


            Four days later, Air Cambodia flight K6 611 from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou taxied in under the spray of celebratory water cannons as traditional Khmer dancers in silk costumes performed in the arrivals hall.
    


            On October 20, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet cut a ribbon to officially inaugurate the airport.
    


            “This is a new achievement reflecting Cambodia's long-term development vision,” he told reporters at the site.
    


            Above all, Hun Manet's government hopes the airport will be filled with tourists. Despite its UNESCO-listed temples, beaches, and famously affordable prices, Cambodia attracts only about 2.5 million international visitors a year — a fraction of the 32 million who go to Thailand and the 18 million who visit Vietnam.
    


            Techo International, a reported $2 billion project about 18 miles south of Phnom Penh, is meant to change that. The 87,000-square-foot facility, named for a Khmer military honorific title granted by the king, is being billed as a gateway to a new era of tourism and investment in Cambodia's under-visited south.
    


            Inside, natural light filters through floor-to-ceiling windows onto pale wood floors and tropical greenery. The curving roofline, designed by British firm Foster + Partners, draws inspiration from the ornate headdresses of traditional Apsara dancers.
    


            Nikolai Malsch, a senior partner at Foster + Partners, said the design emphasizes clear sightlines and minimal confusion. Travelers should never feel trapped in a maze of corridors.
    


            “It's a very simple binary decision,” he explained. “Walking to the gates, you come to a point where your gate is either left or it's right.”
    


            The terminal's maximum walking distance, he added, is just 500 meters – roughly 550 yards — from center to end.
    


            Beyond efficiency, the building aims to be unmistakably Cambodian. The roof's swooping ridges double as rainwater catchment points. Local coffee chain Brown Coffee opened early to serve lattes to construction crews.
    


            Charles Vann, director of Cambodia Airport Investment Company, a key financial backer of the airport, said he hopes the airport will help act as a draw for travelers in its own right. “We believe that this airport can attract a lot of visitors and tourists to come to Cambodia, similar to Dubai (or) London,” he told CNN.
    


            The government has positioned Techo International as both a modern infrastructure project and a point of national pride. Alongside facial recognition scanners and environmental certification, the airport even has its own theme song — “Power of Techo International Airport” — shared on Prime Minister Hun Manet's social media accounts.
    


            “The aviation sector is one of many ways to connect tourists, businesses, political networks, and multi-purpose missions,” Hun Manet wrote. “Cambodia has actively expanded and upgraded its international airports to meet growing travel demand, enhancing connectivity for travelers.”
    


            Techo isn't the country's only recent airport milestone. The $1 billion Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport (SAI), opened in 2023, was built under China's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect more of the world, and extend Beijing's influence, through Chinese-made infrastructure.
    


            Both airports form key pillars of Cambodia's “Sacred Tourism 2025-2035” master plan — a blueprint to develop wellness, agricultural, and community tourism. The country wants to diversify its offering beyond Angkor Wat, the ancient Hindu-Buddhist temple complex currently seen as its star attraction.
    


            For Cambodia, new runways promise connection. Flights now link Phnom Penh to Bangkok, Beijing, Hanoi, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur, with Turkish Airlines and Etihad set to add direct routes from Istanbul and Abu Dhabi this fall, making it much easier for visitors from Europe and the Middle East to access Cambodia.
    


            Not everything is rosy in Cambodia's travel forecast. The airport's big inauguration event was held four days after South Korea issued a rare “code black” travel warning for parts of Cambodia, following the death of a Korean student allegedly tortured at a phone scam center. International advisories warn travelers of heightened risk of crime in Phnom Penh and dangers from decades-old unexploded ordnance in other regions.
    


            Some in the aviation industry are skeptical of Cambodia's big tourism ambitions.
    


            Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, believes that a shiny new airport is not enough on its own to bring tourists.
    


            “Vietnam and Thailand have more to offer in terms of culture, food and, more importantly, security,” he says. “Apart from Angkor Wat and the Killing Fields, there aren't other spots to lure tourists to Cambodia.”
    


            “At the moment Cambodia is struggling to overcome a reputation as a destination for syndicates involved in scams, frauds and human trafficking.”
    


            Across Southeast Asia, the Belt and Road program has also funded a high-speed train connecting Laos and China, and Chinese investment is helping build a metro system in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi.

            Phase two of Techo's development will eventually add a train connection to Phnom Penh's city center. For now, most passengers arrive by private car or tuk-tuk along the new highway stretching through rice fields.
    


            Meanwhile, Phnom Penh International — the Cambodian capital's old airport which had already been eclipsed in size by Siem Reap-Angkor International — has now closed to traffic and there's no official plan yet for its next life.
    


            But under the watchful gaze of its departure hall Buddha, Techo International is beginning to spring into life, step by step.
    


            Cambodia has built the airport it hopes will redefine its global image. Now it just needs the world to show up.

            Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the region later this week. It's proof this year's Atlantic hurricane season is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.
    


            Melissa was about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was churning forward at an agonizingly slow 2 mph.
    


            Heavy rain is already spreading north Wednesday as Melissa moves at a snail's pace toward Jamaica and Haiti. A foot or more of rain is possible in southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through this weekend. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.
    


            Melissa is moving over water that's so warm it's essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season, and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday morning.
    


            When that happens, it will be the 2025 Atlantic season's fifth hurricane and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean. It's also increasingly likely Melissa could become the season's fourth major hurricane — Category 3 or greater.
    


            A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica. There's a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus.
    


            Here's what we know so far.
    


            Melissa's exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios. The possibilities have changed slightly from initial forecasts, but both place Hispaniola and Jamaica in harm's way.
    


            Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, which is the island that houses the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as it drifts closer to the island through the weekend.
    


            It's still unclear exactly what parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. Jamaica could also receive torrential, flooding rainfall beginning later this week.
    


            The islands will also face strong, potentially damaging winds from Melissa, especially after it reaches hurricane strength Saturday, according to the hurricane center's forecast.
    


            Slow-moving storms like Melissa hit the same areas with torrential rain and strong winds for days, significantly increasing rainfall totals and the likelihood of power outages. Melissa will start moving quicker at some point, and exactly when and where that happens is extremely important to determine its impacts. It's also still quite unclear.
    


            If Melissa's current forecast track holds and the storm moves slowly west toward an area south of Jamaica into early next week, it could end up where the atmosphere and extremely warm water align to boost the storm.
    


            Melissa is now expected to become at least a Category 3 major hurricane by Monday morning.
    


            Its anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that's happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.
    


            A stronger Melissa would eventually turn northeast next week and threaten other portions of the Caribbean, like Cuba. That scenario would increase the intensity of all of Melissa's impacts from rain to wind and dangerous seas.
    


            Alternatively, there's still a chance that another weather pattern could pull Melissa north toward Jamaica or Haiti early next week. This path would likely prevent Melissa from reaching the strength it might in the first scenario, but could also mean a direct landfall and more concentrated impacts in either location.
    


            A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not impossible. At this time, the storm's most likely impact to the US could be some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.
    


            Florida could be in play if Melissa takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa's wind and rain.
    


            The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently, Hurricane Nicole slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and Hurricane Zeta smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.
    


            As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.
    


            Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Leaders at the Pentagon have significantly altered how military officials will speak with Congress after a pair of new memos issued last week.

In an Oct. 15 memo, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his deputy, Steve Feinberg, ordered Pentagon officials — including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to obtain permission from the department's main legislative affairs office before they have any communication with Capitol Hill.

The memo was issued the same day the vast majority of Pentagon reporters exited the building rather than agree to the Defense Department's new restrictions on their work, and it appears to be part of a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over what the department communicates to the outside world.

According to the memo, a copy of which was authenticated by a Pentagon official, “unauthorized engagements with Congress by (Pentagon) personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives.”

Sean Parnell, the top Pentagon spokesman, called the move a “pragmatic step” that's part of an effort “to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency.”

Previously, individual agencies and military branches within the Pentagon were able to manage their own communications with Congress. 

A second memo, issued Oct. 17, directed a “working group to further define the guidance on legislative engagements.”

The memos were first reported by the website Breaking Defense.

A marketer of shark-repellant sunscreen. A maker of chocolate-flavored whiskey. A seller of a drink that promises to quickly lower blood-alcohol levels.

Until recently, these businesses had significant losses and floundering stock prices in common. Now, they're members of a legion of publicly traded companies helping to power one of the biggest trends in markets and the crypto industry.

So far this year, billions of dollars have flowed into companies that have reinvented themselves by making the buying and holding of cryptocurrency their main focus. More than 200 public companies have announced plans to hold crypto on their balance sheets as so-called digital asset treasury companies, or DATs.

The rebranding as crypto companies came after years of losses in a variety of niche enterprises that include making lavender-flavored vodka, manufacturing materials for indoor marijuana growers, and selling ozone-infused water as part of a “nanobubble” cleaning technology.

The trend has attracted a wide range of people, from obscure to more well-known investors.

“We're going to change finance forever, it's that simple,” President Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, said in August at a Nasdaq opening bell ringing ceremony for a new DAT focused on a cryptocurrency founded by the Trump family. “It's a great milestone for our country.”

But just how transformative the DAT craze will be remains to be seen, as questions mount about the sustainability of this trend. Many new DATs have seen prolonged stock slides after receiving an initial bump.

“We are probably past peak DAT, if we're being honest about it,” said Austin Campbell, the founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting and an adjunct professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.

Publicly traded companies turn themselves into DATs by raising money through the sale of stocks and then use that money to buy types of crypto. The money is often raised from private investors, sometimes with ties to the type of cryptocurrency the new DAT will stockpile.

In 2020, the tech firm MicroStrategy became the first DAT when it started accumulating bitcoin, the world's oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Led by ultra bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, the company's stock price has been one of the best performing in the past five years.

The success of MicroStrategy, which has rebranded as Strategy, has spawned dozens of imitators. The first wave of crypto treasury companies focused on bitcoin while more recently companies have started buying large stakes in more niche and unproven forms of cryptocurrency.

One reason DATs are booming is that buying and managing crypto holdings—especially newer tokens—can be daunting for newcomers.

S.Y. Lee, founder of the crypto project Story, said even sophisticated investors hesitate to manage digital wallets. DATs make the process as simple as buying a stock.

“Here you just go to your brokerage account … you just buy the shares,” Lee said in an interview with CoinDesk.

His crypto company, which focuses on trying to monetize intellectual property, has been backed by the heavy-hitting venture capital fund a16z crypto. Story recently partnered with Heritage Distilling, a Washington-based maker of chocolate-flavored whiskey and lavender vodka, to form a new DAT.

For struggling companies, becoming a DAT is a way to reinvent their brand and take advantage of a growing cryptocurrency market while raising new capital.

It can also mean big payouts to some of the company executives and others involved. Mill City Ventures, a company that developed an online poker game and offered high-interest loans before it became a DAT focused on the cryptocurrency Sui, has agreed to pay at least $1 million a year in fees to a firm managing its crypto.

Justin Sun is one of the most visible figures in crypto. The founder of the Tron blockchain, Sun is a billionaire who has been a key investor in Trump family crypto projects and was invited earlier this year to a dinner with the president.

Sun has also been in legal fights with former employees who alleged abuse, the media mogul David Geffen, who alleged Sun committed fraud related to the sale of a pricey sculpture, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused of him of market manipulation and improperly paying celebrities like Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul to tout Sun's crypto.

That case was paused shortly after Trump took office and Sun made a triumphant appearance on Wall Street in July when he wore a tuxedo to help ring Nasdaq's opening bell to mark a new Tron-focused DAT.

The company that turned to Sun's crypto for its treasury is SRM Entertainment, a firm with a history of losses that sells theme park knickknacks. Company CEO Richard Miller has taken a winding road to being a top executive at a crypto-focused company. He cut his teeth as a broker at Stratton Oakmont, an infamous boiler room brokerage featured in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” where he once agreed to pay $125,000 to settle customer complaints of wrongdoing, according to regulatory documents. 

Miller later got into the skincare business. A company that previously acquired SRM Entertainment that he helped run marketed sunscreens that claimed to also repel sharks and jellyfish.

In the days after the company announced it was transitioning to a Tron-focused DAT, Miller exercised stock options that allowed him to buy shares for 56 cents each and then sell them just as the stock was peaking for more than $10. Miller's total stock sales totaled more than $1 million. The stock price has fallen significantly since then.

SRM Entertainment previously spun off from a firm that also recently became a DAT. Safety Shot, which markets a drink claiming to lower blood-alcohol levels by as much as 50% in 30 minutes, had a varied history before becoming a DAT focused on a dog-themed meme coin cryptocurrency called Bonk earlier this year.

Safety Shot and its predecessors' product history include health products meant to address herpes cold sores, hair loss and “women's sexual wellness.” The company has been accused of taking unethical steps to try to boost flagging stock prices.

Organizers for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival sued the company last year after alleging it released a “bogus press release” indicating it was a festival sponsor. A judge later issued an injunction against Safety Shot.

Alt5 Sigma was a little-known fintech company before it pledged in August to buy $1.5 billion worth of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial tokens.

The company, which has previously operated a household appliance recycling business and developed pain drugs, has a rocky history. Its predecessor, JanOne, was sued by the SEC in 2021 for allegedly conspiring to issue false financial reports. JanOne settled without admitting wrongdoing. The SEC continues to pursue a case against former CEO Jon Isaac, whose father now serves as Alt5's president.

Alt5's Canadian subsidiary was recently convicted of money laundering in Rwanda, and the company has also been accused of conspiring with its former chief financial officer to hide stock from creditors, according to its SEC filings. Alt5 has denied any wrongdoing.

Eric Trump was initially set to join Alt5's board of directors, but the company said that he would instead be an “observer” in order “to comply with Nasdaq's listing rules.”

The DAT craze is not the first time publicly traded companies have taken hard pivots to crypto. During a crypto boom in 2017 and 2018, several companies rebranded as firms focused on blockchains, the technology that powers crypto transactions.

Photo company Kodak launched a crypto token called KodakCoin while a company called Long Island Iced Tea rebranded as Long Blockchain Corp. Several companies that underwent a crypto rebrand back then enjoyed short increases in their stock prices but did not find lasting success.

The Long Island tea company's shift to crypto, for example, led to it being delisted from Nasdaq and several individuals being charged with insider trading. For companies that have pivoted to crypto more recently, the SEC's plans to make it easier to launch exchange-traded funds focused on niche forms of crypto could spell trouble.

But Jason Rozovsky, who is head of policy at the crypto firm Axelar, said the SEC's move isn't “necessarily bad news.”

“Investor interest in bitcoin DATs has continued to grow, even as ETFs and other compliant options have become available, which suggests these structures may remain a durable part of the market.”

NEW YORK (AP) — An immigration enforcement sweep targeting vendors on Manhattan's famed Canal Street turned chaotic on Tuesday after droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded federal agents and attempted to block them from driving off, prompting arrests and fierce standoffs along a bustling downtown corridor.

The confrontation began shortly after 4 p.m., as federal agents fanned out across a section of Chinatown that has long served as a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes, electronics and other goods.

An Associated Press reporter observed dozens of agents detaining a street vendor selling bedazzled smartphone cases, one of a number of arrests in the area.

In response, a contingent of protesters, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, surrounded the masked officers, attempting to block their vehicle as they shouted “ICE out of New York” and called on other pedestrians to join them.

Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with pepper spray before detaining them.

As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Additional federal agents, armed with long guns and tactical gear, also arrived in a military tactical vehicle.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agents were conducting an enforcement operation against sellers of “counterfeit goods” 

“During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,” she said.

At least one person was arrested for assaulting an officer, McLaughlin said. She did not respond to a request about how many vendors were detained.

The sweep came days after a conservative influencer shared video on X showing a group of men selling bags on the street, urging the official ICE account to “check this corner out.”

While clashes between immigration authorities and protesters have played out in Los Angeles and other cities, such scenes have been rarer on New York City streets, which Mayor Eric Adams has attributed in part to his working relationship with President Donald Trump's administration.

Trump has threatened to send federal troops to the city if Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, wins election in two weeks.

An FBI spokesperson said Tuesday that special agents were involved with immigration enforcement efforts in New York in response to a request from DHS to help with “major operations.”

Mayor Eric Adams said the city had no involvement in the sweep Tuesday and was still gathering details.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said.

In a statement, Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, accused the Trump administration of trying to create a “violent spectacle” on the city's streets.

“This operation had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with terrorizing immigrant families and communities,” he said.

The demolition of part of the White House's East Wing continues as President Donald Trump aims to build a new ballroom. Here's a breakdown of the White House layout. (AP Video: Jacquelyn Martin and River Zhang)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Construction started this week on the $250 million ballroom that President Donald Trump is adding to the White House as construction crews began tearing down the facade of the East Wing, where the new space is being built.

The Republican president and top White House officials had initially said nothing would be demolished during construction. 

The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will dwarf the main White House itself, at nearly double the size, and Trump says it will accommodate 999 people.

Trump said on social media that the ballroom won't cost taxpayers a dime because it is being privately funded by “many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.” 

Here are some things to know about the newest White House construction project:

Trump says the White House needs a large entertaining space and has complained that the East Room, the current largest space in the White House, is too small, holding about 200 people. He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn. 




Trump says the project will be paid for with private donations and that no public money will be spent on the ballroom. The White House promised to release information on which individuals and corporations have pledged or donated money and invited some of the donors to an East Room dinner last week, but has not released a comprehensive list and breakdown of funds.

Some $22 million for the project came from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, as part of a recent settlement for a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought against the company.

The White House also has not said how much of his own money Trump is contributing.




The East Wing is traditionally the social side of the White House and sits across East Executive Avenue from the Treasury Department. It's where tourists and other guests enter for events.

The president and his chief spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said over the summer that the White House itself would remain intact as the ballroom was going up.

“It'll be near it but not touching it,” Trump said. “Nothing will be torn down,” Leavitt added.

That turned out not to be the case.

The White House said some demolition was needed because the East Wing, the traditional home for the first lady and her staff, is being modernized as part of the ballroom project.

He's moving ahead with construction despite the lack of sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, the executive branch agency that has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.

Trump named a top White House aide, Will Scharf, to head the commission. Scharf has made a distinction between demolition work and rebuilding, saying the commission was only required to vet the latter.

By Trump's telling, it will become a space where guests will mingle, sip cocktails and eat hors d'oeuvres until they are called into the ballroom for dinner. Trump said a set of windows in the room will be removed to create a passageway to and from the ballroom. 

Renderings released by the White House suggest a strong resemblance to the gilded ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club and home in Palm Beach, Florida. 

The project also has grown in size since it was announced, going from accommodating 650 seated guests to holding 999 people, big enough to fit an inauguration if needed, he said at a recent White House dinner for donors. Windows will be bulletproof, he said. 

The White House has said the ballroom will be ready for use before Trump's second term ends in January 2029, an ambitious timeline.

Yes. He has heavily redecorated the Oval Office by adding numerous portraits, busts and gold-toned adornments. He converted the Rose Garden into a stone-covered patio, installed towering flagpoles on the north and south lawns, and decorated an exterior wall with portraits of every president except his immediate predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. 

Trump also said he renovated the bathroom in the famous Lincoln Bedroom in the private living quarters and laid down marble floors in a passageway leading to the South Lawn. 

Presidents have added to the White House since construction began in 1792 for a host of reasons, and Trump aides say his decision to build a ballroom follows that long tradition. 

Many of the prior projects were criticized as being too costly or too lavish, but eventually came to be accepted, according to the White House Historical Association. 

Thomas Jefferson added the east and west colonnades. 

Andrew Jackson built the North Portico on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House, aligning with the South Portico that James Monroe added after the original mansion was rebuilt after the British burned it during the War of 1812.

Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing to provide dedicated space for the president and key staff, while Franklin D. Roosevelt added the East Wing, which over time became the home base for the first lady's staff and social functions. 

One of the most significant White House renovations happened under Harry Truman, when the mansion was found to be so structurally unsound that he ordered a complete gutting of the interior that lasted from 1948 to 1952. The project, including Truman's addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico, was highly controversial. 

Other changes include the creation of the Rose Garden during John F. Kennedy's administration and Richard Nixon's decision to convert an indoor swimming pool that was built for FDR's physical therapy into a workspace for the growing White House press corps.

President Donald Trump says his plan for a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary is on hold because he doesn't want it to be a “waste of time.” The decision was made following a call Monday between Sec. of State Marco Rubio and Russian FM Sergey Lavrov.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday his plan for a swift meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a “waste of time.” It was the latest twist in Trump's stop-and-go effort to resolve the war in Ukraine. 

The decision to hold off on the meeting in Budapest, Hungary, which Trump had announced last week, was made following a call Monday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

“I don't want to have a wasted meeting,” Trump said. “I don't want to have a waste of time — so we'll see what happens.”

Lavrov made clear in public comments Tuesday that Russia is opposed to an immediate ceasefire. Trump, meanwhile, has been shifting his stance all year on key issues in the war, including whether a ceasefire should come before longer-term peace talks, and whether Ukraine could win back land seized by Russia during almost four years of fighting.

Trump's hesitancy in meeting Putin will likely come as a relief to European leaders, who have accused Putin of stalling for time with diplomacy while trying to gain ground on the battlefield. 

The leaders — including the British prime minister, French president and German chancellor — said they opposed any push to make Ukraine surrender land captured by Russian forces in return for peace, as Trump most recently has suggested.




They also plan to push forward with plans to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's war efforts, despite some misgivings about the legality and consequences of such a step.

The U.S. and Russian presidents last met in Alaska in August, but the encounter did not advance Trump's stalled attempts to end a war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The Kremlin didn't seem to be in a rush to get Trump and Putin together again either. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that “preparation is needed, serious preparation” before a meeting.

Trump suggested that decisions about the meeting would be made in the coming days.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been trying to strengthen Ukraine's position by seeking long-range Tomahawk missiles from the U.S., although Trump has waffled on whether he would provide them. 

“We need to end this war, and only pressure will lead to peace,” Zelenskyy said Tuesday in a Telegram post.

He noted that Putin returned to diplomacy and called Trump last week when it looked like Tomahawk missiles were a possibility. But “as soon as the pressure eased a little, the Russians began to try to drop diplomacy, postpone the dialogue,” Zelenskyy said.

On Wednesday, Trump is expected to hold talks in the White House with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the U.S. by Canada and European countries. 

A meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries who support Ukraine — is due to take place in London on Friday.

Trump initially focused on pressuring Ukraine to make concessions, but then grew frustrated with Putin's intransigence. Trump often complains that he thought his good relationship with his Russian counterpart would have made it easier to end the war.

Last month, Trump reversed his long-held position that Ukraine would have to give up land and suggested it could win back all the territory it has lost to Russia. But after a phone call with Putin last week and a subsequent meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday, Trump shifted his position again and called on Kyiv and Moscow to “stop where they are” and end the war.

On Sunday, Trump said the industrial Donbas region of eastern Ukraine should be “cut up,” leaving most of it in Russian hands.

Trump said Monday that while he thinks it is possible that Ukraine can ultimately defeat Russia, he's now doubtful it will happen.

“We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” the leaders' statement said. “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”

Lavrov made clear Tuesday that Russia opposes a ceasefire, Russian state news agencies reported. He told journalists in Moscow that it would go against what the two presidents agreed upon in Alaska. Trump had hoped to get Russia to stop the fighting, but he was rebuffed by Putin, who has pushed for a comprehensive settlement to end the war.

Russia occupies about one fifth of Ukraine, but carving up their country in return for peace is unacceptable to Kyiv officials.

Also, a conflict frozen on the current front line could fester, with occupied areas of Ukraine offering Moscow a springboard for new attacks in the future, Ukrainian and European officials fear.

The statement by the leaders of Ukraine, the U.K., Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Denmark and EU officials came early in what Zelenskyy said Monday would be a week that is “very active in diplomacy.”

More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.

“We must ramp up the pressure on Russia's economy and its defense industry, until Putin is ready to make peace,” Tuesday's statement said.

Michelino Sunseri climbed past boulders on his way to a record-breaking feat: The extreme runner reached the summit of Grand Teton, one of the highest mountains in the American West, and then rushed back down, all in less than three hours.

The National Park Service, however, didn't celebrate. Instead, it charged him with a crime.

Sunseri was found guilty of a misdemeanor for spending just two minutes during the run on a prohibited trail in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. 

The remarkable solo triumph in 2024 has been overshadowed by his legal saga. “Free Michelino” stickers are on posts and benches in Jackson, Wyoming. Sunseri's supporters, including members of Congress, are appalled by what they consider to be a glaring example of excessive enforcement by the government.

But Sunseri, 33, may be getting a break. His lawyer, Alex Rienzie, said prosecutors have agreed to seek a dismissal if the runner completes 60 hours of community service and a course on wilderness stewardship. A judge expressed concern about the shift Tuesday and still would need to sign off. Another hearing was set for Nov. 18.

“It is an evolution of what is right and was made to preserve prosecutive and judicial resources while upholding the best interests of the public and the justice system,” the U.S. Attorney's Office in Wyoming said.

Sunseri said he's hopeful for a “rational and reasonable agreement” that puts the matter behind him.

Prosecutors had repeatedly said the ban on shortcutting designated trails is on the park's website, the park map and in other places. They insisted on pressing ahead with a two-day trial last May, despite a lack of support from officials in the new Trump administration.




Joey Wilson of Salt Lake City, an ultramarathoner who designs training programs for athletes, said the significance of Sunseri's achievement sometimes gets lost.

“It's an unbelievable thing that he accomplished — world class,” Wilson said. 

Sunseri defended himself by saying he took the same route as many previous record holders on Grand Teton, including Kilian Jornet, one of the world's greatest mountain athletes, in 2012, without any blowback from the Park Service.

He set out on Sept. 2, 2024, sharing the mountain with Labor Day holiday hikers. The path starts flat and wide before becoming extremely rocky on the way up. 

“There are boulders the size of small houses,” said Wilson, whose father was a park ranger. “You've got to use your hands. If your hands were to pop off in a couple of places, you're going to fall a long way down.”

Sunseri also had to confront a series of switchbacks as the Garnet Canyon Trail zigged and zagged like a maze. On his way down, shirtless and wearing a hat backwards, he made a split-second decision that would later land him in court: He left a switchback to avoid casual hikers and possible injury, taking a path known as the Old Climber's Trail for two minutes.

“I was ahead of pace,” said Sunseri, who had trained by running the mountain more than 40 times. “I knew I was going to get the record regardless of which trail I took. I didn't want to be yelling at people to get out of my way.”

A small sign where he entered the trail says, “Short Cutting Causes Erosion,” while another at the other end says, “Closed For Regrowth.” Sunseri said there was no vegetation to destroy on the steep, narrow, hard-packed ground.

Later, Sunseri dropped to his knees in exhaustion at the base of the mountain. He had set a new fastest-known time on Grand Teton — “FKT” in the running community — of 2 hours, 50 minutes, 50 seconds.

Sunseri had run a total of 13.3 miles (21.4 kilometers) while gaining an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,133 meters) on his way up the mountain. The summit rests at 13,775 feet (4,198 meters).

“I was stoked,” he recalled. “It's one of those things where every single thing has to go right — and everything did go right.”

Andy Anderson didn't bypass switchbacks during his record run in 2012, but Sunseri said he still had his blessing. They had dinner in Truckee, California, and Anderson handed over the prize: a handmade box bearing a commemorative belt buckle and listing the names of past Grand Teton record holders.

Sunseri wrote about his epic run on social media. Those words doomed him. Federal investigators used search warrants to get access to the posts, which led to a misdemeanor charge of shortcutting a designated trail in the national park.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick found him guilty in a 51-page opinion released in September. She noted the testimony of Park Service Ranger Michelle Altizer, who said Sunseri's “actions were high profile” and that the potential to deter others was “very high and an important consideration” in citing him.

Sunseri's lawyers argued that the signs on Old Climber's Trail did not explicitly prohibit entry.

“The trail has been sitting in its current state for decades,” Wilson told The Associated Press. “If they really wanted to close that trail they could plant seeds over it and put a log down. Trail closed. Do not cross.”

After the spring trial, emails obtained by the defense team revealed that Park Service officials in Washington had told prosecutors on the eve of trial that they were withdrawing their support. A U.S. Interior Department lawyer referred to President Donald Trump's order “fighting overcriminalization” in federal regulations. 

“We're continuing with the prosecution,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Romine in Wyoming wrote back.

Because of the court case, Sunseri's performance on Grand Teton is not being recognized by fastestknowntime.com, a website for the best times on routes considered to have remarkable scenery or historical and cultural value around the world. 

In Congress, U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is sponsoring a bill that would make willful intent a requirement for prosecuting certain crimes like Sunseri's trail-cutting misdemeanor. He called the case a “prime example of the problem of overcriminalization.”

""You know, I'm not (surprised) because everybody's raising money to pay players,"" Saban told ESPN on Tuesday. ""So, the people that are giving the money think they have a voice and they're just like a bunch of fans. When they get frustrated and disappointed, they put pressure on the (athletic directors) to take action, and it's the way of the world.""

Napier and Penn State's James Franklin are among the biggest names to be kicked to the curb during the season. Sam Pittman (Arkansas), Mike Gundy (Oklahoma State), Deshaun Foster (UCLA), Brent Pry (Virginia Tech) and Trent Bray (Oregon State) were also axed by their respective schools.

Saban said on Saturday that he thought Franklin's dismissal was ""unfair,"" given the success that Franklin had at Penn State.

Saban told ESPN that college football still needs to find a way to ""improve the quality of life of players"" while also developing them and giving them a proper education.

A former mayor in Massachusetts was stabbed outside a cannabis dispensary he owns, according to officials.

Will Flanagan, 45, served as the Democratic mayor of Fall River from 2010 until 2014, when he faced a recall election after being accused of showing a gun to one of his political rivals, Jasiel Correia, according to The Herald News. The Fall River Police Department said the stabbing happened on Monday at around 5 p.m. outside Cosmopolitan Dispensary, which Flanagan owns.

Police said Flanagan suffered ""significant injuries"" and was transported to a hospital, where he was listed in serious but stable condition.

Fall River police announced Tuesday afternoon that 31-year-old Corree Gonzales was arrested in connection with the stabbing.

The full support of the Mayor's Office is with the Fall River Police Department as they work tirelessly to bring justice in this case. We stand firmly behind Chief Kelly Furtado, and the dedicated men and women of the FRPD as they continue this active investigation,"" Coogan said.

Fall River Police Chief Kelly Furtado said patrol officers and detectives ""responded swiftly"" to what she called a ""senseless act of violence.""

""We will exhaust every resource to ensure justice is served,"" she said. ""I want to thank the Mayor's Office for their continued support as we move forward with this investigation.""

The Coast Guard is bolstering its forces along western Texas' Rio Grande to support President Donald Trump's border security mission as part of a ""surge operation,"" according to the service. 

Trump declared a national emergency at the border in January, and his administration stood up Joint Task Force Southern Border in March to allow troops under the Department of War to assist with the Department of Homeland Security's border mission. 

Dubbed Operation River Wall, the Coast Guard deployment aims to counter the influx of drugs into the U.S., and to deter and interdict illegal immigrants along the 260-mile stretch of the river that is part of the U.S. border, the service announced Monday. 

The Coast Guard said it is dispatching additional response boats, shallow watercraft, command and control assets, and tactical teams to the area to support the operation.

The service said it is leading operations it is conducting alongside U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of War under U.S. Northern Command to advance Trump's border priorities. 

""U.S. Coast Guard is the best in the world at tactical boat operations and maritime interdiction at sea, along our coasts, and in riverine environments,"" Adm. Kevin Lunday, acting commandant of the Coast Guard, said in a Monday statement. ""Through Operation River Wall, the Coast Guard is controlling the U.S. southern border along the Rio Grande River in eastern Texas.""

It's unclear exactly how many Coast Guard personnel and assets are involved in Operation River Wall, and the Coast Guard did not provide specifics, citing operational security concerns. 

""We are deploying a range of assets, personnel, and equipment appropriate to maximize coverage of the Rio Grande River,"" Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth said in a Tuesday statement to Fox News Digital. ""Due to operational security concerns, we cannot provide specific details about deployment numbers or specific locations."" 

However, the Coast Guard announced in March it was beefing up its operational presence along the southwest border for border security operations. Between January and March, the Coast Guard Southwest District announced it tripled its forces there. 

The Pentagon said in July that roughly 8,500 troops are assigned to Joint Task Force Southern Border to provide backup to the Coast Guard and Border Patrol, and have been tasked with responding to security threats along the border.

The Coast Guard has launched several high-profile operations in recent months. For example, the service kicked off Operation Pacific Viper in August — a joint effort between the Coast Guard and Navy aimed at countering the influx of illegal drugs to the U.S. as part of Trump's larger effort to crack down on drug cartels.

So far, the Coast Guard has confiscated 100,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean since August, averaging 1,600 pounds of cocaine daily, according to the service.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin discusses the state's upcoming gubernatorial race, responds to the violent texts tied to Democratic AG candidate Jay Jones, and more on ‘The Sunday Briefing.'

President Donald Trump praised Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears this week after Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger mocked the Republican over her non-endorsement with a SpongeBob SquarePants reference.

Trump was asked about Earle-Sears on Air Force One and praised her debate performance while appearing to criticize Spanberger's refusal to explicitly call for scandal-plagued attorney general candidate Jay Jones to drop out after his texts envisioning the murder of a former House Republican leader.

""I think the Republican candidate is very good and she should win because the Democrat candidate is a disaster,"" he said.

""I haven't been too much involved in Virginia -- I love the state; I did very well in the state but I will tell you I think the republican candidate is excellent and the Democrat candidate is a disaster,"" he said.

He warned that both Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. – the Democratic nominee in the Garden State – will preeminently be bad for the current U.S. energy dominance agenda.

Trump, however, again appeared to stop short of issuing an endorsement in the style he usually does – which includes effusive praise and ""total endorsement"" on Truth Social.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the White House for clarity on whether the AF1 comments constituted an endorsement.

Former President Barack Obama was clearer in his commendation of Spanberger, whom he formally endorsed last week.

A Spanberger campaign spokesperson also confirmed the two will rally in Virginia in the coming days. The site will reportedly be in Hampton Roads.

Obama released a video calling Virginia's elections ""some of the most important in the country this year.""

""I am proud to endorse Abigail Spanberger for governor. Republican policies are raising costs on working families so billionaires can get massive tax cuts,"" Obama said, echoing congressional Democrats.

Asked about Trump and Obama, the Earle-Sears campaign said the video endorsement shows Spanberger is ""scared – and it shows.""

""After losing support across Virginia, she's leaning on liberal elites to try and save her collapsing campaign,"" press secretary Peyton Vogel told Fox News Digital.

""This is a desperate play from a candidate who's run out of support, out of ideas, and out of time. Voters see through it, and that's why Winsome Earle-Sears is surging.""

Spanberger got another boost Tuesday from PBS' ""Bill Nye the Science Guy,"" who condemned Trump in a raucous speech over the weekend and will rally with the Virginia Democrat in Charlottesville.

When asked about Nye's resurgence on behalf of Democrats, a White House spokesperson quipped, ""You mean, ‘Bill Nye the Liberal Activist Guy'?""

They called us racists for telling the truth. Turns out, the truth aged just fine.

When we launched Defending Education in March 2021, it wasn't because we wanted a fight. It was because we could see public education turning into a playground for activists and ideologues who wanted to tinker with children's minds and treat them differently based on their immutable traits.

Flush with COVID cash, districts invited even more race hustlers into schools to train staff and students to “dismantle whiteness” and become “antiracist.” Step one on the path to antiracism? Discriminate on the basis of race, of course.

One of the earliest and most egregious catalysts for the creation of Defending Education warning signs came from Evanston/Skokie School District 65, just outside Chicago. In October 2020, Superintendent Devon Horton announced that he would give “students from marginalized groups first priority for seats for in-person learning” and all others would be taught remotely. He said that “we have to make sure students who have been oppressed will be given the first opportunities,” and this is “about equity for Black and brown students, for special education students, for our LGBTQ students.”

DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD SUES FIRM FOR ‘FAILING TO PROPERLY VET' DETAINED SUPERINTENDENT

Under this plan, the most accelerated students could return if they checked the right demographic boxes. Struggling students who happened to be white, Asian, or heterosexual would stay home. It was unlawful, negligent, and blatantly discriminatory — not to mention categorically insane. 

And we said so, loudly.

Our objections were met with the usual slurs: racist, white supremacist, bigot. It was an ironic line of attack on our founder, Nicki Neily, whose paternal grandparents met in a Japanese internment camp. But the name-calling never mattered. The truth and the law did.

Now, fast forward to 2025. Devon Horton has been indicted on 17 federal charges, including wire fraud, embezzlement, and tax fraud. Prosecutors allege he and three associates took kickbacks from companies they secretly owned that landed contracts with District 65 and Chicago Public Schools. The same man who moralized about “oppression” and “equity” was allegedly running a corruption scheme that defrauded taxpayers.

And he's not alone. In Des Moines, another self-styled “equity champion,” Superintendent Ian Roberts, just resigned in disgrace. Roberts lied on his I-9, falsified his résumé, registered to vote illegally in Maryland, and was detained by ICE on an active deportation order after abandoning his district-issued car with a loaded handgun and $3,000 in cash.

The all-female school board has admitted it knew Roberts had lied on his résumé before hiring him, but alas, he was just too captivating for them to care. Now, he's gone, leaving behind a humiliated district in the national spotlight and a community demanding answers.

Horton and Roberts both weaponized race to silence dissent and used “equity” as a shield for their own corruption. Meanwhile, the people who hired them clapped along like brainless seals because that's what a good “ally” does. 

Horton's indictment is the ending many of us expected. School officials who proudly promote racial discrimination in hiring and school reopening are morally compromised. Their falls from grace are inevitable.

EX-IOWA SUPERINTENDENT FEDERALLY CHARGED AFTER ICE ARREST

It's the same grift that made Black Lives Matter founders millionaires while cities burned and police were vilified. It's the same cottage industry of “diversity consultants” and “equity officers” raking in public dollars to divide students by race, lecture parents about privilege, and shame teachers for their “whiteness.” 

These aren't isolated scandals. They're part of a well-documented pattern, and it's a certainty that more dominoes will fall. For those who stood up against identity-based discrimination in K-12 schools from the beginning, this moment is vindication. And for the countless moral cowards, it's a warning: When you let ideology run your schools, corruption stops being a bug in the system. It becomes the system.

Venezuela‘s regime is coming under increasing pressure from the Trump administration for using the cartels it controls to smuggle drugs into the United States. Last week, President Donald Trump said he had authorized covert CIA actions inside the South American country, a significant escalation.

But Caracas's transgressions extend to other areas. It has also long backed efforts to sow political division on U.S. streets. First, it supported Black Lives Matter and its founders. Now, it's antifa.

THE FRIENDS OF ZOHRAN MAMDANI

Indeed, you can tell a lot about which domestic anti-U.S. groups are rising by the support they get from our enemies overseas, especially Venezuela, but also Iran, Cuba, and China. That Venezuela is diversifying into “anti-fascism” is yet another sign of how diminished BLM has become.

Before its precipitous downfall, BLM changed this country deeply, and for the worse. Its massive and costly riots led to a wave of deep societal changes that threatened to make race the deciding factor in everything from hiring, job promotion, contracts, and university admissions. Diversity, equity, and inclusion workshops became mandatory, and freedom of expression came under threat.

That tide is finally turning now as the people fought back against these draconian measures. But for a few years, the heads of all our main cultural institutions, from universities to media, to libraries, to even the Smithsonian, accepted the BLM canard that America was systemically racist and needed a top-to-bottom overhaul.

Venezuela played more than a supportive role in this attempt. Last week, I spoke with a former senior Venezuelan official who was very close to the dead dictator Hugo Chavez and who has now defected. He told me he was in the room in late 2012 when Chavez gave Opal Tometi — who the following year helped to found BLM — suitcases stuffed with dollars.

“Chavez ordered his people to hand the suitcases to them, suitcases filled with dollars, at least $20 million,” the defector told me, adding that Tometi was accompanied by three other African American women and the actor Danny Glover, a huge supporter of the Marxist regimes in Venezuela and Cuba. “Chavez told them that the money was to project the Bolivarian revolutionary project on U.S. streets,” he said, using Chavez's term for Venezuelan Marxism.

The defector, who is cooperating with and providing evidence to the U.S. government on other subjects, particularly the close connection between the Cartel de los Soles narco group and the Venezuelan state, spoke with great specificity. “I see them all very clearly. The meeting took place at the Miraflores presidential palace, in a huge suite called the Japanese suite, where private meetings are held.”

This isn't hard to believe. It was Chavez himself who, after all, called in 2006 for the creation of a leftist network inside the U.S. that would act as a fifth column to thwart U.S. policy. That network came into being as the United States Social Forum. Launched in 2007, it quickly became an incubator for the founders of BLM to network.

Chavez made this call at the immense 2006 gathering in Caracas of the World Social Forum, a global meeting of Marxists that had been taking place annually in different Third World capitals for several years.

 “I think that, finally, distinct movements are rising in the U.S., movements that each day has gained more power, more conscience, and more unity,” Chavez said as he urged Americans to take up the revolutionary cudgel. “Viva the people of the U.S.!” he shouted to a crowd of some 15,000, which included Cuba's then-foreign minister, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada.

“We count on you, compañeros!” Chavez said, using the Cuban Revolution's term for comrade to address Americans. “Essential to this formula to save the world are the people of the U.S., the conscience of the U.S. people, the resurrection of the U.S. people. United with the people of the Caribbean, the people of Latin America, the people of Asia, Africa, and Europe. All of us must unite; join together in a victorious offensive against the empire.”

Within months of this speech, the inaugural meeting of the United States Social Forum was held in Atlanta in 2007. Alicia Garza, another one of the main three founders of BLM, was not just there but also on the organizing committee.

Garza, who was just 26 and had recently joined a sort of Marxist preparatory school called People Organized to Win Employment Rights, cut her teeth at that inaugural USSF.

“It was one of my first trips with POWER, and I was eager to prove myself by playing a role in helping to coordinate our delegation of about thirty members, along with the staff,” Garza wrote in her 2020 book The Purpose of Power. “I was becoming politicized in this organization.”

The USSF was, she wrote, “a major gathering of social justice activists” that taught her “a lot about how to build relationships with people with different backgrounds and agendas,” skills which, she added, helped her during the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 following the death of Michael Brown.

The organization that Patrisse Cullors, the third BLM founder, belonged to — the Labor and Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles, another Marxist prep — was also on the planning committee of the first USSF. It is therefore highly likely she was also in attendance in Atlanta. She attended a subsequent meeting in Detroit in 2010 and spoke there.

There is at least one mention in a 2022 academic paper that Tometi was also at the Atlanta gathering in 2007. But we know she attended World Social Forum gatherings.

All this networking, at Chavez's behest, happened years before BLM was founded in 2013 and helped create momentum for it. Garza pretty much revealed that the USSF was created at the request of America's enemies overseas at a speech she gave in Oakland in 2010.

She said foreign Marxists had said at the WSF, “‘What are you doing? Take your foot off my neck, right? I need you to go home and talk to your comrades, and your compañeros, right? And talk about and figure out what you're gonna do to take your foot off our neck',” Garza can be seen saying in this video. “That's where the U.S. Social Forum came from.”

So the mayhem we had on our streets, and all the stress it brought, was carried out by people who networked and carried out street organizing to help Marxist dictators in Caracas, at the very least, and may have received outright financial backing from them. Revolutionary Venezuela continued its relationship after BLM's founding by, for example, inviting representatives to gatherings of the Foro de Sao Paulo, the Hemispheric Marxist network Venezuela promoted.

And BLM, after its creation, was in return unstinting in its support for Venezuela's illegal regime.

In 2015, Tometi brought Nicolas Maduro, who took over as president when Chavez died in 2012, to speak in Harlem at an event that Glover also attended. Tometi was an election observer in Venezuela that same year, writing a manifesto on behalf of BLM supporting the Bolivarian revolution.

The BLM leaders frittered away all their money and any respectability they might have had, and are left now with rival groups bickering over who owns whatever money is left.

So maybe that explains why Maduro is now busy turning his attention to international anti-fascist events and antifa groups. They may lack the tight structure BLM once had and the political and societal clout, but antifa makes up for it with raw violence and actions to sow pure chaos.

At least five times in the past year, Maduro has hosted “anti-fascist” rallies, conferences, or festivals. It started in September 2024 with a World Congress against Fascism and Neo-Fascism, which, in reality, became a gabfest to denounce U.S. policies.

That conference was followed two months later by Venezuela's launch of the “World Antifascist Network.”

Then, on January 9 to 11 this year, to coincide with Maduro's inauguration after actually losing elections last year, Caracas hosted an International Anti-Fascist Festival, which organizers said had over 2,000 attendees from 125 countries.

At the most recent one, last January, the Party for Socialism and Liberation was an attendee from the U.S. The U.K. Revolutionary Communist Group, another antifa group, also sent Sam McGill to four of the Venezuelan anti-fascist events.

And Code Pink, another antifa adjacent group, which has to boot connections to the Chinese Communist Party, has also sent members to visit Caracas and Havana.

The PSL is a Marxist-Leninist party that will turn out for any rally, demonstration, or riot, as long as it is anti-U.S. in nature.

NO KINGS IS THE SEINFELD OF PROTESTS

The PSL has supported BLM in the past. But with BLM falling into inactivity, PSL is more what the New York Post describes as an “Antifa satellite org.” The “Trantifa” leader of Armed Queers Salt Lake City, reportedly being investigated in the Charlie Kirk assassination, Ermiya Fanaeian, opened a PSL chapter in Utah. Fanaeian visited Cuba earlier this year to receive ideological training. The AQSLC has trained with the John Brown Gun Club, a straight-up antifa group.

Our enemies want to use us in a weakened state, whether because we're hooked on narcotics or because of political mayhem in our streets. In October 2019, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, presented a battle plan for hemispheric destabilization, calling it a “Bolivarian hurricane.” If we are serious about stopping political violence, it would be useful to look at the foreign connections.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","John Sununu announces bid for New Hampshire Senate seat","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3859381/john-sununu-announces-bid-new-hampshire-senate-seat/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:03:36 GMT","

Former GOP Sen. John Sununu has entered the race to reclaim New Hampshire‘s Senate seat after he was ousted by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in 2008.

“Washington's never been perfect. It's not meant to be,” Sununu said in his campaign launch video. “When I was there, people with different opinions could get together, work things out, and come to solutions that made a real difference. But now, Congress just seems loud, dysfunctional, even angry. But Granite Staters still talk. We don't always agree, but we respect one another and work together for the common good. That's the New Hampshire way.”

Sununu has been in Republicans' sights as a top recruit for the seat. His brother, former Gov. Chris Sununu, rejected calls to jump into the race. Both brothers have been critical of President Donald Trump, with the former governor being a vocal supporter of former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley during her primary bid against the president. He is expected to meet with Trump soon over an endorsement, according to Politico.

Sununu framed his campaign as one that would “lower the temperature” of politics.

“Maybe you're surprised to hear that I'm running for the Senate again,” Sununu added. “I'm a bit surprised myself. Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.” 

He promised to protect Medicare, “tackle healthcare costs,” and never to vote to cut benefits for seniors on Social Security.

A government watchdog warned in July that Social Security benefits will be cut by 24% by late 2032, which would equal an $18,100 annual benefit cut for a dual-earning, middle-class couple that retires at the start of 2033, unless reforms are put into place. 

Healthcare costs and benefits have been a hot topic in Washington, D.C., during the government shutdown. Democrats are refusing to vote in favor of funding the government unless Republicans come to the table to negotiate extending Obamacare premiums, which are set to expire this year.

Sununu is seen as a front-runner, given his access to his family's wealth to support his bid and his strong connections with party leadership, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD). His father also served as governor of New Hampshire and then worked as chief of staff for President George H.W. Bush.

LIST: THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE WHO HAVE SAID THEY WON'T SEEK REELECTION

The former senator will face off against fellow Republican former Sen. Scott Brown, who served in Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013. State Sen. Dan Innis, who was also running for the seat, already dropped his bid and endorsed Sununu.

For the Democrats, Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH) is running. Polling from September shows Sununu more competitive against Pappas than Brown.

“If Sununu runs, Chris Pappas will be in for the fight of his political career,” the memo from 1892 Polling read. 

Republican National Committee regional communications director Kristen Cianci said, “New Hampshire voters are witnessing a formidable Republican field poised to make this seat competitive in 2026. This, combined with Chris Pappas's weak candidacy and far-left history, should have everyone taking a second look at this race.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

“These cartels are the al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,” War Secretary Pete Hegseth said of the organizations accused of controlling the boats being targeted by U.S. strikes.

President Donald Trump and his administration informed Congress last month that the United States is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels that are smuggling narcotics into the country, using it as justification for the strike campaign that began last month.

Since the strikes began, U.S. forces have killed more than two dozen people but have not shown evidence to prove there were drugs aboard the targeted vessels. The two survivors of a recent strike last week raised questions the administration hadn't yet faced, mainly what they would do with them.

Trump announced the two would be repatriated to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia. Ecuador has decided not to pursue charges against one of the survivors.

“Can you imagine an administration that, having engaged in kinetic action against al Qaeda terrorists and captured some of them alive, would suddenly let them go?” Christopher Hernandez-Roy, the deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Washington Examiner.

He speculated that the decision to repatriate them instead of going through the court system could mean the administration is anticipating it “might be on shaky legal ground” about the justification for “basically kinetic action with no forewarning.”

In previous armed conflicts, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. troops would take enemy fighters prisoner if the situation arose, while historically, drug smugglers who were caught in Central America prior to this campaign would be detained by U.S. law enforcement and often charged.

“We've been told that these attacks have been directed against people that the administration is absolutely certain are what they call unlawful combatants,” professor Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University, told the Washington Examiner. “Well, if they were so certain about that, then why would you let these people go?”

“Normally, if you're engaged in a conflict and you capture enemy combatants, you detain them,” he added. “But of course, if you detain them, the question then becomes where you're going to bring them, to Guantanamo? I guess theoretically, you could bring them to Guantanamo and subject them to the same detention rationale and review proceeding that you've used for the al Qaeda and Taliban fighters there. But that means that ultimately, the individuals are going to be able to contest the designation.”

The administration has not provided any evidence to prove that these vessels were carrying drugs.

The military has surged personnel and capabilities into the region over the last couple of months as a part of the administration's broader effort to cut down on drug smuggling, while Trump told the Washington Examiner last month that his administration is going to “look very seriously at cartels coming by land.”

Trump announced last week that he authorized the CIA to conduct clandestine operations within Venezuela to undermine Nicolas Maduro's regime. In the U.S., Maduro is indicted on narcoterrorism and drug-trafficking charges, and he's been labeled the head of the Cartel of the Suns.

The administration doubled its reward for information leading to his arrest from $25 million to $50 million. At the same time, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that in August, the U.S. had seized up to $700 million of assets allegedly linked to him.

There has been little public congressional oversight while lawmakers seek additional information from the administration.

TRUMP VOWS TO STOP VENEZUELAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS BY LAND

“There really is pretty widespread bipartisan skepticism [and] concern about the operation thus far. I think the reasons for the skepticism differ on a party line,”  a Senate aide told the Washington Examiner. “I think that has really just become more and more clear, it's about regime change in Venezuela and applying maximum pressure on the regime there.”

Trump is also taking further action against Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he called an “illegal drug leader” on Sunday, by cutting U.S. subsidies to the South American country. Petro accused the U.S. of killing an innocent Colombian fisherman in a strike last month.

Hegseth announced over the weekend that the U.S. killed three people last Friday on a vessel that he said had ties to a Colombian terrorist organization, Ejército de Liberación Nacional, or National Liberation Army.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Colombian President Gustavo Petro suggested that Tuesday's acquittal of the country's former president, Alvaro Uribe, could lead to sanctions from the United States, given the Trump administration‘s support for the right-wing leader.

Alvaro had been found guilty in July of bribing a paramilitary witness to lie about alleged links to him, but a Colombian appeals court overturned that conviction.

Petro decried the latest ruling on social media, accusing Uribe of being aligned with Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups.

“This is how the history of paramilitary governance in Colombia is covered up — that is, the history of the politicians who came to power in alliance with drug trafficking and unleashed genocide in Colombia,” the left-wing president said on X, seemingly referencing the systematic extermination of the Patriotic Union party by drug cartels, paramilitary groups, and state agents in the 1980s and 1990s.

“Now Trump, allied with these politicians and with Uribe, will seek to sanction the president who denounced, throughout his life, the alliances between Colombian political power and paramilitary drug trafficking in Colombia,” Petro added, “and he does so with the help of those who helped paramilitarism in the country.”

In recent days, tensions between the U.S. and Colombia have escalated as the U.S. military continues to strike Venezuelan and Colombian vessels that President Donald Trump alleges are carrying drugs.

The Trump administration says the people aboard these vessels are narcoterrorists and drug traffickers, whereas Petro argues some of them are ordinary civilians. He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. for allegedly murdering a Colombian fisherman in one of its Caribbean strikes last month.

At least 32 people have been killed in these strikes since early September.

In a separate post, Petro said the victims were “all poor people” and that with Trump's threat of using military force in Colombia and Venezuela over drug trafficking, a path will be paved for the U.S. to “bring personal sanctions against me, as if I were the head of drug trafficking in the world.”

Over the weekend, Trump announced the U.S. cut subsidies to Colombia and threatened to strike drug production fields within the South American nation if Petro doesn't shut them down immediately. Trump also teased a higher tariff on Colombia, which already pays a 10% baseline tariff.

Before that, Trump announced the CIA was recently authorized to conduct clandestine operations within Venezuela to undermine President Nicolas Maduro's government. Maduro faces federal charges in the U.S. related to his alleged narcoterrorism and drug-trafficking ties.

In an interview with Univision on Monday, Petro suggested Trump should be overthrown because of his threats against Colombia's sovereignty. After his comments sparked backlash from Latino Republicans in Congress, he rushed to defend himself.

“I didn't threaten Trump,” the Colombian president wrote on X. “I just said that Trump should change his heart from defending death-dealing policies around the world, like the genocide in Palestine, to life-dealing policies. If that change doesn't happen, then the American people themselves will change Trump, because we can't commit suicide.”

Following Uribe's acquittal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated the news.

LATINO GOP CONDEMNS COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT'S THREATS TO ‘OVERTHROW' TRUMP

“Colombia's justice has prevailed as former President Uribe is absolved after years of the political witch hunt against him and his family,” Rubio said in a statement.

The Trump administration has remained an informal ally of Uribe, the country's president between 2002 and 2010, before Trump arrived in office. Rubio has been particularly vocal against Uribe's prior conviction, which he once condemned as “the weaponization of Colombia's judicial branch.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Brightline has been hailed as the future of high-speed rail in the United States, but it has one big, unignorable problem.

The Brightline is a beautiful train. Ultra-quiet and decorated with streaks of highlighter yellow, it carries passengers between Miami and Orlando, sometimes moving as fast as 125 miles per hour. It restores glamour to the humble railroad: During your ride, if you wish, you can order a half bottle of Veuve Clicquot for $59; the on-board bathrooms are large and clean enough to take a decent mirror selfie in. Condé Nast Traveler has called it “super chic.”

Privately owned and operated and transporting about 250,000 passengers a month, the Brightline is only the second high-speed train in the United States and the first outside the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak operates the Acela. Its newness and sleekness make it a novelty in a country where trains are mostly old and ugly. Its existence shows that America can still build great things and that private industry can build them quickly and with style. If a beautiful high-speed train can work in Florida—whose former governor famously rejected more than $2 billion in federal funding for such a train—maybe it can work anywhere. But right now, something is very wrong.

What the Brightline is best known for is not that it reflects the gleam of the future but the fact that it keeps hitting people. According to Federal Railroad Administration data, the Brightline has been involved in at least 185 fatalities, 148 of which were believed not to be suicides, since it began operating, in December 2017. Last year, the train hit and killed 41 people—none of whom, as best as authorities could determine, was attempting to harm themselves. By comparison, the Long Island Rail Road, the busiest commuter line in the country, hit and killed six people last year while running 947 trains a day. Brightline was running 32.

In January 2023, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the Brightline's accident rate per million miles operated from 2018 to 2021 was more than double that of the next-highest—43.8 for the Brightline and 18.4 for the Metra commuter train in Chicago. This summer, the Miami Herald and a Florida NPR station published an investigation showing that someone is killed by the train, on average, once every 13 days.

Floridians have started calling it the “Death Train” and maintain a sense of gallows humor about it, saying that it must be “fed” regularly to keep hurricanes away. Train attendants told me that Brightline engineers and conductors sometimes darkly joke about earning a “golden ticket”—which is when the train hits someone at the right time so that the three paid days off a worker gets for emotional distress are rolled into a weekend that takes up most of the week.

Brightline argues that the “Death Train” moniker is unfair for many reasons. One is the notorious difficulty of determining whether a death on a train track was a suicide. The company says the true rate of suicides on its Florida route is higher than government agencies report because of the variability in how local law-enforcement agencies and medical examiners make their determinations. Although Brightline no longer insists, as it has in the past, that the majority of the deaths are the result of suicides or drugs, it still takes care to frame the issue as a matter of personal responsibility. None of the deaths on Brightline tracks has been the result of equipment failure or operator error, Ashley Blasewitz, Brightline's director of media relations, wrote to me in an email. “All have been the result of illegal, deliberate and oftentimes reckless behavior by people putting themselves in harm's way.”

Federal agencies have investigated the Brightline incidents and produced no firm conclusions about why they have happened so often. The company, sometimes called “Frightline” on the local news, has not been found responsible for any of the deaths. How could it be responsible for people driving around lowered gates or walking into the clearly delineated path of a train? Yet there must be some explanation for the unusual number of fatalities.

Brightline's parent company aspires to create additional train routes all over the country. It has been embraced by pro-transit wonks and former President Joe Biden's train-nerd transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, as well as by tech-world influencers and members of the Trump administration. In a February press release announcing that it would investigate a federally funded California high-speed-rail project that has become a decade-plus boondoggle, Donald Trump's Department of Transportation praised Brightline by comparison, citing its “impressive work” on Brightline West, the company's second route. Still under construction, Brightline West will connect Las Vegas to the Los Angeles suburbs with a train that can go up to 200 miles per hour.

If Brightline really is the future of rail in the United States, the most important question is obvious: Why are so many people dying?

A popular theory of the Brightline deaths, which you'll see in comments underneath viral videos of the train plowing into cars, is that there is something wrong with people who live in Florida. Specifically, these comments invoke the concept of the “Florida Man”—a long-standing meme that suggests the state is, in essence, full of morons.

Jim Kovalsky, the president of a nonprofit called the Florida East Coast Railway Society, appeared exasperated in a local-TV interview last year. “If you don't put yourself between those two steel rails, you're not going to get hit by a train,” he said. When I spoke with him earlier this year, he was even more direct. “I think the concept of Florida Man is real,” he said. “Unfortunately, we are dealing with a lot of people that don't understand self-preservation.”

But if the people of Florida were uniquely stupid in a way that made them more susceptible to being hit by trains, you would expect them to be hit uncommonly often by all trains. This is not the case. Amtrak serves fewer passengers than Brightline, but operates through many of the same urban areas as well as some additional ones, and it reported six total fatalities in the state in 2024, compared with Brightline's 41. The NTSB's 2023 report found that Brightline's accident rate per million miles was more than eight times that of SunRail, another commuter train that operates around Orlando. Brightline has challenged the usefulness of this statistic, noting that it doesn't account for the amount of daily traffic around and on the tracks, but that is sort of the point.

The Brightline runs on the route of the original Florida East Coast Railway, which was built in the late 1800s by Henry Flagler, a Standard Oil tycoon. Flagler is popularly credited with “inventing” modern Florida: His railroad allowed for the development of swampland into a series of luxury resorts dotting the coast. Everything grew up around this track—it's the vein running through all of the oldest cities and most densely populated areas of South Florida.Passenger trains stopped running on this line in the late 1960s, leaving it to slower freight trains that ran less frequently. When Brightline's parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, was taken over by the private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group, it built a second track so that passenger trains and freight trains could efficiently share the space. (Then it sold the freight rights to a Mexican conglomerate for $2.1 billion.) Since 2017, far more trains than ever before have run through these areas, and faster, in both directions at the same time.

As a result, once-familiar environments have been transformed. Take, for example, the story of Joann DePina, a 49-year-old mother of two who was killed by a Brightline train in January. DePina was walking over the tracks that cut through her neighborhood, but she was doing so on a well-worn footpath. She was technically trespassing, but there weren't any fences or no trespassing signs, and it was a logical thing to do. DePina rented a room in a sober-living house on one side of the tracks and was crossing to get to a group meeting on the other side. She had been in recovery since 2017 and was saving money to move into her own apartment.

I walked along the tracks with her aunt Maria Furtado in May. Furtado showed me the footpath, next to the white cross she'd put up in her niece's memory. In person, it was clear why people would walk there: The tracks split the neighborhood in half, with tightly packed houses on one side and a row of businesses on the other. To get around the tracks legally would require walking down to an intersection to cross, then walking back, adding at least 10 minutes. Taking a shortcut over the tracks looks easy enough, and it was probably easy to do so safely during the decades when freight trains were the only traffic. Hence the worn path.

“I worry about these people all the time,” Furtado told me, gesturing at a house whose yard ended less than 50 feet from the tracks. On a previous visit, she'd seen a young boy chasing after a cat as it walked on the tracks. As we talked, Furtado pointed behind me. I turned around and saw a Brightline train coming toward us—only a few seconds away, at most. The train whipped past—it's powered by quiet diesel-electric locomotives and goes 79 miles per hour through that part of its route. It was easy to put myself in DePina's place. She was walking at night, and she didn't hear or see anything coming. Her timing was horrible.

After DePina's death, Furtado attempted to contact Brightline but never heard back. She also contacted Governor Ron DeSantis, who forwarded her letter to the Florida Department of Transportation, which gave her a polite but vague response about its commitment to safety. (During the course of my conversations with Brightline about its record, Blasewitz provided a list of safety improvements that had been made to the tracks both before and after the train started operating, which cost nearly $500 million. “Brightline is one of the safest forms of transportation in the state of Florida, moving millions of people out of their cars and off dangerous roadways,” she wrote by email.)

Furtado told me she wasn't sure what other options were left to her. “I don't know who to blame,” she said. In her opinion, someone should have to put up a fence along parts of the tracks that cut through neighborhoods—whether that's the city or the state or Brightline, she doesn't much care. Being from Massachusetts and having some familiarity with northern commuter trains, she also liked the idea of the tracks being elevated, even a little bit, to deter people from walking over them. “She wasn't going to hike a mountain or climb over a fence to get across,” she said of her niece.

DePina's story is elucidating, but it's only one incident. The NTSB has been conducting a series of investigations into Brightline accidents to search for patterns and will eventually publish a summary analysis of those findings. But so far, only a handful of reports have been published, and they offer few clear takeaways.

For instance, last year, investigators looked into a pair of fatal accidents that had happened two days apart at the same intersection in Melbourne, Florida, a small, coastal city 70 miles southeast of Orlando. Both involved drivers going around safety gates. The details of the first crash were especially odd. The crossing's gates and all of its other safety devices had been working perfectly. Neither the engineer nor the conductor of the train had done anything wrong, while the driver of the car did at least two obvious things wrong. The first was that he had driven around a stopped car and then the lowered gate even as a woman in the back seat of his car yelled at him not to. The second, a toxicology report showed, was that he had been on bath salts.

On the one hand, the issue here was obvious: Florida Man. On the other, the NTSB's report contains information that suggests a dangerous environment, regardless of one's drug intake. It noted that Brightline service had dramatically increased train traffic through Melbourne in recent years. The double-tracking of the line at this location had been completed in June 2023; previously, 14 freight trains passed through each day, and now there were 14 freight trains plus 32 higher-speed passenger trains. Before the two back-to-back Brightline incidents, there had been only three crashes since 1975.

As part of that investigation, NTSB staffers rode the Brightline one Sunday from Orlando to West Palm Beach and back. They found all crossing gates and warning lights to be functioning perfectly and the train crews to be professional and alert. Yet the train they rode had to make an emergency stop to avoid hitting a pedestrian in Melbourne. Then it nearly hit a bicyclist, also in Melbourne. “While talking with the engineer,” the investigators noted in their write-up, “he stated that he had been involved in seven incidents while working for Brightline involving striking trespassers or vehicle strikes.”

Many train tracks are elevated to cross above roadways. Others are sunken down to cross beneath them. But the Brightline's track intersects flatly, or “at grade,” with the roads on much of its route, including the part that runs through central Miami.

Many states have undertaken grade-crossing-elimination projects over the past half century because they make train routes dramatically safer. On the Amtrak route between Washington, D.C., and New York City, the highest-trafficked stretch of train track in the country, there are no grade crossings. The last one was eliminated in the 1980s.

There are 331 grade crossings along the Brightline route in South Florida. James Perkins, a former Brightline conductor, cited this when explaining to me why he no longer works for the company. He mostly enjoyed his time at Brightline, he said—the company was a good employer—but he didn't want to work on that route anymore in large part because of how often the train would hit people. At his previous job operating a freight train in the 200-mile stretch between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, he said there were 40 to 50 grade crossings. In the 65 miles between West Palm Beach and Miami, there are 174. “It's just real busy,” he told me. “The fatalities—this was just something I didn't want to continue doing.”

When I visited the West Palm Beach area to look at the crossings and roads in person, I drove over the tracks dozens of times. They cut through the landscape at strange angles and in unexpected places—behind the downtown courthouse, alongside a Little League field in Delray Beach. People have been struck and killed by Brightline trains at both of these locations.

During my trip, I met with Eric Dumbaugh, a professor of urban and regional planning at Florida Atlantic University who has lived in the area for most of his life. “Brightline is unique nationally,” he said. “It's operating right through the urban fabric.” Just by leaving their houses, people encounter it, whether they want to or not, and they sometimes have to react quickly, in a life-and-death situation, to a system they don't intuitively understand. “This is why we see the issues that we have,” he said.

To visualize this, we drove to a grade crossing in Delray Beach, where an elderly couple had been hit and killed by a Brightline train in 2023. The NTSB investigated this accident, perhaps because it was so confounding. The couple had been driving down a road adjacent to the tracks just after 8 p.m. It was winter, so it was dark. The husband was behind the wheel—he had a green light, so he turned right, at which point there was only a short bit of roadway before the couple found themselves on top of the southbound track. They either didn't register or didn't have time to react to the gate's warning lights and bells. Their timing, like Joann DePina's, was horrible, and the gates came down while the car was in the crossing.

The couple apparently watched, unpanicked, as a northbound freight train approached from one direction. A witness told the NTSB that she saw the wife get out of the car, look around, then go over to the driver's-side window to say something to her husband before getting back in the car. The woman had seemed calm. The best guess that Dumbaugh came to—the same as the NTSB's—was that the wife had examined the car's position and seen that it was clear of the track on which the freight train was approaching. She couldn't see a train coming on the other track, from the other direction. The couple must have decided to wait for the freight train to pass. They turned off the engine of their car, as well as their headlights.

Just as the freight train passed, the Brightline came on the other track. It hit the front of the car and sent it spinning off the road, flipping onto its side. The wife was thrown out of the vehicle, while the husband was stuck inside. Both were dead at the scene. The witness pulled her own car onto the grass and sat for 10 or 15 minutes, shaking, she told the NTSB. She hadn't seen the Brightline coming either.

Dumbaugh explored the intersection, pointing at various elements. Signage on the adjacent road made it clear that a train passes nearby, but didn't tell drivers to be wary of turning into its path. “There was nothing on the approach that warned people a right turn would be an issue,” he said. From the NTSB report, we knew that the freight train had radioed the Brightline once it saw the car on the tracks and that the Brightline engineer had implemented the train's emergency brakes, but there hadn't been nearly enough time to stop. Again, it was a story without one easily identified insight. The Federal Railroad Administration regulates the operation of the gate. The road the couple had turned off was a state highway. The intersecting street was the responsibility of the city, but the traffic signals were the responsibility of the county.

Brightline says that it is an advocate for closing certain crossings on its route, but that this rarely happens “without local support.” Because of all the elements at any intersection, the process of closing even one crossing can be convoluted and expensive. Sealing off the entire Brightline route or elevating the entire track would simply not be economically feasible for a private company. Still, over a period of months, I spoke with several experts who had different opinions on many of the technical details but who all agreed that there's no real mystery behind the Brightline deaths. “Fast trains and grade crossings are always a deadly combination,” the historian Richard White, whose 2011 book about American railroads was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, told me. He put it the most succinctly, but I did not talk with anybody who disagreed with that conclusion.

While I was in Florida, I hoped to hear directly from Brightline executives. The company was co-hosting a conference called the Railway Interior Innovation Summit, in Orlando. So, of course, I took a Brightline train to get there.

The train ride was unlike any I've taken in my life. The Brightline's passenger cars are softly lit with pretty blue LEDs along the ceiling, and the roomy seats are upholstered with soft white leather. There is ample legroom and nothing is broken. The elegant new stations have cocktail bars named Mary Mary, apparently in reference to Henry Flagler's first and third wives, who had the same first name. The stations also have gift shops, where you can buy attractive Brightline merchandise—pink ball caps, soft sweatshirts, a candle matching the custom scent that is piped into the terminals.

I bought a “Premium” (first-class) ticket from West Palm Beach for $99, which came with a steak sandwich on a brioche bun for dinner, a passion-fruit tartlet for dessert, a dark-chocolate Lindt truffle for a second dessert, and a glass of cuvée from the complimentary-drink menu. The Brightline is the first train line to offer basically flawless Wi-Fi provided by Elon Musk's Starlink, which is why I got to see Brett Baty put the Mets up over the Red Sox while hurtling up the coast at the end of a long day. The ride was smooth and quiet and we were exactly on time. We made it to Orlando without incident in two hours and 12 minutes—more than an hour faster than the typical Amtrak on this route, and much less stressful than driving a car.

This probably would not have seemed remarkable to the rail summit's many European attendees, whose countries already have high-functioning train systems. Many of these people were in the United States for the first time—meaning that their first experience of our wonderful and interesting country was three days in Orlando. At a networking event, I entered a cluster of conversation just as a Swiss man was explaining that American train stations are surrounded by “car parks,” which he found shocking, because most people in Switzerland ride their bikes to the train stations. (Switzerland is about half the size of Maine, by the way.)

A packed conference room listened to a panel on train start-ups, including one called Dreamstar Lines, which intends to begin operating a “hotel on rails”—a luxury overnight train between San Francisco and Los Angeles—before the 2028 Summer Olympics (in a mock-up, it had an on-board spa). Various companies showed concepts for spectacular and futuristic train cars, but Brightline was the center of attention. Its executives gave the most well-attended talks, got the biggest laughs. Everybody agreed that Brightline's trains were impressive and that its proposals were exciting.

On the third day of the summit, participants were led on a tour of Brightline's Orlando maintenance facility by Tom Rutkowski, the company's vice president and chief mechanical officer, a former general superintendent for New Jersey Transit, and a charming, brassy host. When we all boarded one of the trains to look around, Rutkowski encouraged us to sit down and feel the leather, which he said was the same that is used in Bentleys. “If you've never sat in a Bentley, this is as close as you're going to get,” he told us.

After the formal tour, the group was offered complimentary wraps for lunch in a meeting room. When I walked in, Rutkowski was sitting on top of a table, holding court in front of a small group of men who were standing around asking him friendly questions about Brightline's business. “We are poor,” he told them. “I'm lucky I can make payroll.” He said it not as if the company were desperate but as if it were scrappy. He added, “There's no government money coming to bail us out.” (Rutkowski later denied making these comments, and called them “nonsense.”)

Some additional context is needed here. The claim that there is no public money coming to or already in use by Brightline is not exactly true: The Florida line was built, in part, with $2.2 billion of tax-exempt bonds. If Brightline were, for some reason, to go bankrupt, it might behoove either Florida or the federal government to bail it out and take over operation of the line, rather than leaving everything to rust and the hundreds of thousands of people who use the train to go back to their cars. 

The bonds underlying Brightline have been downgraded multiple times this year because of slower-than-expected ridership growth and higher-than-expected costs. In July, the company announced its intention to defer $1.5 billion in interest payments, and NPR reported that Brightline had been looking for outside investors for months with little success. Blasewitz, the media-relations director, told me that Brightline is still confident in its year-over-year growth and that it intends to establish itself as an “integral” part of Florida's transportation system, though she declined to comment on when the company expects to become profitable.

In addition to the safety conversation, then, there is a conversation to be had about whether Brightline is even a private solution to a public problem at all. The new line in California, Brightline West, will be privately operated, but is being built with billions in federal grants. To the extent that I heard any muttering at the summit that was less than complimentary to Brightline, it was on this point.

At one summit event, I chatted briefly with Jim Mathews, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association, who thought the Brightline project was interesting and in some ways laudable. Still, he said that Brightline's Florida strategy was not repeatable. It had been a quirk of history that its parent company owned the right-of-way on those old railroad tracks, and it would not be in that situation again anywhere else in the country. Plus, Brightline lost more than $500 million in 2024 while serving only six stops, he pointed out. Amtrak, often regarded as an albatross around taxpayers' necks, lost more—about $705 million—but serves more than 500 stops, including many that a private enterprise would never bother with and that a public one is obligated to serve.

“The idea of scaling on a private level is just complete insanity,” Mathews told me when we talked again after the summit. “Brightline got 3 billion federal dollars to bring along Brightline West—which is great; I don't oppose that. The more the merrier—the more service we have, the better it is,” he said. “But let's not pretend this is the kind of capital investment that private industry can do by itself. They can't.”

If the most obvious question to ask about Brightline is Why are so many people dying on this one stretch of train track in Florida?, the second-most-obvious is Who can fix it? 

It seemed to me that the problem in Florida was being treated as unsolvable, as though this is somehow just the way it is. The Federal Railroad Administration, for instance, doesn't believe that Brightline is at fault for the frequent accidents. James Payne, the FRA's staff director of grade crossing and trespasser outreach, told me frankly that South Florida is a mess. “It keeps me up at night,” he said. But in his opinion, Brightline is doing about as much as it possibly can to improve grade crossings and encourage safety, given the constraints of its business and the existing infrastructure.

I talked with Jim Mathews about the situation at some length, hoping for clarity. Mathews didn't have a perfect explanation either. He thought Brightline had been arrogant and callous, but he also thought the real issue was bigger. Americans are okay with tens of billions of tax dollars funding highways and airports overseen by powerful regulatory agencies. But we don't want to spend the same way on trains, even though we want trains to be built. “We love private industry because it doesn't cost us money, but we point fingers at private industry when it kills people,” he said. “That's why we have governments—they protect people; they step in where markets fail.” Or they should.

Just after the Miami Herald's July story on Brightline deaths came out, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy remarked that there had been “way too many deaths” in Florida, and that something should be done. Shortly after that, federal grants worth more than $42 million, which were awarded to Brightline between 2022 and 2024 but had not been dispersed, were finally ushered along by Duffy. Those funds will be used to make some safety improvements, including fencing along parts of the Brightline's route and various interventions to deter people from driving around lowered gates. At the same time, the proposed 2026 Department of Transportation budget that was advanced by Congress over the summer includes no funding at all for the Federal Railroad Administration's Crossing Elimination Grant Program, which is the primary means by which local governments all over the country have funded grade-crossing-removal projects.

In May, when I rode a Brightline train out of Miami, looking through the window at a ludicrously flat landscape, I thought about the future. The train hurtled through towns that were arranged on either side, going so fast while so close to houses, restaurants, parks, and people that I was startled again each time I looked out the window. This is not what it will be like when people ride Brightline West. That train will go through the desert and run mostly within an existing highway median. It won't have the same pitfalls as this first experiment, for which people are dying and that's just the cost of something new. Later that evening, I scrolled on my phone and came across an Instagram post about another Brightline accident, with a caption describing the person who had reportedly been hit as a “track snack.” People in the comments responded jubilantly, praising the train for chowing down on another soul. The beast was getting stronger, the commenters said with satisfaction. “As always sorry if this was your family member,” the account runner wrote dutifully in the replies.

After the Hunt seems to reckon with cancel culture, before revealing where its true interest lies.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The following contains spoilers for After the Hunt.

After the Hunt, the latest film from the director Luca Guadagnino, seems designed to inspire debates about “cancel culture.” Set in 2019 amid the #MeToo movement, the movie follows a group of academics in Yale's philosophy department who are embroiled in a sexual-assault scandal. The characters are perfectly comfortable discussing morality. But as soon as they're made to confront their personal beliefs, philosophy becomes, as Guadagnino put it in an interview at the New York Film Festival, something of a “special effect”—the fuel that can turn any conversation incendiary.

The movie, now in theaters, hinges on a provocative event: Maggie (played by The Bear's Ayo Edebiri) accuses a popular professor, Hank (Andrew Garfield), of sexual assault. Hank's colleague, the enigmatic Alma (Julia Roberts), is subsequently caught between the two—the student who worships her, and one of her closest friends. The most daring scene, though, arrives right at the end: In a brief epilogue, Alma reunites with Maggie five years after the allegation dissolved their relationship. The women are disinterested in relitigating what happened. Instead, they insist upon their own happiness: Alma has recovered from the drama; she's now a dean at Yale. Maggie, too, is thriving—engaged, with a giant ring she shows off to her former mentor. After their conversation wraps, the camera lingers on Alma until Guadagnino, from somewhere off-screen, calls out, “Cut!”

The director's voice breaks the fourth wall with as much subtlety as a character waking up to say that everything was merely a dream. The moment is jarring, and implies that everything that happened on-screen until then shouldn't be taken too seriously. Some critics have interpreted the ending as a glib last-minute twist that threatens to neutralize the story's potency and dismisses the seriousness of the movie's premise. Among the other complaints: There seems to be no point, beyond pure button-pushing, to using a Woody Allen–style typeface in the opening credits, thereby referencing a real-life disgraced figure. The script is blanketed in sweeping claims found in online discourse about sex and gender, but it ultimately has little to say about cancel culture. Perhaps its message is meant to be deliberately ambiguous—or maybe there's no message at all.

Read: A #MeToo movie devoid of sensationalism

Yet Guadagnino's decision to insert himself into the movie's final beat is revealing, in that it clarifies more about After the Hunt than anything that precedes it. The scene illuminates the story's preoccupation not with the post-#MeToo world but with performance, hints of which can be found throughout the film. An early sequence finds Alma and Hank theatrically debating, before a collection of awed students, whether any of the philosophers they study led a wholly moral life. Inside Alma's home, her husband, Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg), acts the part of the dutiful spouse when guests come over, baking a tart for Alma's colleagues; alone, he falls asleep to porn. Alma visits the dean of humanities to talk about Maggie's accusation, but they don't discuss how the assault may have happened—or the fact that Maggie just attended Alma's boozy, intimate dinner party, which encouraged a fair amount of boundary-blurring. Instead, the dean worries about how the situation will come off to the rest of the academic community. “Against all odds,” he says, “I've found myself in the business of optics, not substance.”

Studied mannerisms inform every relationship in the film. The movie questions whether anyone is telling the truth: whether Maggie falsely accused Hank in order to deflect how she plagiarized her dissertation, whether Hank's pitiful self-deprecation is an act belying a disturbingly aggressive demeanor, and even whether Alma actually cares about her students. But truths go ignored, the film argues, when everyone prefers inventing realities for themselves. Consider the fantastical visual language Guadagnino deploys—he frequently captures characters via their reflections, including a moment in which Hank is positioned in front of a pair of intersecting mirrored walls; his gesticulating makes him look like a many-tentacled beast. Alma, who seems to almost always be hiding behind a mask, fades from her couch at one point via a bit of camera trickery, like she's a ghost.

After the Hunt, in other words, is not what it initially seems like it might be: a film that examines changing cultural mores. Rather, it's a cynical movie in which characters carefully position themselves for maximum validation. This need to be seen as morally good poisons them all—the more Alma stands up for Maggie in public while doubting her in private, the more Alma's health deteriorates. The more Frederik keeps up a facade of warmth in his marriage, the more he descends into cruelty. After the Hunt pointedly avoids showing the faculty's deliberations on Hank's firing—the titular hunt, if you will—in favor of examining how each of its characters, indifferent to what actually happened, insists on being perceived as correct.

Guadagnino, in interviews since the film's debut at the Venice Film Festival, in August, has waved off critiques that the film is hollow. He has resisted the notion that After the Hunt is a “movie about #MeToo,” calling the label “a bit of a lazy way to describe it.” And, he's noted, the choice to insert his own voice into the story's final seconds is nothing but a way to remind the audience that the film is, well, a film. “Once we say ‘Cut,' we invite the audience to think that this is a movie,” he said at the New York Film Festival. “We wanted to entertain them.”

After the Hunt does entertain. The production design impressively transforms a London soundstage into New Haven, the plot is fabulously convoluted, and Roberts is particularly compelling to watch, clearly relishing the opportunity to deliver a slippery performance. The film around her is equally slick, using as its backdrop a moment in recent history when people in power felt under the microscope. It never peers through that microscope itself, but in its final moment—“Cut!”—After the Hunt invites the viewer to do so instead.

The biggest lesson from the racist, sexist, and antisemitic group chats.

The political fallout is continuing from the leak of the Young Republicans group chat. A Politico investigation found that young GOP leaders from Arizona, Kansas, New York, and Vermont sent each other thousands of Telegram messages that included racist, antisemitic, and violent rhetoric.

The authors of the messages repeatedly used slurs and epithets to describe Black people and other people of color, said “I love Hitler,” joked about putting their political opponents in gas chambers, and threatened rape and violence.

First reported last week, the Politico story instigated a conversation among conservatives about whether blatantly bigoted language had become too normalized among young people on the right.

Some members of the chat have been fired or resigned from their positions in the party. Democrats were quick to condemn the messages, but the response from Republican pundits and politicians has been divided, with some denouncing the statements and others minimizing and excusing them, or pointing to violent messages coming from the left.

Vice President JD Vance, notably, said he refused to “join the pearl clutching” and referred to the chat participants as “kids” and “young boys,” even though the participants are in their 20s and 30s.

The leaked Young Republicans chat was followed by another leaked chat in which Paul Ingrassia, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, told a group of Republicans that he has “a Nazi streak,” that Martin Luther King Jr. Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell,” and used an Italian slur for Black people. On Tuesday, Ingrassia withdrew his nomination in the wake of these reports and after it became clear he wouldn't have the backing of several GOP senators.

Today, Explained host Noel King spoke with Jamie Cohen, an associate professor of media studies at Queens College CUNY in New York who researches visual culture and online extremism, about why Republicans keep getting caught saying offensive things to each other when they think no one else is listening.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Why do you think those Young Republicans were saying what they were saying?

I think they've normalized this speech in their communities. It's sort of the way that we code switch into our group chats. We each have our own type of language when we talk to each other, and the sites and places that they communicate or find themselves around online are speaking like this. They're just dragging that type of language into their group chats.

That brings us to the question of — if you think that talking this way is normal — whether you really mean it. And we're not inside their heads; we don't know if they really mean it. But one way of determining whether they really mean it is to ask: Is this exclusive to young people on the right?

There is a space where people test the people around them while using speech. The Overton window is the overall borderlands of acceptable speech. But I think each person who holds their ideologies — whether they're left ideologies or right ideologies — tests people by using language that is pretty specific to their space and ideology. And so in these cases, you often hear these words to see if somebody pushes back or not. And if nobody pushes back, you know that that's an acceptable form of speech inside those communities.

So it isn't always ideologically [exclusive] to the right; it is ideologically [exclusive] to what is an in-group or what you find as a sense of belonging. So it's the way that we test each other to figure it out.

Jay Jones, a Democrat who's running for attorney general in Virginia, said in some texts that he seemed to think were private, that a former House speaker in Virginia, a Republican, should get two bullets to the head. He talked about his rivals' kids being killed by gun violence. What do we take from the example of Jay Jones?

So this example is interesting, because the difference here is the Young Republicans aren't running for office. [Editor's note: One member of the group chat is a Vermont state senator.] They might hold positions in their state, but when you're running for attorney general, you really are the person who's responsible for that type of justice. There's that sentence of “wisdom consists of the anticipation of consequences.” When you're running for that position, being inconsequential about that is irresponsible. [Jones] said he was embarrassed and sorry for what he said. But that is also abhorrent speech and it falls under what would be considered threat, and that isn't protected by our First Amendment rights.

What I'm hearing from you is that everybody is behaving badly in the chats. And by everybody, I don't obviously literally mean everybody, but I myself have said things in private group chats — nothing along these lines, I assure you and our listeners — that I would not want anyone to see. 

This makes me, Jamie, open to the idea that a group chat is essentially harmless. We talk this way in private, but we don't act on this. And we live in 2025. Everyone has the group chat, and everybody is trying to impress their friends with the clever or salty or spicy things that they say. But we need to remember that it's not real life. What do you think about that?

In the past several years and probably the last decade, we've replaced community into these digital spaces. We're allowed to be more free inside of them. And I think, to be clear, if we lose that freedom, then we've lost connectivity. We do need an ability to express ourselves freer with our group chats, in terms of private spaces, in terms of what we would consider in-group — and I mean small in-group. What we would consider [our] community should have the ability to have a flexibility of language that is acceptable among friends. That is how it is.

Those gray areas are part of how we moderate space in general. It isn't a danger that translates from text directly to action. That is completely different. Text to action takes many, many years. I think where I feel this happens is when you normalize any type of slow violence — meaning these are just jokes at this point, when you normalize that amongst a group of friends.

[But] sometimes the borders of your group chat spill out into real life. You forget who you're talking to. You've normalized it so much in your head that your filters have been worn down. And I think that's where the borderlands become soft. And I worry about that with internet culture in general, because so many people that consider themselves extremely online or very online since the pandemic have lost the idea of what the filter is between their online friends and how they communicate to their parents, to their friends offline, or in classes, to be honest. I've heard things that come out of [my students'] mouths which result in a little bit of a red face. So I think sometimes that normalcy creates an accidental okayness that isn't with the right ingroup.

These were young Republicans who were chairs of the Young Republicans in Kansas City and New York. You look at their online profiles, and these are not particularly charismatic people. They don't seem as if they're bound for greatness. And so maybe — and we've heard conservatives make this argument — they are people at the lower echelon who weren't really headed anywhere, and therefore it's not so much to worry about. What do you think about that?

I would ask where JD Vance was in the echelon 10 years ago. If you assume that he was in the lower echelons of politics a decade ago — coming off of a book deal and telling his story, and 10 years ago today being fairly anti-Trump — and then figuring his way into a point where today he uses Twitter and his accounts quite aggressively, with his language. And in [his] defense of these text messages, it just tells you that yes, at this point they may be lower echelon in their speech, but there's a likely trajectory of them moving up to potentially the vice presidency or the presidency itself.

Vance is a fascinating case because he is young. He's a millennial. He's a member of the emo community. He almost certainly will run for president in 2028, and he's defending this. This man who's very ambitious, who would probably like to be president someday, is the loudest voice saying, this is no big deal. That's really striking. What do we take from that?

I guess it surprised me the most when the vice president replied in a quote tweet to the Krassensteins: “I don't give a shit what you call it,” when the Krassensteins called the Trump administration's bombing of a Venezuelan boat a “war crime.” The vice president is a very online character, but the Krassensteins are well known as reply guys on X, and they clap back. That's their main goal. They speak directly back to politicians and try to get that type of attention. So they're popular figures.

I thought to myself, in what part of history, at least modern history, would you hear a vice president saying that to a citizen? That would be considered something that would be a gaffe or something that would be so problematic. I mean, I grew up when Dan Quayle misspelled potato. So I was fascinated by that level of aggressive mockery of somebody just saying something on Twitter, or on X, and how much that type of speech has become normalized, not just by politics, but by culture and media as well.

I do believe that Vance is speaking, when he talks about this or covers for these Young Republicans — I feel in many ways he's speaking towards the future of the party that he is likely to or imagines himself to inherit. And in that way, we're kind of seeing what the new baseline at the bottom is, the normalcy of that lower level as it's going to become something more aggressive in the future. People still see the internet as another place. But JD Vance and this chat group shows that the internet is everywhere. Internet culture is running our politics and our culture at this point. And we have to really pay very close attention to how JD Vance speaks, because he may be speaking to his echo chamber, but he is expecting that chamber to get much larger and encompass everything around us.

Can “affordability” be more than just a campaign pitch?

The buzziest political word of the year is “affordability” — it's the mantra that carried the insurgent progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani to victory in New York City's mayoral primary, and that Democrats across the country have since raced to claim as their own.

“Affordability is the central issue, the central reason to be a Democrat,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren declared in August. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has similarly placed “affordability” at the center of his state housing reforms and his administration's plan to manufacture generic insulin pens. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison launched his reelection bid this week under the banner of “Afford your life.”

Few candidates or elected officials are willing to acknowledge what many economists say quietly: that prices tend to be “sticky,” and that absent a major economic slowdown, costs are unlikely to fall much from where they are today. Still, Democratic strategists who worried that the party under Joe Biden had for too long ignored cost-of-living issues and the growing frustration around inflation have been happy to see “affordability” take center stage. That the cry is being led by a candidate endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America has even given the term leftist validation — despite the fact that a decade ago “affordability“ stood as the vague, squishy descriptor socialists blamed for watering down the goal of universal health care with the Affordable Care Act.

But when it comes to the explanation for today's affordability crisis, the party has found itself embroiled in seemingly endless factional debates — with each camp insisting their diagnosis is the primary one. Is the crisis because, as the Abundance theorists argue, we're not building enough? Or is it, as some populists allege, due to corporate greed and Wall Street recklessness? Or because we've shirked on antitrust enforcement, allowing monopolies to take over and artificially raise prices? Or because, as progressives argued in the 2010s, unions were decimated and too much was left to the market? Rather than acknowledge that multiple factors might be at play, each faction has largely dug in around its preferred explanation.

One attempt to unify these debates comes from the Economic Security Project (ESP), a progressive organization focused on direct cash support and the broader social safety net. It offers a new analysis of affordability in hopes that a comprehensive framework might lead to clearer political solutions, and perhaps more harmonious political consensus. Though Mike Konczal, one of the report's co-authors, emphasized in an interview that their work represents an “honest assessment“ of structural problems and not a political compromise, it's clear that the analysis aims to offer a more constructive path forward than the in-fighting so many have grown used to.

The analysis divides the affordability crisis into two categories: problems with markets and problems with incomes.

Markets, ESP argues, fail in three main ways

On the income side, ESP argues that three forces make essentials unaffordable even when markets function well.

The framework covers most of the leading theories and treats all six causes as equally important, declining to rank any theory against another. It builds on a different framework published in September by Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Biden, and Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economist. The Bernstein-Mahoney report laid out more specific policy recommendations than ESP, though ESP says it plans to issue those types of proposals beginning next year.

Both analyses arrive as Democrats sort through competing ideas for understanding why costs are so high. The most prominent this year has been Abundance, popularized by Vox co-founder Ezra Klein and journalist Derek Thompson, which focuses on supply constraints: zoning laws blocking housing, permitting delays slowing infrastructure, regulatory barriers limiting competition. Their diagnosis is that government-imposed bottlenecks are preventing us from building enough of what we need.

ESP incorporates those arguments but argues it's incomplete. In the case of child care, for example, even if you removed every supply constraint (like licensing requirements that limit the number of providers or zoning rules that restrict home-based day cares) families would still struggle to afford care early in their careers. Building more housing, similarly, is not enough to protect families when job losses or inflation erode real incomes.

As proof that these various approaches aren't really in tension, ESP points to California. In the past two years, state lawmakers passed major YIMBY upzoning laws while also enacting anti-monopoly measures, including a ban on algorithmic rent-setting software like RealPage and reforms targeting prescription-drug middlemen who mark up prices. The same Democratic legislators — progressives like state Sen. Scott Wiener and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks — championed both sets of policies. “At the state level, at the personnel level, we often don't see these conflicts as much as you might suspect,” Konczal said.

The framework tries to show that addressing broken markets in one area doesn't preclude addressing broken incomes in another. Or, put differently, the conflicts that often dominate online debates may be more about interpersonal feuds and factional positioning than actual policy trade-offs.

Konczal acknowledged that because the framework doesn't prioritize among causes, “people will obviously have disagreements on which is more important,“ calling that “a very useful disagreement to have.” By not making those judgments itself, the framework lets each camp find validation without forcing trade-offs about which problems deserve the most urgent action.

If political battles are ultimately about resource allocation and legislative priorities, what's gained by a unifying framework that sidesteps the hardest choices?

This raises an obvious question: If political battles are ultimately about resource allocation and legislative priorities, what's gained by a unifying framework that sidesteps the hardest choices?

Some, like Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing People's Policy Project, think the ESP framework gets the logic generally right but badly misweights the causes. “As far as magnitude goes, income distribution dwarfs everything else,” he told Vox. Broken incomes bear most of the blame for lack of affordability, he argues, while theories like monopolistic pricing get more attention than the evidence warrants.

The weighting question connects to a deeper issue. When should markets be fixed and when should they be replaced? This is arguably the key question for affordability and one that the various factions have not yet squarely confronted.

Should health care be made more affordable through competition and transparency, or guaranteed through universal coverage? Should housing costs come down through supply increases, or should housing be partially decommodified through social housing?

Ironically, “affordability” once meant something very different to progressives. A decade ago, Democrats fought over whether the government should guarantee services or simply make them cheaper. The Bernie Sanders wing pushed for universality — Medicare-for-all, free college, housing as a right — while moderates framed goals around access: less costly insurance, debt-free college, homeownership incentives. “Affordable“ became the compromise word, often dismissed by the left as a disappointing cop-out — a promise of market participation instead of universal provision.

Now you have a progressive organization embracing “affordability” while explicitly invoking Social Security-style guarantees for life-cycle costs.

Does one need to pick? Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign showed how “affordability” can cover both approaches. She ran on an “opportunity economy“ centered on market-based solutions: small business tax credits, housing supply increases, cutting red tape. But she also proposed banning price gouging on groceries, capping prescription drug costs, and expanding the Child Tax Credit. “Affordability” let her do both without having to explain when markets needed fixing versus when they needed bypassing.

That's either sophisticated politicking or strategic ambiguity. The optimistic read is that the left has evolved beyond the false binary of guarantees versus opportunity. You can fix markets and provide universal goods — they're complementary, not contradictory. Recognizing that markets can work for some things if we fix them, while other things need decommodification, is arguably progress.

The pessimistic read is that “affordability” is doing too much work, covering for a lack of clarity about priorities. Without a theory of when to use which approach, you get a “do everything” framework that risks defaulting to market-based solutions because they're easier and more politically palatable, even when the right answer might be to fight for universal programs.

When I asked the report authors whether they had a theory for when something should be guaranteed versus made more affordable, they demurred. “It depends,” Konzcal said, saying that “most economic problems involve both” sides. He pointed to public options as a balanced approach, but offered little clarity for when to deploy them. “Markets can innovate and scale, while public options can anchor supply, set benchmarks, and ensure universal access,” he said.

Their sector-specific reports planned for 2026 will be a clearer test of where this framework ultimately goes. That's where we'll see if this can tackle the thorniest questions: What should we stop trying to make people afford at all?

The panic over lead in protein powder lead got the risk totally wrong.

Americans' love affair with protein powders may slowly be poisoning them with the known neurotoxin lead.

That, at least, is the implied conclusion of a viral investigation published last week by Consumer Reports on levels of lead and other heavy metals in popular protein supplements. Many brands, the article reported, “carry troubling levels of toxic heavy metals” including lead: “For more than two-thirds of the products we analyzed, a single serving contained more lead than CR's food safety experts say is safe to consume in a day — some by more than 10 times.”

It is a finding that, in a country in the grips of “protein mania,” has spread like wildfire across both traditional and social media. The problem is that it's more scaremongering than science — not because there isn't some lead found in these protein powders, but because Consumer Reports uses an almost impossibly low level of lead exposure as its baseline, which makes its findings seem much scarier than they really are.

For its investigation, Consumer Reports, which has long performed independent tests of lead levels in different foods, baby foods, and spices, tested 23 protein powders and pre-made protein shakes for heavy metals, and then compared their findings to lead levels that “CR's food safety experts say is safe to consume in a day.” That level is the so-called maximum allowable dose level (MADL) of 0.5 micrograms per day that was established by California's Prop 65, a 1986 law designed to inform consumers about exposure to harmful chemicals in everyday products.

The results were damning for many of the products. Sixteen were found to contain unsafe levels of lead, with plant-based supplements faring particularly badly, including Huel's Black Edition protein powder, which was found to exceed safe levels by a shocking 1,288 percent, and deemed by the magazine as unsafe to consume.

Lead exposure, to be clear, is a very serious health threat. It can stunt brain development in children, leading to lifelong disability. It can also damage the nervous system and kidneys, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke in adults. It is considered such a dangerous substance that the general expert opinion is that there is no truly safe level of exposure.

But while Consumer Reports' figures sound scary — 1,288 percent! — the devil is in the details, and specifically, the choice to use Prop 65 levels as the baseline.

To understand why, you need to understand the science of lead safety limits. The Food and Drug Administration has launched an initiative to bring lead levels “closer to zero” to mitigate children's exposure. But zero itself might be unachievable. Lead is naturally present in numerous foods, and found especially in some plants, which absorb lead from contaminated soil, air, and water. The FDA's studies of dietary lead exposure show that the average American adult consumes between 1.7 and 5.3 micrograms daily through their normal food intake.

Exposure to some amount of lead — be it through food, air, water, or the built environment — is unavoidable, so regulatory agencies tend to use estimates of relatively safe exposure called “reference levels” to guide policies. Such estimates take the lowest amount of lead that is known to be harmful and divide it by a so-called safety factor, a sort of statistical buffer.

The FDA, as part of its “Closer to Zero” campaign and using a 10X safety factor, has set its reference levels at 2.2 micrograms per day for children and 8.8 for women of childbearing age (to protect against accidental fetal exposure). This means that regularly exceeding these might pose health risks.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Felicia Wu, professor of food safety, toxicology, and risk assessment at Michigan State University, told me that the reference levels for lead represent “an acceptable level in food or water, based on a combination of reducing risk to populations while making it economically feasible for water utilities or food companies” to operate.

California's Prop 65, however, used a far higher 1,000X safety factor (1,000 times lower than minimal known unsafe levels) to arrive at 0.5 micrograms of lead per day as its reference level.

This is an unachievable safety target, significantly below the lead you get from average daily food consumption, especially for people who eat more legumes, fruits, and vegetables, all of which grow in the soil and inherently pull in some amount of heavy metals. As one clinical dietician I spoke with told me of the Prop 65 level: “You literally can't eat food from the Earth if you want to achieve this.”

Drying and processing foods can further concentrate those heavy metal levels. Take Huel Black Edition powder, which has pea protein as a principal ingredient. Consumer Reports's tests show that one serving of Huel has 6.3 micrograms of lead, or about 12.6 times more than Prop 65's reference level 0.5. That's how the magazine gets to the astounding claim that Huel contains around 1288 percent of the maximum safe dose of lead.

But compared to the FDA's more realistic numbers, 6.3 micrograms is 71.6 percent of the reference level for women of childearing age, meaning it's safe even for at-risk individuals. For adult males, who are more likely to glug protein shakes, the risk is negligible. Children, with some exceptions, shouldn't be consuming protein powder at all.

And that's one of the two products with the highest levels of lead — the other is Naked Nutrition's Vegan Mass Gainer — which means that every single one of the 23 products that Consumer Reports tested is relatively safe by FDA standards. If you're doing the math at home and have found that adding 6.3 micrograms from a Huel shake to the high end of average daily intake at 5.3 micrograms would take you beyond the reference level for at-risk people, remember that the reference level is ten times less than the minimum observably unhealthy amount. There's a built-in cushion. (While the CR report noted that an FDA spokesperson told them that there is “sufficient evidence” that the 8.8 micrograms of lead level should apply to all adults, not just women of childbearing age, that would still mean that even the products with the most lead would fall beneath that standard.)

And it bears noting that Consumer Reports's tests showed levels of lead that were higher than tests of Huel carried out by the National Sanitation Foundation, an independent testing body, which showed that a serving of Huel Black came in under 3.6 micrograms. And while it's true that plant-based protein powders like Huel do have higher lead levels than whey protein that comes from dairy, the differences are trivial if we get away from the Prop 65 baseline. Switching from plant-based to animal-based protein powders to reduce lead exposure, as Consumer Reports tells readers to consider doing, is an unnecessary precaution.

The bottom line is that Consumer Reports's protein lead scare is — pardon the pun — a big nothingburger. But the questions still remain: Are protein supplements completely safe? And should you be consuming them? The answers are a little more complicated.

Consumer Reports might be overstating the threat posed by lead in protein powders, but their reporting does bring up an important problem that applies to all supplements: They are troublingly under-regulated in the United States.

The FDA is responsible for food supplement safety just as it is for food safety. But the two operate under completely different regulatory regimes.

While an entire cottage industry of health and fitness gurus exists purely to convince people that they need more protein, most Americans already get more than enough of it through their normal diet.

Food is governed by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, under which all foods have to be tested for safety before being allowed to be sold to the public. But supplements fall under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, which states that supplements like protein powders do not require pre-market approval. It is then up to the government to test or follow up on complaints, and remove offending products found unsafe, all of which it must do with constrained staffing and budget. In 2024, the FDA inspected only 600 of the over 10,000 supplement manufacturers that sell products to Americans.

This means that while supplements might be legally regulated, most are de facto unregulated. Unsurprisingly, the supplement market has boomed in the wake of DSHEA, widely considered to be the result of lobbying by the supplement industry. The result has exposed consumers to supposedly healthy products whose health benefits (and risks) are for the most part unverified.

William Masters, a food economist at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition, told me that to call supplement companies snake oil salesmen may be too kind. “If I sell snake oil as oil for your salad dressing, it has to have snake oil in it,” he said. “If I sell snake oil as a supplement, it doesn't even have to have snake oil in it.”

Others offered a more tempered assessment. Kevin Klatt, a nutrition research scientist at the University California Berkeley, told me that he would steer consumers who insist on protein powders toward larger and more reputable brands, which are more likely to, like Huel, have done outside testing like getting NSF certification — and are more concerned about bad press and potential litigation.

But all the experts I spoke with for this story argued that supplements should be more strongly regulated. Rob Shewfelt, a professor emeritus of food science and technology at the University of Georgia and the author of In Defense of Processed Food told me that it's important for the public to recognize that the problem with supplements is not that they are processed foods, but that they are not regulated as stringently as other foods — including actual processed foods. “Supplements [in the US] wouldn't be trusted by me as a food scientist,” he said. It's the regulatory process, not whether something is processed, that matters.

And then there's the question of whether people need to be consuming protein supplements in the first place. While an entire cottage industry of health and fitness gurus exists purely to convince people that they need more protein, most Americans already get more than enough of it through their normal diet. Supplements, as their name suggests, exist to supplement deficiencies in diets, but the average person, including the average athlete, can quite easily meet protein targets on a diet without supplements, including a plant-based one.

So no, your protein shakes are not giving you lead poisoning. And if you want to have them, that's probably fine. Whether you need to is a different story.

Young people want to understand culture. Why on TikTok?

After the release of Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl, TikTok had some expectedly strong takes.

One popular TikTok claims that Swift's album is a “case study in moral collapse” full of lyrics that demonstrate “pathological self-involvement” and “an absence of self-identity.” The user's tone is confident, but their analysis is largely speculative. Another TikTok explains how the public has perceived Swift through her whiteness. The argument is equally lacking in rigor and includes some ahistorical claims. The video still received over 7 million views and tens of thousands of comments in agreement.

Outside of Swift's release schedule, this sort of critical analysis is everywhere. The TikToker, talking straight to the camera, breaks down the latest pop star, reality show, cheating scandal, or fashion trend. Sometimes, they're examining the object or phenomenon itself. Other times, they're relating it to society at large. They'll often utilize TikTok's green-screen tool, floating photos and text above their head that they lean on for authority.

Cultural commentary on TikTok isn't new, nor is it always bad. Many critics, academics, and other experts are fairly popular on the app now. Still, it's disconcerting to see this kind of in-depth analysis be overtaken by anyone with a strong voice and an academic vocabulary. The feigned authority can contribute to the spread of misinformation on TikTok and other platforms. Meanwhile, professional critics are losing their jobs at legacy publications, as a climate of fear due the Trump administration has made the job more risky. Following Charlie Kirk's death, a Washington Post columnist was fired for discussing his history of racist remarks.

The rise of the armchair TikTok critic nevertheless shows that Gen Z wants help understanding the world — but they're not necessarily reading a newspaper to do so. Instead, they're devouring takes from random strangers on an entertainment app, alongside brain rot content and lip-syncing videos. But why?

Gen Z, it seems, increasingly realize that they're stuck on a social media hamster wheel. If they can't stop scrolling, they may as well make the most out of it and learn something, even if that something isn't necessarily rigorous or true.

In many ways, the genre of cultural commentary on TikTok is just a truncated form of the video essays that have been popular on YouTube for years. As Terry Nyugen previously wrote for Vox, these long-form videos started to thrive in 2012 when the platform began prioritizing watch time over views in their search engine. And they remain a prominent source of hours spent on the website. Popular accounts like Natalie Wynn (aka ContraPoints), Mina Le, Lindsay Ellis, Every Frame a Painting, and the Nerdwriter regularly rake up millions of views for their hour(s)-long deep dives into cultural phenomena. Among the more well-researched analyses, you'll also find plenty of misinformation, unsubstantiated gossip, and generally bad takes, like conspiracy videos about Covid or deep dives into Hailey Bieber's alleged stalking.

It was only natural that internet users would carry this “I'm here to learn” attitude over to TikTok, according to Jamie Cohen, a media studies professor at Queens College CUNY in New York. One reason for this shift, he says, was the timing of the app's rise “when everybody was switched to learning online during the pandemic.” However, several aspects of YouTube that make it such a successful platform for posting in-depth explainers don't exactly translate to the bite-sized format of TikTok. YouTube's more formal, “big-screen” presentation creates more of an incentive for video essayists to show their work, by reading out full citations or elaborating on supportive materials. On TikTok, however, facts and ideas are often hurried and collaged to make a fast, reductive point.

“The format of analysis videos on YouTube is much more essay-like, whereas on TikTok it's about designing and layering up,” Cohen said. “The green-screen tactic is good, but it always results in pointing at things rather than explaining things.”

Another downside of TikTok's commentary is that it isn't necessarily designed to spark curiosity or further research. Nikita Walia, a brand strategist and writer who specializes in cultural studies, semiotics, and media theory, says that the best creators on the app “spark further exploration” in their cultural analysis, but that “the format itself rewards closure, quick takes, clear answers, [and] moral certainty.”

“The result is that ideas become aesthetic objects meant to be consumed, rather than wrestled with,” Walia said. “What once invited dialogue now functions as display.”

The fact that Gen Z wants knowledge from TikTok is not particularly unique. Social media platforms have historically been rationalized as additional hubs of information and learning. In addition to the long-form videos essays, TED Talks and how-to videos have helped give YouTube an educational sheen. Despite the chaotic nature of the app, X (formerly Twitter) is still a space for legitimate journalism and intellectual discourse, populated by prominent voices from media and politics.

However, Gen Z's complicated relationship with their phones makes this method of learning seem less voluntary and more like a response to a state of entrapment. The idea that Gen Z can't get off of social media has been well studied — and most of them agree it's true. TikTok, in particular, boasts several addictive and time-wasting features, from its all-powerful predictive algorithm to the brevity of its videos, which can distort time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the young people that dominate TikTok's user base are reading less than previous generations.

“People want to feel that their time online has meaning, and in some ways it does,” Walia said. “However, even the smartest content has to play by the same algorithmic rules that favor speed and stimulation over reflection.”

TikTok has also simply become a primary source of news for many people. According to a study by Pew Research Center published in January, 52 percent of TikTok users, which is equivalent to 17 percent of all US adults, say they regularly get news on the site. However, journalists represent a tiny percentage — just 0.4 percent — of the accounts that TikTok users follow.

While it's easy to scold Gen Z for not being more literate or curious beyond what they see on TikTok, Walia says that individuals shouldn't be blamed for listening to whatever impassioned “thought leader” comes across their timeline. “The incentives just don't exist to embark on deep self-study, and higher education is increasingly inaccessible,” Walia said.

Cohen, the CUNY professor, still sees a desire to learn among his students, who are always referencing these cultural commentary videos, and in Gen Z at large. He says that TikTok is a space where they can get “supportive material that isn't covered but that they're curious about.” This is especially important in a time when college campuses are being targeted by the administration for teaching certain policies and compelled to censor ideas.

“The world itself makes them feel disenfranchised,” Cohen said. “It doesn't give them power, so they do want to be educated.” Most of all, Cohen added, “they don't want to feel left behind.”

HELODRANON'NY RANOBE, Madagasikara — Ny haran-dranomasina (vatohara) izy tenany dia tena tsara tokoa. Miaina any amin'ny dimy kilaometatra miala ny morontsiraka izy ireo, any amin'ny rano lalina manodidina ny dimy ambin'ny folo metatra, ary dia toy ny tany mikitoantoana misy loko mavokely, manga, ary volomboasary, mipetraka ao anatin'ny ranomasina manga lalina. Ny singany iray amin'ny vatohara dia vondron-biby madinika velona, ary manana endrika hafahafa maro, manomboka amin'ny endrika toy ny lovia fasiana mofomamy sy toy ny ambin-kazo avy amin'ny penisilihazo noharatana ka hatramin'ny endrika toy ny tandroka sy toy ny atidoha.

Fa nisy zavatra iray mazava tsara tsy hita tao: trondro. Toy ny tanàna tsy misy olona, dia saika foana avokoa ilay haran-dranomasina — tsy misy trondro, tsy misy drakaka, tsy misy lamaira (murène), ary tsy misy biby an-dranomasina hafa izay tokony ho hita amin'ny haran-dranomasina.

Maraina mazava tamin'ny volana Septambra ny andro, ary tamin'izay no nanaovako fijibihana (plongée) tao amin'ny haran-dranomasina iray tao atsimon'ny andrefan'i Madagasikara, firenena nosy iray ao atsinanan'i Afrika. Ary toy ny haran-dranomasina maro amin'ny faritra manodidina sy ny hafa maneran-tany, dia efa eo andalam-pahasimbana izy ireo. Ny fanjonoana mihoapapana no naha ritra ny trondro ety amin'ny ranomasimbe, ka rehefa mandeha ny fotoana dia mihamahazo vahana ny lomo-dranomasina (algue) ary lasa mandrakotra ny haran-dranomasina. Ny fitomboan'ny hafananan'ny ranomasina sy ny hamafin'ny rivodoza, miampy ny fandripahana ala any an-tanety, dia anisan'ny loza ho an'ny haran-dranomasin'io firenena io, izay isan'ny manana karazana biby sy zavamaniry maro indrindra eto amin'izao tontolo izao.

Olana lehibe izany ho an'ny olona manamorona ny morontsiraka eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara. Miankina amin'ny jono ny fiainan'izy ireo — ny fanjonoana biby an-dranomasina dia tena ilainy, ary matetika dia io no hany loharanon-tsakafo sy vola — kanefa rehefa potika ny haran-dranomasina dia potika koa ny jono. Ao amin'ny haran-dranomasina ny trondro no matory, no mihinana, no miafina ny ireo biby mpihaza, ka raha tsy eo intsony izany dia sahirana izy ireo amin'ny fahavelomany. Toe-javatra sarotra izany : ny fahasalamana sy ny fiainan'ny olona eny amorontsiraka dia miankina amin'ny jono, kanefa ny fanjonoana be loatra koa dia isan'ireo antony lehibe mahatonga ny haran-dranomasina — sy ny jono izay tohanany— hihena.

Io fifanoherana eo amin'ny fiainan'olombelona sy ny fiainan'ny biby io dia tsy eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara ihany no misy azy. Ity nosy ity, izay onenan'ny olona manodidina ny 33 tapitrisa, dia isan'ireo firenena mahantra indrindra eran-tany, ka manodidina ny 80 isanjaton'ny mponina no miaina amin'ny vola latsaky ny 12 000 ariary isan'andro. Matetika tsy manan-tsafidy hafa ny olona afa-tsy ny miankina mivantana amin'ny tontolo iainana mba hahazoana izay ilaina amin'ny fiainana.

Ao anatin'izany anefa, ny fanjakana dia tsy nahavita nanome akory ny tolotra fototra toy ny jiro azo antoka sy rano madio — mainka moa fa na dia lalana hivoahana amin'ny fahantrana sy amin'ny fiankinana amin'ny fitrandrahana. Tamin'ity vanim-potoana fararano ity, izany tsy fahombiazan'ny fanjakana izany dia niteraka fihetsiketsehana tao anatin'ny herinandro maromaro izay notarihin'ny tanora manerana an'i Madagasikara, izay eo amin'ny 20 taona eo ho eo ny salan-taonany. Vokatr'izany, dia nesorin'ny Antenimierampirenena tamin'ny 14 Oktobra ny filoha, ary noraisin'ny miaramila ny fitondrana. Tsy mbola mazava izay dikan'io fiovan-kery io ho an'i Madagasikara sy ho an'ireo tanora mitaky fiovana.

Noho ny filàna mavesatra misy amin'ny maha olombelona, tsy mahagaga raha maro amin'ireo tontolo iainana malaza eto amin'ny firenena no mihasimba ihany koa. Araka ny fikarohana, hatramin'ny fiandohan'ity taonjato ity, dia efa simba hatramin'ny antsasaky ny haran-dranomasina velona eto Madagasikara, ary tahaka izany koa ny ala voajanahary. Saika ny karazana gidro rehetra, biby izay hita eto Madagasikara ihany — dia tandindomin-doza ho lany tamingana.

Ny fanjakana sy ireo fikambanana tsy miankina dia nandany am-polony taona maro — sy vola an-jatony tapitrisa dolara avy amin'ny fanampiana avy any ivelany — mba hiatrehana ireo olana ireo amin'ny fomba izay efa nahazatra, toy ny fananganana faritra arovana izay mandrara ny fanjonoana. Fa ny asehon'i Madagasikara dia izao: matetika tsy mahomby ny tetikasa fiarovana raha toa ka mainka manasarotra ny fiveloman'ny olona tena mahantra izany. Ary hita mazava fa io no antony lehibe nahatonga ireo tetikasa fiarovana maro tsy nahomby any amin'ireo toerana manankarena biby sy zavamaniry, izay matetika hita any amin'ireo firenena mahantra.

Ny toerana toy Madagasikara dia mampiseho fa ilaina ny fomba fiarovana amin'ny fomba hafa — fomba izay tena mametraka ny olona sy izay ilainy ho fototra iaingana, mba hiaina tsara sy ho feno fahatanterahana. Izay indrindra no nahatonga ahy nakany amin'ny Helodranon'ny Ranobe, toerana nandalovako herinandro tamin'ny volana Septambra. Niaraka tamin'ny mpanjono sy ekipa mpikaroka iraisam-pirenena aho, nitsidika fikambanana kely iray izay manandrana mamerina amin'ny laoniny ny jono sy ny vokatra azo avy aminy, nefa tsy manakana ny jono mihitsy. Ny tanjon'ny tetikasa dia ny hanampy olona. Ny fiarovana ny tontolo iainana dia vokatra an-daniny fotsiny.



Tony ny ranomasina ary feno sambo kely misy lay rehefa tonga indray maraina aho teo amoron-dranomasina tao Ambolimailaky, tanàna mpanjono iray. Ireo lay tsofin-drivotra — maro amin'izy ireo vita amin'ny gonim-bary efa nampiasaina ary nozairina miaraka — no nitondra ny lakana hazon'ireo mpanjono, izay antsoin'izy ireo hoe lakan-day na lakam-boaly, ho eny amin'ny morontsiraka.

Nahita harato vita avy amin'ny lay fiaro amin'ny moka (moustiquaire) aho tao amin'ny lakana sasany rehefa nanakaiky ny morona izy ireo. Eto Madagasikara sy amin'ny faritra hafa eto Afrika, tsy zava-baovao ny mahita mpanjono mampiasa ireo lay fiaro amin'ny moka (moustiquaire) ireo — izay matetika omen'ny fikambanana mpanampy hiarovana amin'ny tazomoka — mba hanjonona trondro.

Nasehon'ireo mpanjono tamiko izay azony. Ny sasany nanana siny feno sardinina madinika nihetsika toy ny ranom-bolafotsy. Ny hafa kosa nanana vata feno eo amin'ny antsasany misy trondro toy ny Votrandra, Lafo, Bodoloha, ary zanaka Mandrandovoke. Nisy ankizy vitsivitsy nametraka trondro vitsivitsy mbola velona, toy ny Fia maintsy, tao anaty vilany vy mba hilalaovany. Nisy zaza roa lahy, tokony mbola mpianatra raha ny taonany, nampiseho tamiko siny plastika iray nisy zanaka horita (poulpe) roa ambin'ny folo izay nosamboriny. Nifangaro ny tanan'ireo horita (poulpe) ireo ary tototrin'ny ranomaintiny.

Amin'ny maha olona avy any Etazonia ahy izay tsy mpanjono, nahatsapa alahelo aho nahita ireo biby marobe maty sy mbola niala aina. Matetika aho mahita trondron-dranomasina sy horita (poulpe) any amin'ny aquarium, na amin'ny fitsangantsanganana andranomasina, na amin'ny dokambarotry ny fikambanana mpiaro tontolo iainana. Fa ho an'ireo mpanjono eto dia hafa tanteraka ny fifandraisany amin'ireo biby ireo — ary manana ny antony tsara izany.

Ao amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe, ny jono no loharanom-bola lehibe indrindra amin'ny tanàna manamorona morontsiraka, araka ny tenin'i Aroniaina “Aro” Manampitahiana Falinirina, mpikaroka manovo ny mari-pahaizana “doctorat” momba ny sianan-dranomasina ao amin'ny IHSM, oniversiten'i Toliara. Izany no fomba ahazoan'ny olona vola hividianana sakafo, fitaovam-pianarana, sy fitaterana. Ary amin'ny foko sasany — indrindra ny Vezo, foko iray manana fifamatorana lalina amin'ny ranomasina hatramin'ny razany — ny jono dia efa fomba fiainana hatramin'ny taranaka maro.

“Raha tsy manjono aho, tsy mihinana,” hoy Nambokely, mpanjono iray nihaona tamiko teo amoron-dranomasina tao Ambolimailaky, tamin'ny alalan'ny mpandika teny.

Ny mpanjono eto helodranon'ny Ranobe dia miasa tsy ankiato andro aman'alina.

Indray hariva, rehefa vao nilentika ny masoandro, dia nandeha sambo kely aho niaraka tamin'ny mpikaroka vitsivitsy izay mianatra momba ny haran-dranomasina sy ny jono. Feno zavamiaina madinika mamirapiratra teo ambonin'ny ranomasina, ary nirehitra izy ireo rehefa nosarihin'ny onja ny lohan'ny sambo, toy ny hoe nandeha teo ambonin'ny vovoka manjelanjelatra izahay.

Fa ny tena nisy firantiana fahazavana lehibe dia tao anaty rano. Rehefa niala lavidavitra amin'ny morona izahay, dia niseho teo ambanin'ny onjan-dranomasina ireo tara-pahazavana samy mandeha haingana amin'izay halehany — mpanjono amin'ny alina ireo. Ireo mpanjono dia mitady ny haza tiany hohazana amin'ny fampiasana jiro tsy mataho-drano, izay indraindray dia jiro tsotra nofonosina amin'ny kapôty maromaro.

Rehefa nipoitra avy anaty rano nitondra lamaira (murène) voatsatoka tamin'ny voloso (na lefona), ny mpanjono lehilahy Vezo iray antsoina hoe Jean Batiste, dia nilaza tamiko fa manjono amin'ny alina izy satria mahazo trondro betsaka kokoa noho ny amin'ny atoandro.

Saingy, hoy i Jean Batiste — ary toy izany koa ny mpanjono rehetra niresaka tamiko tao Ranobe — mihamafy sy mihasarotra hatrany ny mahazo zavatra, ka lasa mihasarotra ihany koa ny mahazo vola. “Tena mampanahy” hoy i Jean Batiste tamiko tamin'iny alina iny teny an-dranomasina.

Ao amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe sy amin'ny faritra maro eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara, miharatsy be ny jono, ary mety ho potika mihitsy aza. Fikarohana maro avy amin'ity faritra ity no manaporofo fa mihena ny trondro azon'ny olona sy ny isan'ny karaza-trondro azo raha oharina amin'ny telopolo na efapolo taona lasa. Ny karazana trondro sasany — anisan'izany ny Bodoloha sasany, izay manampy amin'ny fanakanana ny fitomboan'ny lomotra (algue) manimba haran-dranomasina — dia efa nanjavona tanteraka amin'ny toerana sasany. “Tafidina amin'ny taha tsy mbola nisy toy izany teo aloha,” hoy i Gildas Todinanahary, izay mpikaroka momba ny ranomasina, sady talen'ny IHSM.

Mihakely ihany koa ny haben'ny trondro azon'ny olona, midika izany fa manjono trondro mbola tanora sy kely ny mpanjono — famantarana mazava ny fanjonoana mihoapapana koa izany. Raha jonoina avokoa na ny lehibe na ny kely, dia tsy misy afaka mamokatra taranaka intsony.

Nambaran'i Nambokely tamiko fa taloha, tamin'ny andro tsara, dia afaka nahazo 40 000 na 60 000 ariary ny mpanjono iray amin'ny andro iray monja. Fa amin'izao fotoana izao, vondrona misy mpanjono efatra na dimy no mandeha manjono mandritra ny ora maro eny an-dranomasina, kanefa trondro vitsivitsy fotsiny no mety azony, manodidina ny antsasaky ny siny plastika iray. Izany dia manodidina ny 20 000 ka hatramin'ny 40 000 ariary, hoy izy tamiko, ary tsy maintsy zarain'izy ireo mitovy. Ny horita (poulpe) madinika roa ambin'ny folo kosa dia mitentina manodidina ny 10 000 ariary monja.

“Tsy ampy ny sakafo azon'olona anatin'ny indray andro,” hoy i Marcel Sebastian, mpanjono zokiny iray nihaona tamiko tao amin'ilay tanàna. Efa mihoatra ny 50 taona izy no manjono eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara.“Tamin'ny taloha misakafo midi, misakafo hariva. Fa amin'ny fotoana henaniky zao, tsy mihina hany midi fa mihina hany hariva, izay izany ty fisehony.”



Tsy ny jono no olana. Fa ny fanjonoana mihoapapana — tsindry izay mahatonga ny jono ho tafahoatra be ka tsy manome fotoana ho an'ny haran-dranomasina sy ny zava-manan'aina ao aminy mba hiverenan'ny ainy amin'ny laony. Izay no mitranga amin'izao fotoana izao eto atsimo-andrefan'i Madagasikara. Maro loatra ny olona samy mpanjono ary mitovy ny trondro jonony.

Antony iray amin'izany dia ny fiovan'ny toetrandro. Ny fiakaran'ny hafanana dia manampy amin'ny haintany maharitra izay manasarotra ny fambolena any atsimon'i Madagasikara. Ao ihany koa ny fandripahana ala be dia be — izay manala ireo hazo izay mitazona ny tany sy manampy ny rano hiditra ao anaty tany — izay midika fa rehefa avy ny orana, dia mandrakotra tany fambolena ny atsanga avy amin'ny tondra-drano. Rehefa tsy mahomby ny fambolena any an-tanety, dia mitombo ny isan'ny tantsaha eto Madagasikara izay mifindra any amin'ny morontsiraka mitady vola amin'ny alalan'ny jono. (Ny fandripahana ala any an-tanety koa dia mandefa fotaka any an-dranomasina, izay afaka mandrakotra sy mamono haran-dranomasina.)

Io fifindra-monina ateraky ny toetrandro io dia mahatonga ny mponina eny amin'ny morontsiraka hitombo be, ka mampitombo ny tsindry amin'ny jono. Sarotra ny mahita tarehimarika marina amin'ny isan'ny olona eto amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe, fa araka ny asa fikarohana iray tamin'ny taona 2019, dia nitombo 4,5 isan-jato isan-taona eo ho eo ny tanàna eto — midika izany fa mitombo avo roa heny ny mponina eto afaka 15 taona. Raha ny salan'isa manerantany dia manodidina ny 1 isan-jato monja. “Maro amin'ireo olona tonga avy any an-tanety no tsy te honina eto,” hoy i Quinn Mitsuko Parker, mpikaroka manovo ny mari-pahaizana doctorat ao amin'ny Oniversiten'i Stanford, izay mianatra momba ny vondrom-piarahamonina mpanjono eto amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe.

“Tsy te hanao asa fanjonoana izy ireo. Aleon'izy ireo mamboly.”

Fa tsy manan-tsafidy afa-tsy ny manjono ny olona. Na dia tsy ampy intsony aza izany. Na dia manafaingana ny fahasimban'ny haran-dranomasina sy ny loharanom-bola azo avy ao aza izany.

Indray maraina, fotoanan'ny tsinam-bolana, dia nandeha lakana niaraka tamin'ny mpanjono vitsivitsy aho tamin'ny fotoan'ny ranomasina nidina. Nanomboka nihalalina ny rano tamin'ny voalohany fa rehefa nandeha lavitra izahay dia nanomboka narivo indray — mandra-pahatongan'ny fotoana izay namparivo ny rano ka afaka nandehanay an-tongotra. Teny ambonin'ny haran-dranomasina izahay tamin'izay. Zavatra hafahafa be izany: eto izahay, kilaometatra vitsivitsy miala ny morontsiraka, nefa dia mandeha an-tongotra ety ambonin'ny faritra tokony hisy ranomasina.

Rehefa tena tafidina be ny rano, dia miseho ny ampahany amin'ireo vatohara. Ary amin'izay, ny mpanjono — indrindra ny vehivavy teto — dia manararaotra an'izany. Mandeha eny ambonin'ny haran-dranomasina izy ireo mitady horita (poulpe), soky (oursin), ary biby madinika hafa hohanina na hamidy, lazaina amin'ny fomba fiteny hoe “mihaky” (pêche à pied) izany.

Farafahakeliny vehivavy eo amin'ny roambinifolo eo no nihaky (pêche à pied) tamin'ny fotoana nahatongavanay teny, ary samy niondrika nijery ambany izy ireo no sady nandeha. Ny sasany nitondra voloso (na lefona), hanindromana horita (poulpe), ary ny hafa nitondra akorandriaka lehibe sahala amin'ny boziky (conque), izay ampiasainy hanokafana soky (oursin).

Nankeo amin'ny vehivavy iray antsoina hoe Doseline aho, izay nanao kiraro tsy mitovy sy satroka be manarona masoandro. Sady niresaka izahay no sady nanindrona ny volosony tao anaty hara izy nitady horita (poulpe), ary indraindray izy nijanona naka akorandriaka kely sy nametraka izany tao anatin'ny kitapony.

Nilaza tamiko i Doseline fa amin'izao fotoana izao dia antsasaky ny horita (poulpe) no azony raha oharina tamin'ny 10 na 20 taona lasa izay. Ary na dia fantany aza fa mety hanimba ny haran-dranomasina ny mihaky toy izany — satria ny ankamaroan'ny haran-dranomasina hita eny dia efa maty noho ny fisian'ny mpihaky toy izao— dia tsy manana safidy hafa izy, hoy izy tamiko. Doseline dia renim-pianakaviana mpitondra-tena, ary izy no miandraikitra ny zanany lahy iray izay mbola mianatra. Hoy izy tamiko hoe: “Tsy ampy ho anay ny vola miditra [avy amin'ny ny jono].”

Nandritra ny adiny iray mahery aho nijery an'i Doseline nitady teny amin'ny haran-dranomasina teny. Nandalo teo ambonin'ny “étoile de mer” misy tsilo sy biby madinika miloko antsoina hoe limaces de mer izahay. Nahita aho akorandriaka foana izay nipetrahan'ny drakaka, biby toa avy amin'ny tontolo hafa izany. Doseline, izay manao bango mifity roa, dia tsy dia nahomby loatra “Malahelo aho fa tsy nahita horita ka holy” hoy izy tamiko.



Tao anatin'ny telopolo taona izay, nanintona ny sain'ny maro avy amin'ny fikambanana iraisam-pirenena mpiaro tontolo iainana sy ny mpamatsy vola vahiny i Madagasikara.Ny biby eto amin'ny nosy dia tsy vitan'ny hoe manintona — Gidro! Tanalahy! haran-dranomasina! — fa tsy manam-paharoa koa. Satria efa ela be i Madagasikara no voasaraka tamin'ny tany hafa, dia nanana fotoana ampy ny biby sy zavamaniry ao hampivoatra ny karazany (espèce) ho karazana (espèce) hafa vaovao. Ankehitriny, manodidina ny 90 isan-jaton'ny karazana zavamaniry sy biby eto dia tsy hita any an-kafa eto ambonin'ny tany. Midika izany fa raha lany eto Madagasikara izy ireo, dia ho lany amin'izao tontolo izao mihitsy.

Noho izany zava-dehibe izany, dia ny fikambanana lehibe iraisam-pirenena toa an'i Conservation International sy WWF dia efa niasa teto amin'ny nosy mba hiezaka hanakana ny fahapotehan'ny ala, ny fanjonoana mihoapapana, ary ny fahasimban'ny tontolo iainana amin'ny endriny rehetra. Ary ireo fikambanana mpanome fanampiana dia efa nandefa vola an-jatony tapitrisa dolara teto amin'ny nosy ho an'ny fiarovana.

Kanefa ireo loza ireo dia mbola mitombo, fa tsy mihena.

Ny olana lehibe indrindra dia ny fahantrana — izany dia tsindry mavesatra amin'ny tontolo iainana — izay mifamatotra akaiky amin'ny korontana ara-politika. Fa misy olana lehibe ihany koa eo amin'ny fampifandraisana ny fomba nentim-paharazana amin'ny fiarovana ny tontolo iainana na eto Madagasikara izany na amin'ny firenena mahantra hafa.

Teo aloha, ny fikambanana mpiaro ny tontolo iainana, ny siantifika vahiny ary ny fanjakana dia niantehitra be tamin'ny fametrahana faritra arovana eto Madagasikara ho fitaovana enti-miaro ny tontolo iainana, toy ny fanaovana valan-javaboary arovana, faritra arovana an-dranomasina ary ny toerana voajanahary arovana. Ny helodranon'ny Ranobe, ohatra, dia isan'ny faritra an-dranomasina voaaro amin'ny fomba ofisialy. Nefa araka ny fikarohana, ireo fomba fiarovana ireo dia tsy nahavita nanakana ny fahasimban'ny tontolo iainana. “Nahomby ve ny fiarovana ny harena voajanahary eto Madagasikara tamin'ny rafitra faritra arovana nandritra ny 30 taona? Tsia,” hoy ny minisitra teo aloha momba ny tontolo iainana, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, tamin'ny taona 2020.

Izany dia satria matetika ireo valan-javaboary arovana ireo tsy mamaha ny antony mahatonga ny olona hitrandraka ny tontolo iainana. Amin'ny tranga sasany, dia manavesatra manokana amin'ny vehivavy mpanjono ihany koa ireo fepetra ireo, satria manakana ny fidirany amin'ireo faritra anjonoana amin'ny fakan-javaboahary, araka ny nosoratan'i Merrill Baker-Médard tao amin'ny bokiny Feminist Conservation: Politics and Power in Madagascar's Marine Commons.

Olana iray hafa eto Madagasikara, ary hita maneran-tany ihany koa, dia ny hoe ny ONG dia matetika tompon'andraikitra kokoa amin'ny mpamatsy vola noho amin'ny vondrom-piarahamonina misy azy, hoy i Emma Gibbons, mpitantana ny ReefDoctor, fikambanana kely iray ao amin'ny helodranon'ny Ranobe. Ireo mpamatsy vola, amin'ny ankapobeny, dia manohana tetikasa vitaina anaty fotoana fohy. Ary tsy dia ahitana fepetra raha tsy tena manampy ny olona na ny tontolo iainana ireo tetikasa ireo, hoy ihany izy.

Ireo olana ireo dia hita mazava tsara indrindra eto atsimon'i Madagasikara, izay nantsoina mihitsy hoe “fasan'ny tetikasa” (cimetière de projet) satria maro be ireo tetikasa tsy nahomby.

Raha te hahomby ny fiarovana, dia tsy maintsy avy amin'ny olona eny ifotony sy tarihin'izy ireo izany, ary mifototra amin'ny fahatakarana lalina ny kolontsaina sy ny zavatra tian'ny olona, hoy i Gibbons, izay teratany britanika izay nipetraka teto Madagasikara nandritry ny 20 taona. Ny mpanjono eto dia mazava ho azy fa te hiaro ny jono — satria io no fiainany, sy fivelomany — saingy tsy afaka mamoy ny toerana fanjonoany izy ao anatin'izany. Zava-dehibe kokoa aminy ny fahazoana sakafo. “Tsy azo tenenina olona hoe aza mihinana,” hoy i Gibbons.

Izany fomba fijery izany no nanampy an'i Gibbons nandray fanampahakevitra amin'izao. Tsy nanakana ny jono, toy ny fanao araky fomba fiarovana taloha izy, fa — miaraka amin'ny olona ao amin'ny fiarahamonina sy ekipa iray misy mpikaroka eo an-toerana sy vahiny — manandrana mamorona toerana maro kokoa azo anjonoana.

Fa tsy manandrana manakana ny jono toy ny fomba fanao taloha amin'ny fiarovana, izy — miaraka amin'ny olona ao amin'ny fiarahamonina sy ekipa iray misy mpikaroka eo an-toerana sy vahiny — dia manandrana mamorona toerana maro kokoa azo anjonoana.

Ary mba hanaovana izany, dia manangana haran-dranomasina vaovao tanteraka izy ireo.“Manantena izahay,” hoy i Gibbons, “fa afaka mampitombo ny velaran-tany azo anjonoana.”

Ny fanamboarana haran-dranomasina artifisialy dia mora kokoa noho ny fieritreretana azy.Izy sy ireo mpiara-miasa aminy dia mandatsaka vato vaventy amin'ny ranomasina, ka mamorona andalana lavalava amin'ireo vato ao ambanin'ny rano, izay manodidina ny 57 metatra ny halavany. Izany dia mitovy amin'ny halavan'ny fiaramanidina mpitondra olona iray.

Avy eo, avela hifindran'ny karazam-biby sy zava-maniry samihafa ireo vato ireo amin'ny alalan'ny fitaovana antsoina hoe ARMS (fanafohezana ny hoe autonomous reef monitoring structures) izay efa nijanona volana maro teo amin'ny hara voajanahary hanangona vatohara, eponge, ary biby madinika an-dranomasina hafa.

Ireo fitaovana ireo, vita amin'ny takelaka vato maromaro mipetaka, dia toy ny fintambaran-javatra entina amelomana ny haran-dranomasina.

Hatramin'izao, ny ReefDoctor dia efa nahavita haran-dranomasina artifisialy roa izay manarona toerana manodidina ny antsasaky ny hekitara. Ny tsirairay amin'ireo dia misy andalana vato efatra, antsoina hoe spurs, izay feno ARMS efa misy karazam-biby sy zava-maniry samihafa.

Nilamina ny ranomasina ary maitso kokoa fa tsy dia manga tamin'ny fotoana nahatongavako teo ambonin'ny iray amin'ireo hara artifisialy, manodidina ny iray kilaometatra miala amin'ny morontsiraka, niaraka tamin'i Mark Little, izay mpikaroka an-dranomasina. Mikaroka momba ny mikraoba ao amin'ilay hara izy. Tsy dia mazava tsara ny rano, ka saika tsy hitanay akory ireo vato teo ambany — ary tsy dia mamporisika hisitrika tao. Nefa, na izany aza, dia nametaka “bouteille de plongée” aho ary niditra anaty rano.

Rehefa nidina aho, dia niseho tsikelikely manoloana ahy miaraka amin'ilay maska manjavonjavona ireo vato, tahaka ny hoe midina anaty tanàna haolo sy very iny aho.

Nilomano nankeo amin'ny ARMS maromaro aho, izay nisy vatohara madinika mitombo toy ny sampan-kazo amin'ny hazo bonsai. Takalo (poisson coffre), Lafo (poisson lion), ary bodoloha kely (poisson perroquet) — izay antsoina toy izany noho ny vavany manakaiky ny an'ny vorona — dia nivezivezy nanodidina. Sendra nisy fay (raie) niseho avy tao amin'ny rano manjavozavo iny ary nandalo teo anoloako, dia nanjavona indray avy eo. Tamin'io fotoana io, nahatsapa aho fa simba loatra ny tontolo iainana ka tsy maintsy manomboka manangana izay efa rava indray isika. Soa ihany amin'ity indray mitoraka ity fa toa mandeha tsara io fomba fananganana io.

“Manao tsara ny asany izy,” hoy i Little, mpikaroka efa nahavite ‘doctorat' ao amin'ny Oniversiten'i Harvard sy ao amin'ny Scripps Institute of Oceanography, rehefa tafakatra teo amin'ny vedety izahay. “Be dia be ny zava-manan'aina ao.”

Amin'ny taona ho avy vitsivitsy, ekipa iray ahitana mpikaroka eto an-toerana sy vahiny no hanao fikarohana momba ny fiantraikan'ireo haran-dranomasina noforonina amin'ny fiainan'ny zavaboary an-dranomasina sy ny asa fanjonoana eto — ary koa ny fiantraikan'izany amin'ny fahasalamana ara-batana sy ara-tsaina amin'ny olona monina amin'ireo tanàna manodidina. Araka ny fanazavan'i Chris Golden, mpikaroka momba ny sakafo sy ny fahasalamana iraisam-pirenena ao amin'ny Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health sady anisan'ireo mandray anjara akaiky amin'ny tetikasa, dia isan'ny fikarohana lehibe indrindra eran-tany mampifandray ny fahasalaman'ny tontolo iainana sy ny fahasalaman'olombelona izany.

Ny tanjon'ity fikarohana ity, hoy i Golden, dia “ny hahafantarana raha toa ka ny fikajiana ireo loharanon-karena voajanahary amin'ity fomba ity dia afaka manampy miaraka amin'ny fanatsarana ny tontolo iainana sy ny fahasalaman'ny olona, ny sakafo, ary ny fiarovana ara-tsakafo.”



Tsy haiko ny tsy hahatsapa fa mbola tsy ampy lavitra izany. Raha mitohy ny fitombon'ny fanjonoana — na ny isan'ny mponina eny amin'ny morontsiraka — dia tsy hahavita hanatsara vokatry ny jono ireo haran-dranomasina voatr'olombelona (artifisialy) vitsivitsy ireo. Na dia ireo siantifika mandray anjara amin'io tetikasa io aza dia mahafantatra ny fetran'izany. “Raha amina toe-javatra mivelatra kokoa dia tsy mahomby izy io,” hoy i Gildas Todinanahary, talen'ny IHSM ao amin'ny Oniversiten'i Toliara, izay miara-miasa akaiky amin'i Gibbons.

Ny tena fomba hampaharitra ny haran-dranomasina sy ny fanjonoana dia ny fanomezana loharanom-bola hafa ho an'ny olona eny amin'ny morontsiraka, hoy i Gildas tamiko. Izany hoe, ny fampiasam-bola amin'ny fanabeazana, mba hianaran'ny olona fahaiza-manao vaovao, toy ny fambolena mahatanty ny fiovan'ny toetrandro. Na koa hoe, ny fananganana indostria hafa izay tsy miankina amin'ny fitrandrahana. Mila fiovana lehibe be ny firenena mba hahombiazan'ny fiarovana. Mila fitantanana tsara izany, ary amin'izao fotoana izao dia mbola tsy manana govrnementa akory i Madagasikara. Saingy hoy ihany i Todinanahary, efa nampiditra vola an-tapitrisany dolara ho an'ny tetikasa fiarovana tontolo iainana ny ONG sy ny fikambanana mpanampy. “Mety ahoana indray raha natao tamin'ny fanabeazana sy ny fahasalamana io vola io?” hoy izy. Indraindray, ny fiarovana mahomby dia tsy mitovy amin'ny fiarovana amin'ny endriny mahazatra.

Farany, izay hitako tao amin'ny Helodranon'ny Ranobe dia ratsy kokoa noho izay nieritreretako azy. Indraindray dia toy ny nijery krizy ara-tontolo iainana sy ara-pivelomana mitranga mivantana. Saingy i Gibbons, i Gildas, ary ireo siantifika Malagasy marobe manan-talenta dia mbola manam-panantenana sy miezaka manarina ny jono — satria tena efa atahorana ny toe-javatra.

Rehefa anisan'io fiarahamonina io ianao, dia mahatsiaro ho tompon'andraikitra ao, ary izany no mahatonga ny tena tsy mahavita ny fitazanam-potsiny.

Ary tsy dia tsy misy dikany akory izany. Mbola afaka sitrana ny haran-dranomasina sy ny fanjonoana tohanany. Mbola misy aina.

Rehefa avy nijibika tao amin'ny hara artifisialy izahay, dia nitondra ahy tao amin'ny hara voajanahary iray, antsoina hoe Vatosoa, i Little. Taona vitsivitsy lasa izay, ny ReefDoctor dia nanangana hara artifisialy kely iray teo akaikin'ity hara voajanahary ity mba hanjonoan'olona. Tambin'izany anefa, ireo mpanjono eo an-toerana dia nanaiky tsy hanjono ao amin'ny Vatosoa, hoy i Gibbons tamiko.

Kely ny fanantenako, indrindra rehefa avy nijibika tamin'ireo hara tsy nisy trondro. Nefa nahatalanjona ilay izy. Ilay haran-dranomasina dia fitambaran'ny hara izay, rehefa mitombo dia manana endrika takelaka manify mifanindry toy ny ravin'ny voninkazo raozy. Ary nisy an-jatony teo amin'izy ireny nifampitohitohy, ka toy ny hoe nilomano teo ambonin'ny voninkazo lehibe iray izahay.

Nanjavonjavona hatrany ny maska nanaovako, izay tena manelingelina, ka nofenoiko ranomasina tao anatiny ary nodioviko matetika. Rehefa afaka nijery mazava indray aho, dia nahita zavatra nitsingevana teo anoloako. Toy ny ahi-dranomasina ilay izy, saingy toa nifatotra tamin'ny vatana Angisy (calmar), biby an-dranomasina iray misy tanana valo sy “tentacule” roa.

Malaza amin'ny fahaizany manafina tena amin'ny loko sy endrika izy, ary toa nampiasa ny tanany mba hitovy amin'ny poti-javatra an-dranomasina. Rehefa nanakaiky aho dia nihemotra tsikelikely izy. Rehefa avy teo, angamba rehefa fantany fa nisy nahatsikaritra ihany izy, dia nanova loko ary nandositra haingana.

“Ny fanantenana mba hiverenan'ny hatsarany dia mbola misy,” hoy i Gibbons tamiko indray hariva, raha nandeha teny amoron-dranomasina izahay tamin'ny filentehan'ny masoandro, sady nijery tsara ny lalana mba tsy hanitsaka akorandriaka maranitra. “Mbola manankarena zavaboary betsaka ireo toeram-panjonoana ireo. Tsy hijanona ao mandrakizay izany, fa amin'izao aloha dia mbola ao izy.”

From Maldives to the Democratic Republic of Congo, there has been stunning progress in tackling diseases.

It's not an exaggeration to say that hope is in short supply these days in global health. The steep cuts to lifesaving global health programs, the burning of emergency food supplies, the renewed politicization of vaccines are just a few of the bleak developments that have happened since the start of the year.

But that narrow view misses the quiet progress happening around the world.

Just last week, the Maldives — a tiny archipelago in the Arabian Sea — became the first country in the world to eliminate the transmission of hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis from mother to child. That's no small feat. Across Southeast Asia, thousands of pregnant women still pass on these infections to their babies each year. Hepatitis B alone affects more than 42 million people in the region, according to the World Health Organization.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

For one country to shut down the transmission of all three is a genuine public-health moonshot.

That was possible because of the country's universal health coverage, which has enabled almost every expectant mother to receive antenatal care during her pregnancy that includes a test for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B. And over 95 percent of newborns in the country receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of delivery. (Meanwhile, the US is pushing to delay that childhood dose of hepatitis B.) The Maldives also spends about 10 percent of its GDP on health — among the highest in Asia — a number that's climbed steadily since it introduced universal health coverage in 2012. (My colleague, Dylan Scott, has written about how other countries make universal health care work, and what the US can learn from it.)

It's a remarkable achievement for a small island nation with limited resources. “This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal,” WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press release.

But even countries that don't spend 10 percent of their GDP on health are making meaningful progress to stop deadly infectious diseases.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that has faced recurring Ebola outbreaks since the late 1970s, has managed to swiftly get its latest one under control. The latest outbreak, declared on September 4, infected 64 people and killed 43.

But on Sunday, the WHO announced that the country's last patient had been discharged. There have been no new cases since September 25 — a notably quick containment for a virus that, in past outbreaks, has lingered for months.

Containing the virus wasn't easy, as the outbreak largely unfolded in remote, rural communities. Yet the response from local health workers and teams from the WHO kept it from spreading further. Now, a 42-day countdown — twice Ebola's 21-day incubation period, long enough to be sure no new infections emerge — is underway. If no new cases emerge during that window, the outbreak will be officially declared over.

There's progress too, against lesser-known but equally consequential infectious diseases.

Fiji, an island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, recently became the 26th country to eliminate trachoma, a bacterial infection that affects the inner layer of the eyelid and can lead to permanent blindness if untreated. (In 2021, trachoma blinded an estimated 400,000 people globally.)

The win didn't come out of nowhere. Since 2012, researchers with the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, funded in part by USAID, have surveyed over 2.6 million people across 35 countries to pinpoint where trachoma infections still persist. That data has allowed countries to target antibiotics to high-risk populations, improve access to clean water and sanitation, expand access to surgery, and to promote hygiene education. Fiji used the same set of strategies to join the growing list of countries free of trachoma.

Maldives, Congo, and Fiji are vastly different countries — in geography, resources, and the diseases they face — but together they tell a hopeful story in global public health: With a sustained investment in health, the political will to match, and relentless community-level work, progress against even the most persistent problems is possible.

Business Insider Edition 

Cameroon's long-serving leader Paul Biya is edging closer to an unprecedented milestone that could see him become the first sitting president in modern history to celebrate his 100th birthday while still in office


        As Cameroon awaits its official presidential election results, Paul Biya appears on track to secure yet another seven-year term, one that could see him become the first president in modern history to reach 100 years old while still in office.
    


Xinhua reported that Cameroon's National Commission for the Final Counting of Votes handed over the tentative results of the Oct. 12 presidential election to the Constitutional Council on Tuesday in Yaoundé.
    


        Though not officially released, sources from the commission and Jeune Afrique indicated that President Paul Biya led with 53–54% of the votes, ahead of opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who secured about 35%.
    


        Born on February 13, 1933, Biya has ruled Cameroon since 1982, a tenure spanning over four decades. His current term, which began after the 2018 election, officially ends later this year.
    


        Should he win re-election, his next term would run from late 2025 through late 2032, meaning he would be 99 years old when it concludes and just months shy of turning 100 in February 2033.
    


        However, if the inauguration or term timeline extends into early 2026, Biya could remain in office long enough to mark his 100th birthday while still president; otherwise, he would turn 100 shortly after leaving office.
    


        His longevity in power, and now in life, makes him not only Africa's oldest sitting leader but one of the longest-reigning in the world.
    


        Biya's re-election, however, has not been without fierce opposition, following recent outbursts led by opposition candidate Tchiroma Bakary.
    


        Once a close ally of Biya and his spokesman for two decades, Tchiroma had emerged as the main challenger in the election.
    


        Bakary declared himself the winner of Cameroon's 12 October presidential election shortly after the exercise, claiming victory.
    


        Tchiroma's declaration, made in a five-minute video posted on social media, drew swift condemnation from the government and Biya's ruling party, who described the move as “illegal.”
    


        The government reiterated that only results announced by the Constitutional Council could be considered official.
    


        Apart from main opposition contender Tchiroma Bakary, President Paul Biya is also facing dissent from within his own household. In a viral TikTok video, his 27-year-old daughter Brenda Biya shocked Cameroonians by declaring she would not vote for him in the October 12 election.
    


        “Do not vote for Paul Biya, not because of me, but because he has made too many people suffer,” she said, adding, “I hope we will have another president,” before announcing she was cutting ties with her family and their financial support.
    


        The council has until 27 October to declare the winner.
    


        Tchiroma, 76, vowed to “defend” what he called his victory, raising fears of unrest in the Central African nation.
    


        If Biya clinches another victory, it will extend a reign that has defined Cameroon's political life for more than half a century. Under his watch, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) has maintained an iron grip on power, thanks to constitutional amendments, strong state control, and a fragmented opposition.



        In 2008, Cameroon's parliament abolished presidential term limits, paving the way for Biya to contest indefinitely. Supporters describe him as a symbol of stability in a volatile region, while critics argue that his extended rule has come at the cost of democratic renewal and economic innovation.



        Biya's possible re-election would carry global symbolism, a 92-year-old leader extending his mandate into his late 90s, governing a youthful nation where the median age is just 18.
    


        For many Cameroonians, the moment is both historic and uncertain, raising questions about the future of leadership in one of Africa's longest-standing regimes.

The generative AI boom has fueled the growth of single-person startups and companies operating without external funding.

For Amazon Web Services, these ""solopreneurs"" and bootstrapped startups have emerged as a ""blind spot"" in its customer discovery process, which heavily relies on connections with venture capital firms, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.

This has caused AWS to miss out on several high-growth startups as early customers, including SurgeAI and Base44. SurgeAI grew to $1 billion in revenue without outside funding, while Base44, once solely owned by its founder, was acquired by Wix for $80 million.

""This blind spot poses increasing risk to cloud market share,"" Amazon employees warned in the internal document.

Amazon became the dominant cloud provider by working with early startups. Some of these nascent businesses grew into huge tech companies that spent heavily on compute, which drove demand for Amazon Web Services.

The rise of generative AI is messing with this successful formula. This new technology helps some startups get going with fewer employees. That means they sometimes need to raise less money. These smaller, often self-funded, businesses look from the outside like less interesting cloud customers, when in fact they may retain the ability to grow into substantial enterprises.

This is part of a broader challenge for AWS, which is seeing a ""fundamental"" shift in how AI startups spend on cloud computing, Business Insider previously reported.

An Amazon spokesperson said it's ""not true"" that the company is missing early signals of fast-growth startups, adding that the company continues to ""engage founders as early as we can, in collaboration with VCs, via programs like AWS GenAI Accelerator and AWS Activate.""

To tackle the issue, AWS intends to adjust its VC-driven discovery approach to add a more data-driven prediction model designed to spot promising startups at an earlier stage, according to the internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider.

AWS can't risk losing this market. A growing number of startups are run by a single employee, driven by AI's efficiency gains. Replit's CEO Amjad Masad previously said the era of solo software creation has arrived, saying anyone can build an app in a few hours with the right AI prompt. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted last year that a ""one-person billion-dollar company"" would emerge because of AI.

David Levy, a former manager on AWS' startup business development team, wrote in a blog post this week that AWS intentionally focused on founders early in their journeys to secure them as long-term customers. That approach accelerated AWS growth and led to roughly 70% adoption among startups backed by top-tier venture capital firms, he noted.

But that's beginning to shift. Levy wrote that AI startups are now directing their initial spending toward GPUs, AI models, and inference tools, rather than traditional cloud compute or storage services, citing Business Insider's earlier report. Those are areas where no single cloud provider holds dominance, creating fresh challenges for vendors such as AWS.

""AWS built an empire by chasing startups everyone else ignored,"" Levy wrote. ""Now they're the ones being out-hustled by the next wave of builders.""

In 2022, when Yoni Rechtman's boss asked where he wanted to be in five years, the newly hired venture capitalist told him, ""Not here.""

What might have sounded like defiance was exactly what Kevin Colleran, managing director of Slow Ventures, wanted to hear. The firm doesn't promote from within. It keeps funds small — ""easier to return many multiples of success,"" Colleran said — and so the firm needs fewer investors.

This month, Slow made an exception to its rule, giving Rechtman, 30, a seat at the partners' table.

The firm, now nearing $1 billion in investor capital, has four partners investing out of its core seed funds. Colleran says Rechtman is the first principal to be promoted to partner for those funds in 10 years; Megan Lightcap made partner in 2024 to co-lead the firm's creator-focused fund.

It's a precarious time for junior venture capitalists. Many came of age during the frothy post-pandemic boom, when deal flow was brisk, valuations soared, and portfolio companies seemed to double in value every few months. Then the market cooled and funds pulled back.

Suddenly, midlevel investors had fewer chances to prove themselves, and some of their once-glittering deals now looked painfully overpriced. The path to partnership, already murky, became even narrower. Some disillusioned investors left the industry altogether.

Back in 2022, Rechtman assumed he'd eventually leave Slow to raise his own fund. Plans changed, and not, he says, because the market soured. Through September, 68 debut funds closed, versus 183 in all of last year, per PitchBook. Emerging managers are also taking twice as long to raise their next funds — a headwind that would give any investor pause.

Rechtman says he's staying for a simpler reason. The job's not finished.

Early on, Slow general partner and early Facebook executive Sam Lessin gave Rechtman this advice: ""Fish in waters where other firms aren't fishing."" Rechtman took it somewhat literally.

This year, he grabbed a last-minute flight to Tampa to reconnect with a startup billing itself as ""Uber for heavy-equipment repair."" Founded in 2020, Heave has quietly assembled a network that it claims covers nearly a third of the country's heavy-machinery mechanics.

Rechtman closed a handshake deal with the founder over smoked fish, and Slow joined its $7 million seed round, which was announced in August. It's the kind of off-beat, unsexy bet that has become Rechtman's calling card.

That approach has nudged Slow into areas it might have otherwise overlooked, such as healthcare, growth buyouts, and what Rechtman calls ""real-world businesses."" This spring, Slow backed SuperDial, which builds voice agents for healthcare organizations and has already handled more than 1 million calls. Colleran said Rechtman also worked with him to close Journey, a travel rewards platform created by Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy.

Slow doesn't vote by unanimity. It runs on a simple rule: any two partners can greenlight a deal. Decision-making power is flat. ""Because we are small and we trust each other, if two people like an idea, that's good enough,"" Colleran said.

Colleran, now in his forties, calls Rechtman a ""younger and hungrier"" network-builder. Rechtman hosts a twice-yearly mini-conference for young partners, principals, and emerging managers, and says a meaningful share of his deals now come through that circle.

He's also built an audience by publishing. He's written a weekly Substack for more than a year and says he has roughly 15,000 subscribers. Rechtman said if investors want credibility with founders on weird, non-consensus ideas, they have to put their thinking in public. ""Frankly, I have a style that either attracts or repels founders,"" he said.

Instead of leaving Slow to raise a debut fund, Rechtman says he now sees a path to help build a differentiated franchise from inside a partnership.

As a Brooklyn native, he wants to do it from New York. The city is awash in seed checks, he says, but starved for growth capital to scale the most promising hometown companies.

Slow has raised three opportunity funds, totaling $295 million, to join later rounds for its top performers. This gives Rechtman a way to keep backing breakouts rather than watching them migrate to out-of-town investment firms.

""When something takes off in New York, other people make the money,"" Rechtman said. ""I see an opportunity to change that.""

When Nikki Ashkar and her husband Mike baked her grandmother's cinnamon buns for the first time, they didn't plan to start a million-dollar business.

Five years later, however, their small business, Mav's Top Buns, has sold over half a million cinnamon buns. Since the start of 2024, it has generated more than $1 million, according to sales report records reviewed by Business Insider.

""We went from selling cinnamon buns from a U-Haul truck to making over $1 million in about a year,"" Nikki told BI's Rachel Cohn.

Today, they bake the buns at a bakery in New Jersey. At $10 a bun, the price isn't cheap, but neither is the labor. ""You've got to know your worth,"" Nikki said.

The dough rests for 72 hours before hitting the oven. The frosting, a secret ratio of vanilla bean to cream cheese, is applied twice. ""We ice every single nook and cranny,"" Nikki said, adding, ""So that you never miss a good bite.""

Coming from a marketing background, Nikki knew that branding was as essential as the recipe itself. She didn't want to call the business ""Mike and Nikki's buns.""

Ultimately, they chose the name ""Mav's Top Buns,"" named after her firstborn son, Maverick. From the start, she positioned the business as the ""best cinnamon buns in New Jersey.""

""We truly believe that,"" Nikki said, adding, ""When you believe something so intrinsically about your product and what you bring to the table, you become that.""

Nikki said they have never paid for marketing or influencer promotions. Instead, their own social media accounts helped drive growth.

For example, Nikki began posting photos and videos on the business's Instagram account in 2020, some of which have since gone viral. One of her first viral posts racked up 80,000 likes.

""At first I was kind of offended,"" she said of the viral video's angry comments at how she was holding the bun. ""But as we grew and as we got more viral, it just became one of those things where the more viral you get, the more people are going to comment whatever they want to comment, and it's good for the algorithm, it's good for us.""

One of the account's most viral posts features standard visuals but pairs them with an edgy audio clip that includes some profanity.

Nikki said she hesitated before posting it, worried it might be too bold for a family business. However, the post felt authentic to her. ""People related to things a lot when we were just authentically ourselves.""

It's not like the Insta page is filled with edgy content, however. Other posts showcase the couple's quirky personality through delicious-looking cinnamon buns accompanied by metal music and rap, and some dancing videos.

Nikki opened the bakery while eight months pregnant, balancing a newborn, late-night bakes, and long lines of customers. Mav's Top Buns now produces up to 1,000 buns a day during peak weekends, she said.

Behind the scenes, Nikki and Mike juggle the demands of entrepreneurship and parenthood.

""I think that's what people really grabbed onto, and that's why they love to support us because they know how hard a mom and dad work,"" Nikki said.

When asked what keeps her going through burnout and sleepless nights, Nikki credited perseverance and authenticity.

""Sometimes we'd lose power and we'd roll buns by candlelight, but it was those times where it really separated the men from the boys, where if you keep going, you will succeed,"" she said.

Nikki said their three children are already mimicking the family trade, rolling Play-Doh into miniature buns at home.

In this article

Tech giant Alphabet is contributing $22 million to help build the White House ballroom under a legal settlement reached with President Donald Trump last month over his being banned from the company's YouTube platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by his supporters.

Images showing the demolition of part of the White House's East Wing to prepare for building the ballroom triggered public anger this week.

The demolition work has raised questions about who is footing the bill for the planned $250 million, 90,000 square-foot building.

The Google parent Alphabet's contribution in the form of the settlement, which was recorded in Oakland, California, federal court, represents nearly 10% of the estimated construction costs.

The settlement notes that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf ""to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.""

Trump, who in July promised that the East Wing's structure would not be touched to build the ballroom, has promised that American taxpayers will not pay for the ballroom.

Trump has said that he and private donors will cover the costs.

""The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly,"" the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social Monday.

But it is still unclear who all the other contributors are and how much they have agreed to pay for the ballroom's construction. Sources told CBS News in September that R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy have donated. CNBC has reached out to these companies for comment. 

Trump chose McCrery Architects to design the ballroom. The construction team is led by Clark Construction and the engineering team is headed by AECOM, according to a White House statement from July. 

In July, Trump promised construction of the ballroom ""won't interfere with the current building.""

""It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,"" Trump said of the East Wing at the time.

The Treasury Department banned its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing, saying this would pose a potential security risk. The department is located next to the White House with a clear view of the demolition work.

The White House has dismissed the anger as ""manufactured outrage.""

Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom. It is not clear how much Comcast is contributing. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.

In this article

Meta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.

The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit and other product-related positions will be impacted.

Axios was first to report the layoffs.

Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a ""non-working notice period.""

""During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,"" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. ""You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.""

The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, ""minus your notice period.""

Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.

Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will ""result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.""

Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.

On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a ""significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,"" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.

In this article

NEW YORK — General Motors is targeting a suite of new software initiatives for its vehicles over the next three years, including an in-vehicle artificial intelligence assistant from Google and a driver-assistance system that can largely control the vehicle without human interaction or monitoring.

GM said the conversational Google Gemini AI will begin launching in its vehicles next year, followed by the new driver-assistance system, which will allow drivers to be hands-free and take their eyes off the road under certain circumstances, in 2028.

GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives made the announcements Wednesday as part of a ""GM Forward"" software event that also showcased other initiatives designed to ""transform the car from a mode of transportation into an intelligent assistant,"" the automaker said.

The company also announced that it is working on a new centralized computing platform, which is planned to roll out starting with the Escalade IQ in 2028; increased use of collaborative robots, also known as cobots, that can work alongside humans; and expanding availability of products from its GM Energy business.

""Today we'll share our vision for our vehicles, our industry and how we're driving the future of transportation forward,"" Barra said to kick off the event in lower Manhattan.

GM said the announcements are meant to usher in a ""new era of mobility"" for the company, which has struggled to achieve such initiatives in the past. Its previous efforts at moving forward include announcing plans in 2021 to double revenue by 2030, led by many now-defunct growth businesses, as well as growing annual software and services revenue to between $20 billion to $25 billion.

In recent years, it also killed an ""Ultra Cruise"" system meant to be able to drive in 95% of circumstances that was initially due to come out in 2023 and folded its Cruise robotaxi business.

GM executives on Wednesday declined to discuss revenue potential of the new announcements. CFO Paul Jacobson has previously walked back the doubling revenue goal, but has noted the company's growing revenue, up 9.1% last year to $187.44 billion.

GM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday said the company's revenue plans are ""pretty much on track … maybe a year or two different"" as it plans to continue to grow revenue, especially with the technologies announced Wednesday. He also said these initiatives are ""very different"" than prior announcements, as they're tangible products that are entering the market shortly.

As of the third quarter of this year, GM recognized $2 billion from software services. That's up from 2021, when the plans were announced, when it took the full year to hit that mark. It also cited $5 billion in deferred revenue, up 90% from a year earlier, to end the third quarter.

The event comes a day after GM reported standout third-quarter earnings and upped its guidance, pushing the stock to have its second-best day on record since the automaker's 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.

GM stock on Wednesday was trading relatively flat.

GM said the AI system from Google, which its infotainment system is developed on, will make ""it possible to talk to your car as naturally as you would to a fellow passenger.""

""Our vision is to create a car that knows you, that looks out for you, and just meets your needs, even before you say,"" Sterling Anderson, GM chief product officer, said during the event.

Anderson called the centralized computing a ""foundational piece"" of the company's plans in increasing the capabilities of its vehicles.

The Detroit automaker said it expects to update select vehicles from the 2016 model year to all new models in the U.S. beginning next year with the AI tech.

GM also said it plans to develop its own ""AI, custom-built"" technology in the years to come but did not provide an exact timeframe.

""In the future, we will introduce our own AI fine-tuned to your vehicle,"" said David Richardson, a former Apple executive who is now GM vice president of software and services engineering. ""Think of this as an assistant. It's going to anticipate your needs, offer timely help and make every journey more personable and more enjoyable.""

GM said it plans for its upgraded advanced driver-assistance system, also known as ADAS, to feature hands-free, ""eyes-off"" driving technology, beginning on the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV, which currently starts around $127,500, in 2028.

The automaker then expects to expand the availability of the tech to other models, company executives said.

""Autonomy will make our roads safer. They'll give customers back their most valuable asset: time. It'll be a cornerstone of GM product portfolio going forward,"" Anderson said.

The vehicle will use lidar, or light detection and ranging, systems that allow the vehicle to better detect or ""see"" its surroundings. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has notably been a critic of the technology, and his company's vehicles rely on camera-based systems and computer vision.

""Just be clear, we're developing a self driving product,"" Anderson, a former Tesla executive, told CNBC. ""It's an eyes-off, self-driving system. As it relates to use of lidar in it, your product will be better with multiple modes of sensing, period. Full stop.""

Anderson, calling it an ""ocean that's too big to boil,"" said the system is expected to evolve incrementally to its full potential.

GM declined to say whether the new technology will be called ""Super Cruise,"" which is its current system that allows drivers to be hands-free on 600,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in North America.

The current Super Cruise system monitors a driver's attentiveness through the use of sensors and eye-detection cameras.

GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016, but it was slow to roll out the technology until recent years.

Barra said the roll out of the new system will be significantly faster than the company's initial expansion of Super Cruise.

Starting in 2026, GM said it will make its ""Energy Home System"" — which includes bi-directional electric vehicle charging and a stationary home battery — available via leasing, compared with outright purchasing the equipment.

The leasing will begin with GM all-electric vehicles owners and later roll out to other homeowners interested in backup power and solar integration, the company said.

GM Energy launched in 2022 as one of the automaker's growth initiatives involving EVs. It was started to rival Tesla's home energy systems and provide battery packs, EV chargers and software to help customers optimize charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.

GM has not disclosed the size or revenue of its GM Energy business other than a blog by Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, that said momentum for its services are growing.

""It's really incredible to see all the great things that are right on the horizon, and I know we will deliver for our customers, and that's what matters most,"" Barra said. ""This moment builds on our history and sets the course.""

In this article

Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected three Paramount Skydance takeover offers as it fields broad buyout interest, CNBC's David Faber reported Wednesday, citing sources.

Paramount's last offer was for just under $24 per share and was comprised of 80% cash, according to Faber, who previously reported a bid could come in at between $22 and $24 per share.

Reuters on Tuesday reported WBD had rejected a bid for nearly $24 per share.

WBD said on Tuesday that it had received ""unsolicited interest"" from multiple parties and that it would expand its strategic review process to review all bids. At the same time, the company is moving ahead with previously announced plans to separate into two entities: a streaming and studios business and a global networks business.

Faber reported Tuesday that Netflix and Comcast were among the interested parties.

""It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,"" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in a statement Tuesday. ""After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,"" he said.

Shares of WBD gained almost 11% on Tuesday. They were up another 1% in morning trading Wednesday.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Beyond Meat shares slashed gains Wednesday, briefly dipping into negative territory as the meme stock rally faltered.

The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages rose just 15% in midday trading Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. The stock reached a high of $7.69 during the session, after closing Tuesday at $3.62. It was last above $4, up 14%.

It's the latest in an extraordinary week for the company. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).

That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short.

On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores.

Shares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the name soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The shares have slid in each of the last five years, falling more than 47% in 2021, 81% in 2022, 27% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. The name is down more than 3% in 2025.

The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal.

This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took on online message boards such as Reddit's WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades.

In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses.

The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible artificial intelligence bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. It revived it earlier this month as retail traders dove back into the bull market.

In response to someone on WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote Wednesday, ""Youre already down 7k, impressive.""

Another posted: ""You know the economy is cooked when BYND stock is making a comeback.""

German auto giant Volkswagen on Wednesday warned of temporary production outages citing China's export restrictions on semiconductors made by Nexperia.

The update comes shortly after the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, said the China-Netherlands dispute over Nexperia could lead to ""significant production restrictions in the near future"" if the supply interruption of chips cannot be swiftly resolved.

A spokesperson for Volkswagen told CNBC by email that while Nexperia is not a direct supplier of the company, some Nexperia parts are used in its vehicle components, which are supplied by Volkswagen's direct suppliers.

""We are in close contact with all relevant stakeholders in light of the current situation to identify potential risks at an early stage and to be able to make decisions regarding any necessary measures,"" a Volkswagen spokesperson said, noting that the firm's production is currently unaffected.

""However, given the evolving circumstances, short-term effects on production cannot be ruled out,"" they added.

Shares of Volkswagen traded 2.2% lower at 2 p.m. London time (9 a.m. ET).

Last month, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned semiconductor maker based in the Netherlands, in what was seen as a highly unusual move.

The Dutch government seized control of the company, which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries, citing fears the firm's tech ""would become unavailable in an emergency.""

China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm among Europe's auto industry.

A spokesperson for Germany's Economy Ministry said the government is concerned about chip supply chain difficulties, according to Reuters.

BEIJING — Chinese tech giant Baidu announced Wednesday that its robotaxi unit will start test drives in Switzerland in December, as firms race to get their vehicles on European roads.   

The company's Apollo Go unit will work with Swiss public transit operator PostBus through a strategic partnership, Baidu said.

By the first quarter of 2027, the companies aim to begin operating a public-facing fully driverless taxi service called ""AmiGo"" that uses Apollo Go's RT6 electric vehicles, the press release said. Baidu added that once the robotaxis are up and running, the operators plan to remove the cars' steering wheels.

Plans to start tests in December are the most concrete steps Baidu has announced so far in getting its robotaxis on public roads in Europe.

The Chinese tech company said in August that it would partner with U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft to deploy robotaxis in the U.K. and Germany starting in 2026. A month earlier, Baidu announced a partnership with Uber to deploy Apollo Go robotaxis on the ride-hailing platform outside the U.S. and mainland China later in the year.

Other robotaxi companies are also racing to expand into Europe and the Middle East, after building up operations in the U.S. and China.

On Friday, Chinese robotaxi operator Pony.ai announced it will work with Stellantis to begin tests in Luxembourg in the coming months, before expanding to other European cities next year.

U.S. rival Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet, last week also announced plans to start tests in London before launching the self-driving taxi service there next year. Uber in June said it would start trials in spring 2026 of fully autonomous rides in the U.K. with SoftBank-backed self-driving tech startup Wayve.

In this article

A group of prominent figures, including artificial intelligence and technology experts, has called for an end to efforts to create 'superintelligence' — a form of AI that would surpass humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. 

Over 850 people, including tech leaders like Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, signed a statement published Wednesday calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. 

The list of signatories was notably topped by prominent AI pioneers, including the computer scientists Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, who are widely considered ""godfathers"" of modern AI. Leading AI researchers like UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell also signed on. 

Superintelligence has become a buzzword in the AI world, as companies from Elon Musk's xAI to Sam Altman's OpenAI compete to release more advanced large language models. Meta notably has gone so far as to name its LLM division the 'Meta Superintelligence Labs.' 

But signatories of the recent statement warn that the prospect of superintelligence has ""raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.""

It called for a ban on developing superintelligence until there is strong public support for the technology and a scientific consensus that it can be built and controlled safely.

In addition to AI and tech figures, the names behind the statement came from a broad coalition ranging from academics, media personalities, religious leaders and a bipartisan group of former U.S. politicians and officials. 

Those retired officials included former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.

Meanwhile, Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck — influential media allies to U.S. President Donald Trump — were also prominently featured on the list.

Other high-profile signatories included the British royal family members Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as well as former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. As of Wednesday, the list was still growing.

There has been a growing divide in the tech space between those who see AI as a powerful force for good, warranting unfettered development, and those who believe it's dangerous and in need of more regulation. 

However, as noted by the 'Statement on Superintelligence' signatory website, even the leaders of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, such as Musk and Altman, have, in the past, warned about the dangers of superintelligence. 

Before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Altman wrote in a 2015 blog post that ""development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.""

Meanwhile, Elon Musk said on a podcast earlier this year that there was ""only a 20% chance of annihilation"" when discussing the risks of advanced AI surpassing human intelligence. 

The 'Statement on Superintelligence' cited a recent survey from the Future of Life Institute showing that only 5% of U.S. adults support ""the status quo of fast, unregulated"" superintelligence development. 

The survey of 2,000 American adults also found that a majority believe ""superhuman AI"" shouldn't be created until proven safe or controllable and want robust regulation on advanced AI. 

In a statement provided on the site, computer scientist Bengio said AI systems could surpass most individuals in most cognitive tasks within a few years. He added that while such advances could help solve global challenges, they also carry significant risks.

""To safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design AI systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,"" he said. 

""We also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future.""

The U.S. could substantially slash tariffs on Indian exports as the two countries near a trade deal that could see New Delhi cutting oil purchases from Russia, Indian media outlet Mint reported Wednesday.

As part of the trade deal, Washington could slash tariffs on Indian exports to 15%-16% from the current 50%, Mint reported citing three unnamed sources aware of the matter.

India is also considering raising its import quota for non-genetically modified corn from the U.S. — currently 0.5 million tonnes annually — even with a import duty of 15%, while pushing for a mechanism under which both sides can revisit tariffs and market access over time, the report said.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had received assurance from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call that New Delhi would scale back purchases of Russian oil.

""He's not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war end as much as I do. He wants to see the war end with Russia, Ukraine, and as you know, they're not going to be buying too much oil,"" Trump told reporters abroad Air Force One, while threatening that New Delhi would keep paying ""massive"" tariffs if it did not do so.

In a post on X on Wednesday morning local time, Modi confirmed the phone call with Trump, adding that he hoped the two countries continue to ""stand united against terrorism in all its forms,"" without mentioning India's stance on Russian oil.

Trump last week also said that Modi in a call had agreed to cut Russian oil purchases. India's foreign ministry spokesperson said the following day that he was not aware of any call between Trump and Modi.

On the question of cutting oil imports from Russia, the spokesperson said Thursday, ""India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.""

Russian oil has been one of the contentious issues in the prolonged bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and India. Trump in August levied an additional 25% tariff on exports from India as a ""penalty"" for its Russian oil purchases, taking overall duties to 50% and upending relations between the two countries.

Indian officials have argued that it if the country were to stop buying Russian oil, a plan must be put in place to stabilize energy markets, along with a contingency to fill the shortfall in supply if Russian barrels are taken off the market.

Both sides had agreed to boost bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 in a meeting in February before talks collapsed with India reportedly not agreeing to widen access to its vast agricultural and dairy sectors.

The U.S.-India relations further soured when Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, in a move seen as a signal to Trump of India's willingness to boost rather than cut ties with Moscow.

India has become the world's second largest buyer of Russian crude, trailing China, since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, importing 1.6 million barrels per day in the first half of this year, up from 50,000 bpd in 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In recent weeks, Trump has softened his rhetoric, expressing optimism about the ongoing negotiations and reiterating on Tuesday that Modi was a ""great friend.""

The finalization of the trade agreement will likely be communicated to Trump and Modi at the ASEAN summit later this month, though neither Trump nor Modi has officially confirmed their attendance for the event, Mint reported.

""The broad contours of the agreement are in place, but sensitive areas such as agriculture and energy need political clearance before the deal can be announced,"" the report said.

India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comments.

Data from government-backed India Brand Equity Foundation shows, bilateral trade between New Delhi and Washington reached a record $132.2 billion in fiscal year ending March 2025, up by more than 10% from the previous year.

India's exports to the U.S. jumped 11.6% to $86.51 billion, while imports from the country rose 8% to $45.69 billion.

Netflix's business leaders and investors probably aren't enjoying a soda pop after the release of its third-quarter results. While the company's revenue met expectations — though not beating them as it did the first and second quarters — earnings were taken down by a tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. Shares of Netflix fell around 6% in extended trading Tuesday stateside.

But it doesn't look like any other media company will dethrone Netflix as the king of streaming in the near term. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday it's open to a sale — and Netflix is reportedly an interested buyer — even as Warner Bros. is going ahead with its split into two companies in the meantime. Elsewhere, Comcast's NBCUniversal is currently spinning off its cable networks, which includes CNBC. Those moves suggest that legacy media is still finding its footing amid the era of streaming inaugurated by Netflix.

While there are many factors contributing to Netflix's golden status, its shows are likely the main protagonists. ""KPop Demon Hunters,"" released in June, was a smash hit. It's now the company's most-watched film, hitting 325 million views and surely played a huge role in Netflix's best ad sales quarter ever in the third quarter. Even as the streaming giant's earnings stumbled during that period, Netflix is still showing other media companies how it's done.

— CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.

India is close to a trade deal with U.S., local media reports. As part of the agreement, the White House could slash tariffs on New Delhi to 15%-16% from the current 50%, according to Indian media outlet Mint on Wednesday. India could also reduce oil purchases from Russia.

Netflix's third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. The miss was because of an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities, the company said. Revenue for the period was in line with estimates. Netflix added it is going ""all in"" on artificial intelligence.

Japan's exports return to growth in September. However, the 4.2% year-on-year increase, which snapped four months of declines, was below the 4.6% rise expected by a Reuters poll of economists. Shipments to Asia climbed 9.2% from a year earlier, while those to the U.S. fell 13.3%.

U.S. stocks trade mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record Tuesday stateside. The S&P 500, however, was flat and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.16%. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi led gains, rising around 1%.

[PRO] 'Buyback aristocrats' are outperforming the market. The term refers to companies that have reduced their share counts across a certain period of time — a portfolio of them has outperformed the equal-weight S&P 500 since 2012, according to Goldman Sachs.

Curtain falls on the era of big UK conglomerates

Unlike in the United States, conglomerates — giant companies owning numerous businesses across different sectors — have more or less died out in Britain. This was reinforced when last Friday Smiths Group, the FTSE-100 engineering company, announced a major disposal as it sheds its conglomerate status.

The Smiths break-up marks the end of an era in which conglomerates dominated the ranks of Britain's biggest companies. Yet traces of the old U.K. conglomerates are everywhere. 

— Ian King

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Netflix is ""all in"" on leveraging generative artificial intelligence on its streaming platform, according to the company, as AI continues to make its way into mainstream entertainment.

The comments came from Netflix's earnings report Tuesday, which highlighted AI as a major focus for the world's largest streaming service by subscriber count. 

""For many years now, [machine learning] and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology,"" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.

It added that generative AI presents a ""significant opportunity"" across its streaming platform, including improving its recommendations, ads business, and movies and TV content.

""We're empowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions and deliver even more impactful titles for members,"" the company said.

Netflix provided recent examples of this, noting its recently distributed film Happy Gilmore 2 used generative AI tools to help de-age characters. Meanwhile, producers for the Netflix series Billionaires' Bunker have used various generative AI tools during pre-production to explore wardrobe and set designs.

Netflix's comments come amid broader concerns in the entertainment and art world regarding the potential for AI to replace human workers and the technology's use of human-made content.  

Speaking during an earnings call, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos seemingly addressed those issues, noting that AI can enhance the overall TV and movie experience, but ""can't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not.""

""We're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster and in new ways — we're all in on that,"" Sarandos said. He added: ""We're not worried about AI replacing creativity."" 

However, many in the entertainment industry remain skeptical of AI and its growing presence in media. 

An upstart production studio called Particle6 recently faced massive backlash for its plan to create, design, manage and monetize AI-generated actors and talent, including from the media union SAG-AFTRA. 

SAG-AFTRA previously led a significant actors' strike in July 2023, amid a broader series of Hollywood labor disputes that saw concerns about the use of artificial intelligence brought to the forefront.

The strike lasted over 100 days before a tentative agreement was reached between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which included the establishment of contractual AI protections for film and TV performers for the first time.

To further encourage the responsible use of such AI tools, Netflix recently released a new AI-focused production guidance aimed at its creators.

Bitcoin price dropped from $114,000 yesterday to $108,000 today. 

Bitcoin price retreated to around $108,300 today after briefly touching $114,000 on Tuesday, while traditional safe-haven assets continued to slide.

Spot gold fell to as low as $4,034 per ounce, extending its sharp losses from earlier in the week, and silver remained down nearly 8%.

The moves follow remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, who announced plans for a “skinny master account” program that would allow eligible fintech and crypto firms limited access to the Fed's payment system — a step seen as integrating digital assets more directly into traditional finance.

Those Fed comments were made at the Federal Reserve's first-ever Payments Innovation Conference in Washington. Bitcoin initially jumped more than 5% to $114,000 during the event but has since retreated to around $108,000.

Market chatter on social media suggested that investors may be rotating out of precious metals and into bitcoin, echoing themes from Bitwise Asset Management's latest Crypto Market Compass report. 

Bitwise said a modest 3–4% shift of capital from gold into crypto could theoretically double Bitcoin's price, given the relative size difference between the two markets.

Just today, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick wrote that he expects Bitcoin to briefly drop below $100,000 due to trade war concerns but said the decline may be short-lived, noting that recent gold weakness has historically sparked quick Bitcoin rebounds.

Bitcoin prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi are emerging as real-time sentiment indicators for traders betting on future bitcoin prices. These platforms aggregate odds based on where participants think bitcoin will end the year.

Earlier in October, traders were predicting a $144,000 year-end price, but that has since dropped to around $129,000 as volatility and fear increased.

When the spot price trades well below forecasts, it typically signals fear and potential undervaluation; when it trades near or above forecasts, it suggests market euphoria and possible local tops. Adjusted for prediction volatility, the data shows that wide gaps between the two often coincide with market lows.

So right now, it's safe to say that prediction markets are flashing a contrarian “fear” signal.

While Polymarket claims 91% accuracy, removing outlier bets brings that figure closer to 71%. Interestingly, this ratio tends to move opposite the Fear and Greed Index — highlighting undervaluation during fear and overconfidence during greed.

Here's what happened","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/the-biggest-crypto-wipeout-was-led-not-by-bitcoin-but-much-smaller-tokens-heres-what-happened.html","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:40:57 GMT","



The crypto industry recently had one of its worst days ever. And while bitcoin and ether holders seem to have put some of the carnage behind them, traders of many lesser-known tokens are still feeling a lot of pain.

More than 1.6 million traders suffered a combined $19.37 billion erasure of leveraged positions over a 24-hour period beginning Friday, Oct. 10. That's the largest ever liquidation event tracked by crypto-focused data analytics firm CoinGlass. The wipeout marked a dark spot for the digital assets market in an otherwise strong year for cryptocurrencies that saw bitcoin and ether hit record highs. More than a week after the event, its ripples are being felt most in smaller coins.

Bitcoin and ether are trading between roughly 11% and 12% below their respective Oct. 10 highs, with the former token trading above its critical $100,000 resistance level and the latter hovering within striking distance of its key $4,000 price, according to a CNBC analysis of CoinMetrics data. Lesser-known coins such as XRP, solana, dogecoin and BNB are trading between 15% and 24% off their pre-liquidation crisis highs.

Bitcoin and ether's comparative resilience is largely due to the fact that the two largest cryptos by market capitalization are older and more well established than alternative digital assets, GSR head of content and special projects Frank Chaparro told CNBC.

""They're just bigger, more established assets, with ETFs and other structured products behind them,"" Chaparro said. ""The long-tail tokens are less mature, less liquid, and naturally more prone to volatility.""

Chaparro also noted that bitcoin and ether suffered less losses compared to alternative crypto-assets in this month's massive liquidation event.

Solana, dogecoin, XRP and BNB are often used for leveraged trading on centralized or decentralized exchanges. Midcap and small-cap digital assets fell between 60% and 80% at the peak of the liquidation event, while bitcoin and ether lost just 11% and 13%, according to crypto-focused market maker Wintermute.

""There's always been a lot of leverage in crypto,"" Fundstrat Global Advisors head of research Tom Lee said last week on CNBC. ""The volatility and leverage is what has drawn people into that space, especially when you get outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, [which] are generally not held on margin.""

Leverage refers to the funds traders borrow to open positions that are larger than the initial capital invested, or margin, that they put up front. A position is liquidated, or forcibly closed, when the collateral a trader used to secure that position is no longer sufficient to cover their losses.

The crypto wipeout came after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed earlier on Oct. 10 to impose ""massive"" tariffs on China, sending ripples across financial markets. And although fallout from major geopolitical announcements is par for the course in the digital assets market, traders suffered more in this instance due to the unwinding of many leveraged positions.

""You have effectively what's been described as a doom loop in which the initial price drop triggers some liquidations. And when you're unwinding those positions into an order book that's thin...the spot prices of the assets that are being unwound crater,"" Chaparro said.

Those price drops prompt crypto exchange's margin systems to view traders' collateral differently, leading to more positions being unwound, according to Chaparro. ""If you have one bitcoin as collateral when it's 100k, your collateral position is a lot different than when it's trading at 70k, and so then more accounts become under collateralized, and the cycle repeats itself.""

""You're pouring gasoline on fire in a way that's not the case in other highly leveraged markets,"" the executive said.

In the U.S. and abroad, there are now more ways for traders to gain exposure to crypto. Last year, the U.S. approved the launch of several spot bitcoin ETFs as well as exchange traded funds that track ether, with issuers later rolling out offerings boasting two- or three-times leverage on the tokens' movements.

Offshore, decentralized exchanges such as Hyperliquid and Binance Labs-linked Aster are becoming popular with traders that want to make bets on crypto with even more leverage. The former offers maximum leverage of 40-times for bitcoin and 25-times for ether, while Aster offers as much as 1,001x leverage, depending on the token.

Trading products with more leverage appeal to investors because they offer higher returns. However, with the potential for higher rewards comes even greater likelihood of losses, according to Zach Pandl, head of research at crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale.

""More leverage means more risk in every financial market,"" Pandl told CNBC.

On top of that, crypto's infrastructure for leveraged trading hasn't evolved to suit the market's particularities, Chaparro said.

""We have a 24/7 market that's built effectively on a nine-to-five exchange infrastructure. And, with crypto markets, you don't have the same traditional forces that can as easily prevent or remedy stress, like circuit breakers,"" Chaparro said.

""The liquidation event is a blip in the story of the functionality and utility of these underlying assets, but it's not a blip in terms of thinking about the fragile infrastructure of our offshore derivatives markets,"" he added.

Crypto researcher Molly White wrote in her blog that the Oct. 10 liquidation event could be a harbinger of things to come for the crypto market and beyond.

""The meltdown reminded us just how quickly crypto markets can unravel when an abrupt shock pierces the euphoria of traders who've been watching prices steadily rise, and seem to forget they can do anything else,"" crypto researcher Molly White said last Friday in the post. ""As crypto grows more interconnected with mainstream finance, future crashes will reach far more widely.""

Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, also noted the possibility that we ""see a big correction or bear market that is at least partly fueled by by large liquidations due to these leverage effects.""

But unlike White, Leon thinks traditional finance institutions' entrance into the cryptocurrency market could help counterbalance the effects of crypto-native players using massive amounts of leverage.

""There's bigger and bigger quantum of capital in the space controlled by players, as opposed to many small retail traders,"" Leon said. ""And as more institutional capital comes into this space, it mitigates some of that risk, because large institutions don't take on 50x leveraged positions … and they tend to hold longer.""

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (ETH) continues to face resistance at the $4,000 mark after multiple failed recovery attempts. Despite broader market stability, the second-largest cryptocurrency struggles to flip this key psychological level into support. 

The selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) remains a major obstacle, limiting Ethereum's ability to regain upward momentum.

Exchange net position data reveals a notable shift in trader behavior over the past 10 days. Outflows from exchanges, typically signaling accumulation, have dropped sharply. This slowdown suggests investors are pulling back from buying, reflecting uncertainty in Ethereum's near-term performance as the market digests recent price swings.

As outflows decline, inflows are gaining momentum, indicating more ETH is moving onto exchanges for potential selling. This shift often precedes increased bearish pressure, as traders look to secure profits or mitigate losses.

Ethereum's on-chain data highlights weakening macro momentum. The Age Consumed metric—an indicator of dormant coins being moved—recorded a significant spike within the past 24 hours. This surge marks the third-largest movement in over three months, suggesting that previously inactive long-term holders are beginning to sell their assets.

Such a rise in Age Consumed typically signals a wave of profit-taking or loss prevention. As LTHs move their holdings back into circulation, it shows growing impatience with stagnant prices.

Ethereum's price trades at $3,846 at press time, slipping below the $3,872 support level. The altcoin king has remained stuck under $4,000 for nearly a week, reflecting fading momentum and tightening volatility in the broader crypto market.

Given the prevailing selling pressure and weak inflows, Ethereum's price could fall further toward the $3,742 support zone. If this level fails to hold, a deeper correction could follow, pushing ETH down to $3,489. Such a decline would reinforce the current bearish outlook.

However, if Ethereum holders curb their selling and demand strengthens, ETH could rebound above $4,000. A decisive break of this resistance could lift prices toward $4,221, signaling renewed optimism and invalidating the prevailing bearish setup.

What to Know:

$XRP jumped a notable 3% on Monday, briefly touching the $2.50 mark before people started taking a bit of profit. But why the sudden excitement?

The main reason for the rise boils down to a classic case of risk appetite returning. For weeks, we've seen people nervously piling into defensive assets like gold. Well, that started to ease up today.



When gold slips, risk assets usually perk up, and that's exactly what happened. Even Bitcoin saw a modest uptick, helping set the mood.

As well as this, $XRP's had some other excellent tailwinds:

The surge was quick! $XRP blew up from $2.36 to a day high of $2.53 in a fast afternoon breakout, with trading volume absolutely spiking. That tells you the big institutional players were active.

Despite a slight retreat, $XRP quickly found solid footing around the $2.42-$2.45 zone.

The takeaway? For now, the $2.42 support level looks strong, despite falling at $2.38 now. If $XRP can finally close decisively at about $2.53, we could be looking at a run toward $2.63 next.

Keep an eye on those gold and Bitcoin trends; if they stay on their current course, $XRP might just keep climbing.

Let's face it: we all love Bitcoin, but trying to use it for anything fast is a nightmare of slow speeds and crazy high fees. That's what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to solve.

Think of it as putting a Ferrari engine into the most secure vault in the world. It's a game-changing Layer 2 network that integrates the hyper-fast Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), finally bringing real-world scalability to $BTC.



That means your Bitcoin isn't just a static store of value anymore; it's a dynamic asset ready for DeFi, fast payments, and NFTs. The proof is in the pudding: the project has already exploded, raising over $24M in its presale.

When you see whales piling in, buying up to $379.9K at a time, you know the smart money is moving. Plus, you can earn right away with dynamic staking rewards up to 48% APY. The Canonical Bridge ensures your original Bitcoin is locked securely while you transact at warp speed on the L2.

Our experts predict $HYPER reaching $0.02595 by the end of 2025, which is a possible 97% ROI if you invested at today's price. Hurry, though, as a price increase is coming in the next couple of days.

Tired of meme coins that are all hype and zero substance? Say hello to PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), the project that's revolutionizing the space by introducing a wildly fun mine-to-earn gaming model.

Forget the dusty, power-guzzling hardware of old-school mining. Here, you get to build and upgrade your own virtual nodes in a gamified, browser-based server room using the $PEPENODE token.



The best part is that the digital miners don't just sit there; they actively generate a mix of hot meme coins, including $PEPE and $PEPENODE itself. This is real passive income meets viral meme culture.

$PEPENODE's tokenomics are built to reward early movers and drive long-term value: they burn 70% of the tokens used to buy nodes, making $PEPENODE deflationary, and thus potentially increasing value over time.

The presale is closing in on $2M raised, offering early investors massive staking APYs up to 674%. These unique upgradeable nodes give you a powerful edge over later buyers, making early entry critical.

Our price prediction for $PEPENODE by the end of 2025 is $0.0031, giving you a potential ROI of 178%.

You know the name. BONK ($BONK) is more than just a dog-themed meme coin; it's the token that reignited the flame of the Solana community.

It started as a massive, fair-launch airdrop, immediately establishing itself as the ‘people's coin' and proving that fun and fair distribution can win.

Built on Solana's lightning-fast and cheap blockchain, $BONK is the perfect social currency, quick to move and affordable to use. But the real story is utility. $BONK has been integrated into over 350 projects across the Solana ecosystem.



We're talking DEXs, NFT marketplaces, and even games; it's everywhere. The project is governed by the BONK DAO, ensuring the community has a real voice, and mechanisms like BonkSwap keep the token relevant and in demand.

The recent setup of Bonk Inc. and its acquisition plan further signals a serious, long-term commitment to ecosystem growth and scarcity.

Unlike fly-by-night projects, $BONK has survived and thrived, demonstrating that it has the staying power to be a core part of the crypto landscape for years to come. $BONK isn't just a coin; it's a movement.

Recap: $XRP saw a sudden 3% jump, briefly hitting $2.50, driven by a shift from defensive assets like gold back into the broader, risk-on crypto market. This surge was increased by strong internal factors. Check out $HYPER, $PEPENODE, and $BONK as the next best crypto to buy now.

Bitcoin dominance has been the quiet story behind recent price action. After a low formed the week of September 8, dominance rose for six straight weeks. The metric broke above 60 percent and produced a sharp wick that surprised many traders. That move shows where capital may flow next.

What Bitcoin dominance means right now

Bitcoin dominance measures how much of the total crypto market value sits in Bitcoin. When dominance falls, money often moves into altcoins. When dominance rises, capital tends to return to Bitcoin. Right now dominance is testing a key zone. If it moves above the recent high, we should expect a clearer rotation toward Bitcoin.

Why this matters for altcoins

Analyst Benjamin Cowen said that many altcoins have been losing ground against Bitcoin. Some Bitcoin pairs hit new lows this cycle. That pattern matters because it changes how gains and losses show up for investors who hold alts instead of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin dominance climbs, altcoins can drop even while Bitcoin moves higher. That dynamic forces a different approach to risk and timing.

The ETH versus BTC factor

How Ethereum performs against Bitcoin will shape whether dominance can make a new high. If ETH puts in a higher low versus Bitcoin, dominance may struggle to break much higher. If ETH drops further, dominance has room to run. Watch ETH/BTC for clues on where rotation will go next.

Emotion and market narrative

A familiar cycle plays out in social channels. Analysts call for higher dominance. Creators who back microcaps push the opposite view. When dominance spikes, the critics get emotional. That pattern has repeated across cycles. The market does not care about pride. It only values clarity and evidence.

Timing matters more for altcoins

Buying low fee index funds does not require precise timing. Holding altcoins is different. Many altcoins act like penny stocks. If you buy them without timing, you can watch your position suffer for months or years. For traders in altcoins, entry and exit timing can determine outcomes more than conviction alone.

Lessons from past cycles

Past market resets have forced a cleanup. Weak leverage and poor projects exit the market. That process can clear the path for stronger networks to rally later. The same may happen now. Expect a selective cycle. Only a few durable projects will lead the next leg up.

FAQs

Bitcoin dominance shows Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market. When it rises, capital often flows to Bitcoin, impacting altcoin prices. It helps predict market trends.

When Bitcoin dominance increases, altcoins often lose value as money shifts to Bitcoin. Timing altcoin trades is key to managing risks in this dynamic.

ETH/BTC shows Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin. If ETH holds strong, dominance may stall; if ETH weakens, Bitcoin dominance could rise further.

As per Coinpedia's BTC price prediction, the Bitcoin price could peak at $168k this year if the bullish sentiment sustains.

Weekend hope faded a bit on Tuesday as Bitcoin slipped to $112,800 and Ethereum moved down to $3,867. This looks more like a pause than a crash. When the big coins slow down, people start asking about the best crypto to buy. Three altcoins stand out today. AVAX has a clear setup on the chart. LINK has strong partners and real use. Remittix focuses on fast, low-fee payments across borders, which many people and small businesses need. We will check AVAX and LINK first, then show how Remittix ties this story together for a must-hold altcoin list.





Source: Swallow Academy 

AVAX is holding just above a local support band near $19.45 after rejecting $20.87. Price trades around $19.76 and is down about 4.89%, but the bull case stays intact while support holds. For the best crypto to buy now list, the next proof is a clean market-structure break on this timeframe. That confirmation would turn dips into entries and keep the invalidation simple if support fails.

Beyond the chart, Avalanche drew new capital. M2 Capital invested $21M to push digital-asset adoption in the Middle East and improve the ecosystem. That mix of fresh funds and on-chain efficiency keeps AVAX near the front of screens for DeFi project builders and long-term holders who want the best long-term crypto investment with growing demand.



Source: Swallow Academy

LINK shows a recovery setup as buyers defend the drop, but the price still sits below key EMAs. The confirmation for the best crypto to buy now crowd is a breakout and reclaim of those EMAs. If that hits, momentum can quickly target the $27 to $28 zone.

Chainlink secures about $62B in value, holds roughly 62% oracle share, engages with whales and collaborates with Mastercard and Intercontinental Exchange. It also powers Polymarket with tamper-proof feeds. Real-world ties plus dominance make LINK a credible next big altcoin candidate.

Remittix is built for simple, borderless transfers that actually get used. The wallet beta has launched, the team is CertiK-verified and the project ranks #1 for Pre-Launch tokens on Skynet. Remittix has raised over $27.5M with 679M+ tokens sold. Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank are live, with another major CEX reveal coming soon.



Pullbacks in BTC and ETH do not break the bigger theme; they often set up the next leg. For the best crypto to buy now, AVAX offers structure plus funding tailwinds, LINK brings deep institutional reach and Remittix delivers crypto with real utility in payments. If you are building a basket of upcoming crypto projects and cross-chain DeFi project plays, these three fit the best crypto to buy now filter.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Kadena Foundation to Cease Operations, Leaving Blockchain to Run Without Core Team","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/kadena-foundation-to-cease-operations-leaving-blockchain-to-run-without-core-team","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 06:57:47 GMT","

The Kadena Foundation, the team behind the blockchain once pitched as a scalable proof-of-work alternative to Ethereum, said it will cease all business operations and dissolve its organization, citing market conditions and an inability to sustain active development.

The Kadena team is “no longer able to continue business operations and will be ceasing all activity and active maintenance of the Kadena blockchain immediately,” it said in an X post. 

The announcement sent KDA, Kadena's native token, tumbling more than 55% in 24 hours to below 9 cents, wiping out nearly all of its five-year price action.

A small team will oversee the transition and release a new node binary to ensure network continuity without the foundation's operational involvement.

The Kadena blockchain itself will continue to operate, the team noted, because it is maintained by independent miners and community developers. More than 566 million KDA remain allocated for mining rewards until 2139, and 83.7 million tokens are still set to unlock by 2029.

Still, the loss of the core development team effectively leaves the chain's future in the hands of its community and independent ecosystem projects, making a precarious position for a network once backed by prominent early investors and marketed as a hybrid public-private chain.

Kadena, founded by former JPMorgan blockchain engineers Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino, launched in 2019 with the promise of scaling proof-of-work networks through a unique multichain “braided” architecture. It combined traditional mining with smart-contract functionality and its own programming language, Pact.

At its 2021 peak, KDA traded above $25 and the project reached a $25 billion valuation, driven by speculative enthusiasm for alternatives to Ethereum's high fees. Activity and developer participation have dwindled in recent years as newer proof-of-stake and modular blockchains dominated funding and user attention.

Oops, something went wrong

The diminutive European country of Liechtenstein (population: approximately 40,000) has launched a state-backed blockchain infrastructure network, marking a move to blend national oversight with digital innovation.

The Liechtenstein Trust Integrity Network (LTIN), operated by Telecom Liechtenstein, offers blockchain services designed for institutions that require compliance with European regulations.

The platform operates under Liechtenstein's Blockchain Act and is aligned with the EU's upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), according to a press release.

LTIN's early partners include Bank Frick, Bitcoin Suisse, Solstice, and Zilliqa. Together, they aim to develop secure transaction, validation, and identity systems that keep data and governance within European jurisdictions. The project also carries a sustainability pledge, committing to 100% renewable energy use across operations.

Franz Wirnsperger, LTIN's chairman, said the initiative extends Liechtenstein's reputation for regulatory precision into blockchain. For enterprises, that could mean fewer compliance risks when adopting distributed ledger technology for finance, trade, or identity services.

As a public-private partnership, LTIN plans to onboard more participants from the institutional digital asset market, stated the press release. The move reflects a broader trend among small European states—like Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Luxembourg—positioning themselves as trusted hubs for regulated blockchain activity.

A federal judge in California recently rejected unregistered securities claims from people who bought cartoon images of “bored” apes—some wearing sunglasses—in the form of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, because they were marketed for “consumption.” Now those token purchasers have refiled their class action complaint, trying to resurrect their original premise. 

While the law governing cryptocurrency trading remains in flux, NFTs stand apart because each item is unique. Judge Fernando M. Olguin‘s ruling in favor of Yuga Labs Inc. and its promoters focused on how the company's Bored Apes Yacht Club tokens were promoted and sold.

Though NFT sales have declined, their promoters still face significant liability stemming from their heyday. NBA great-turned-businessman Shaquille O'Neal settled a suit over his Astrals and Galaxy NFTs for $11 million earlier this year. Yuga Labs' tokens were touted by Madonna, Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber, and other celebrities.

The recent decision pointed to allegations that Yuga Labs and its promoters said NFTs like Bored Ape Yacht Club provided membership in a digital club, “access to a collaborative art experience,” and, significantly, fun. 

“None of these alleged promotional statements can be read to tout the NFTs as investments,” Olguin said. His ruling and reasoning, if it survives and propagates, could provide a path out of litigation for token issuers.

Lee Reiners, a Duke Financial Economics Center fellow who's testified about crypto before Congress, said he doesn't recall a judge ruling that digital assets weren't securities because the purchasers' money didn't constitute an investment. 

Olguin effectively said, “No, you're buying digital art,” Reiners said. “I don't think he necessarily got that wrong.”

Margot Hoppin of Hoppin Grinsell said it's the first decision she's aware of that grants a dismissal motion for failure to adequately show an NFT collection is an investment contract and therefore a security.

Under Olguin's logic, “NFT promoters could potentially escape securities regulations simply by avoiding using language about profits” or related concepts, she said.

“This case comes down to whether these are ‘consumption goods,' or are they securities?” said Adam Moskowitz, who represents plaintiffs in litigation over the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and other cases. “These were mainly marketed as consumption goods.”

“So it's a different world from the rest of crypto,” where there are “interest accounts and tokens sold for profit,” he said.

The NFT holders repleaded their allegations. Before, they spent four paragraphs discussing whether they invested money. In the new complaint, the issue takes up about 13 pages. 

The defendants' marketing “contained specific crypto industry terms that marketed the Yuga Financial Products to Plaintiffs and Class members as investments with the prospect of financial gain,” they now allege. Remarks about “aping in,” rocket and moon emojis, the NFTs' value, and Yuga's promised development of a “metaverse,” or virtual world, all relate to future profit, they say.

If Olguin rejects the securities claims again, the Bored Ape token holders will still have consumer protection claims to fall back on.

Congress will likely step in to decide which digital assets can be considered securities, and in what circumstances. But for now, courts are using a 1946 US Supreme Court decision, SEC v. W. J. Howey Co. to assess those questions. To show an asset is a security, a party must show an investment of money in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others.

Olguin's look at the “efforts of others” prong provided some surprises, attorneys said.

Blockchain lawyer Lewis Cohen of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP says Olguin suggested in a footnote that the “efforts of others” aspect can be satisfied through sales on the secondary market, rather than sales direct from the issuer.

That view “runs exactly contrary” to the findings of Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York in SEC v. Ripple Labs Inc., he said. Torres had said exchange-based sales of Ripple's token to the public, often made by trading algorithms, didn't satisfy Howey—while sales to institutional investors did. 

But Ripple Labs also differed from another 2023 ruling in the same district that rejected the distinction between public and institutional sales. Olguin cited that case, SEC v. Terrraform Labs Pte, along with Bored Ape social media statements, in rejecting a defense argument.

To Hoppin, whose firm represents both plaintiffs and defendants in crypto cases, the blockchain “ecosystem” has played a key role in the “efforts of others” determination. 

The use of a privately controlled blockchain counts toward “efforts” by the token issuer, as in a case involving Dapper Labs, and it also counts if the promoters control the NFT marketplace, as in a DraftKings case, she said.

“But what happens when the ecosystem is more like a virtual world or an interactive platform or a universe creation based on a media property or artistic property, or comic book series?” she said. “This case suggests that that's not enough, and that's a surprising result,” she said. 

Many NFT collections are “promoted in tandem with a corresponding universe,” she said. And for many NFT purchasers, “the value of the NFTs they're holding are really directly linked to a promise of future preservation and access rights to those spaces, to those virtual worlds.”

Hoppin said there's a tendency for courts to be “dismissive of newer, non traditional, virtual-world-based, or meme- or hype-driven assets.”

“Holding a really new and nontraditional type of finance up to the metrics and terms and ways of thinking about traditional financial products, they will tend to fail those metrics and not speak in that language,” she said. But the markets exist. “It shouldn't mean there's less protection, legally.”

The NFT lending DApps market is projected to grow from USD 2,457.4 million in 2025 to USD 37,137.5 million by 2035, at a CAGR of 31.2%. P2P Lending will dominate with a 62.3% market share, while retail investors will lead the application segment with a 58.7% share.

Key Statistics

The global NFT lending DApps market, valued at USD 2,457.4 million in 2025 and projected to reach USD 37,137.5 million by 2035 at a CAGR of 31.2%, is poised for exponential expansion as technological innovation reshapes how digital assets are monetized and collateralized. Growth of nearly 15.12X during this period will be strongly driven by advances in blockchain protocols, smart contract architecture, and interoperability frameworks that transform NFTs into widely accepted instruments within decentralized finance ecosystems.

One of the most influential shifts is the evolution of smart contracts that underpin NFT lending platforms. Automated lending agreements embedded on-chain reduce the need for intermediaries, ensuring trustless execution, real-time validation, and transparent enforcement of loan terms. Innovations in programmable smart contracts now allow for dynamic interest rates, flexible repayment options, and instant liquidation of collateral in case of default, which enhances efficiency while reducing systemic risk. These innovations are critical in scaling NFT lending beyond niche communities to broader DeFi ecosystems.

Cross-chain interoperability is another defining technological innovation. As NFTs exist on multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Chain, lending DApps increasingly integrate cross-chain bridges and interoperability protocols. This creates seamless liquidity across platforms, enabling NFTs minted on one chain to serve as collateral in lending ecosystems on another. Such frameworks expand market depth, improve liquidity pools, and lower barriers for users across diverse blockchain environments.

The integration of Layer-2 scaling solutions and zero-knowledge rollups also addresses one of the key challenges of NFT lending—transaction cost and speed. By enabling high-throughput transactions with minimal gas fees, these technologies make micro-lending and smaller NFT-backed loans feasible, broadening accessibility. At the same time, decentralized oracles and real-time NFT valuation engines powered by AI are emerging as vital innovations. They provide accurate, automated price feeds for volatile and illiquid NFT assets, strengthening risk management for both lenders and borrowers.

Tokenization of loan products represents another forward-looking innovation. Lending platforms are experimenting with fractionalized loan tokens, allowing liquidity providers to diversify exposure across multiple NFT-backed loans rather than concentrating risk on a single asset. This mirrors structured finance models in traditional markets and could attract institutional players by offering standardized, risk-adjusted instruments. Security advancements are also shaping the future of NFT lending. Multi-signature authentication, decentralized custody solutions, and smart contract auditing are becoming embedded standards to safeguard user assets. Integration with decentralized identity solutions further ensures compliance, fraud detection, and borrower accountability, paving the way for mainstream adoption.



Between 2025 and 2030, the NFT lending DApps market is projected to expand from USD 2,457.4 million to USD 9,553.1 million, resulting in a value increase of USD 7,095.7 million, which represents 20.5% of the total forecast growth for the decade. This phase of development will be shaped by increasing institutional adoption of nft-backed lending protocols, rising demand for cross-chain lending solutions, and growing emphasis on automated liquidation mechanisms with enhanced risk management characteristics. Digital asset management firms are expanding their DeFi capabilities to address the growing demand for NFT collateralization, yield generation, and sophisticated lending protocol integration requirements.

From 2030 to 2035, the NFT lending DApps market is forecast to grow from USD 9,553.1 million to USD 37,137.5 million, adding another USD 27,584.4 million, which constitutes 79.5% of the overall ten-year expansion. This period is expected to be characterized by the expansion of multi-chain lending infrastructure, the integration of ai-powered risk assessment systems, and the development of fractionalized NFT lending platforms with enhanced liquidity mechanisms.

Key Takeaways

UPTEMPO's 2WINZ NFT series on Upbit NFT is a phygital project uniting 11 Korean artists to blend digital asset trading with traditional art collecting.

The limited drop offers 150 TIM ver. LUV GARDEN PFP NFTs, where digital ownership grants holders random physical rewards, including art toys and an original painting.

The NFTs are sold via a Fixed-Price Sale using ETH, starting October 21, 2025, with physical prize eligibility based on a November 3 snapshot.

Upbit NFT is launching the Project 2WINZ NFT series, beginning with the inaugural drop from acclaimed designer and art director UPTEMPO. This project unites 11 leading Korean art toy artists, establishing a new standard for phygital collectibles in the digital asset space.

UPTEMPO, who also co-leads HANDS IN FACTORY, is recognized for cultivating the “RUNNING HORNS” universe. His artistic influence extends beyond the digital realm, evidenced by high-profile collaborations with major brands like Nike, New Era, and the production company behind Netflix's Stranger Things.

The inaugural drop features UPTEMPO's specific creation: the TIM ver. LUV GARDEN PFP NFT. The artwork focuses on a ‘Gardening' theme, symbolizing the integration of Art and NFT, as well as the partnership between the Artist and Upbit.

Fellow HANDS IN FACTORY artist Hajonghoon collaborates on this launch. He creates his unique “HAZARD” figure series, which is a resilient lizard that regenerates its tail, serving as a powerful metaphor for modern perseverance. Additionally, his versatile work, including detailed sculptures and illustration projects like “BOOTLE BRAIN,” highlights the high-caliber talent driving the 2WINZ collection.

The drop will feature 150 NFTs in total. Subsequently, holders will be randomly allocated physical benefits. Specifically, these rewards include 1 original painting and 25 limited-edition physical art toys. All these tangible assets represent original works created by HANDS IN FACTORY and UPTEMPO.

Most importantly, this release is phygital, meaning the digital ownership grants access to physical rewards. Therefore, this hybrid approach, combining blockchain provenance with tangible art, defines the 2WINZ philosophy and aims to bridge the gap between digital asset trading and traditional art collecting.

Regarding the sale, the TIM ver. LUV GARDEN PFP NFTs will utilize a Fixed-Price Sale method, selling at a set price until all 150 editions are sold or the sale window closes.

A significant incentive is attached to holding these NFTs, dependent on traits within the digital asset. A snapshot date of November 3, 2025, at 12:00 AM KST will determine eligibility for the following physical prizes:

Before the main NFT drop, the 2WINZ project built serious hype with its “Free Raffle Drops.” This immediately showcased the project's phygital DNA. Right before the main NFT drop, five lucky winners scored a truly special prize, which is a collaborative physical art toy designed by both UPTEMPO and Hajonghoon.

Following the event, the successful completion of this raffle and the subsequent announcement of the winners (who then submitted personal information for prize delivery and tax processing) provided a clear, real-world example of the utility embedded within the Project 2WINZ ecosystem. This assures potential buyers of the value behind the ‘Phygital‘ label.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","UK data regulator defends decision not to investigate MoD Afghan data breach","https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/22/ico_afghan_leak_probe/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 07:15:00 GMT","

The UK's data protection regulator declined to launch an investigation into a leak at the Ministry of Defence that risked the lives of thousands of Afghans connected with the British Armed Forces.

The MoD was responsible for the accidental data breach, which took place in February 2022 and is likely to have cost more than £850 million. Evidence of the breach only came to light in July this year after a government superinjunction, imposed in August 2023, was lifted.

According to a report [PDF] from the National Audit Office (NAO), the MoD first became aware of the data breach in August 2023 when personal details of ten individuals from the dataset were posted to Facebook.

Speaking to MPs this week, Information Commissioner John Edwards, who oversees government data protection, said his office decided not to launch an investigation into the historic leak after meeting with MoD officials.

""During those sessions – because of the classification – no notes could be taken, so when my colleague made the decision to take no further action, and he informed me of that, we didn't document it immediately. It was only after the superinjunction was lifted that we recorded a formal decision and put that into the system,"" he said.

Appearing before the House of Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, Edwards denied that the superinjunction prevented note-taking or an investigation. ""It's just that information systems make it quite difficult to store classified material and to make a meaningful decision.""

He said that after superinjunction was lifted, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) – a non-departmental government body under the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) – reviewed the information available and decided there was no reason to impugn that original decision.

The leaked spreadsheet comprised 33,345 lines of data, including the names and contact details of applicants to the Afghan resettlement scheme —a program for those at risk of Taliban reprisal following the withdrawal of UK and US forces in August 2021. The document also included information about applicants' family members.

According to the NAO, the official responsible believed they were sharing a limited dataset with an external party for legitimate operational purposes. However, the spreadsheet contained additional data that wasn't immediately visible to the sender.

""It was contained in a hidden cell,"" Edwards said. ""The person had a legitimate need to share a limited amount of information. They accidentally shared much more than they intended to.""

Edwards told MPs the ICO decided not to investigate because it might hinder the MoD's response.

""My office had been informed, as we would have expected, as details emerged. We were given details of how the MoD was responding and we were satisfied with the steps that they were taking. When a breach becomes known to an organization, there is an immediate need within the organization to get to the root cause and to rectify the problems, and in this case, to keep safe people that may have been affected, and this was extremely serious. For the ICO to go in and start investigating [an incident, it] can actually get in the way.""

At the time, the ICO was also responding to a separate incident that took place in September 2021. The UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), the unit in charge of relocating citizens who worked for or with the UK government in Afghanistan, failed to BCC email recipients, putting Afghan interpreters at risk. It fined the department £350,000 after an investigation concluded in late 2023.

The Information Commissioner said his office did have the capability to investigate incidents involving classified information, but, in the case of the Afghan data leak, it was challenged by resources because the department does not have enough vetted staff.

""The decision was to take no further action in terms of the formal investigation. That was not a decision to do nothing,"" he said.

Immediately after the superinjunction was lifted, the ICO wrote to the Cabinet Office to say a joint effort to improve public sector data protection was ""not working well enough.""

In a joint committee with DSIT and the Cabinet Office, Edwards said there would be a plan to raise standards by the end of the year.

Chair Dame Chi Onwurah said the committee had invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who leads the Cabinet Office, to the hearing. Another minister was supposed to attend, but that date is yet to be set.

""We are very disappointed about the government's failure to send a minister to the session despite the long lead time and longer delay,"" she said. ®

The best crypto presale buy for 2025 remains the top search on the internet amid Bitcoin's ongoing recovery. Many investors are now seeking top new crypto ICOs that could raise parabolic returns in 2026.

This shift has brought investors to DeepSnitch, a new crypto analytics ecosystem that provides AI tools that help retail traders to better read the market. DeepSnitch has already gotten 500x growth projections, further bringing more investors to its ongoing ICO. Here's why investors say DeepSnitch could become one of the best new cryptos to buy.



Beijing has reportedly suspended stablecoin initiatives by Ant Group and JD.com, signaling a renewed push to keep tight state control over digital currency development.

According to the Financial Times, the directive came from both the People's Bank of China and the Cyberspace Administration of China, which instructed the companies to withdraw their Hong Kong stablecoin plans.

Officials were said to be uneasy about the idea of private firms issuing assets that could mirror sovereign money, viewing such tokens as a potential challenge to the digital yuan. The decision represents a major shift for two of China's biggest fintech players, both of which had expressed interest in Hong Kong's newly opened stablecoin licensing program.

Hong Kong's stablecoin initiative, launched in August, was designed to attract innovation in digital payments and stablecoin issuance, but mainland regulators appear intent on keeping those experiments under close supervision.

The policy clash highlights the fine line between innovation and state oversight in China's financial sector. Some former officials have pushed for a renminbi-denominated stablecoin to counter the influence of the U.S. dollar in global markets, while others warn that private stablecoins could encourage speculation and complicate monetary management.

DeepSnitch's (DSNT) ongoing presale has exploded past the $448,000 mark in stage 2 of its ICO, fueling claims that it could emerge as the best crypto presale for Q4 2025. DeepSnitch's blend of cutting-edge AI and blockchain analytics has sparked comparisons to early bull-run winners like Render, with whispers of 500x returns amplifying investor interest.



The secret behind the hype lies in its technology. DeepSnitch's five AI-driven modules act like a constant on-chain radar, monitoring liquidity flows, whale transfers, and smart contract deployments to predict movements before the market reacts. In essence, DeepSnitch allows retail traders to stay proactive in a space dominated by reactive strategies.

The platform will also feature a proprietary dashboard that translates this flood of intelligence into digestible insights that anyone can use. From visual whale tracking to risk alerts, it's built for both beginners and pros who want to act fast and stay ahead.

Security has also been prioritized. DeepSnitch's contracts have passed audits by both Coinsult and SolidProof, assuring the community that safety and transparency are part of the foundation.

As the AI revolution spreads across crypto, DeepSnitch AI is emerging as a frontrunner in actionable intelligence. With Stage 2 selling out fast and the DSNT price still at $0.01953, traders know this could be the final low entry point before the next major stage begins.



Maxi Doge is one of the upcoming crypto presales of 2025 that aims to merge strong utility with community-based growth. This network provides a meme-based leverage trading ecosystem where community members can take on higher risk while aiming for increased earnings.

By offering leverage trading in its ecosystem, Maxi Doge is overcoming one of the common limitations ot meme coin ecosystems: a lack of native real-world utility. Offering such options positions Maxi DOGE to become one of the top performers in the meme coin market in 2025.

Already, many are rushing to join the Maxi Doge meme ecosystem, seeking to capitalize on the project's growth before it goes mainstream. Over $3.7 million has been raised since the start of Maxi DOGE's presale. Maxi DOGE's presale is a bit advanced, meaning the opportunity for maximum growth is quite capped.

BullZilla's meme coin ecosystem is promising strong growth numbers, and the crypto market has taken notice. This Ethereum-based meme coin is built to create value for community members in all market conditions. Driven by a progressive rice engine, BullZilla raises its token value after every $100,000 raised in its ongoing presale.

It also raises the value after every 48 hours, even if not up to $100,000 has been raised. BullZillla goes further by including a Roarburn at every presale milestone. This boosts the scarcity of BZIL tokens, further increasing their value. Another way token holders can earn extra value is by participating in the HODL Furnace and locking up their tokens for up to 70% APY.

Although investors are confident that BullZilla will become a top performer, one factor that could hamper its growth is competition from top new crypto ICOs like DeepSnitch. Already, a report by Kraken shows that investors expect AI cryptocurrencies like DeepSnitch to outshine their competitors in 2025.

Even with crypto prices correcting in October, DeepSnitch AI's presale continues to draw record interest. Currently in Stage Two, the project has already surpassed $448,000 in capital as investors rush to accumulate before its expected market boom.

The earliest DSNT buyers are already sitting on a 29% increase. The ongoing dip has turned into an opportunity for those who see the future of AI-integrated crypto systems. Experts predict DSNT could become the best crypto presale buy of 2025, especially after its 500x growth projections.

Buy directly from the official presale today while entry prices remain low.



Investors say DeepSnitch's 500x growth projections make it one of the best crypto tokens to buy.

You can search for new cryptos with strong growth potential and join their presale before they go live.

Investors expect a strong performance from AI cryptocurrencies in 2025.

                                        Image Source: BusinessDay                                    

Wrapped CBDC, the private issuer of the cNGN stablecoin pegged to the Nigerian naira, has made ₦15.34 million ($10,500) from accrued income in seven months, according to its September attestation report released on Monday. While its reserves are generating healthy returns, Wrapped CBDC's long-term profitability hinges on the broader adoption of cNGN among Nigerian users and crypto platforms.

Wrapped CBDC has steadily shifted its reserve mix toward yield-bearing collective investment schemes (CIS) and short-term government paper since March. In the March attestation, the issuer held ₦50 million ($34,000) in a money market fund inside total reserves of ₦152.508 million ($104,000), with the balance kept in bank deposits. The April report shows the same reserve mix and totals. 

The May attestation shows a deliberate reallocation: money market investments and similar assets rose to about ₦100.1 million ($68,250) while cash deposits fell to roughly ₦51.108 million ($35,000), leaving total reserves at ₦156.108 million ($106,500).

Over the months, the issuer pushed its holdings in money market funds and treasury bills from an initial ₦50 million ($34,000) to ₦294.96 million ($201,000), representing 48.5% of its reserve portfolio. The issuer now places about ₦152.79 million ($104,000) in a CardinalStone money market fund (MMF) and ₦142.17 million ($97,000) in two short-term Nigerian treasury bills. 

The assets cumulatively generated ₦15.34 million ($10,500) in accrued returns, according to filings. Those reallocations convert idle cash into interest-earning instruments and increase the reserves' capacity to produce operating income while retaining liquidity for redemptions.

Holding reserves in yield-bearing instruments makes clear economic sense for private stablecoin issuers. Cash in a bank account yields little or nothing—but can be instantly liquidated—while money market funds and short-dated government bills pay daily or weekly interest and remain highly liquid. Interest income reduces the net cost of running a stablecoin and creates a buffer that can help smooth redemptions during volatile outflows.

Private stablecoin businesses monetise those interest streams. Major issuers earn income from interest on reserves, transaction and listing fees, and other investments. Tether, the El Salvador-based company and issuer of the dollar-backed USDT token, invests large portions of its reserve portfolio in low-risk, interest-bearing assets such as US treasury bills and cash equivalents, generating substantial interest income. 

Additional revenue comes from fees for token issuance, redemption services, account verification, and custodial or enterprise services, and from strategic investments in other digital-asset companies.

Wrapped CBDC appears to follow that model. The stablecoin issuer reports that its primary revenue sources are interest accrued on reserve assets, fees tied to token issuance, and account verification charges for crypto platforms that want to list the cNGN stablecoin. Those fees and reserves interest together form the bulk of the startup's monetisation strategy.

Stablecoin issuance is primarily a balance-sheet business. The issuer must manage redeemable liabilities represented by tokens in circulation while preserving liquidity and reducing credit and market risk on reserve assets. 

This requires three linked functions: custody and safekeeping of reserves, transparent third-party attestations or audits, and ongoing asset-liability management that prioritises immediate redemption capacity. Investors and partners fund growth through equity and venture capital, while the issuer uses reserve yields and fees to fund operations and product expansion.


        In 7 months, Wrapped CBDC generated ₦15.34M in income from the reserves backing its stablecoin. With ~₦603.05M cNGN tokens in circulation, here's what that looks like on a per-token level.

Enter the amount of cNGN you hold (or plan to buy) to see the estimated income its backing reserves could generate for Wrapped CBDC in one month.


        Source: cNGN September attestation report, as cited in the article. Calculations are estimates. Total Reserves = Principal (₦603.05M) + Accrued Income (₦15.34M). ‘Income' refers to accrued returns, not company profit.
    

Over the months, several investors and partners have funded the cNGN project without disclosing the amounts.

In September, Adaverse, a Saudi-based venture studio affiliated with the blockchain company Cardano, reportedly made a “significant” investment in Wrapped CBDC. The issuer has also received support from the Base ecosystem and other undisclosed investors.

Since launching in February, Wrapped CBDC has published monthly attestation reports showing that its reserves either matched or exceeded the number of cNGN tokens in circulation. In March, the stablecoin had ₦152.5 million ($104,000) in reserves for 152.4 million tokens. April reflected the same balance.

May appeared to be the only month that tested the peg. At the end of that month, 156,056,988 cNGN tokens were in circulation while the issuer's principal reserve stood at ₦151.2 million ($103,000), according to the asset figures in its filing that month. The reserve comprised ₦51.2 million in bank deposits, ₦50 million ($34,000) in a money market fund, and ₦50.1 million ($34,000) in other short-term instruments. The gap was covered by interest income already accrued on those investments, allowing the company to maintain the peg.

“The omission in the May 2025 attestation report was the result of a clerical error in the bank deposit section,” said Uyoyo Ogedegbe, managing director at Wrapped CBDC, acknowledging the shortfall. “One deposit line item of approximately ₦5 million was not reflected in the report, although the overall reserve total of about ₦156 million was correctly reported. The issue has been reviewed and corrected in an updated May 2025 report.”

The episode highlights a crucial principle. A stablecoin's peg must rest on its principal reserve, while interest and investment returns should be treated as excesses. These excesses build liquidity buffers that protect the token's convertibility and give retail holders confidence that redemptions will always clear at face value.

In every other month between March and September, the cNGN's reserves equaled or exceeded the number of tokens in circulation across all six blockchains where it trades.

Wrapped CBDC's core duty is to keep full backing and transparent reporting of reserves. Its monthly attestations from independent auditors have so far confirmed that the reserves—held in bank deposits, money market funds, and treasury bills—cover all outstanding cNGN tokens.

The issuer's role ends at issuing and managing the stablecoin. Third parties, such as Xend Finance, a Nigerian crypto investment platform, have begun creating products around the cNGN stablecoin. In May, the crypto startup launched a cNGN money market fund that lets users earn returns on their cNGN holdings. Wrapped CBDC has distanced itself from the initiative, claiming that its responsibility is limited to issuing the cNGN stablecoin and maintaining reserve transparency, not managing external investment ventures.

Adoption momentum has cooled in recent months. According to the issuer's filings, cNGN tokens in circulation recorded 298.6 million in June, then jumped to 603.85 million in July. The pace of expansion slowed after that. The most recent filings the issuer provided show circulation at about 603.05 million in September, a small decline from the July peak and a signal that rapid adoption has eased.

For cNGN to win the local retail market, maintaining peg is becoming the most basic of its responsibilities. It must somehow convince more Nigerians that it has utility beyond being a “stablecoin.”

Editor's Note: An earlier version of this report stated that cNGN's May reserves reflected a monetary failure to maintain its peg. After publication, Wrapped CBDC clarified that a ₦5 million bank deposit line item was omitted from the May 2025 attestation report due to a clerical error. The total reserve figure of about ₦156 million was accurate, and the report has been updated accordingly with the comment.","{'href': 'https://techcabal.com', 'title': 'TechCabal'}","cryptocurrency"

Reform leader Nigel Farage has vowed to oppose the creation of a U.K. central bank digital currency (CBDC), declaring he would “rather go to prison” than live under what he described as a system of government financial control.

The controversial politician also claimed that his experience “debanked” had led him to embrace crypto, calling it the “ultimate freedom.”

Speaking at the Zebu Live conference in London on Wednesday, Farage warned that a central bank digital currency would form part of a broader move towards “digital personal ID”, which he said could give authorities “complete control” over citizens' finances.

“A central bank digital currency fits into the plan for digital personal ID. It's one and the same thing,” Farage said.

“I don't want to live in a country with a central bank digital currency that can measure how much we've spent — that could be linked to a carbon output or whatever else it may be,” he added. “Frankly, I would rather go to prison.”

He said the idea of a state-controlled digital pound “fills [him] with total and utter horror”, calling it an “authoritarian step” incompatible with personal liberty.

Farage told the audience  that he had personally raised the issue with Bank of England  Governor Andrew Bailey, who confirmed that the central bank was still advancing its CBDC plans.

“I asked him straight — are you still progressing your plans for a British central bank digital currency? And the answer was yes,” Farage said.

“Bailey and I may not agree on things, but he's honest. He's an honest public servant.”

CBDCs are digital versions  of a nation's official currency, which, unlike crypto, are fully centralized.

Reflecting on his own experience being “debanked” two years ago, Farage said the incident reinforced his belief in crypto as a tool for personal empowerment.

“When I was debanked, I realised this is the ultimate freedom — being in control securely of your own money, making your own decisions, free from authoritarian government,” he said.

“Crypto is the ultimate freedom in the 21st century, and debanking absolutely taught me that for life.”

Farage said he now viewed crypto as “the antidote to financial censorship” and promised to lead a campaign for “individual liberty, freedom, independence and choice.”

“They may think they're the big guys,” he added. “I think there's enough of us to win this great battle. I intend to be at the forefront of it, however long it takes.”

Asked whether he had personally invested in digital assets, Farage replied, “Yeah, of course.”

“People are fascinated,” he said. “When I talk about things, people do actually have conversations about it.”

He acknowledged the risks of speculative trading but distinguished it from long-term investment.

“One thing is investing. The other is trading on margin,” he said. “Trading on margin is great when it's great. It's not so great when it's not so great.”

      The US dollar is under scrutiny from investors around the world. Banks, firms and governments that rely on it as an international means of payment and store of value worry about the  policies of an erratic and hostile “America First"" president. They fear further steps to weaponize the American currency. They fret that US government debt is on an unsustainable path and that the Federal Reserve, whose independence hangs in the balance, will feel pressure to inflate away those obligations.


     
      The dollar may be the dominant global currency for the moment, but there are real questions about how long this moment will last.


     
      And now to the rescue come—wait for it—dollar-linked stablecoins, blockchain-based digital tokens pegged one-to-one to the greenback. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act signed into law by President Donald Trump in July promises to let a thousand stablecoins bloom. The US Treasury and its regulatory partners will spend the next year fleshing out the rules, after which they will start licensing private stablecoin issuers. To all appearances, there will be no shortage of licensees.


     
      The domestic implications have been much  discussed. Will stablecoins actually be fully backed by safe liquid collateral, or will the regulated, who have every incentive to hold higher-yielding assets, stay one step ahead of the regulators? 


     
      Will stablecoins always and everywhere trade one for one with the dollar? 


     
      If there are runs, will regulators intervene, just as they intervened in 2008 to guarantee the liabilities of the Reserve Primary Fund, the world's third-largest money-market fund? 


     
      Will the banks' deposit base be insulated by  prohibitions on stablecoins paying interest, or will issuers sidestep this ban by channelling interest payments through the exchanges on which their coins are traded, threatening the existence of the banking system?


     
      These are good questions, and the answers are not reassuring.


     
      Still, some will argue that if there are risks, they are risks worth taking, because stablecoins will preserve the dollar's global hegemony. So it was argued by no less an authority than Donald Trump Junior at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore earlier this month.





     
      The argument starts with the observation that 99% of stablecoin circulation worldwide is tied to the dollar. If those dollar stablecoins are held and used outside the US, they will provide an entirely new set of international payment rails, separate and in principle faster and cheaper than cross- border banking and the banks' hoary messaging  system, Swift.


     
      If this enhances the attractiveness of dollar payments, corporate treasurers will be encouraged to maintain inventories of dollars. Central banks, likewise, will be encouraged to hold reserves of dollars, since this will enable them to act as dollar lenders and liquidity providers of last resort. These complementarities will lock in dollar dominance.


     
      This argument is based on a slew of assumptions that need to be unpacked. 


     
      First, the notion that dollar stablecoins will be attractive for payments assumes that they will in fact be stable (here come those good questions again), and that other governments will allow free use of dollar stablecoins by their residents.





     
      How realistic is that assumption? Some governments may hesitate, fearing that currency substitution would undermine the effectiveness of their domestic monetary policy. Others would worry about facilitating money laundering, tax avoidance and evasion of capital controls. 


     
      European Union authorities will scrutinize  the compatibility of dollar stablecoins with the consumer-protection and market-integrity provisions of their Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The EU has already flagged Tether, the leading stablecoin, as non-compliant.


     
      The rebuttal is that governments lack the ability to turn back this digital tide. But anyone who has encountered China's Great Firewall knows that national authorities retain considerable power  to limit their citizens' digital transactions. 


     
      True, Europeans will be able to access dollar  stablecoins offshore even if they are banned in Europe itself. But big banks and companies will be reluctant to engage in such regulatory evasion, given that they will pay a heavy price if caught.





     
      A third assumption is that jurisdictions where other currencies circulate will not issue their  own stablecoins. But China has just taken a step in this direction, adopting an ordinance authorizing the issuance of renminbi-linked stablecoins in Hong Kong.


     
      Finally, it is assumed that private-label stablecoins will not be outcompeted by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These are essentially the same instrument, only issued by central banks, which can guarantee their conversion into central bank money. More than 100 central banks around the world are going down the CBDC road. Only the US has shunned it, reflecting the country's  historical suspicion of central banking, as well as lobbying by the American crypto industry.


     
      History shows that central bank money has profound advantages over private money. This gives good reason for thinking that the US is betting on the wrong horse. ©2025/Project Syndicate

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Crypto exchange Cryptomus fined record $177M by Canada's financial crime watchdog","https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cryptomus-fined-177-million-fintrac-9.6948338","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:47:20 GMT","

A cryptocurrency exchange has been slapped with a fine of almost $177 million — the largest-ever penalty by Canada's financial intelligence agency — for infractions including failing to flag more than 1,000 transactions with suspected links to criminal activity.

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) announced the penalty for Xeltox Enterprises Ltd. on Wednesday. The B.C.-incorporated business operates as Cryptomus and was previously known as Certa Payments Ltd.

The $176,960,190 fine eclipses the previous record — roughly $20 million — for a fine imposed by FINTRAC. That penalty was given to Peken Global Ltd, the operator of another cryptocurrency firm, KuCoin, in September.

""Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, Fintrac was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action,"" director and CEO Sarah Paquet said in a statement about the Cryptomus penalty.

The agency found 1,068 instances where Cryptomus did not submit reports for July 2024 transactions involving known darknet markets and virtual currency wallets with ties to the criminal activity Paquet described.

Darknet markets are online and often anonymous platforms where illegal goods and services are sold. Virtual currencies also mask the identity of their holder, making both them and the darknet markets havens for criminal activity.

FINTRAC said Cryptomus didn't just violate money laundering laws when it failed to flag suspicious transactions, it also committed a violation when it failed to report 7,557 transactions originating from Iran between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2024.

Because of ministerial directives linked to financial transactions associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Cryptomus was supposed to treat these transactions as high risk. It was also required to verify the identity of the sender(s)/beneficiary(ies), exercise due diligence, maintain a record of the transactions and report them to FINTRAC, yet the agency said none of those obligations were fulfilled.

Furthermore, FINTRAC found 1,518 transactions in July 2024 that met the $10,000 threshold at which companies have to report a large transfer of virtual currency.

FINTRAC said these instances went unreported by Cryptomus, which also had ""incomplete and inadequate policies and procedures"" that created deficiencies in how the company handled ongoing monitoring and ""know-your-client"" obligations.

Under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, businesses ranging from financial institutions to real estate brokers and casinos must keep certain records, identify clients, maintain a compliance regime and report financial transactions meeting specific criteria to FINTRAC.

The Wednesday fine is the latest reprimand Cryptomus has faced. The B.C. Securities Commission temporarily banned the firm in May from trading securities and other market activities.

In 2024-25, FINTRAC issued 23 violation notices to business that didn't comply. It was the largest number of notices issued in one year in its history and amounted to more than $25 million in penalties.

FINTRAC has imposed more than 150 penalties since it received the legislative authority to do so in 2008.

Reform leader Nigel Farage has vowed to oppose the creation of a U.K. central bank digital currency (CBDC), declaring he would “rather go to prison” than live under what he described as a system of government financial control.

The controversial politician also claimed that his experience “debanked” had led him to embrace crypto, calling it the “ultimate freedom.”

Speaking at the Zebu Live conference in London on Wednesday, Farage warned that a central bank digital currency would form part of a broader move towards “digital personal ID”, which he said could give authorities “complete control” over citizens' finances.

“A central bank digital currency fits into the plan for digital personal ID. It's one and the same thing,” Farage said.

“I don't want to live in a country with a central bank digital currency that can measure how much we've spent — that could be linked to a carbon output or whatever else it may be,” he added. “Frankly, I would rather go to prison.”

He said the idea of a state-controlled digital pound “fills [him] with total and utter horror”, calling it an “authoritarian step” incompatible with personal liberty.

Farage told the audience  that he had personally raised the issue with Bank of England  Governor Andrew Bailey, who confirmed that the central bank was still advancing its CBDC plans.

“I asked him straight — are you still progressing your plans for a British central bank digital currency? And the answer was yes,” Farage said.

“Bailey and I may not agree on things, but he's honest. He's an honest public servant.”

CBDCs are digital versions  of a nation's official currency, which, unlike crypto, are fully centralized.

Reflecting on his own experience being “debanked” two years ago, Farage said the incident reinforced his belief in crypto as a tool for personal empowerment.

“When I was debanked, I realised this is the ultimate freedom — being in control securely of your own money, making your own decisions, free from authoritarian government,” he said.

“Crypto is the ultimate freedom in the 21st century, and debanking absolutely taught me that for life.”

Farage said he now viewed crypto as “the antidote to financial censorship” and promised to lead a campaign for “individual liberty, freedom, independence and choice.”

“They may think they're the big guys,” he added. “I think there's enough of us to win this great battle. I intend to be at the forefront of it, however long it takes.”

Asked whether he had personally invested in digital assets, Farage replied, “Yeah, of course.”

“People are fascinated,” he said. “When I talk about things, people do actually have conversations about it.”

He acknowledged the risks of speculative trading but distinguished it from long-term investment.

“One thing is investing. The other is trading on margin,” he said. “Trading on margin is great when it's great. It's not so great when it's not so great.”

Oops, something went wrong

Russian lawmaker Igor Antropenko has submitted legislation to recognize crypto as marital property, subject to division during divorce proceedings, thereby addressing the risks to property rights created by the unclear legal status of digital assets.

According to a local report, the draft federal law proposes amendments to Articles 34 and 36 of Russia's Family Code, stipulating that digital currency acquired during marriage would be considered joint property while crypto obtained before marriage or through gratuitous transactions would remain individual property.

The proposal has been sent to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Central Bank Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina for review.

Antropenko, a member of the State Duma Committee on Industry and Trade from United Russia, noted that an increasing number of Russian citizens are using digital currency for investment and savings amid economic digitalization.

The explanatory note argues that the lack of regulation creates “the risk of infringement of the property rights of one of the spouses, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 19 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation.”

The proposal comes as Russia recorded $376.3 billion in cryptocurrency transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, overtaking all European markets according to Chainalysis.

South Korea established a precedent in October 2024 by enabling married couples to divide cryptocurrency holdings during divorce proceedings.

Legal firm IPG Legal confirmed the nation's law now recognizes both tangible and intangible assets, including cryptocurrencies, as marital property under Article 839-2 of the Korean Civil Act.

The provision allows either spouse to request division of assets acquired during marriage upon divorce, reinforcing a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that classified virtual assets as property.

Spouses can request fact-finding investigations through courts if they suspect their partners hold undisclosed crypto assets.

Blockchain technology makes cryptocurrency tracking more straightforward than traditional cash assets, as blockchain records provide transparent transaction ledgers that individuals cannot hide or delete.

Couples can choose to liquidate crypto holdings before dividing them or split tokens directly.

At that time, a New York case exemplified these challenges when a woman discovered her husband's hidden Bitcoin holdings during divorce proceedings.

She employed a forensic accountant who uncovered 12 BTC, worth approximately $500,000, stored in an undisclosed wallet.

Russia's surge in crypto adoption has been driven by institutional use, the expansion of DeFi, and an increased reliance on stablecoins for cross-border transactions.

Large-scale transfers exceeding $10 million increased by 86% during the measured period, nearly double the 44% growth observed in the rest of Europe.

Source: Chainalysis

The ruble-pegged stablecoin A7A5, despite Western sanctions, became the world's largest non-U.S. dollar stablecoin by market capitalization, reaching $500 million in early October.

DeFi activity in Russia increased eightfold in early 2025 before stabilizing at three and a half times the mid-2023 baseline.

In September, lawmaker Yevgeny Masharov proposed creating a national crypto bank to bring informal crypto transactions into the regulated sector and increase federal revenues.

The country plans to launch its central bank digital currency nationwide on September 1, 2026, following parliamentary approval in July.

However, illegal and quasi-legal crypto mining is costing Russia millions of dollars annually in electricity costs and lost tax revenue.

Experts believe almost 140,000 Bitcoin and altcoin mining farms operate in Russia, with the lion's share remaining underground to avoid commercial electricity rates that consume up to 80% of profits.

Recent arrests have included an Omsk employee who accepted a $6,270 bribe to allow miners to steal power, and a St. Petersburg operator who has bypassed electricity meters since 2018, resulting in a loss of $6.3 million to the grid.

Istanbul, Turkey – October 2025 — In a world where speed, scale, and security define success, few crypto exchanges have faced the dual challenge of building world-class infrastructure in a market affected by international sanctions on Iran. Nobitex, Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange with over ten million verified users, is proving that innovation and integrity can coexist — showing how technology can drive trust and resilience in complex environments.

“We are not adapting to limitations — we are engineering around them,” said a senior technology officer at Nobitex. “This isn't a workaround; it's a blueprint for how secure, transparent, and compliant crypto infrastructure can thrive anywhere.”

While many exchanges rely on outsourced systems, Nobitex has built nearly its entire core infrastructure in-house, including: • A proprietary order-matching engine capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second • AI-powered monitoring systems that detect anomalies in milliseconds • Real-time wallet screening connected to dynamically updated international sanctions databases • Adaptive pricing engines that align fiat and crypto liquidity with global markets.

Due to international restrictions affecting Iranian markets, platforms often lack access to global APIs and compliance tools. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, Nobitex used it as an opportunity to innovate — building a fully independent tech stack that meets international expectations for performance, transparency, and reliability.

“You cannot outsource integrity,” the officer added. “When you build your own systems, you own the trust.”

Cybersecurity remains one of the most significant challenges for the crypto industry. Nobitex has invested heavily in prevention-first architecture, including: • Air-gapped cold wallets for reserve assets • Multi-signature approval layers for large withdrawals • AI-driven anomaly detection tuned to regional behavioral data • Automated IP and device fingerprinting to prevent fraud.

The company also conducts independent penetration tests with ethical hackers and operates a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) combining human expertise with machine learning analytics. These measures have enabled Nobitex to withstand multiple.

high-level cyberattacks over the past three years without loss of user funds — setting a new benchmark for operational resilience in emerging markets.

Even while operating in a market affected by international sanctions on Iran, Nobitex maintains strict international AML/KYC controls — not through declarations, but through technology: • All users must complete verified KYC onboarding; anonymous accounts are prohibited • Wallets flagged by OFAC, FATF, EU, and UN lists are automatically blocked • All suspicious transactions are isolated and logged within seconds for review.

This system is powered by a proprietary compliance engine built directly into Nobitex's infrastructure, providing faster and more accurate detection than typical third-party integrations. The result is a platform that prevents illicit activity at the source while keeping legitimate users protected and informed.

“Technology allows us to be both compliant and inclusive,” said the compliance lead. “We meet global standards without excluding those who need access most.”

For Nobitex, infrastructure isn't just about performance — it's about access. The platform is optimized for low-bandwidth environments, offers Persian-language interfaces, and provides onboarding experiences tailored for first-time crypto users. In collaboration with regional developer communities, Nobitex has: • Released open APIs for wallet and payment developers.

• Sponsored blockchain-for-good hackathons • Trained more than 5,000 developers and analysts in secure crypto infrastructure

By empowering both technical and non-technical users, Nobitex is cultivating a homegrown digital economy rooted in transparency and education, not speculation.

While some exchanges use tools that obscure transaction trails, Nobitex has taken a different path — one of voluntary visibility: • It does not employ mixers or privacy obfuscation tools • It publishes annual transparency and compliance reports • It is developing a public blockchain explorer to make its on-chain activity verifiable.

These actions make platform misuse measurably harder and position Nobitex as one of the few exchanges in restricted markets openly building toward global transparency standards.

At a time when the global crypto industry faces trust crises and regulatory scrutiny, Nobitex's journey illustrates how necessity can drive genuine innovation. Rather than seeking exceptions, the company invites the world to judge it by its architecture, not its address.

“We don't ask for exemptions — we ask to be evaluated by our engineering,” said the CTO. “What we've built shows that transparency, security, and compliance can thrive anywhere when technology leads the way.”

Founded in 2018, Nobitex is the MENA region's leading cryptocurrency exchange, trusted by more than ten million verified users. The platform adheres to international AML/KYC frameworks, employs AI-based risk monitoring, and maintains open-data transparency dashboards. Nobitex's mission is to make blockchain-based fintech secure, transparent, and inclusive — proving that responsible innovation can flourish even in restricted markets.

The U.S. is pulling ahead of Britain in the race to shape the future of crypto, according to Mohamed Ezeldin, Head of Tokenomics at Animoca Brands.

Ezeldin said that the U.K.'s ambitions  to become a global leader in emerging tech are being undercut by policy inaction, taxes, and political turmoil.

Ezeldin said the U.S. is moving more confidently toward crypto adoption, even if regulation still lags behind.

“We've seen a President who is very controversial but also very stubborn in his ways,” he said.

“When he says something, he will deliver, or deliver close enough to what he's promised, for better or worse.”

“Part of his mandate is crypto,” Ezeldin continued, referencing the launch of Trump's token and World Liberty Finance.

“So the U.S. is actually in a much better position as of today for crypto, even though regulation is still lagging behind.”

Ezeldin acknowledged that American leadership in crypto has not always been smooth, but said it remains unmatched in its global influence.

“The U.S. has always been a leader in this space, again, for better or worse,” he said.

He contrasted that with Britain's faltering position.

“We're not faring too well as the U.K. right now,” Ezeldin said. “We're getting battered and bruised, absolutely, for sure.”

“The U.K. says it wants to be a leader in emerging technologies,” Ezeldin told CCN during an interview at the Zebu Live conference in London.

“But realistically, no steps have been made to alleviate any of the pain points,” he stressed.

He said that while government ministers continue to promote Britain as a crypto hub, on-the-ground realities tell a different story.

“Some of the pain points — tax is a big issue,” he said. “A lot of founders are leaving the U.K., moving to Dubai and Lisbon for tax breaks.”

Ezeldin added that the political instability  of recent years, with frequent leadership changes and economic uncertainty, has compounded the problem.

“The instability within the U.K. government right now is not a beacon of success,” he said.

“‘Come to the U.K., we're in a solid phase of growth,' that's not been the case.”

His comments come amid Britain's push to rebrand itself as a crypto hub, an effort spearheaded  by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who said he wanted to make the U.K. “a global hub for crypto technology.”

Since then, the government has promised to introduce stablecoin legislation , explore a digital pound , and attract blockchain-based investment, but progress has been extremely slow.

Despite the uneven regulatory landscape, Ezeldin said Animoca Brands continues to expand globally, working with major institutions on blockchain infrastructure projects.

The Hong Kong-based company, which started in gaming, has grown into an ecosystem builder with more than 600 investments across the Web3 space.

“We're focused on digital property rights and true ownership of assets,” Ezeldin said.

“Our approach has always been about adding value to the ecosystem, not extracting it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","What role does BlockDAG play in the evolution of cryptocurrency?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/blockdag-transforming-crypto-investments-employee-salaries","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:29:53 GMT","

BlockDAG is a radical departure from conventional blockchain technology, fundamentally changing how transactions are processed in the cryptocurrency sphere. Unlike traditional blockchains which handle transactions in a straight line, BlockDAG allows for numerous transactions to occur at the same time. The result? An impressive transaction speed that soars up to 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). Such rapid processing capabilities are a game changer, especially for fintech applications that demand fast and scalable solutions.

But this innovation isn't just about speed. The architecture of BlockDAG also enhances both decentralization and security, which are two major concerns institutional investors have when pondering crypto investments. By consuming less energy than traditional Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, BlockDAG fits nicely into the sustainability narrative that regulators and investors are increasingly prioritizing. This makes it a compelling choice for fintech startups keen on creating robust, scalable, and low-cost financial products.

The recent success of BlockDAG's presale, which accumulated nearly $430 million while drawing in over 3.5 million users, stands as proof of its rising popularity and market validation. Yet, this enthusiasm is not merely about purchasing coins; it's an investment in a vision for a more efficient and user-friendly financial future.

Whale movements—significant transactions by large holders—are crucial to understanding the stability of established cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Recently, a massive $27 million DOGE transfer by a whale raised red flags among traders, suggesting impending selling pressure and igniting market jitters. Such behemoth transactions can catalyze panic selling among smaller investors, causing short-term volatility.

On the flip side, when whales purchase assets during price drops, they can effectively create price support levels. With ADA, whale transactions pointed to a trend toward cold storage, which is often seen as bullish behavior. This kind of accumulation can stabilize prices and instill greater confidence in the market, potentially attracting more institutional and retail investment.

However, whale activity can have a double-edged effect. While it might encourage long-term stability, it can also introduce short-term unpredictability. Investors must observe these movements closely to gauge market sentiment and make judicious choices.

The shift towards stablecoin salaries marks a notable change in the compensation practices of tech companies. Stablecoins, being pegged to established currencies, offer employees financial flexibility and stability. This shift presents several key advantages:

Diminished Volatility: Stablecoin utilization helps employees sidestep the volatility that accompanies traditional cryptocurrencies, leading to more predictable compensation aligned with their financial requirements.

Quicker Transactions: Payments via stablecoins often see swifter processing times than traditional banking methods, enabling timely access to funds for employees, especially freelancers and remote workers.

Reduced Transaction Costs: Using stablecoins can drastically cut cross-border fees, thereby increasing employees' net compensation and overall financial satisfaction.

Access to DeFi Tools: Employees receiving stablecoin salaries have opportunities to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, such as staking and yield opportunities, offering additional financial avenues.

Competitive Advantage: Providing stablecoin salaries can help tech firms distinguish themselves in a tight job market, thereby attracting top talent eager for innovative payment options.

As more companies embrace stablecoin salaries, they are not just improving employee satisfaction, but also positioning themselves as forward-thinking players in the fast-evolving financial landscape.

Decentralized organizations such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) face distinct challenges in managing crypto assets amidst a volatile market. Here are strategies to effectively navigate this landscape:

Diversification of Assets: By distributing investments across various asset classes—like large-cap cryptocurrencies, altcoins, and stablecoins—the risk of concentration gets mitigated, reducing the impact of volatility on any single asset.

Active Management: Engaging in proactive portfolio management, though tricky, can yield better risk-adjusted returns. This includes rebalancing portfolios and responding to macroeconomic trends.

Incorporating Stablecoins: The use of stablecoins within the treasury can hedge against volatility, ensuring liquidity for daily operations. This approach proves particularly effective during market downturns.

Hybrid Management Models: Many organizations adopt a mixed model, balancing a core, passively managed portfolio for long-term exposure with more active strategies to manage risk or seize short-term opportunities.

Community-Driven Governance: Leveraging blockchain transparency allows for community participation in decision-making regarding asset management, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives.

Regular Portfolio Review: Continual assessment and adjustment of the asset mix ensures alignment with the organization's risk profile and market dynamics, maintaining financial stability.

By adopting these strategies, decentralized organizations can successfully navigate market volatility and enhance their asset management protocols.

Fintech startups stand to benefit significantly from advancements in crypto technologies like BlockDAG, which can reshape their investment strategies. Several approaches may prove effective:

Focusing on Speed and Scalability: Incorporating BlockDAG's rapid transaction capabilities into their services can enhance user experience and accommodate high transaction volumes, essential for payment systems and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Aligning with Institutional Trends: With institutional interest in crypto on the rise, fintech startups should prepare to attract this capital by showcasing real-world utility and compliance with regulatory standards.

Navigating Regulatory Support: As regulatory frameworks in Asia and beyond become more progressive, fintech startups can better navigate this evolving landscape while remaining innovative.

Delivering Tangible Utility: Creating financial products that provide real-world utility—such as low-code smart contract builders—can expedite time-to-market and bolster investor confidence.

Engaging the Community: Engaging users and fostering community can enhance brand loyalty and attract a wider user base, as evidenced by BlockDAG's expanding community.

The Oct. 10 crypto crash and lack of sizable bounce since continues to shake up sentiment among the bulls.

Less than three weeks after saying a rise to $135,000 appeared imminent, Standard Chartered head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick said a decline below $100,000 now appears ""inevitable.""

In a note to clients on Wednesday, Kendrick said the recent high of $126,000 on Oct. 6 matched his near-term target but failed to hold as broader macro fears — particularly around U.S.-China trade tensions — triggered a market-wide selloff.

“Since then, the 10 October US-China trade war fear driven selloff put paid to any further push higher,” Kendrick wrote. “The question now is how far does bitcoin need to fall before finding a base?”

The good news, said Kendrick, is that the decline below $100,000 should be short-lived and is likely to mark the last-ever chance to buy BTC for six figure.

Three key signals could mark the turning point, he said. The first is capital flow between gold and bitcoin. Kendrick noted that a sharp gold selloff this week coincided with an intraday bounce in bitcoin, possibly signaling a rotation from gold to crypto. “Further such evidence would be constructive for a bitcoin low being formed,” he added.

Second, Kendrick is watching for signs that the Federal Reserve may end quantitative tightening. He points to several liquidity measures that have been tightening steadily. A Fed response could provide the macro backdrop for bitcoin to climb again.

Finally, even though he doesn't consider himself a technical analyst, Kendrick highlighted that bitcoin has consistently held above its 50-week moving average since early 2023, when it was trading around $25,000.





In an earlier note on Oct. 3, Kendrick forecasted a new all-time high and set a year-end price target of $200,000. At the time, he cited U.S. government shutdown risks, bitcoin's correlation to Treasury premiums and shifting ETF inflows as reasons for bullish momentum.



While Bitcoin's rally has stalled, Kendrick remains confident in a longer-term uptrend, urging investors to treat any drop below $100K as a potential entry point, not a sign of reversal.

Bitcoin's BTC$108,222.75 two-way price action is squeezing both leveraged bullish and bearish plays, underscoring challenging market conditions for traders.

In the past 24 hours, BTC's price has traded back and forth between $107,000 and $113,000, wiping out roughly $600 million in market-wide bullish and bearish futures bets. The liquidation wave hit as traders cut leverage across major exchanges, with data from CoinGlass showing roughly $355 million in long positions and $301 million in shorts closed out over 24 hours.

Bitcoin accounted for the bulk of the damage at more than $340 million, followed by ether ETH$3,837.95 at $200 million. Solana SOL$184.15, XRP$2.3978, and DOGE$0.1921 rounded out the top losers, each seeing tens of millions in forced liquidations.

Such flushes are common after large price swings. Leveraged positions on perpetual futures exchanges are automatically closed when traders' margin levels fall below maintenance thresholds, often causing cascading price moves as positions are sold into thin liquidity. 

Large liquidations serve as critical indicators of short-term turning points in market sentiment.

“Despite Bitcoin's sharp pullback over the past 24 hours, positioning on our futures platform has actually continued to stabilize,” said Alexia Theodorou, head of derivatives at Kraken. “After hitting a local low on Oct. 6, the long/short ratio on Bitcoin perpetuals has shifted back toward neutral territory.""

""The recent volatility pushed derivatives activity on Kraken to record levels, but despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, our data suggests many traders view the sell-off as overdone and are cautiously positioning for potential upside. While sentiment remains fragile, we're seeing a more balanced market emerge following an initial wave of capitulation,"" Theodorou added.

BTC's sharp pullback from overnight highs above $113,000 marked an abrupt end to the recovery from the Oct. 10 low and is indicative of how fragile sentiment remains heading into the final stretch of October.

Perhaps, the market is still digesting the fallout from the month's earlier deleveraging shock.

“The bulls failed to push the market above recent highs, and we're seeing the formation of an active short-term downtrend,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. 

“Bitcoin at $108K has again fallen to its 200-day moving average. The spring scenario of prolonged consolidation around this line and a further breakout now looks like the hopeful case for bulls,"" he added.

Major altcoins have tracked BTC lower, with ETH holding near $3,870 and SOL down 9% over the week. BNB and XRP posted minor gains after outperforming in earlier sessions, while memecoins such as DOGE saw sharper drawdowns amid thinning speculative flows.

“The sharp intraday swings across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins reflect a cautious market sentiment,” said Wenny Cai, co-founder and COO at SynFutures. “After yesterday's brief recovery, traders are back to reacting to macro cues like rising bond yields, geopolitical uncertainty, and thin liquidity. In this kind of environment, even small changes in risk appetite trigger outsized moves.”

Despite the red screens, data from Glassnode and ETF flow trackers suggest structural demand hasn't collapsed. Spot ETF inflows remain steady, exchange balances sit near cycle lows, and long-term holders continue accumulating. 

Traders are now eyeing the Oct. 29 Fed meeting, with most anticipating a 25 basis point cut in borrowing costs. The central bank reduced rates by 25 bps in September.

Bitcoin's BTC$108,053.24 key volatility index remains elevated even as the S&P 500 VIX index, Wall Street's primary fear gauge, has eased from its surge following the Oct. 10 market shakeup.

Observers attribute the stickiness in BTC volatility to factors including concerns around auto-deleveraging and poor market liquidity.

The Oct. 10 market panic, triggered by President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement on China, led to broad-based risk aversion, sending both stocks and cryptocurrencies lower.

On the same day, BTC's price fell to roughly $104,000 from $122,000 and its annualized 30-day implied of expected volatility (IV), represented by Volmex Finance's BVIV index, surged from 40% to 60%.

The index has since stabilized above 50%, maintaining elevated levels compared to the VIX index, which has fallen back below 20%, erasing the spike to 29%. The VIX represents the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500.

The divergence is due to traders pricing new risks in the crypto market, according to Yoann Turpin, co-founder of the crypto market-making firm Wintermute.

""Bitcoin volatility was subdued earlier, characterized by regular premium selling as market participants, particularly digital asset treasuries (DATs), sought to generate yield and differentiate their strategies. It has now become clear that new risks and market dynamics—such as ADL (auto-deleveraging)—were underestimated and are now being fully priced in,"" Turpin told CoinDesk.

Auto-deleveraging (ADL), often the final step in the liquidation process, is triggered when an exchange's insurance funds and liquidation procedures prove insufficient to cover losses from bankrupt positions. In such cases, the system automatically reduces or closes profitable opposing positions to maintain platform solvency, effectively socializing losses during market stress.

During the Oct. 10 crash, several exchanges, including decentralized giant Hyperliquid, activated ADL to force-close leveraged short bets.

In essence, the crash etched ADL risks, previously largely unknown or underestimated, firmly into investors' psyche, likely reflected in sticky implied volatility.

That said, Turpin expects volatility to remain elevated at current levels only if BTC rallies to new highs or new lows outside of the $100,000-$125,000 range.

Liquidity in the cryptocurrency market refers to the ease with which digital assets can be bought or sold without causing significant changes to the market price. When liquidity is high, even large buy or sell orders can be absorbed without drastically impacting prices, which helps keep the market stable and reduces volatility. Conversely, when liquidity dries up, smaller orders can have an outsized impact on market rates, often leading to increased volatility.

The market panic on Oct 10, partly catalyzed by the breakdown in infrastructure at Binance, the world's leading crypto exchange by volume, has affected market liquidity, setting the stage for a new high volatility regime.

""Although the macro fears that initially triggered the spike have eased, realized volatility has continued to climb, keeping IV supported. This could be a shift into a higher-volatility regime rather than a temporary shock,"" Jimmy Yang, co-founder of institutional liquidity provider Orbit Markets, said.

""With many spot liquidity providers hurt during the recent crash, market depth has thinned, leaving prices more prone to large swings,"" he explained.

Griffin Ardern, head of BloFin Research and Options, blamed tightening fiat liquidity conditions in offshore (non-U.S. markets) regions for elevated BTC volatility.

""The Hong Kong dollar's overnight lending rate (HIBOR) has returned to its pre-May level, while the DXY has actually risen since October, even during a period of interest rate cuts. This is a clear sign of tight liquidity, which often triggers volatility,"" Ardern said. ""BTC's volatility is largely determined by the offshore market.

 Tether has notched its 500 millionth user of its USDT stablecoin, an achievement its CEO Paolo Ardoino said is “likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history.” 

US dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether hit its 500 millionth user on Tuesday, offering a means to transact and save for those who have been excluded by the traditional banking system.

“Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino wrote in a post on X.

Tether said the figure represents 500 million “real people,” not simply Tether (USDT) wallets, suggesting its stablecoin has now been used by around 6.25% of the world's population.

The World Bank Group estimates there are 1.4 billion adults who don't have access to a bank account globally. Crypto is one potential solution to the problem, as anyone with a phone can download a crypto wallet to receive money and store funds securely.

Crypto can also be beneficial for those who live in high-inflation countries or nations where the risk of having one's funds seized is real.

To celebrate the milestone, Tether shared a 10-minute documentary showcasing USDT adoption in Kenya, where people turn to stablecoins “not for speculation, but for survival.”

Ardoino noted that 37% of USDT users hold the stablecoin as a store of value.

It also highlighted how small businesses have been forced to turn to USDT to pay for imports as an alternative to the weakening Kenyan shilling, providing a lifeline to keep those companies afloat.

USDT is by far the largest stablecoin, with a market cap of $182.4 billion, representing a 58.4% market share, according to CoinGecko. Circle's USDC (USDC) comes in next at 76.8 billion.

Last month, Tether was said to be in talks with investors to raise up to $20 billion at around a $500 billion valuation, which would make Tether one of the most valuable private companies in the world.

Financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald is acting as a lead adviser in the potential deal.

Earth Is Getting Darker, Which Could Accelerate Global Warming

The planet's brightness is dimming—changing rainfall, circulation and temperature

By Ryan Green edited by Andrea Gawrylewski

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

The view of Earth from space is famously familiar—bright blue ocean, swirling gyres of white clouds, touches of terrestrial green. The luminosity of this image is the result of the sun's rays shining on the planet, where they're either reflected or absorbed by materials on Earth's surface and in our atmosphere. But a new study that examined Earth's overall brightness reveals that something eerie is happening to that familiar picture.

Scientists measure the planet's brightness by factoring in how much light reaches earth and how much is reflected back out to space (as measured by orbiting satellites). This reflectivity is known as albedo, and Earth's overall albedo has been decreasing for decades. But according to a new study published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, that change isn't uniform: the Northern Hemisphere is getting even darker than its southern counterpart. This loss of brightness could result in increased warming in the Northern Hemisphere, throwing Earth's weather systems out of balance.

Norman Loeb, senior technologist for radiation sciences at NASA and lead author of the study, and his colleagues investigated the changes in Earth's brightness using data from three different satellites measuring incoming sunlight against what is called outgoing longwave radiation, or the amount of radiation reflected back into space, over a 24-year period. They combined this with data from high-resolution spectral imagers, snow and cloud maps, and computer climate models. What they found was surprising.

This is a conceptual animation showing how polar ice reflects light from the sun. As this ice begins to melt, less sunlight gets reflected into space. It is instead absorbed into the oceans and land, raising the overall temperature, and fueling further melting.

Historically scientists believed a fundamental property of Earth was that the brightness of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres were symmetrical. The two hemispheres have different albedos—the Northern Hemisphere has more land and snow and ice cover, and thus it is more reflective. “One has a lot of continents; the other has more ocean. One has Antarctica; the other has the Arctic Ocean,” says Brian Soden, a University of Miami professor of atmospheric science. But despite these differences, they appear to reflect the same amount of sunlight from space.

That equilibrium was thought to be because of cloud cover. Formed from both water vapor and aerosols, clouds can, at varying altitudes, reflect or absorb solar rays. But Loeb's team found a break in the hemispheric symmetry, which suggests that there's a limit to the role clouds play in maintaining it. The researchers have hypotheses about why they observed differences between the hemispheres: when the Earth warms, the air holds more water vapor, which absorbs solar radiation. The Northern Hemisphere is experiencing more warming, so this could account for some level of darkening.

Some of the difference could also come from changes in aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere ranging from pollutants to dust or sea salt, that reflect solar radiation. Because of stricter controls on aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere since the early 2000s in countries such as the U.S. and China, coupled with melting ice and snow, this part of the globe is reflecting less sunlight. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, a major volcanic eruption and Australian bush fires have both contributed aerosols to the atmosphere in the past few years, increasing reflectivity.

When the balance in reflectivity shifts, “the whole circulation of the climate will shift in order to transport energy from the hemisphere that has a surplus to the one that has a deficit,” Soden says. This could influence ocean currents and the location of rainfall bands, which can have ramifications for water availability.

And of course, if more solar radiation is coming in, the Northern Hemisphere will continue to get hotter. This could mean that more ice and snow will melt, further fueling the global heating and darkening. Though he can't confirm the correlation, Loeb says that tropical precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere has increased relative to the south. “This is still early,” he said, “I will be very interested to see what further implications may arise.”

Why Some Apologies Feel Hollow—And Others Don't

The words we choose when apologizing—especially longer, effortful ones—can signal sincerity and make our apologies feel more authentic.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

We've all heard apologies that ring hollow and others that sound genuine, but what makes the difference? New research suggests that the words we choose when we apologize can signal how much effort we're putting into making amends, and that perceived effort has a big impact.

Here to explain what makes an apology sound authentic is Shiri Lev-Ari, an associate professor in psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat today.

Shiri Lev-Ari: Thank you for inviting me.

Feltman: So you recently authored a paper about something that I think many of our listeners think a lot about, especially in the age of the Internet [laughs]: the idea of apologies and what makes one sound genuine. Could you tell me a little bit about your research background and kind of how you came to this question?

Lev-Ari: Yeah, so I'm a researcher of language, but I'm particularly interested in language when it has a social aspect, so to see how it helps in social functions and [is] influenced by social information. And I came to apologies because I find apologies quite interesting and bizarre. They're something that is called cheap talk because anyone can apologize, whether or not they mean it—it costs them nothing—so you think they'd be meaningless, but they're really meaningful. So I was kind of interested in trying to think [about] what people do to the language to really help convince the other person that they really mean their apology.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and in the paper you talk about this concept of iconicity. Could you explain what that is for our listeners?

Lev-Ari: Yeah, so iconicity is when—or at least specifically in spoken language—is when the sounds or the form of a word resemble the meaning. So a few very easy to understand examples: for example, the sound /i/ is really associated with small size. So think about “itsy-bitty” or “tiny,” so those sounds really sound small, and we actually know that across the world's languages, the word for “small” is much more likely to have the sound /i/ than you'd expect by chance.

Feltman: Mm, and so how does that relate to the idea of sort of evaluating apologies?

Lev-Ari: So usually when people talk about iconicity they really think about inherent iconicity, so when the form of the word always conveys that meaning. So for example, “itsy-bitsy” will always, like, sound small, and it doesn't matter in which context you're gonna say “itsy-bitsy”; it's gonna sound small.

And what I was interested in is—well, with the context of apologies—I was more interested in how people try to convey effort in the context. So they would use words that in the context express the fact that they're really putting an effort into their apologies, even though in other contexts those words might not really reflect, necessarily, effort.

Feltman: And why is effort so important when it comes to speaking and hearing an apology?

Lev-Ari: Well, so the thing is that we know that in real apologies what people usually do in order to convince the other person that they really mean their apology is really put an effort into the apology. So I'll give you an example that is both from an actual study but is also really, really intuitive to understand.

So imagine that you read about a case where there are two students and one of them inadvertently did something that harmed the other one, didn't realize it at the time, and later on, when they found out, there are two options. Either the second they found out they traveled to where the other person is taking a class, even though they're not taking that class and they don't need to be there, so really inconvenienced themself and put in time and effort just to go and apologize as soon as possible. In the other case they apologize to the other student the next time they happen to see them. And when you ask someone, “Okay, which of the two cases is the student more apologetic, or more mean the apology?” it's kind of obvious that [it's] when they put in effort and inconvenience themself.

So there really is a lot of evidence that seems really intuitive that putting in effort really reflects the fact that you're sorry. And what I was trying to do is [determine] whether I can also find it in the language itself—so do people really try to convince the other person that they're sorry by using words that are harder to say to show: “See how much effort I'm putting into my apology?”

Feltman: Yeah, and so what are the different ways that we can speak in ways that take more effort? Is it just about the length of a word, or is there other stuff that can go on?

Lev-Ari: One thing that is interesting is that there are two factors that really influence how difficult it is to say a word. One of them is how long the word is, so that's obvious: obviously, you're gonna spend more time and do more motor action in order to say or type the word. Another factor that really matters is how common the word is. So some words are much more common than others, and it's actually much easier to say common words. So it was easier to recall them, and even after you recall them it's actually easier to say, like, more frequent words.

So there are two options of what apologizers can do. One thing is, you might think, “Okay, maybe they're gonna use really long words and also really infrequent words to show, ‘Look how much effort I'm putting into it.'” But the problem is that this only thinks about the apologizer and doesn't really think about the other person.

Now, if you also think about the effort for the other person, then long words are perfect. They're really, really hard to say but actually really, really easy to understand—maybe even more than shorter words because they tend to be more different from other words and you have more time to process them. So it's great: you're putting in effort, and actually the listener doesn't need to put in any effort.

But infrequent words are actually hard both for the person saying them but also for the listener, so you might think that if you're a sophisticated apologizer, you wouldn't want to use them because you wanna burden yourself but not the addressee. So maybe a sophisticated apologizer would use long words but will avoid low-frequency words.

Feltman: Mm, yeah, that makes sense.

So can you talk a little bit about how you approached studying this question?

Lev-Ari: Yeah, so I did two studies, and in the first one I wanted to see what people actually do in the real world. So what I did is I went to social media, specifically Twitter, and I looked at apology tweets compared to other tweets by the same people, and I looked both at celebrities and noncelebrities just to see that it doesn't really matter who is apologizing. And in both cases I found that people use longer words when they apologize, but they don't use infrequent words. So they're really putting in the burden on themselves but not on the other person.

And what I've done next is I try to see, “Okay, is this strategy effective at all?” So I then did an experiment where I showed people different versions of apologies that, basically, had the same meaning—they just differed in how long and how frequent the words were. So think, for example, about, “My action doesn't reflect my true self,” versus “My action does not represent my true character.” They mean the same thing, but, you know, “character” versus “self,” “represent” versus “reflect”—so longer words. And basically people needed to rank the different apologies with the same meaning from most to least apologetic. And we found that when apologies had longer words people ranked them as more apologetic, but they didn't care about frequency.

So this really fits with what we found on Twitter. It seems that everyone basically seems [to think], “Okay, like, long words really reflect apologeticness, and it's really the effort that a speaker is putting in.” But people don't really pay attention to word frequency because that's hard for everyone, so it's not really what an apologizer should do.

Feltman: What other questions are you hoping to answer about this topic? Do you have any further research planned?

Lev-Ari: So what I'm trying to look at, actually, right now that is related to this is trying to look at expression of gratitude and requests for help and try to see similarly, “How do people manipulate their speech to really help their message be more effective?”

So even after we ignore which word—like, the meaning that they're trying to use, how, just by doing things like maybe, for example, using a higher versus a lower pitch to show, like, you know, greater warmth and submissiveness and things like that, how do they similarly show how they feel or their stance versus the other person?

Feltman: I'm curious, since doing this research has it changed the way you interpret or experience, like, celebrity apologies that come up in the news?

Lev-Ari: Ooh, celebrity apologies. I don't know; I'm trying to think if there were famous celebrity apologies recently. But people have asked me whether I do it in my own speech now, and I have to say, that's—I think it's unavoidable that I would pay attention to it, but it actually worries me because it seems that we all do it naturally and I'm worried that if I actually overthink it, I might actually do it wrong and not as well as I do it naturally.

Feltman: [Laughs.] Well, I was going to ask you what advice you have for people who want to make their sincere apologies come across as effectively as possible, but it sounds like maybe the best thing we can do is to just mean our apologies and care about making amends. Would you say that that's correct [laughs]?

Lev-Ari: Yes, and I think that if we actually really try, it will come naturally, that these are the type of words that we use that are most effective.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk through this research. It's been super interesting.

Lev-Ari: Thank you for inviting me. Happy to be here.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. Join us again on Friday to learn about the fraught history of testing how common medications can impact pregnancy.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In many ways, science is a story of happy accidents. From the (possibly apocryphal) story of Isaac Newton and the apple to the discovery of penicillin centuries later, accidents can lead humanity in some truly wondrous directions. Now a team of scientists from Columbia University are adding a new fortunate fluke to the list. This one may not rewrite our understanding of gravity or usher in a new era of medicine, but it could be a huge boon for another world changing technology: artificial intelligence. 

In the study, published earlier this month in the journal Nature Photonics, scientists detail how exploring ways to improve Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) accidentally led to the discovery of a chip-sized frequency comb, a special kind of light where color bands are lined up next to each other and bright frequencies appear as spikes on spectrogram—sort of like teeth on a comb. 

“The technology we've developed takes a very powerful laser and turns it into dozens of clean, high-power channels on a chip,” Andres Gil-Molina, a former postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and the study's lead author, said in a press statement. “That means you can replace racks of individual lasers with one compact device, cutting cost, saving space, and opening the door to much faster, more energy-efficient systems.”

To pull this off, Gil-Molina and the research team relied on multimode laser diodes, which are typically used in medical devices and laser-cutting tools. Not exactly known for being neat and orderly beams of light, researchers used a technique known as a “locking mechanism” to essentially “purify” the noisy light, Gil-Molina says. This method uses silicon photonics to clean up the laser's output so that it displays high coherence. 

Then the chip splits this rarified laser light into dozens of colors. Because these colors don't interfere with one another, each optical hue is its own channel, allowing for the possibility of sending dozens of data streams simultaneously. Of course, this is far from the first time such a device has been created—in fact, this basic idea known as “wavelength-division multiplexing” is what transformed the internet into what it is today. What's different is that frequency combs typically require powerful and expensive lasers and amplifiers, but this study shows that they can achieve the same trick on just a single chip. 

“This is about bringing lab-grade light sources into real-world devices,” says Gil-Molina. “If you can make them powerful, efficient, and small enough, you can put them almost anywhere.”

The most obvious application for this new kind of chip is AI data centers, which are increasingly feeling the strain to move information fast enough, especially between processors and memory. While many data centers still use single-wavelength lasers along fiber optic cables, a compact frequency comb can send multiple data streams along that same cable. 

“This research marks another milestone in our mission to advance silicon photonics,” Columbia University's Michal Lipson, the senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “As this technology becomes increasingly central to critical infrastructure and our daily lives, this type of progress is essential to ensuring that data centers are as efficient as possible.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A “toxic duo” may be the hidden trigger behind Alzheimer's disease","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251022023113.htm","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:20:58 GMT","

For decades, scientists have known that Alzheimer's disease is marked by sticky plaques and tangled proteins in the brain. In recent years, research has also shown that the brain's blood vessels play an important role in how the disease develops. Yet despite decades of progress, this deeper understanding has not led to fully effective treatments. The main obstacle has been the uncertainty around the exact biological chain of events that leads to brain cell loss.

A Toxic Interaction Between Amyloid and Blood Proteins

New findings now reveal a damaging partnership between two key molecules: amyloid beta (Aβ), a peptide known for forming plaques, and fibrinogen, a major blood protein involved in clotting. When Aβ attaches to fibrinogen, it produces unusual clots that resist breakdown. These stubborn clots are linked to inflammation and damage in blood vessels, and even very small amounts of the complex appear to set off early signs of Alzheimer's, including loss of synapses, swelling in the brain, and leaks in the blood-brain barrier. The results strengthen the case that vascular dysfunction contributes directly to neurodegeneration and highlight a promising new therapeutic target: the Aβ/fibrinogen complex.

""It takes a larger amount of Aβ or fibrinogen alone to cause serious damage in the Alzheimer's brain,"" says Erin Norris, research associate professor in the laboratory of Sidney Strickland at Rockefeller. ""But when the two complex together, you only need very small amounts of each to cause damage. There's a synergistic effect with Aβ and fibrinogen.""

Investigating a Long-Standing Hypothesis

Strickland's Patricia and John Rosenwald Laboratory of Neurobiology and Genetics has been studying this Aβ/fibrinogen link for almost twenty years. Earlier work from the group showed that Aβ binds to fibrinogen and connected that interaction to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. At the time, the idea that blood vessel problems could play a major role in Alzheimer's was controversial. ""Only recently, with a number of breakthroughs in the field, did people begin to believe that the vascular system is involved in AD pathogenesis,"" Norris says. ""Since our initial findings, we've been focused on studying the mechanisms that explain how a dysfunctional vascular system impacts AD.""

Identifying the complex was only the beginning. The researchers wanted to know how much damage it could cause on its own. They recreated low concentrations of the Aβ/fibrinogen complex in the lab and applied it to thin slices of mouse brain tissue as well as to living mice. This allowed them to observe its effects under tightly controlled conditions.

""We wanted to really show the damage -- to zoom in on exactly how pre- and post-synaptic terminals were being harmed,"" says Research Associate Elisa Nicoloso Simões-Pires.

Their experiments revealed that while Aβ and fibrinogen alone caused little harm, even small amounts of the combined complex led to major problems. It damaged synapses, increased inflammation, and disrupted the blood-brain barrier -- all signature features of Alzheimer's disease. When the researchers used antibodies that stopped Aβ from binding to fibrinogen, the harmful effects were significantly reduced.

""We showed that the complex actually induces blood-brain barrier leakage, when the proteins alone did not,"" Simões-Pires says. ""Disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows for blood proteins to cross into the brain, which lead to additional harm.""

Clues to Early Alzheimer's and Potential Treatments

One strength of the study is that it used both isolated brain tissue and live mice. ""It was an in vitro and in vivo project, both providing the same outcome,"" Norris says. ""We are much more confident in our results when we can show the same thing in culture and in a living organism."" Next, the team plans to explore the mechanism -- why does this complex cause so much trouble?

There may also be clinical implications, because the study suggests that even small amounts of the Aβ/fibrinogen complex can trigger the features of Alzheimer's disease long before cognitive symptoms appear. Mice exposed to the complex, for instance, also showed elevated levels of phospho-tau181, a biomarker used in humans to detect Alzheimer's years before symptoms arise. This result raises the possibility that the current study is mimicking the earliest stages of AD progression and that early intervention targeting the complex itself could delay or prevent it.

While many mechanisms contribute to Alzheimer's, the team believes this particular pathway deserves more attention. ""It's not a simple disease,"" Simões-Pires says. ""A lot of other factors can induce neurotoxicity, and we certainly do not propose that inhibiting this complex formation would cure AD. But perhaps targeting this complex would alleviate some of the pathologies and be even more effective in combination with other therapies.""

These discoveries bring researchers one step closer to understanding how damage spreads in the Alzheimer's brain -- and how stopping a single toxic interaction could make a difference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A giant wave is rippling through the Milky Way, and scientists don't know why","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083650.htm","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 06:30:58 GMT","

Our Milky Way is constantly in motion: it spins, it tilts, and, as new observations reveal, it ripples. Data collected by the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope show that our galaxy is not only rotating and wobbling but also sending out a vast wave that travels outward from its center.

For about a century, astronomers have known that the Milky Way's stars orbit its core, and Gaia has precisely tracked their speeds and trajectories. Since the 1950s, scientists have also recognized that the galactic disc is not flat but warped. Then in 2020, Gaia uncovered that this warped disc slowly oscillates over time, similar to the motion of a spinning top.

Now, researchers have identified an enormous wave that moves through the Milky Way, influencing stars tens of thousands of light-years from the Sun. The phenomenon is like a rock dropped into a pond, where the resulting ripples spread outward -- only here, the ""ripples"" are made of stars, stretching across the galaxy's outer regions.

The newly revealed wave is illustrated in the figure above. Thousands of bright stars, shown in red and blue, are overlaid on Gaia's detailed map of the Milky Way.

In the image on the left, we see our galaxy from a top-down perspective. The right panel shows a side view, cutting vertically through the galactic plane. From this angle, the left portion of the galaxy curves upward while the right side bends downward (this is the warp of the disc). The red and blue regions mark the newly discovered wave: red areas indicate stars located above the warped plane, while blue areas show stars lying below it.

Although no spacecraft can venture beyond the galaxy, Gaia's remarkably precise measurements -- covering all three spatial dimensions (3D) and three components of motion (toward and away from us, and across the sky) -- allow scientists to construct these top-down and edge-on views of the Milky Way.

These maps reveal that the wave extends over a vast section of the disc, affecting stars located about 30,000 to 65,000 light-years from the galactic center (the Milky Way itself measures about 100,000 light-years across).

""What makes this even more compelling is our ability, thanks to Gaia, to also measure the motions of stars within the galactic disc,"" says Eloisa Poggio who is an astronomer at the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) in Italy, and led the team of scientists that discovered the wave.

""The intriguing part is not only the visual appearance of the wave structure in 3D space, but also its wave-like behavior when we analyze the motions of the stars within it.""

In the edge-on view of the Milky Way linked below (""The Milky Way's great wave in motion""), white arrows show how the stars move. The vertical motion of the stars (represented by these arrows) is slightly shifted sideways compared to the pattern of their positions (shown by the red and blue colors).

""This observed behavior is consistent with what we would expect from a wave,"" Eloisa explains.

She compares the phenomenon to a stadium crowd performing a wave. If we could freeze that moment in time, some people would be standing upright, others would just have sat down (after the wave passed), and some would be about to stand (as the wave approaches). Galactic timescales are far longer, but the principle is similar.

In this comparison, the people standing upright correspond to the red regions in Gaia's maps, while those about to rise -- moving upward with the greatest vertical speed -- are represented by the longest white arrows pointing up, just ahead of the wave's crest.

Eloisa and her team detected this remarkable motion by carefully studying young giant stars and Cepheid stars, both of which vary in brightness in predictable ways that make them easy for Gaia to observe across large distances.

Because these stars seem to move with the wave, the researchers suspect that gas in the galactic disc may also participate in this large-scale motion. Newly formed stars could retain information from the gas they were born from, preserving a kind of ""memory"" of the wave.

The cause of the galaxy's vast oscillations is still uncertain. One possibility is that the Milky Way experienced a past encounter or collision with a smaller, dwarf galaxy, but further analysis is needed to confirm this.

This newly found ""great wave"" might also have some link to a smaller undulating structure known as the Radcliffe Wave, which lies roughly 500 light-years from the Sun and extends about 9,000 light-years across.

""However, the Radcliffe Wave is a much smaller filament, and located in a different portion of the galaxy's disc compared to the wave studied in our work (much closer to the Sun than the great wave). The two waves may or may not be related. That's why we would like to do more research,"" Eloisa adds.

""The upcoming fourth data release from Gaia will include even better positions and motions for Milky Way stars, including variable stars like Cepheids. This will help scientists to make even better maps, and thereby advance our understanding of these characteristic features in our home galaxy,"" says Johannes Sahlmann, ESA's Gaia Project Scientist.

Common dolphins, among the most abundant marine mammals on Earth, are living significantly shorter lives in the North Atlantic. A new study published on October 10 in Conservation Letters reports that their lifespan has dropped sharply in recent decades.

Researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder found that female common dolphins are living an average of seven years less than they did in 1997. The team warns that this decline threatens not just the species but also the ocean ecosystems they help sustain.

""There is an urgent need to manage the population better,"" said Etienne Rouby, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). ""Otherwise, there is a risk for decline and, ultimately, extinction.""

Dolphins of the Bay of Biscay

Roughly 6 million common dolphins inhabit tropical and temperate waters worldwide, making them the most numerous members of the cetacean family, which includes whales and porpoises. One of their key winter gathering spots is the Bay of Biscay, off the coast of France, where nutrient-rich waters attract anchovies, sardines, and other small fish that serve as food for the dolphins.

However, this same region is also one of Europe's busiest fishing zones. While dolphins are not the intended catch, many become accidental victims of fishing operations. Known as ""bycatch,"" this phenomenon causes thousands of dolphin deaths each year. In 2021 alone, bycatch was estimated to have killed about 6,900 dolphins out of the bay's winter population of 180,000.

Despite such figures, past surveys suggested that dolphin numbers in the area were stable.

A New Way to Measure Decline

Traditional monitoring methods rely on counting dolphins spotted from ships or aircraft. Because the animals are constantly moving, these surveys can overlook population changes until they become severe. For species like dolphins, which reproduce slowly and live for decades, that delay can make recovery extremely difficult once the decline becomes visible, Rouby explained.

To better track survival trends, the research team took a different approach by examining stranded dolphins that had washed ashore along the Bay of Biscay. Dolphins usually beach themselves when sick, injured, or disoriented, and most do not survive. Although stranded animals represent only about 10% of total deaths, their condition over time can reveal important patterns in population health.

The researchers analyzed 759 stranded common dolphins collected between 1997 and 2019.

""We wanted to capture changes in the population's survival and fertility rates. These are more sensitive indicators of population health, and they enable us to identify the problems before they become irreversible,"" Rouby said.

Evidence in the Teeth

By studying the growth layers in dolphin teeth, the scientists determined the ages at which the animals died. Their findings showed that the average lifespan of female dolphins in the Bay of Biscay fell from 24 years in the late 1990s to only 17 years by 2019. This decrease has also resulted in fewer calves being born, signaling a broader reproductive decline.

The study found that population growth has slowed by 2.4% since 1997. Under ideal conditions, common dolphin numbers can increase by about 4% per year, meaning that growth in 2019 was likely only around 1.6%.

""The numbers are likely to be lower in reality,"" Rouby said. He warned that if this trend continues, growth could eventually turn negative, marking the beginning of an overall population decline.

Policy Changes and Future Action

Since 2024, the French government has implemented a one-month annual fishing ban in the Bay of Biscay each January to protect dolphins. Although initial reports show the measure may be helping, Rouby suggested that adjusting the ban's timing based on dolphin migration patterns could make it more effective. Because dolphins do not always arrive at the same time each year, matching the closure to their movements would offer better protection.

Other North Atlantic cetaceans, including harbor porpoises and bottlenose dolphins, may be facing similar pressures. Understanding these patterns could help strengthen marine protection policies such as the US Marine Mammal Protection Act and the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

Why Dolphins Matter

""Dolphins are the top predators in the Bay of Biscay, and they play a very important role in the ecosystem,"" Rouby explained. ""Without these predators, fish populations could become out of control, and they would in turn consume too much plankton and vegetation until the system collapses.""

He emphasized the need for swift, informed action. ""As humans, we should make conscious decisions to protect the living and non-living things around us. Facing evidence of viability loss, we need to act before it is too late.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Running fixes what junk food breaks in the brain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083638.htm","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 03:33:36 GMT","

Researchers at University College Cork, led by Professor Yvonne Nolan, have uncovered the specific metabolic processes that explain how exercise helps offset the harmful behavioral effects of eating a Western-style cafeteria diet. Published on October 21 in the peer-reviewed journal Brain Medicine, the study shows that voluntary running can reduce depression-like behaviors triggered by diets high in fat and sugar. These changes appear to involve both circulating hormones and metabolites produced in the gut. The discovery offers valuable insight into how lifestyle habits like exercise can be used to support mental well-being in an age where ultra-processed foods are common.

To investigate, the team studied adult male rats fed either a standard chow diet or a rotating cafeteria diet made up of high-fat, high-sugar foods for seven and a half weeks. Half of the animals in each group were given access to a running wheel. This setup allowed the researchers to distinguish the separate and combined influences of diet quality and physical activity on the brain and behavior.

Novel Mechanisms Connecting Exercise and Mood

The findings showed that voluntary running produced an antidepressant-like effect even when the rats consumed an unhealthy diet, suggesting that regular physical activity could benefit people who eat Western-style foods.

Using a comprehensive metabolomic approach, Professor Nolan and her colleagues examined the caecal contents of the animals and found that the cafeteria diet profoundly altered gut metabolism. Out of 175 metabolites analyzed in sedentary rats, 100 were significantly affected. Exercise influenced a smaller subset of these, partially restoring the balance. Three metabolites known to play a role in mood regulation -- anserine, indole-3-carboxylate, and deoxyinosine -- were reduced by the cafeteria diet but rebounded with exercise.

Behavioral tests assessing learning, memory, and emotional responses revealed further insights. The cafeteria diet alone did not greatly impair spatial learning or recognition memory, but exercise slightly improved navigation skills. The researchers also found mild anti-anxiety effects from exercise that occurred regardless of diet type.

What are caecal contents?

The term caecal contents refers to the material found inside the caecum, a pouch located at the beginning of the large intestine. In animals such as rats, this area is rich in gut microbes that help break down food and produce a wide variety of chemical compounds called metabolites. Scientists often analyze caecal contents to understand how diet, exercise, or medication affect gut health and metabolism.

Hormonal Pathways in the Diet-Exercise Relationship

Analysis of blood samples revealed strong hormonal changes that mirrored the behavioral outcomes. Sedentary rats on the cafeteria diet had sharply higher insulin and leptin levels, but these elevations were significantly reduced in those that exercised. According to Dr. Minke Nota, the study's first author, this hormonal rebalancing may help explain how exercise protects against the behavioral effects of poor diet.

The team also identified intricate interactions between diet and exercise involving other hormones that regulate metabolism. In animals eating standard chow, exercise boosted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels, but this response was weakened in those on the cafeteria diet. In contrast, exercise increased peptide YY (PYY) levels only in the cafeteria-fed rats, suggesting that compensatory hormonal mechanisms help stabilize metabolism when diet quality is low.

Levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) rose substantially in response to the cafeteria diet regardless of physical activity, while glucagon levels declined. Together, these findings reveal a complex hormonal network through which diet and exercise interact to influence metabolism and brain function.

Implications for Understanding Diet-Brain Relationships

Perhaps most intriguingly, the study found that the cafeteria diet prevented the typical exercise-induced increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (formation of new neurons), as measured by doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus. In standard chow-fed animals, exercise robustly increased neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus, a brain region involved in emotion and memory. This finding suggests that diet quality may fundamentally alter the brain's capacity to benefit from physical activity at the cellular level.

The research team conducted correlation analyses to identify relationships between specific metabolites and behavioral outcomes. Several caecal metabolites including aminoadipic acid and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid showed negative associations with cognitive performance. These correlations were independent of experimental condition, suggesting fundamental relationships between gut metabolite profiles and brain function.

An accompanying editorial by Professor Julio Licinio and colleagues emphasizes the clinical relevance of these findings, noting that ""exercise has an antidepressant-like effect in the wrong dietary context, which is good news for those who have trouble changing their diet."" The editorial highlights how this research provides a biological framework for understanding why exercise remains beneficial even when dietary improvements prove challenging to implement.

Future Directions and Clinical Translation

The study raises important questions about optimal sequencing of lifestyle interventions. The findings suggest that while exercise can provide mood benefits regardless of diet quality, achieving full neuroplastic benefits may require attention to nutritional status. This has implications for designing interventions that maximize both feasibility and biological impact.

Several limitations warrant consideration. The study was conducted exclusively in male rats, and sex differences in metabolic and neurogenic responses to diet and exercise are well-documented. Additionally, the seven-week intervention period may not capture longer-term adaptations that could emerge with chronic exposure. Future studies incorporating female animals, longer intervention periods, and dose-response designs will help refine understanding of these complex interactions.

The research also opens new avenues for investigating specific metabolites as potential therapeutic targets. The protective effects of exercise on anserine, indole-3-carboxylate, and deoxyinosine levels suggest these compounds may serve as biomarkers or even therapeutic agents for mood disorders. The strong correlations between specific gut metabolites and behavioral measures support growing interest in the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a target for mental health interventions.

This peer-reviewed research represents a significant advance in understanding the biological mechanisms linking diet, exercise, and mental health, offering new insights into how lifestyle factors interact at molecular and cellular levels to influence brain function. The findings challenge existing paradigms about the relationship between metabolic and mental health by demonstrating that exercise can provide antidepressant-like effects even in the context of poor dietary choices. By employing innovative metabolomic approaches combined with comprehensive behavioral and neurobiological assessments, the research team has generated data that not only advances fundamental knowledge but also suggests practical applications for addressing the mental health challenges associated with modern dietary patterns. The reproducibility and validation of these findings through the peer-review process ensures their reliability and positions them as a foundation for future investigations. This work exemplifies how cutting-edge research can bridge the gap between basic science and translational applications, potentially impacting individuals struggling with mood disorders in the coming years.

A day of strong sunlight can spoil more than just a beach outing -- it can also harm the process of photosynthesis, the way plants and other organisms convert sunlight into energy. Underwater, however, certain algae have evolved a unique way to stay protected. Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and their collaborators discovered that a pigment known as siphonein helps marine green algae continue photosynthesizing efficiently, even under intense light.

Protecting the Machinery of Photosynthesis

Photosynthetic organisms use complex molecular systems called light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) to absorb sunlight and convert it into usable energy. When chlorophyll, the green pigment central to photosynthesis, absorbs light, it becomes excited and passes that energy to reaction centers that fuel chemical processes. Under too much light, though, chlorophyll can enter a dangerous ""triplet"" state, producing reactive oxygen molecules that can damage cells.

""Organisms use carotenoids to quickly dissipate excess energy, or quench these triplet states, through a process called triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET),"" said Ritsuko Fujii, lead author and associate professor at the Graduate School of Science and Research Center for Artificial Photosynthesis at Osaka Metropolitan University.

Until recently, the exact details of how this protective process works were not well understood.

A Closer Look at Codium fragile

To investigate, the research team turned to Codium fragile, a type of marine green alga. Like land plants, it has a light-harvesting antenna complex called LHCII, but it also contains rare carotenoids such as siphonein and siphonaxanthin. These pigments allow the algae to use green light -- common in underwater environments -- for photosynthesis.

""The key to the quenching mechanism lies in how quickly and efficiently the triplet states can be deactivated,"" said Alessandro Agostini, researcher at the University of Padua, Italy and co-lead author of the study.

The researchers used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, a technique that directly measures triplet excited states, to compare spinach with Codium fragile. In spinach, traces of harmful chlorophyll triplet states remained. But in Codium fragile, those signals disappeared entirely, showing that its carotenoids successfully neutralize the damaging energy.

""Our research has revealed that the antenna structure of photosynthetic green algae has an excellent photoprotective function,"" Agostini said.

How Siphonein Shields Algae From Sun Damage

By combining EPR data with quantum chemical simulations, the researchers identified siphonein, located at a critical binding site in the LHCII complex, as the key pigment responsible for this defense. They also revealed how its molecular structure and positioning make it especially effective at dispersing excess energy.

These findings show that marine algae have evolved specialized pigments not only to absorb the blue-green light available underwater but also to withstand the damaging effects of intense sunlight.

From Ocean Discovery to Solar Innovation

Beyond improving our understanding of photosynthesis, this research could influence the design of bio-inspired solar technologies that protect themselves from light damage. Such systems might lead to more durable and efficient renewable energy solutions.

""We hope to further clarify the structural characteristics of carotenoids that increase quenching efficiency, ultimately enabling the molecular design of pigments that optimize photosynthetic antennae,"" Fujii said.

The study was published in Cell Reports Physical Science.

A tiny wireless chip placed at the back of the eye, combined with a pair of advanced smart glasses, has partially restored vision to people suffering from an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration. In a clinical study led by Stanford Medicine and international collaborators, 27 of the 32 participants regained the ability to read within a year of receiving the implant.

With the help of digital features such as adjustable zoom and enhanced contrast, some participants achieved visual sharpness comparable to 20/42 vision.

The study's findings were published on Oct. 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

A Milestone in Restoring Functional Vision

The implant, named PRIMA and developed at Stanford Medicine, is the first prosthetic eye device to restore usable vision to individuals with otherwise untreatable vision loss. The technology enables patients to recognize shapes and patterns, a level of vision known as form vision.

""All previous attempts to provide vision with prosthetic devices resulted in basically light sensitivity, not really form vision,"" said Daniel Palanker, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology and a co-senior author of the paper. ""We are the first to provide form vision.""

The research was co-led by José-Alain Sahel, MD, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, with Frank Holz, MD, of the University of Bonn in Germany, serving as lead author.

How the PRIMA System Works

The system includes two main parts: a small camera attached to a pair of glasses and a wireless chip implanted in the retina. The camera captures visual information and projects it through infrared light to the implant, which converts it into electrical signals. These signals substitute for the damaged photoreceptors that normally detect light and send visual data to the brain.

The PRIMA project represents decades of scientific effort, involving numerous prototypes, animal testing, and an initial human trial.

Palanker first conceived the idea two decades ago while working with ophthalmic lasers to treat eye disorders. ""I realized we should use the fact that the eye is transparent and deliver information by light,"" he said.

""The device we imagined in 2005 now works in patients remarkably well.""

Replacing Lost Photoreceptors

Participants in the latest trial had an advanced stage of age-related macular degeneration known as geographic atrophy, which progressively destroys central vision. This condition affects over 5 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among older adults.

In macular degeneration, the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the central retina deteriorate, leaving only limited peripheral vision. However, many of the retinal neurons that process visual information remain intact, and PRIMA capitalizes on these surviving structures.

The implant, measuring just 2 by 2 millimeters, is placed in the area of the retina where photoreceptors have been lost. Unlike natural photoreceptors that respond to visible light, the chip detects infrared light emitted from the glasses.

""The projection is done by infrared because we want to make sure it's invisible to the remaining photoreceptors outside the implant,"" Palanker said.

Combining Natural and Artificial Vision

This design allows patients to use both their natural peripheral vision and the new prosthetic central vision simultaneously, improving their ability to orient themselves and move around.

""The fact that they see simultaneously prosthetic and peripheral vision is important because they can merge and use vision to its fullest,"" Palanker said.

Since the implant is photovoltaic -- relying solely on light to generate electrical current -- it operates wirelessly and can be safely placed beneath the retina. Earlier versions of artificial eye devices required external power sources and cables that extended outside the eye.

Reading Again

The new trial included 38 patients older than 60 who had geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration and worse than 20/320 vision in at least one eye.

Four to five weeks after implantation of the chip in one eye, patients began using the glasses. Though some patients could make out patterns immediately, all patients' visual acuity improved over months of training.

""It may take several months of training to reach top performance -- which is similar to what cochlear implants require to master prosthetic hearing,"" Palanker said.

Of the 32 patients who completed the one-year trial, 27 could read and 26 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity, which was defined as the ability to read at least two additional lines on a standard eye chart. On average, participants' visual acuity improved by 5 lines; one improved by 12 lines.

The participants used the prosthesis in their daily lives to read books, food labels and subway signs. The glasses allowed them to adjust contrast and brightness and magnify up to 12 times. Two-thirds reported medium to high user satisfaction with the device.

Nineteen participants experienced side effects, including ocular hypertension (high pressure in the eye), tears in the peripheral retina and subretinal hemorrhage (blood collecting under the retina). None were life-threatening, and almost all resolved within two months.

Future Visions

For now, the PRIMA device provides only black-and-white vision, with no shades in between, but Palanker is developing software that will soon enable the full range of grayscale.

""Number one on the patients' wish list is reading, but number two, very close behind, is face recognition,"" he said. ""And face recognition requires grayscale.""

He is also engineering chips that will offer higher resolution vision. Resolution is limited by the size of pixels on the chip. Currently, the pixels are 100 microns wide, with 378 pixels on each chip. The new version, already tested in rats, may have pixels as small as 20 microns wide, with 10,000 pixels on each chip.

Palanker also wants to test the device for other types of blindness caused by lost photoreceptors.

""This is the first version of the chip, and resolution is relatively low,"" he said. ""The next generation of the chip, with smaller pixels, will have better resolution and be paired with sleeker-looking glasses.""

A chip with 20-micron pixels could give a patient 20/80 vision, Palanker said. ""But with electronic zoom, they could get close to 20/20.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI turns x-rays into time machines for arthritis care","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251022023116.htm","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:59:28 GMT","

A new artificial intelligence system developed by researchers at the University of Surrey can forecast what a patient's knee X-ray might look like one year in the future. This breakthrough could reshape how millions of people living with osteoarthritis understand and manage their condition.

The research, presented at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025), describes a powerful AI model capable of generating realistic ""future"" X-rays along with a personalized risk score that estimates disease progression. Together, these outputs give doctors and patients a visual roadmap of how osteoarthritis may evolve over time.

A Major Step Forward in Predicting Osteoarthritis Progression

Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disorder that affects more than 500 million people globally, is the leading cause of disability among older adults. The Surrey system was trained on nearly 50,000 knee X-rays from about 5,000 patients, making it one of the largest datasets of its kind. It can predict disease progression roughly nine times faster than similar AI tools and operates with greater efficiency and accuracy. Researchers believe this combination of speed and precision could help integrate the technology into clinical practice more quickly.

David Butler, the study's lead author from the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) and the Institute for People-Centred AI, explained:

""We're used to medical AI tools that give a number or a prediction, but not much explanation. Our system not only predicts the likelihood of your knee getting worse -- it actually shows you a realistic image of what that future knee could look like. Seeing the two X-rays side by side -- one from today and one for next year -- is a powerful motivator. It helps doctors act sooner and gives patients a clearer picture of why sticking to their treatment plan or making lifestyle changes really matters. We think this can be a turning point in how we communicate risk and improve osteoarthritic knee care and other related conditions.""

How the System Visualizes Change

At the core of the new system is an advanced generative model known as a diffusion model. It creates a ""future"" version of a patient's X-ray and identifies 16 key points in the joint to highlight areas being tracked for potential changes. This feature enhances transparency by showing clinicians exactly which parts of the knee the AI is monitoring, helping build confidence and understanding in its predictions.

The Surrey team believes their approach could be adapted for other chronic diseases. Similar AI tools might one day predict lung damage in smokers or track the progression of heart disease, providing the same kind of visual insights and early warning that this system offers for osteoarthritis. Researchers are now seeking collaborations to bring the technology into hospitals and everyday healthcare use.

Greater Transparency and Early Intervention

Gustavo Carneiro, Professor of AI and Machine Learning at Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), said:

""Earlier AI systems could estimate the risk of osteoarthritis progression, but they were often slow, opaque and limited to numbers rather than clear images. Our approach takes a big step forward by generating realistic future X-rays quickly and by pinpointing the areas of the joint most likely to change. That extra visibility helps clinicians identify high-risk patients sooner and personalize their care in ways that were not previously practical.""

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) extend survival in many patients with cancer but are ineffective in patients without pre-existing immunity1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Although personalized mRNA cancer vaccines sensitize tumours to ICIs by directing immune attacks against preselected antigens, personalized vaccines are limited by complex and time-intensive manufacturing processes10,11,12,13,14. Here we show that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 also sensitize tumours to ICIs. In preclinical models, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines led to a substantial increase in type I interferon, enabling innate immune cells to prime CD8+ T cells that target tumour-associated antigens. Concomitant ICI treatment is required for maximal efficacy in immunologically cold tumours, which respond by increasing PD-L1 expression. Similar correlates of vaccination response are found in humans, including increases in type I interferon, myeloid–lymphoid activation in healthy volunteers and PD-L1 expression on tumours. Moreover, receipt of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines within 100 days of initiating ICI is associated with significantly improved median and three-year overall survival in multiple large retrospective cohorts. This benefit is similar among patients with immunologically cold tumours. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to ICIs.

Although ICIs substantially improve survival in some patients, most patients do not benefit from these therapies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. These poor responses are attributed to immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments (TMEs) characterized by tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and may be predicted in some histologies by low intratumoural PD-L1 before immunotherapy initiation. However, there are currently no clinically available methods to improve responses to ICI by modifying the TME. We recently reported that systemic administration of highly immunogenic mRNA nanoparticles induces a viraemia-like cytokine/chemokine response that resets the systemic and intratumoural immune milieu, sensitizing resistant tumours to ICIs10,11,12,14. Although the personalized mRNA vaccines that we and others are developing remain in clinical evaluation (NCT04573140)12, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also induce robust stimulation of cytokine secretion15, and there are now multiple case reports of patients whose tumours spontaneously resolved after COVID-19 mRNA vaccines16,17. However, the impact of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines on immune therapy is unknown.

Here we report that the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination resets the cancer immunotherapy cycle and primes adaptive immunity for synergy with ICIs. We found that receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI initiation was associated with substantial improvements in overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. In preclinical models, we found that this effect required a surge in type-I interferon (IFN) that enhanced antigen-presenting cell (APC) priming of T cells in lymphoid organs. Although tumour cells subvert these primed responses by increasing PD-L1 expression, co-administration of ICIs sustains T cell responses and elicits epitope spreading against tumour-associated antigens. We revealed analogous response correlates for humans receiving COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, including heightened IFNα production, innate/adaptive immune activation and increases in tumour PD-L1 expression. Together, our results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumours to ICIs.

To determine whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were associated with improved responses to immune checkpoint blockade, we first compared the OS among a cohort of patients with stage III/IV NSCLC treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between January 2015 and September 2022 (Supplementary Table 1a). We identified 180 patients who received a COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI initiation, and 704 patients who were treated with ICI and did not receive a COVID vaccine (Supplementary Table 1a). Of the 180 patients who received an mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI initiation, 117 received the BNT162b2 vaccine and 63 received mRNA-1273 (Extended Data Fig. 1a); 24 received a priming dose only, 57 received a booster only, 93 received both a prime and a boost dose, 5 received 2 booster doses, and 1 received a priming dose and 2 booster doses within 100 days of ICI initiation (Extended Data Fig. 1b); 81 received 1 dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days, 98 received 2 doses, and 1 received 3 doses (Extended Data Fig. 1c). After controlling for 39 covariables with Cox proportional hazards regression, including clinical stage, histology, steroid use, performance status, mutation status, comorbidities and treatment year, we found that receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiation of ICI was associated with significantly improved median OS (20.6 months versus 37.3 months) and 3 year OS (30.8% versus 55.7%, adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.37–0.71, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). This survival advantage was similar for patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC (HRadj = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.16–0.89, P = 0.0268) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5) and stage IV NSCLC (HRadj = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.37–0.74, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7); patients who received mRNA vaccines from either vaccine manufacturer (Extended Data Fig. 1a); and patients who had or had not received a previous COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Patients who received two vaccines in the 100 days surrounding initiation of ICI experienced similar OS compared with those who received only one vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These results were also consistent when considering only those patients whose closest mRNA vaccine was within 100 days before their first ICI (Extended Data Fig. 1d), when narrowing the vaccination window to 50 instead of 100 days (Extended Data Fig. 1e), when restricting to only those patients treated during the pandemic (Extended Data Fig. 1f), after correcting for immortal time bias (Extended Data Fig. 1g) and with propensity score matching (PSM; Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). Patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of chemotherapy (a group that did not include targeted therapies owing to significant heterogeneity and limited patient numbers within different drug cohorts) but did not receive ICI had no detectable survival benefit (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Likewise, patients who received a pneumonia or influenza vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI (Extended Data Fig. 2b–e) and those with resectable stage III tumours (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g) experienced no improvement in survival.

a–e, Survival for patients with NSCLC (a–c) or metastatic melanoma (d,e) treated with ICI who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI or did not receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Survival is shown for all patients with NSCLC (a), patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (b), patients with stage IV NSCLC (c) and patients with metastatic melanoma (d and e). P values and HRadj were calculated using two-sided Cox proportional hazards regression (Supplementary Tables 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11), including all variables that were significantly associated with survival on univariable analysis (Supplementary Tables 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). The number of patients at risk at each timepoint is indicated below each graph.

Source Data

We then repeated this analysis in a separate cohort of patients treated with their first round of ICI for metastatic melanoma, including 43 patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI and 167 who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine (Supplementary Table 1b). Of the patients who received mRNA vaccines, 21 received BNT162b2 and 22 received mRNA-1273 (Extended Data Fig. 3a); 6 received a priming dose only, 8 received a booster only, 16 received both a prime and a boost dose, and 13 received 2 booster doses during our period of interest, (Extended Data Fig. 3b); 14 received 1 dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days, and 29 received 2 doses (Extended Data Fig. 3c). After accounting for covariables, including histology, steroid use, performance status, mutation status, comorbidities and treatment year with Cox proportional hazards regression, we found that receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI was associated with substantially improved OS (median OS, 26.67 months versus unmet; 36-month OS, 44.1% versus 67.6%; HRadj = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18–0.74, P = 0.0048) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9) and progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS, 4.0 months versus 10.3 months; 36-month PFS, 23.7% versus 39.5%; HRadj = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.40–0.98, P = 0.0383) (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). These effects were again similar for both vaccine manufacturers (Extended Data Fig. 3a), prime and boost vaccines (Extended Data Fig. 3b), patients receiving single or multiple vaccine doses (Extended Data Fig. 3c), when limiting the analysis to only patients who received their vaccine prior to initiating ICI (Extended Data Fig. 3d), when limiting the analysis to only those treated during the pandemic (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f) and when expanding the analysis to include patients on second- or third-line therapy and those without distant metastases (Extended Data Fig. 3g–i). Moreover, the survival advantage was magnified with PSM (OS: HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.18–0.77, P = 0.0063; PFS: HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.27–0.77, P = 0.0022) (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k).

To demonstrate whether effects observed in humans could be modelled in animals, we recreated commercial preparations of COVID mRNA vaccines for administration to tumour-bearing animals in conjunction with ICIs. As SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been fully sequenced, we synthesized the published mRNA construct used for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) and validated the fidelity of synthesis based on mRNA size (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) and the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies after in vivo administration to animals (Extended Data Fig. 4c). mRNA was encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and met the specification range delineated for clinical preparations of BNT162b2 based on encapsulation efficiency, size distribution, polydispersity and charge18 (Extended Data Fig. 4d–g), the latter of which we found could be disproportionately affected by buffer conditions leading to a net positive charge (Extended Data Fig. 4h). We chose mouse B16F0 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) as models to test immunogenicity and efficacy of spike RNA-LNP vaccines due to the effects of the vaccine in these clinical settings and because both tumour models are poorly responsive to ICIs. We first treated mice with two vaccine doses in conjunction with ICI treatment. We found this regimen to be superior to either monotherapy alone in mice with established B16F0 tumours with tumour volumes of about 80 mm3 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 5a), in mice with subcutaneous (s.c.) LLC (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5b) and in mice with established s.c. LLC with tumour volumes around 100 mm3 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5c). In mice with established LLC, we identified metastatic lesions in the lungs of untreated mice that were similar for monotherapy but significantly reduced with the combination treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). We also found that starting RNA-LNPs before ICI produced similar effects relative to concomitant treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5f). We next tested whether RNA-LNPs could reduce the growth of orthotopic intrapulmonary tumours. We implanted LLC cells orthotopically and administered treatment starting on day 3. In this model, the combination of RNA-LNPs and ICI resulted in superior inhibition of tumour growth as measured by lung weights (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

We next sought to understand the mechanism by which RNA-LNPs targeting the spike protein mediate these antitumour effects. To do this, we used an early treatment model of B16F0 with or without cytokine-blocking antibodies. In this model, RNA-LNPs and PD-L1 blockade each provided numerical but statistically insignificant survival benefits. However, combination therapy with RNA-LNPs and PD-L1 blockade strongly inhibited tumour growth (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Although we previously demonstrated a role for IFNα in the response to mRNA vaccines, recent evidence suggests a dominant role for IL-1 signalling in responses to the specific RNA-LNPs targeting the COVID-19 spike protein15. We therefore evaluated the importance of each pathway with antibodies blocking the IL-1 and IFNα receptors. While blockade of IL-1R had no effect on tumour growth, anti-tumour responses were completely abrogated when blocking type I interferon signalling with IFNAR1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2d). Moreover, direct administration of supraphysiologic doses of type I IFN recapitulated the antitumour effects (Extended Data Fig. 6c). However, stimulation of type I IFN signalling with low molecular mass (LMW) poly(I:C) did not elicit similar immunity (Extended Data Fig. 6d). These results highlight the importance of IFN in driving innate and adaptive immunity, and the ability to manipulate and reset the immune setpoint away from tolerance toward effector immune responses in the presence of ICIs using a commercially available mRNA preparation.

Next, we sought to assess whether other mRNA species would elicit similar antitumour effects. We first modified the protein encoded by the mRNA by replacing the spike mRNA with mRNA encoding the cytomegalovirus antigen pp65, which is overexpressed in human glioma but not in B16F0. We found no significant difference in antitumour activity between these two groups, suggesting that innate immune sensing of the mRNA itself is the primary driver of antitumour activity from mRNA vaccines (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f).

As N1-methyl-pseudouridine is used in place of uridine in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to reduce innate immune activation, we hypothesized that replacing N1-methyl-pseudouridine with uridine to activate pattern recognition receptors would provide even more robust innate immune activation and antitumour activity. As expected, replacing N1-methyl-pseudouridine with uridine in pp65 mRNA resulted in further synergy with ICI (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). However, replacing N1-methyl-pseudouridine with uridine in spike mRNA provided only numerical improvement in antitumour response (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f), suggesting that innate immune sensing is a multifactorial process that may be influenced by specific mRNA constructs.

We then completed additional studies to identify how RNA-LNPs elicit antitumour immunity. Previous work has established that RNA-LNPs stimulate type I IFN production by stimulating the intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA519. However, the mechanism by which RNA-LNPs activate this sensor is unclear. To understand this further, we first ruled out a role for dsRNA in our vaccines by measuring the level of dsRNA contamination in our manufactured ssRNA product. We found the dsRNA/ssRNA ratio in our mRNA to be 0.011% (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We then repeated our tumour growth curve incorporating an additional dsRNA-removal protocol20. With this step, we successfully removed all detectable dsRNA contamination (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Importantly, we found no change in antitumour efficacy with the complete elimination of dsRNA using this method (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Finally, we found no abrogation of type I IFN after RNA-LNP administration in mice lacking RIG-I, a critical sensor of dsRNA and activator of type I IFN response (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Together, these data suggest that dsRNA is not a major cause of the antitumour effects in our preclinical models.

We next tested whether the specific LNP construct impacted antitumour immunity with the same mRNA input. We found that anionic lipoplexes formulated as lipid particle aggregates (LPA) do not elicit similar antitumour effects (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Given that previous literature described that higher-order RNA structures may also stimulate MDA5 activation21, we hypothesized that RNA-LNPs might create higher order structures. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that RNA extracted from our RNA-LNPs contained high-molecular-mass secondary structures similar in mass to dsRNA (Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Combined with previous reports of MDA5 activation with RNA-LNPs but not with ssRNA alone, these data may suggest a mechanism by which encapsulation with LNPs forms high-molecular-mass secondary structures enabling activation of double-stranded sensing machinery (that is, MDA5) for induction of type I interferons.

We next sought to better understand the impact of RNA-LNPs on innate immune cells. IFNα was significantly elevated in both RNA-LNP and combination groups in conjunction with other T helper 1 chemokines (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 8). This surge in cytokine/chemokine response correlated with an increase in myeloid cell activation in the lymphoid organs of mice treated with RNA-LNP alone or in combination with ICI. After treatment with spike-encoding RNA-LNP, there was precipitous activation of APCs, including DCs, macrophages and Ly6C+ cells expressing MHC class II (MHC-II) in lymphoreticular organs, that was abrogated by IFNAR1 blockade (Fig. 2f–i, Extended Data Fig. 9a,b, Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Although this response was dependent on interferon signalling, the magnitude of the response could not be achieved by simply administering systemic IFNα in combination with ICI (Fig. 2f–i and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b).

Myeloid activation extended to the tumour, where receipt of RNA-LNPs was associated with IFNAR1-dependent increases in activated Ly6C+ myeloid cells (Extended Data Fig. 9c and Supplementary Fig. 3). To determine whether increased myeloid activation corresponded to enhanced presentation of tumour antigens, we treated mice with B16F10 tumours expressing chicken ovalbumin (B16F10-OVA) at days 10 and 13 and evaluated presentation of ovalbumin on MHC-I using flow cytometry. We found that spike-encoding RNA-LNPs stimulate APCs to present tumour antigens in lymphoid organs in the presence of costimulatory molecules (Fig. 2j–l and Supplementary Fig. 4). Notably, presentation of tumour antigens in the presence of costimulatory molecules was particularly enriched in Ly6C+MHC-II+ cells (Fig. 2m–o).

In addition to the precipitous activation of APCs, spike-encoding RNA-LNPs in combination with ICIs also elicited expansion of CD8+ T lymphocytes with a marked increase in activation within the effector and effector memory compartments (Fig. 3a,b, Extended Data Fig. 9d, Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Concomitant with these findings, PD-1 expression was increased in T cells and effector/effector memory CD8+ cell subsets, underscoring the potent ability of combination therapy to rapidly prime T cells (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f and Supplementary Fig. 6). Overall, these results illustrate a role for systemic immunomodulation in the recruitment of myeloid cells to lymphoid organs for tumor antigen presentation to cognate T cells.

Source Data

To confirm that spike RNA-LNPs were mediating the expansion of tumour reactive T cells, we isolated CD8+ cells from spleens of treated mice and stained them with tetramers targeting peptides with high predicted binding affinity from six melanoma-associated antigens: GP-100 EGSRNQDWL, GP-100 KVPRNQDWL, claudin 6 (CLDN6), survivin, WT1 and Trp2. We found that combination therapy with RNA-LNPs and ICIs stimulated expansion of tetramer reactive T cells targeting each of these antigens (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7). To confirm that these T cells were truly tumour reactive, we used an activation-inducible marker (AIM) assay22,23. In this assay, antigen-reactive T cells cultured ex vivo with overlapping peptide pools from the same tumour antigens are identified through tandem expression of the AIMs CD69 and 4-1BB (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 14). Using this approach, we detected a substantial increase in peptide-reactive (AIM+) CD8+ T cells from mice treated with the combination of RNA-LNPs and ICI, further supporting tumour reactivity (Fig. 3d). These data confirm that spike RNA-LNPs prime the immune response for activation, presentation and recognition of tumour-associated antigens in a manner that can be significantly expanded through concomitant treatment with ICI.

We next evaluated the T cell compartment in treated tumours. In mice with B16F0 tumours, we identified substantial infiltration of PD-1+CD8+ T cells using both immunofluorescence (Fig. 3e,f, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 15) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3g). Importantly, we found that treatment with RNA-LNPs and ICIs increased PD-1 expression on total tumour-infiltrating CD8+ cells by greater than twentyfold (2.39% versus 51.363%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3f), and that PD-1+CD8+ T cells dominated the total CD3+ T cell compartment in treated mice while representing only a small minority of total CD3+ T cells in untreated mice (5.69% versus 60.6%, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3g). We next evaluated the antigen specificity of these cells. As there were many fewer CD8+ T cells in tumours compared with in spleens after enriching CD8+ cells, we pooled the six tetramers described above for a single pan-tetramer stain containing all six targets. Using this approach, we found that CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes from mice treated with RNA-LNPs and ICIs were twice as likely to be tetramer reactive compared with non-RNA-LNP controls (3.10% versus 7.98%, P = 0.0229) (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Commensurate with the increase in tumour-reactive T lymphocytes in the TME, we found that spike-encoding RNA-LNPs significantly increased PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (Fig. 3i–k, Extended Data Fig. 9g,h and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). Blockade of IFNα signalling abrogated PD-L1 expression, confirming its importance in initiating the immunotherapy response (Extended Data Fig. 9g,h). Together, these data suggest that spike RNA-LNPs stimulate the production and infiltration of activated, tumour-reactive CD8+ T cells that overcome compensatory expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the presence of ICIs.

As there are species-specific differences in how humans and mice respond to mRNA, we next sought to confirm that the pathways identified in mouse models are relevant in humans. To do this, we collected blood and plasma samples from five healthy volunteers at the baseline and at 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14  days after receipt of mRNA-1273 Spikevax Monovalent XBB.1.5 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2023–2024 formulation, 50 μg mRNA) (Fig. 4a). We first evaluated plasma from these volunteers using the NULISA-Seq Inflammation Panel (Alamar Biosciences)—a multiplex assay designed to sensitively detect over 250 immune-related cytokines. As IFNα was found to be essential for antitumour activity in mice, we were particularly interested in the kinetics of this protein at 24 h. Notably, not only was IFNα upregulated, but it was the most upregulated cytokine at any timepoint, increasing by an average of around 280-fold relative to the baseline to a final plasma concentration between 1 and 10 pg ml−1 (Fig. 4b,c). More broadly, IL-6 and IFNγ were the only cytokines that were significantly elevated at 6 h after immunization (Fig. 4d). By contrast, a multitude of inflammatory cytokines surged at 24 h after immunization, including IFNα, IFNγ, IFNω and IFNγ-inducible protein-10 (CXCL10) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 11). Although IL-1 was not found to be significantly increased at any timepoint, IL-1R antagonist (IL1RN) was significantly elevated at 24 h, suggesting a compensatory response to a surge in IL-1 (Fig. 4d). As expected, cytokine responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination were short-lived in healthy individuals, with all cytokines returning to the baseline levels by 7 days (Fig. 4d).

a, Schematic of the experimental design in which blood was drawn from five healthy individuals at baseline and 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after Spikevax (mRNA-1273) COVID-19 mRNA immunization. b,c, Individual datapoints highlighting changes in expression of IFNα from baseline to 24 h for each of five healthy volunteers. Data are expressed as the fold change measured using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel (b). The concentration was also measured separately with NULISAseq absolute quantification (AQ) (c). d, Dynamic expression of the cytokines that are significantly elevated at 24 h at 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Significant variables were defined as those with P < 0.05 and a log2-transformed fold change with an absolute value of greater than 0.5 after linear modelling with fixed effects. Adjusted P values were calculated using moderated two-tailed t-tests with false-discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing. e,f, PD-L1 expression on circulating myeloid cells (CD3−CD19−CD56−CD11b+) (n = 5) (e) and DCs (CD3−CD19−CD56−CD11c+MHC-II+) (n = 5) (f) at 6 h, 24 h and 7 days after immunization. g,h, Activation of natural killer cells (CD56+; n = 5) (g), and T cells expressed as numbers of CD69+ cells of CD8+CD3+ cells (n = 5) (h) at 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after immunization. Data are mean ± s.e.m. P values were calculated using two-tailed paired t-tests.

Source Data

To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 mRNA-induced antiviral cytokines on immune cells, we next evaluated the phenotypes of circulating myeloid cells using flow cytometry. Consistent with our findings in mouse models, we found that mRNA immunization drove innate immune activation exemplified by increased expression of PD-L1 on circulating CD11b+ myeloid cells and CD11c+ DCs (Fig. 4e,f, Supplementary Table 16 and Supplementary Fig. 12). Vaccination was also associated with activation of natural killer cells exemplified by a doubling of expression of IL-2Rα (also known as CD25) on CD56high cells (Fig. 4g) and circulating T cells exhibited by a doubling of expression of CD69 (Fig. 4h, Supplementary Table 17 and Supplementary Fig. 13). Phenotypes for all cells normalized by 7 days, which may be a result of the lack of target in these healthy participants or lymphoreticular localization of activated T cells for polarization into memory cells.

We next repeated this study in 11 healthy volunteers who received the Comirnaty vaccine (BNT162b2, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2024–2025 formula, with 30 μg mRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10a–h). Although we found similar changes to the cytokine profile overall, the magnitude of the increase in type I IFN and innate immune activation by flow cytometry was significantly reduced with BNT162b2, which contains less mRNA relative to mRNA-1273 (Extended Data Fig. 10b–i).

As infiltration of antigen-specific T cells in tumours is known to be associated with increases in PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and was correlated with antitumour response in our preclinical models, we hypothesized that patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine would exhibit higher PD-L1 expression on their tumours. To test this hypothesis, we assembled two cohorts. We first evaluated 2,315 pathology reports from patients with NSCLC with biopsies reporting tumour proportion score (TPS), separating patients into three groups based on the timing between their biopsy and their most recent mRNA vaccine (Fig. 5a). We found that patients who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine less than 100 days before biopsy exhibited a 24% increase in mean TPS of PD-L1 compared with patients who had not received any COVID-19 mRNA vaccines before biopsy (31% versus 25%, P = 0.0450) and a 41% increase in mean TPS relative to patients who received an mRNA vaccine 100 or more days before biopsy (31% versus 22%, P = 0.0099) (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 10j). As a TPS of 50% is a clinically important threshold to determine whether patients with NSCLC are eligible for single-agent immunotherapy instead of chemoimmunotherapy, we next evaluated these data as a binary outcome around this threshold. Notably, we found that patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine were 29% more likely to meet or exceed the 50% TPS threshold over unvaccinated patients (36% versus 28%, P = 0.0295) (Fig. 5c), suggesting that mRNA vaccines have a sufficient impact on TPS to modify treatment decisions. By contrast, pre-biopsy influenza and pneumonia vaccines were not associated with TPS changes (Fig. 5d).

To evaluate the impact of vaccination in each clinical setting, patients were excluded if they received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine before their biopsy. o, OS of unvaccinated patients with stage IV NSCLC stratified by era of ICI start who had baseline TPS < 1% at biopsy. P values and HRs were calculated using log-rank (Mantel–Cox, two-sided) tests (i–o).

Source Data

To expand our findings beyond NSCLC and melanoma, we assembled a separate cohort including all patients at our quaternary referral centre with pathology reports including the term ‘PD-L1' in a four-year period including the pandemic era (Fig. 5e). Together, we identified 5,317 unique pathology reports from January 2020 to October 2023 with the term ‘PD-L1' including 2,831 reporting TPS from a diverse array of patients representing a variety of primary sites and histologies (Fig. 5f). In this cohort, receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days before biopsy was associated with a 37% increase in TPS (13.3% versus 9.7%, P = 0.0364) (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10k), similar to the effect seen in patients with NSCLC. As in the NSCLC cohort, influenza vaccines were not associated with similar increases in TPS (Fig. 5h). We next repeated the survival analysis in this broad patient cohort, including patients at our institution with a biopsy for PD-L1 during our dates of interest who received ICI (n = 888). In this cohort, patients who received any COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI experienced significantly improved survival relative to their unvaccinated peers (P = 0.0038, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60–0.90) (Fig. 5i). This effect was consistent when limited to patients who received their vaccine within 100 days before the start of ICI (P = 0.0311, HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60–0.96) (Fig. 5j) and patients who started their ICI during the pandemic era (P = 0.0056, HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60–0.91) (Fig. 5k).

We next sought to evaluate whether vaccination could restore immune sensitivity in patients with immunologically ‘cold' tumors. We used pre-vaccine TPS as a surrogate for immune sensitivity, as NSCLC patients with TPS <1% have reduced benefit from ICIs compared to patients with baseline TPS >1%. Among patients with stage IV NSCLC and baseline TPS <1%, those who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI exhibited OS similar to that of patients with baseline TPS >1%, suggesting restored sensitivity to ICIs (Fig. 5l). In addition, the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and OS was similar for patients with TPS <1% relative to those patients with a TPS at biopsy of 1–49.9% or ≥50% (Fig. 5l–n). This effect was not explained by changes in patient management during the pandemic period, as patients with stage IV NSCLC with TPS < 1% at biopsy who did not receive a vaccine had similar outcomes before and during the pandemic era (Fig. 5o).

Together, these data suggest a model in which mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumour-related antigens stimulate robust antitumour immune responses that sensitize tumors to ICIs (Extended Data Fig. 11). mRNA vaccines first stimulate a surge in antiviral cytokines, including IFNα, that drive systemic innate immune activation. Tumour-resident innate immune cells activated by this cytokine surge prime T cells, which become activated and infiltrate tumours. Although tumour cells evade attack by upregulating PD-L1 expression, combination with ICI enables COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to overcome this compensatory response, eliciting tumour regression and improved survival.

Immunotherapy promises to deliver systemic anti-cancer therapy with long-term memory preventing recurrence. However, immunotherapy with ICIs relies on pre-existing anti-cancer immunity, which is absent in most patients. mRNA vaccines have recently emerged as a promising strategy to generate anti-cancer immunity to magnify the effects of ICIs24,25,26,27. Here we used mRNA vaccines targeting the COVID-19 spike protein to demonstrate a mechanism by which mRNA vaccines improve survival in combination with ICI, even when the mRNA does not encode tumour antigens. Spike RNA-LNPs elicit body-wide APC activation, leading to the expansion of highly activated tumour specific T cells. When combined with ICIs, these T cells mediate tumour regression. As personalized neoantigen vaccines require considerable manufacturing time, off-the-shelf RNA-LNPs targeting tumour-associated or even infectious disease antigens may represent widely available, low-cost alternatives for patients waiting for personalized neoantigen vaccines or in settings in which personalized neoantigen vaccines are not available.

Although the local injection of RNA-LNPs for infectious disease or personalized cancer vaccines does not aim to directly modify the tumour immune microenvironment, we show here that even local injection of RNA-LNPs containing N1-methyl-pseudouridine to minimize innate immune activation produces sufficient stimulus to reprogram TMEs and sensitize tumours to ICI. Moreover, we find that augmenting innate immune activation by replacing N1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA with unmodified mRNA may further enhance the antitumour effects of this approach. The surprising effectiveness of this approach may explain the relative success of mRNA vaccines compared with other methodologies that also generate T cells reactive against targeted neoepitopes10,11,12,13,28,29.

We show that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines increase PD-L1 expression on tumours, rendering immunologically cold tumours sensitive to ICIs. These results reveal that the timing of a routine immunization might influence treatment trajectories, and provide an over-the-counter means to overcome intrinsic ICI resistance. More broadly, they establish systemic innate immune modulation as a strategy to sensitize tumours to ICIs, and position off-the-shelf RNA therapeutics targeting infectious disease antigens as universal modulators of antitumour immunity.

These findings define a role for widely available vaccines for enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Although we focus on a single therapeutic due to its wide availability, these data could pave the way for other universal mRNA therapeutics specifically designed to reset patient immune systems for enhanced response to immunotherapy.

We completed a non-interventional, retrospective review of patient data using the MDACC electronic health record system, which contains a record of the patients who are treated at the primary campus of MDACC, a large quaternary cancer hospital in Houston, Texas. The chart review for this study involved three groups of patients: (1) patients with tumour biopsies confirming stage III or stage IV NSCLC between January 2017 and September 2022; (2) patients with melanoma of any stage who received single- or multi-agent immune checkpoint blockade between January 2019 and December 2022; and (3) a tissue-agnostic cohort, which included all patients with pathology results for PD-L1 from January 2020 to October 2023 at our institution across a wide range of histologies. This study was approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective and de-identified nature of the data. The data-collection cut-off was 1 September 2024; data analysis was performed from 1 September 2024 to 29 July 2025.

In the NSCLC dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (such as age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (brain, liver), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS; range, 0–5) near the initiation of immunotherapy, radiation therapy in the time around immunotherapy start, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), history of other primary tumours, steroid use around immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence or progression, ICI agent names and start dates, COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination dates, and TPS. Recorded PD-L1 expression as reported below was required for inclusion in the survival analysis for NSCLC. For patients with multiple biopsies, the PD-L1 expression recorded from the closest biopsy to ICI start was used for analysis.

In the melanoma dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (including age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (for example, brain, liver), PS (range, 0–5) at the initiation of immunotherapy, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (for example, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), other primary tumour data, steroid use around COVID-19 vaccination and immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence/progression, ICI agent names and start dates, and COVID-19 vaccination dates. Although our dataset did not include specific vaccine formulations administered to each patient, vaccine formulations administered during the study period included the original monovalent mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna (100 µg mRNA prime, 50 µg mRNA booster) released on 18 December 2020; the bivalent Moderna vaccine targeting the original strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (50 µg mRNA) released on 1 September 2022; the original monovalent vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (30 µg mRNA prime and booster) released on 11 December 2020; and the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent formulation (30 µg mRNA) released on 31 August 2022.

Patients were separated into two groups: (1) patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days of ICI start; and (2) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Survival analysis was performed using these groups, with subanalysis involving staging of the tumour, brand of mRNA vaccine, number of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, location of metastases and cycle of immunotherapy.

For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in both the NSCLC and melanoma datasets, OS was calculated as the time between the date of immunotherapy start closest to the mRNA vaccination date, and the last follow-up date or date of death. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, OS was calculated as the time between the initiation of their first ICI start and the date of death or last follow-up. For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between the initiation of ICI closest to mRNA vaccination and the first incidence of either pathology-confirmed recurrence or imaging-confirmed progression, whichever occurred earlier, that was declared progression in their primary medical oncologist's clinical notes. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between their first ICI start date and clinician-confirmed progression as described above. Patients who progressed before the receipt of mRNA vaccination were included in the vaccination group for this analysis. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated using GraphPad Prism.

For Cox proportional hazards regression, time-dependent variables were defined as described in the figure captions. Continuous/numbered variables (such as age, BMI, PD-L1 expression, ECOG and treatment year) were retained as numeric. Binary and categorical variables (for example, stage, gender, mutational status, comorbidities) were converted into factors. For each variable, we constructed individual Cox proportional hazards models. HRs, 95% CIs (Wald) and P values were extracted from model summaries. Variables with P < 0.05 in univariable analysis were considered for multivariable modelling. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions were similarly generated with significant variables from univariable analysis. For multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions, patients with missing values were excluded from analyses.

Categories with fewer than five cases are reported for completeness but were considered not statistically meaningful due to convergence and insufficient data for reliable inference. Variables with significant relationships with survival were included in multivariable analyses (MVAs), and those significant after MVA (P < 0.05) were included in PSM. Certain variables (for example, steroid use within 1 month of vaccine) represented subgroups of the treatment cohort by definition. These were evaluated descriptively and in univariable models but were not included as covariables in MVAs, as they do not represent baseline confounders and were not significant on univariable analysis.

We assessed the proportional hazards assumption in multivariate models by evaluating Schoenfeld residuals and found no major violations.

A small number of patients in the NSCLC dataset did not have documented ECOG scores, which were an important predictor of outcomes in Cox proportional hazards regression. BMI had missingness in initial univariable analyses but, because it was not required for PSM, imputation was not performed to address the missingness. Multivariable logistic regression and ridge regression were used to evaluate associations between ECOG missingness and clinically relevant pretreatment covariables. Ridge regression was selected due to multicollinearity between important variables that could not be excluded from the model. Variables not included in models predicting ECOG missingness were vaccination status, steroid usage within a timeframe of vaccination or ICI, PD-L1, concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy agent and BMI (as mentioned above). Subsequent ridge regression analysis suggested that ECOG scores in this analysis had a high probability of exhibiting missingness at random.

Given the small sample size in the stage III NSCLC dataset treatment group, multiple imputation was performed to estimate missing ECOG values using chained equations and the R package MICE, where predictive mean matching (PMM) (with set.seed(2025)) was used to create five imputed datasets. Variables used for imputation were chosen based on large absolute ridge regression coefficients (|β| > 0.3) and clinical relevance to ensure that prediction of ECOG missingness occurred with accuracy. After selection using regression coefficients, age and previous cycles of systemic therapy were included due to clinical importance. To facilitate PSM while maintaining power in patients with stage III NSCLC, the mode of the five imputed ECOG values was used as a single value for each patient (n = 5). This approach was necessary to minimize variance inflation and avoid diluting treatment effects in a very small sample. As PMM is random, small deviations in variable definition, factor levels and row ordering may result in slightly different imputed values. However, sensitivity analyses with slightly different mode selection in the case of ties, different seeds and an increased number of datasets (n = 20 or n = 10 rather than n = 5) revealed similar outcomes (P < 0.05) after subsequent matching. The plausibility of imputed values was assessed using density plots, which demonstrated appropriate range and overlap between observed and imputed ECOG values.

After imputation, PSM was performed using the R MatchIt package. A logistic regression model was used to estimate propensity scores, predicting treatment assignment of ‘vaccine within 100 days' or ‘no vaccine' with covariables based on significant factors associated with survival from MVA, including original or imputed ECOG scores. Across all propensity score analyses, nearest-neighbour matching was performed on the previously estimated propensity scores to identify a balanced cohort. In the case of stage III unresectable NSCLC PSM, nearest-neighbour PSM was performed with a caliper of 0.1 and a 2:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients in stage III UR NSCLC to improve covariable balance and maximize statistical power. Sensitivity analysis with removal of ECOG from the PSM model revealed similar trends.

In stage IV NSCLC, patients with missing ECOG were excluded due to sufficient remaining sample size. PSM was once again performed with nearest-neighbour matching, with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients. Sensitivity analyses with removal of ECOG from PSM rather than imputation and with the same methods as reported in stage III NSCLC (with the same caliper of 0.1 but with a ratio of 1:1 rather than 2:1) also each revealed statistically significant results.

No imputation was performed in the melanoma cohort due to completeness of variables. The melanoma PSM analyses were run with nearest-neighbour matching with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients.

Across all matched cohorts, absolute standardized mean differences (|SMD|) of pscores were consistently less than 0.05 after matching, indicating excellent balance between groups. Balance diagnostics were confirmed visually using jitter plots and histograms of propensity scores.

The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival distributions for the matched groups. Log-rank tests were conducted to assess the differences between treatment groups. GraphPad Prism was used to visualize Kaplan–Meier curves, 95% CIs and at-risk numbers at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 months, including after extraction of propensity score-matched data from R. Comparisons between groups in primary datasets (Fig. 1) were reported as adjusted HRs calculated with Cox proportional hazard regression. Comparisons between groups in subgroup analyses were reported as unadjusted HRs calculated with log-rank tests to preserve robustness. P values are reported for primary survival analyses.

In settings in which Kaplan–Meier curves crossed, the restricted mean survival time was calculated using area under the curve analysis of the absolute differences between arms at 12 and 24 months.

All statistical analyses were conducted in R v.4.4.2 (2024-10-31) and GraphPad Prism.

For patients in both the tissue-agnostic cohort and the NSCLC dataset, biopsy date, pathology reports, histological information and diagnosis codes were collected for patients who had received a biopsy with pathology evaluating PD-L1 at MD Anderson (from January 2020 to October 2023 for the tissue-agnostic cohort and August 2016 to August 2022 for the NSCLC cohort). PD-L1 on tumour cells (TPS) and PD-L1 on tumour cells and immune cells together (CPS) were obtained from pathology reports. Data were curated according to the following principles: (1) simple quantitative values were replicated exactly; (2) TPS values of “<1%” were reported as 0%; (3) for patients with a CPS of 0% or CPS <1% with no TPS value, TPS was reported as 0%, as CPS of 0 or <1% implies a lack of expression of PD-L1 on both tumour cells and myeloid cells; (4) TPS values between 1.1 and 49.9 reported as “<x%” or “>x%” were excluded due to lack of interpretability; (5) TPS values of >50% were recorded as 50% and TPS values >60% were recorded as 60%, and so on, as these values indicate high PD-L1 expression. For ranges of PD-L1 expression (for example, 0–5%), the median of the numbers in the range was taken as an approximate estimation of PD-L1 on tumours. Replicate patient biopsies (repeat biopsies performed on the same patient within 2 months of a previous biopsy) were excluded, and the earliest biopsy was included.

Separately, survival was analysed in the tumour-agnostic dataset with any COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI compared with patients who had no recorded history of a COVID-19 vaccine. Survival analysis was performed as listed in the NSCLC dataset for all patients in this dataset who were treated with ICI in this cohort. TPS values were not required for inclusion.

For group-wise analysis, patients in these cohorts were grouped into (1) those who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccination less than 100 days before tissue biopsy; (2) patients who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccine more than or exactly 100 days before tissue biopsy; and (3) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination before biopsy. Patients who received non-mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines within 100 days before biopsy were included in the no-vaccine group.

Studies in healthy volunteers were approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from each healthy participant before plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected and stored at baseline, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h, or baseline, 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, depending on the formulation used. BNT162b2 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2024–2025 formula, with 30 μg mRNA) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax Monovalent XBB.1.5, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2023–2024 formulation, with 50 μg mRNA) were used for the first and second timeframes, respectively. Frozen plasma was thawed and analysed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel 250 by Alamar Biosciences. Absolute quantification of IFNα concentrations was performed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel AQ. Statistical analysis was performed using R, in which we evaluated significance using a linear model with fixed effects based on the time from vaccine and controlling for patient ID (paired), including accommodation of biological variance between the baselines using the limma package's duplicateCorrelation function. P values were calculated using moderated t-tests with FDR correction for multiple testing. For comparisons between Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, we used a linear modelling approach (limma) to assess the log2-transformed fold change in cytokine concentrations per-patient from the baseline to 6 h and 24 h. Moderated t-tests with empirical Bayes shrinkage were applied, and P values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method. Contrasts were constructed to directly compare Moderna versus Pfizer for each timepoint. Cytokines were visualized if they demonstrated significant differences between Moderna and Pfizer from the baseline to 6 h or 24 h (absolute value of log2-transformed fold change greater than 0.5 and FDR-corrected P < 0.05). Mean expression values per condition were normalized to the baseline and visualized. Volcano plots were generated using R. Heat maps and graphs of cytokines with significant changes in relative expression in the plasma at 24 h were generated in GraphPad Prism.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and immediately transferred into a 50 ml tube containing 9 ml of complete RPMI medium (RPMI + 10% FBS) at a ratio of 1 part cells to 9 parts medium. Cells were centrifuged at 400g for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated with live/dead marker (1 µl per 1,000 µl of cell suspension, containing 1–10 million cells per ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, 3 ml of PBS + 2% FBS was added, and the cells were centrifuged again at 400g for 8 min and the supernatant was decanted. Cells were then pre-incubated with 5 µl of Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) per 100 µl of cell suspension for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and centrifuged at 400g for 6 min. After decanting the supernatant, 10 µl of Brilliant buffer was added to each tube, and the mixture was allowed to sit for 5 min before addition of antibodies targeting extracellular markers and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and fixed in the dark for 45 min at 4 °C with 500 µl of fixation solution (BD). Cells were then permeabilized with 2 ml permeabilization buffer. Intracellular stains were added in permeabilization buffer, and cells were incubated for approximately 40 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in 200 µl of PBS + 2% FBS. Analysis was then conducted using Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometer.

All mouse experiments and procedures were approved by the University of Florida or the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice (aged 4–10 weeks) were maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and 35% humidity under a 14 h–10 h light–dark cycle. Mice were randomized prior to treatment. Tumour measurements were performed blinded to the treatment group. Euthanasia was performed by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with approved protocols. Humane end points included tumour ulceration.

C57BL/6 and Rigi-knockout mice (C57BL/6NJ-Rigiem1(IMPC)J/Mmjax) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (046070-JAX) and bred in house. Tumour-bearing mice were implanted s.c. with 50,000 B16F0 melanoma cells, 1 million B16F10-OVA melanoma cells or 200,000 LLC cells in the right flank. Orthotopic LLC models were implemented by implanting 100,000 LLC cells into the left lung of C57BL6 mice through direct injection below the 9th rib. A mix of male and female mice was used for experiments with B16F0, and male mice were used for experiments with LLC. All mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 25 μg per dose of RNA-LNP or RNA-LPA (mRNA fraction)12. We administered anti-mouse IFNα receptor (aIFNAR1, Bio X Cell, BE0241) and anti-mouse IL-1R (Bio X Cell, BE0256) antibodies intraperitoneally at an initial dose of 500 μg per mouse for the first dose, followed by a maintenance dose of 250 μg per mouse twice a week for the remaining treatment period. Anti-PD-L1 (Bio X Cell, BE0101) checkpoint inhibitor was administered at 400 μg per mouse for the initial dose, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 μg per mouse twice a week for the remaining treatment period. Anti-PD-1 (Bio X Cell, BE0146) checkpoint inhibitor was administered at an initial dose of 400 μg per mouse, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 μg per mouse. LMW poly(I:C) (InvivoGen, tlrl-picw) was administered intramuscularly with 25 μg per mice for two doses. Tumours were measured at a frequency of three times a week starting on day 8 until more than 20% of mice reached the end point. Mice were euthanized after reaching the humane end point.

SARS-CoV-2 spike coding sequence with K986P and V987P mutations was inserted into a pGEM-4Z backbone downstream of the T7 promoter with previously published UTRs and poly(A) signal analogous to the mRNA in BNT162b230,31. The 5′ SpeI restriction site was removed from the sequence to allow for restriction of the poly(A) tail. The T7 promoter was changed to have an AGG initiator sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (NEB, E0554) according to the company's recommended protocol. Plasmids were grown in NEB5a competent Escherichia coli and purified using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, 75162) and sequenced using whole-plasmid sequencing by Genewiz. Plasmids were restricted by using 2 U μg−1 SpeI HF (NEB, R3133L) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by DNA precipitation. mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 mRNA Kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A57620). Spike mRNA was made using CleanCap reagent AG (3′ OMe) (Trilink, N-7413-5) and N1-methylpseudouridine-5′-triphosphate (Trilink, N-1081-10). PP65 mRNA was capped using ARCA (NEB, S1411L) followed by treatment with mRNA cap 2′-O-methyltransferase (NEB, M0366L). The in vitro transcription reaction was performed at 20 °C for 10 h. DNA was removed according to the kit instructions and RNA was purified using the RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen, 75162). RNA was eluted in purified RNase-free water and stored at −80°C until use. mRNA was checked for quality using an Agilent TapeStation 4150. After thawing, RNA was diluted to 100 µg ml−1 in RNase-free water followed by incubation at room temperature or 72 °C for 3 min. Then 100 ng of RNA or 1 µl of ladder was added to 5 µl of RNA ScreenTape sample buffer (Agilent, 5067-5577) and mixed at 2,000 rpm for 1 min. The samples were run using an RNA ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5576). For dsRNA removal, the method described previously was followed20. In brief, mRNA was precipitated and reconstituted in chromatography buffer. Cellulose fibres (Sigma-Aldrich, C6288-100G) suspended in chromatography buffer were added to Nucleospin filter units (Macherey-Nagel, 740606) followed by washing. Up to 500 μg of RNA per filter unit was added to cellulose and incubated by rapid mixing for 30 min. RNA was recovered by centrifugation, and incubation was repeated using a second column containing cellulose fibres. RNA was then filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Pall, 4604) to remove any cellulose particulate before being precipitated and reconstituted in RNase-free water20.

Before complexation, 0.5 M of RNase-free citrate buffer (pH 3.75) (Teknova, Custom order) was added to the RNA for a final concentration of 0.1 M. ALC-0159 (Avanti, 880155 P), ALC-0315 (Avanti, 890900 O), cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, C8667) and DSPC (Avanti, 850365P) were reconstituted in 100% ethanol at a ratio of 1.7:47.5:40.8:10. Lipids and RNA were mixed at a 3:1 FRR on a Nanonsemblr Ignite (Precision NanoSystems, now part of Cytiva) for an N/P ratio of 6. RNA-LNPs were dialysed overnight at 4 °C with two buffer exchanges at the 3 h and 6 h timepoints using a 3.5 kDA dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A52967). After dialysis, LNPs were filtered through the 0.2 µM Supor EX ECV filter (Pall, KS2ECV2S). LNPs were concentrated using 30 kDA Amicon filters (Millipore, UFC903024) by centrifugation at 2,000g. The final LNP formulation had sucrose dissolved in PBS added for a final concentration of 12%. Anionic RNA-LPAs were made as previously described12. In brief, DOTAP liposomes 2.5 mg ml−1 were mixed with mRNA at a 1:1 mass to mass ratio and complexed for 15 min at room temperature before administration.

RNA concentration was determined in LNPs using the RiboGreen assay (Invitrogen, R11490) using the BioTek Cytation 3 plate reader. The encapsulation efficiency was determined by comparing readings to LNPs in TE buffer versus LNPs in 1% Triton X-100. LNPs were diluted up to 500 μg ml−1 with PBS before injection. Empty LNPs were used at a volume consistent with the dose of RNA-LNPs fabricated using the same steps and same amounts of lipids. Fluorescence values were plotted in a standard curve with an extrapolation factor set to 1.1. The values from wells with Triton X-100 (total mRNA) and TE buffer (free mRNA) was entered into the following equation: EE% = [1 – (Free RNA/Total RNA)] × 100%. Total mRNA RNA-LNPs were also loaded onto a 1% agarose gel made in 1× TAE buffer (Quality Biological, 351-008-131) with GelRed (Biotium, 41003-T). Then 500 ng of RNA was loaded into LNPs and free RNA was mixed with 6× SDS-free (NEB, B7025S) loading dye and run at 90 V for 45 min. Particle size was acquired using a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra and NanoSight's NS300. Before particle-size, PDI, concentration and surface ζ potential analysis, LNPs were diluted 100-fold with HyClone HyPure water (Cytiva, SH30538.02). They were and run in triplicate at 25 °C on the Zetasizer. Orthogonal particle-size distribution and concentration measurements were carried out using Malvern's NanoSight NS300 NTA equipment. Each LNP sample was diluted 500-fold with PBS and pumped through the equipment at constant speed for five captures with optimized camera settings. An optimized detection threshold was set for analysis. mRNA was extracted from LNPs by dissolving 750 μg ml−1 with 5 volumes of ethanol or 2 volumes of isopropanol followed by 2 washes with cold 70% ethanol. RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free H2O before analysis using the TapeStation.

Mice were bled through the retroorbital route using heparinized capillaries (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22-362566) collecting a maximum of 200 µl into EDTA coated tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9414041). Whole blood was centrifuged at 1,200g for 15 min. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until use.

Tumours were dissected from euthanized mice with the external fibrous sac left intact. Tumours were bisected using a scalpel and half of each sample was placed into a GentleMacs column GentleMACS C Tube (130-096-334) with an enzyme mix containing 10 mg ml−1 of collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138-1G), 1 mg ml−1 of hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, 07461) and 200 mg ml−1 of DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025-150KU) or using the tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-096-730) followed by debris removal (Miltenyi, 130-109-398). Samples were run on a m_TDK_1 cycle and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min after completion. The pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer. The samples were washed twice using cold PBS and then manually counted using a haemocytometer.

Whole spleens were collected from euthanized mice and placed into cold RPMI medium. The spleens were then teased through a 70-µm filter and lysed for 5 min at 37 °C using 1× BD Pharmalyse buffer (BD, 555899). Lysis buffer was quenched with medium and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. Splenocytes were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer and washed once with PBS before being counted using the Beckman Coulter Vi-cell XR or haemocytometer.

In total, 1 × 106 cells from either tumours and spleens were placed into 96-well V-bottom plates. Unless stated otherwise, the washing steps were performed by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C followed by resuspension of cells with 200 µl of buffer, with mixing done by pipetting. Cells were washed with cold PBS and stained with 100 µl of live/dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L10119) for 30 min at 4 °C. Live/dead dye was quenched with 100 µl of cold PBS and the cells were washed once with cold FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended with 10 µl True stain FCX buffer (BioLegend, 422302) diluted to 100 µg ml−1 with FACS buffer for 10 min. Then 90 µl of antibodies (Supplementary Tables 12 and 13) and Brilliant Stain buffer (BD, 563794) were added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of FACS buffer was added to each well and the cells were washed twice with cold FACS buffer. Cells were fixed for 15 min with 100 µl of Cytofix buffer (BD, 554655) at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of PBS was added to each sample and cells were washed twice and stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Initial compensation was acquired using Ultracomp eBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 01-2222-42) and ArC amine reactive compensation beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10346). Results were acquired using a BD Symphony A3 and analysed using FlowJo v.10.8.1 and v.10.10.0.

Peptides selected to be high-affinity binders for Survivin (ATFKNWPFL), GP100A (EGSRNQDWL), GP100B (KVPRNQDWL), WT1 (RMFPNAPYL), CLDN6 or claudin 6 (KVYDSLLAL) and TRP2 (SVYDFFVWL) were purchased from GenScript. H2-Db and H2-Kb monomers were purchased as easYmers from ImmunAware (5001-01 and 5004-01, respectively), and tetramers were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, peptides were reconstituted to 1 mg ml−1 in deionized water, further diluted to 75 μM and incubated with easYmer (Eagle Biosciences, 5004-01, 5001-01) at 18 °C for 48 h. The resulting complexes were tetramerized by gradually mixing with streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences, 554067). After incubation, a final stock concentration of 500 nM for each tetramer was achieved.

According to the manufacturer recommendations, 1–2 × 106 cells were stained with tetramer diluted to 20 nM in FACS buffer. Cells were left to stain in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, washed once with FACS buffer, co-stained with surface antibodies (CD3, CD4) at room temperature for 20 min, washed twice with FACS buffer and analysed on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer.

The AIM assay was performed as previously described12. In this iteration, whole splenocytes were used rather than isolated T cells. In brief, 24 h after the last RNA-LNP vaccine, splenocytes were collected for antigen recall assay. Spleens were collected and processed as described above. 1 million splenocytes were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate in T cell medium containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 11-875-119), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35-011-CV), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 30-002-CI), 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco, 11140050), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (BME, Gibco, 21985-023) and 0.2 µg tumour-associated peptides without cytokines. Peptides were chosen based on their suggested upregulation in melanoma tumours12. Selected peptides were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies and reconstituted according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Co-culture was maintained for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were next collected and stained for the AIM assay for evaluating activation of antigen-specific T cells. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer containing antibodies mix (Supplementary Table 14). Cells were washed three times and fixed using fixation medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, GAS001S100) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS and were stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Results were acquired using a BD Fortessa III. Values were normalized by subtracting the percentage of AIM+ cells of tbe DMSO-only controls from each treatment condition. Statistical analysis was performed using Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's T3 multiple-comparison test.

Plasma was analysed for cytokine concentration using ELISAs and multiplex cytokine arrays. A portion of the plasma samples were assessed for IFNα through ELISA (Invitrogen, BMS6027). Plasma was also sent for analysis by Eve Technologies for multiplex cytokine array (MD44). For quantification of spike IgG, mice that received three vaccines/vehicle doses during tumour studies were bled once the humane end point was reached. Spike-specific IgG was determined using an Anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 IgG titre assay (AcroBiosystems, RAS-T023). Plasma was diluted 100,000-fold and run according to the company's recommended parameters for semiquantitative analysis.

Half of bisected tumours were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed three times using PBS and then immersed successively into 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose for cryopreservation. Tissue was then embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek, 4583) and stored at −80 °C. Blocks of tissue were moved to −20 °C for 24 h and were sectioned at a thickness of 30 µm using the Leica cryostat, and the sections were placed onto microscope slides. Before staining, the slides were brought up to room temperature for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Tissue was blocked at room temperature for 1 h using a blocking buffer containing 2% goat or donkey serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were then stained with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 15) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the sections were washed three times with PBS and stained with secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table 15) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5 min PBS washes, the sections were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000 in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After a triple PBS wash, the sections were mounted with Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36984) and covered with a cover glass. Images were acquired using a Leica Stellaris 8 WLL Spectral Confocal Microscope. Image processing was performed using Fiji ImageJ software (NIH) and Imaris (Oxford Instruments).

RNA-LNPs stimulate production of IFN-α, leading APCs to prime T cells in lymphoid organs. These primed, tumour-reactive T cells then infiltrate tumours and begin killing tumour cells. Tumour cells respond by expressing PD-L1. Combination therapy with RNA-LNPs and ICIs overcomes this resistance mechanism, leading to tumour rejection. Image created in BioRender (Grippin, A.

Google researchers have made a fresh claim of quantum advantage — the ability of quantum computers to radically speed up calculations compared with their classical counterparts.

This is not the company's first such claim. But the researchers say their latest algorithm — dubbed quantum echoes — has the potential to solve scientific problems, including deriving the structures of molecules. It could also, in theory, be replicated on another quantum computer.

“This algorithm offers the opportunity for real-world applications,” said Hartmut Neven, who heads Google's quantum-computing lab, in Santa Barbara, California, at a briefing for journalists ahead of the announcement. The firm is optimistic that in five years there will be practical uses for quantum computers, he added.

But some researchers are cautious of the claim of quantum advantage, published in Nature on 22 October1. “The burden of proof should be high,” says Dries Sels, a quantum physicist at New York University in New York City. And although the paper does a “serious job” of testing various classical algorithms, there is no proof that an efficient one doesn't exist. “Personally I don't think that's enough to make such a big claim,” he says.

Others say that the promise of practical use so soon is premature. The technical advance is impressive, says James Whitfield, a quantum physicist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, but it is “a bit of a stretch to think how this is going to suddenly solve some economically viable problem”.

Google researchers and their collaborators fleshed out how they could apply the algorithm to simple molecules in a preprint study that they have submitted to arXiv. They were able to predict certain features of the molecules' structures using quantum simulations, and confirm their findings with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. But so far, they can only apply the method to molecules that can already be efficiently simulated classically, such as the aromatic liquid toluene.

Applying the quantum echoes algorithm to more complex systems will require less noisy hardware or methods to correct for errors that are still being worked on, said Tom O'Brien, a research scientist at Google Quantum AI in Munich, Germany, at the briefing.

The demonstrations used Google's Willow chip, which harnesses 105 tiny superconducting circuits to store information as quantum bits, or qubits — the quantum equivalent of classical bits of information.

Google's algorithm is able to detect subtle quantum links between distant parts of the computer, which otherwise get scrambled and lost owing to interactions between the device's many quantum parts. The team likened their method to mapping a cave using echoes; it involves running a series of operations, perturbing a qubit, then running the operations in reverse. Measurements reveal traces of the single qubit's interactions throughout the system.

To apply the algorithm to molecules, researchers make qubits simulate ‘spins' of atomic nuclei, the quantum property that makes each nucleus act like a tiny bar magnet. By measuring how these spins interact magnetically, NMR reveals a molecule's structure, but the technique fails when the nuclei are too far apart. By simulating spins using qubits, the quantum echoes algorithm can tease out long-distance interactions to give more structural information than is possible using NMR alone, said O'Brien.

The UNC13A gene encodes a presynaptic protein that is crucial for setting the strength and dynamics of information transfer between neurons. Here we describe a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by germline coding or splice-site variants in UNC13A. The syndrome presents with variable degrees of developmental delay and intellectual disability, seizures of different types, tremor and dyskinetic movements and, in some cases, death in early childhood. Using assays with expression of UNC13A variants in mouse hippocampal neurons and in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify three mechanisms of pathogenicity, including reduction in synaptic strength caused by reduced UNC13A protein expression, increased neurotransmission caused by UNC13A gain-of-function and impaired regulation of neurotransmission by second messenger signalling. Based on a strong genotype–phenotype-functional correlation, we classify three UNC13A syndrome subtypes (types A–C). We conclude that the precise regulation of neurotransmitter release by UNC13A is critical for human nervous system function.

UNC13A, the major UNC13 paralog in mammals, is a highly conserved presynaptic protein that is essential for chemical synaptic transmission. It is required for assembly of the SNARE complex that bridges between neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs) and the plasma membrane, placing SVs in a fusion-competent, ‘primed' state1,2,3,4,5. UNC13A expression levels are positively correlated with the size of the readily releasable SV pool (the RRP6) and with the signaling strength of synapses7,8,9. During periods of high-frequency synaptic activity, UNC13A supports the resupply of SVs to counterbalance SV consumption10,11,12,13,14, sustaining neurotransmission. UNC13A activity is enhanced through direct binding of Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin, Ca2+-phospholipids and diacylglycerol (DAG) to specific regulatory domains. The acceleration of UNC13A activity results in dynamic changes in neurotransmission strength, a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity10,11,12,13,15,16.

In rodents, Unc13a is expressed in the vast majority of neuronal subtypes and in some cells of neural lineage17,18. Most neuronal subtypes additionally express the paralogs Unc13b and/or Unc13c17, which have similar functions. Mice that constitutively lack Unc13a die shortly after birth19,20 owing to a 90% loss of the RRP at excitatory synapses19. The combined elimination of Unc13a/Unc13b results in a complete block of neurotransmission at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses owing to complete RRP loss20. Consequently, newborn Unc13a/b double knockout (DKO) mice are paralyzed but have intact nervous system development20,21.

A pivotal role for UNC13A in human neurological disorders is emerging. Two patients harboring homozygous truncating variants in UNC13A showed profound developmental delay and died during early childhood22,23. Another patient harboring a de novo missense variant (P814L) in UNC13A exhibited mild intellectual disability, dyskinesia and intention tremor24. Certain deep intronic single-nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to genetic risk for the neurodegenerative conditions amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)25,26,27, and promote ALS/FTD disease progression26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Recent studies identified reduced UNC13A expression in neurons with ALS/FTD pathology owing to TDP-43-mediated alterations in splicing34,35, but the mechanisms linking reduced UNC13A expression to disease progression remain unknown33,36.

We identified a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by variants in the UNC13A gene. Systematic patient and variant characterization enabled classification of three disease subtypes. Patients with a type A condition present with profound global developmental delay (GDD) and early-onset seizures. These patients harbor biallelic loss-of-function missense, truncating or splice-site variants that lead to a >50% reduction of UNC13A expression and to a severe reduction in neurotransmission strength in experimental models. Patients with a type B condition exhibit developmental delay, particularly speech delay, and ataxia, tremor or dyskinetic movements as hallmarks of the condition. These patients harbor de novo missense variants that result in a gain of UNC13A function, leading to enhanced neurotransmission. The type C condition is caused by a familial heterozygous missense variant that results in altered regulation of UNC13A function. The patients are mildly affected, exhibiting learning difficulties to mild–moderate intellectual disability and seizures.

Overall, we demonstrate that UNC13A disease-causing variants operate in a cell-autonomous fashion to change synaptic strength and plasticity. Importantly, we present evidence that reduction of UNC13A protein expression to 20–30% of wild-type (WT) levels strongly impairs synaptic transmission and plasticity and has severe consequences in humans, a finding that may be important to understand the role of UNC13A in ALS and FTD. The mechanisms identified here may inform the development of therapeutic approaches.

We identified diverse UNC13A variants in 48 index patients presenting with neurodevelopmental deficiencies (Supplementary Data 1). Based on genotype–phenotype-functional assessment, we classified variants in 20 patients as pathogenic (Fig. 1a) and in eight patients as (likely) benign. Variants in 20 patients remained of uncertain significance (Supplementary Data 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1).

a, Location of validated pathogenic variants identified in 20 patients (Supplementary Data 1) mapped on a schematic representation of the UNC13A gene (NM_001080421.2). Variants with biallelic inheritance are in magenta (p.T117Rfs*18 and p.R202H, and c.767+1 G > T and c.4073+1 G > A are in a compound heterozygous state; others are in a homozygous state), heterozygous de novo variants are in black and a heterozygous, inherited variant is in brown. Variants p.G808D and p.P814L were detected in four and six patients, respectively. Exon colors correspond to the color of protein domains in b. b, Validated pathogenic missense variants overlaid on a schematic representation of the UNC13A protein. The sequence of the hotspot region, termed here as the ‘UNC13 hinge', is magnified. c, UNC13A tolerance landscape generated based on the observed missense and synonymous variants in gnomAD and corrected for the sequence composition (MetaDome database37). The degree of tolerance for missense variants is color-coded (lowest scores, red, highly intolerant; highest scores, blue, highly tolerant). d, AlphaMissense scores38 plotted for all missense variants (pathogenic, of uncertain significance (VUS) and (likely) benign) reported in this study (Supplementary Data 1; heterozygous de novo missense variants, bold typeface; heterozygous inherited or biallelic variants, non-bold typeface; validated pathogenic variants, red; VUS, gray; validated (likely) benign, blue). Notably, all validated pathogenic variants reported in this study are within the pathogenic AlphaMissense score range, and three out of four validated benign variants fall within the benign score range. We consider VUS variants in the pathogenic AlphaMissense score range as hot VUS (14 variants) and those within the benign/ambiguous score range as cold VUS (12 variants). e, Left: age of patients (with median and interquartile range; error bars, s.d.) at the latest physician visit, stratified by inheritance pattern. Middle: major clinical features of 20 patients with pathogenic variants (Supplementary Data 1), stratified by inheritance pattern. The presence or absence of features is shown by the indicated colors together with the respective percentage for different inheritance patterns. Right: standard deviation scores for growth parameters of patients with pathogenic variants at birth and at the latest visit are illustrated by inheritance pattern (HC, head circumference).

Source data

A first group of six patients (18 months to ~15 years old; Fig. 1a,b (magenta), Supplementary Data 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) presented with severe-to-profound GDD or intellectual disability, hypotonia and seizures of different types (largely controllable with medication) or death in early childhood caused by respiratory failure after pneumonia in one case. UNC13A variants in these patients were homozygous or compound heterozygous missense, insertion–deletion or splice-site variants with gene-disrupting splicing effects proven by minigene assays (Supplementary Data 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, parents of patients with biallelic variants in this study who were heterozygous carriers of loss-of-function missense or gene-disrupting splice-site variants, and parents of an individual in a previously published case22 with a homozygous gene-disrupting variant were all reportedly healthy, demonstrating possible tolerance to heterozygous loss-of-function UNC13A variants, as has also been shown in mice19.

A second group of 13 patients (21 months to 32 years old; Fig. 1a,b (black) and Supplementary Data 1) harbored pathogenic, heterozygous de novo missense variants with multiple substitutions at amino acids 808, 811 and 814. They presented with variable degrees of GDD, hypotonia, seizures of different types (mainly refractory to treatment) and typically exhibited ataxia, tremor or dyskinetic movements rarely observed in other patients (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). The protein region spanning the seven highly conserved amino acids 808–814 forms a hotspot for an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and is predicted to be highly intolerant to variation based on the MetaDome database37 and AlphaMissense scores38 (Fig. 1c,d). We term this region the ‘UNC13 hinge' because it links a regulatory domain cluster with the MUN domain, which mediates SNARE complex assembly39,40 (Fig. 1b).

The third group of patients consisted of a family with at least four affected members across two generations (4 years to 35 years old; Fig. 1a,b (brown) and Supplementary Data 1) harboring a pathogenic heterozygous missense variant (C587F) that caused learning difficulties to mild–moderate intellectual disability as well as controlled seizures. The relatively mild presentation of this variant led to autosomal dominant familial heritability.

Altogether, pathogenic variants in UNC13A cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental deficiencies (Fig. 1e; mainly GDD or intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures and abnormal movement features) with both autosomal dominant (de novo or inherited) and recessive inheritance, depending on the type and location of the variants. Additionally, we identified de novo heterozygous or biallelic variants of uncertain significance scattered throughout the UNC13A protein sequence (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Although many of these variants are high-level (hot) candidates for impacting protein function based on in silico predictions (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 1), reliable readouts proving their pathogenicity are currently unavailable.

UNC13A is a multidomain protein (Fig. 1b) impacting diverse synaptic transmission properties7,10,11,12,13,14,15,19,24. We selected a subset of variants with substitutions at key UNC13A domains (Fig. 2a) and comprehensively characterized their impact on synapse function. We show that variants E52K, R202H, C587F, G808D/C and P814L are pathogenic, while our assays did not detect phenotypic changes for R799Q and N1013S, which we therefore classify as (likely) benign (Supplementary Data 1–3 and Extended Data Fig. 4). A comparative summary of all genetic, clinical and experimental data is presented in Extended Data Fig. 5.

Source data

Neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to deficiencies in synapse development41. To examine whether UNC13A variants affect synaptogenesis or presynaptic UNC13A abundance, we cultured hippocampal neurons from Unc13a/b DKO mice in a microisland culture system42,43 (Fig. 2b), where single neurons grow on astrocytic islands, making synapses onto themselves (‘autapses'). We re-introduced WT rat Unc13a cDNA (UNC13AWT; ~94% identity with human UNC13A) or UNC13A cDNA encoding disease-related variants using lentiviral transduction44 at day in vitro (DIV) 2–3. Following immunocytochemical labeling, synapses were defined as VGLUT1-positive puncta (a presynaptic marker) colocalizing with Shank2-positive puncta (a postsynaptic marker). We found no significant change in the number of formed synapses between the different conditions (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Data 2). We then quantified the fraction of VGLUT1–Shank2 puncta exhibiting UNC13A immunoreactivity (Fig. 2c,e and Supplementary Data 2). UNC13AWT was detected in 93.4 ± 1.75% of the VGLUT1–Shank2-positive puncta, and similar colocalization levels were detected for UNC13A with variants in the Ca2+-phospholipid binding C2B domain (UNC13AR799Q), UNC13A hinge (UNC13AG808D) and MUN domain (UNC13AN1013S). Neurons expressing a UNC13A variant in the DAG-binding C1 domain (UNC13AC587F) exhibited a mild but statistically significant reduction in the degree of colocalization. Remarkably, neurons expressing either of the two amino-terminal variants, UNC13AE52K and UNC13AR202H, displayed a strong reduction in the fraction of synapses co-labeled for UNC13A (35 ± 3.9% and 32.5 ± 4% of WT levels, respectively). Moreover, substantially weaker UNC13A labeling intensities were evident (UNC13AE52K, 23 ± 11% of WT levels; UNC13AR202H, 20 ± 13% of WT levels; Fig. 2f and Supplementary Data 2). Taken together, UNC13A disease variants do not affect synapse number in vitro, but the E52K and R202H substitutions cause a strong reduction of synaptic UNC13A levels.

E52 is located at the interaction interface between the UNC13A C2A domain and RIMS1/RIMS2 (refs. 45,46,47,48) (Fig. 3a,b), while R202 is part of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR; amino acids 151 to ~450; Fig. 1a). The E52K and R202H disease variants are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and cause a severe disorder (Fig. 3c,d). Expression of UNC13AE52K or UNC13AR202H in HEK293 cells, which lack UNC13A but express the misfolded protein detection machinery, showed no evidence that these variants cause inherent protein instability (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Smaller sucrose-evoked EPSCs (t) indicate a reduced RRP size in UNC13AE52K-expressing neurons (u), while the mean vesicular release probability was unchanged (v). Data were obtained from at least three independent cultures per condition. Statistical analysis: Kruskal–Wallis test (g–m) and two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (o–v). In h, j, l, p, q, s, u and v, bars and circles represent means and values for individual neurons, respectively; error bars, s.e.m. See Supplementary Data 3 for further details.

To assess how variants affect synaptic transmission, we conducted whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in autaptic Unc13a/b DKO glutamatergic hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3e)20,42 transfected with UNC13AWT or UNC13A carrying disease variants. In UNC13AE52K-expressing neurons (Fig. 3f), we could not detect spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) or action potential (AP)-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs; Fig. 3g–j and Supplementary Data 3). Application of hypertonic sucrose solution to assess the size of the RRP6 revealed the absence of a measurable RRP in UNC13AE52K neurons, indicative of a severe SV priming deficit (Fig. 3k,l). Given that high-frequency AP firing can enhance UNC13A activity, we delivered trains of 40 APs at 40 Hz frequency but did not detect synaptic currents throughout the trains (Fig. 3m). Together, we conclude that UNC13AE52K does not rescue synaptic transmission to measurable levels.

By contrast, UNC13AR202H expression (Fig. 3n) rescued synaptic transmission, albeit with lower efficacy than UNC13AWT. Mean frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs were similar to those measured in neurons expressing UNC13AWT (Fig. 3o–q), but the average eEPSC size (Fig. 3r,s) and RRP charge (Fig. 3t,u) were both reduced by ~40%. The mean vesicular release probability (\({\bar{p}}_{\mathrm{vr}}\)), calculated as the charge transfer during a single AP-induced eEPSC divided by the charge transfer in response to sucrose-evoked RRP release, was unaltered (Fig. 3v).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that two variants cause lower synaptic UNC13A abundance and reduced synaptic strength in mouse neurons. Affected patients presented with profound GDD and no motor development (Figs. 1e and 3c), consistent with decreased synaptic efficacy observed in vitro. Interestingly, although both substitutions reduce UNC13A levels to similar extents (Fig. 2e,f), UNC13R202H expression partially rescues synaptic transmission, while UNC13E52K expression does not. This probably reflects the combined effect of lower UNC13A protein levels and functional consequences of the E52K exchange on the C2A domain function47. The substantial neurotransmission in UNC13R202H-expressing neurons indicates that very low UNC13A levels are sufficient for synapse function.

We identified 13 patients with de novo variants in the UNC13A hinge (Fig. 4a–d). We previously reported one patient with an UNC13A P814L variant24, causing a gain-of-function in synaptic transmission. To consolidate variant pathogenicity and establish functional causality between the expression of hinge variants and synaptic transmission properties, we studied the frequently affected residue G808 (Fig. 4a,d).

Aldicarb-induced accumulation of ACh in the extrasynaptic space leads to receptor desensitization and to worm paralysis. Synaptic phenotypes associated with ACh hypersecretion lead to faster ACh accumulation and to faster paralysis. Reduced secretion results in slower paralysis. n, CRISPR-generated heterozygous (green) and homozygous (blue) knock-in UNC-13P814L (UNC-13P956L) worms exhibit faster aldicarb-induced paralysis than WT worms. o, Similar results obtained in heterozygous (green) or homozygous (blue) UNC-13G808C (UNC-13G950C) knock-in worms. Statistical analysis was performed by using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (f, g, i, k, l) or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn's test (n, o). Bars and circles in f, g, i, k and l represent means and values for individual neurons, respectively; error bars, s.e.m. Data were obtained from at least three independent cultures per condition. Circles in n and o represent averaged data from >10 worms. See Supplementary Data 3 for further details.

In autaptic hippocampal Unc13a/b DKO neurons expressing UNC13AG808D–GFP, we observed a greater than twofold increase in the frequency of mEPSCs compared to neurons expressing the WT variant, whereas mEPSC amplitudes were unaltered (Fig. 4e–g). Given that larger RRP size could underlie an increased mEPSC frequency, we estimated the RRP sizes and found similar values in UNC13AG808D-expressing and UNC13AWT-expressing neurons (Fig. 4h,i). Together, these findings are consistent with the notion that RRP SVs in resting UNC13AG808D-expressing neurons are more likely to fuse spontaneously, possibly indicating higher SV fusogenicity49 or a larger fraction of ‘tightly-docked' SVs50. UNC13AG808D-expressing neurons also showed significantly larger eEPSC charges (Fig. 4j,k). Given that the average mEPSC charge and RRP size were unaltered (Fig. 4f,i), the increased eEPSC charge is indicative of a larger fraction of the RRP released by single APs (higher \({\bar{p}}_{\mathrm{vr}}\); Fig. 4l). We conclude that UNC13AG808D leads to a gain-of-function in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission.

Given that all UNC13A hinge variants were heterozygous, we tested whether a gain-of-function phenotype prevails in the presence of a WT allele. We generated homozygous and heterozygous C. elegans strains harboring the G808C and P814L substitutions using CRISPR–Cas9 targeting of the unc-13 gene. The C. elegans and human UNC13A protein products are highly homologous (~50% identity, ~70% sequence similarity) and serve similar functions51,52,53,54. As a behavioral readout of synaptic function, we assayed loss of movement in response to exposure to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb (Fig. 4m), with faster paralysis indicating acetylcholine hypersecretion. Compared with WT worms, paralysis occurred significantly faster and to a similar extent in homozygous and heterozygous G808C and P814L mutant worms (Fig. 4n,o (green and blue)). These data are consistent with a gain-of-function in acetylcholine secretion, also in the presence of a WT allele.

Based on these results, we conclude that UNC13A hinge variations increase the degree of spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission. Given the substantial number of patients, and because the functional phenotypes of neurons expressing UNC13AP814L and UNC13AG808D in mouse neurons and G808C and P814L in C. elegans are nearly identical (Extended Data Fig. 5), we conclude that UNC13A hinge variations are pathogenic and act through a similar mechanism.

We identified four patients harboring a heterozygous missense variant (c.1760_1761delinsTT; C587F) in the UNC13A DAG-binding C1 domain (Fig. 5a–d)15,55. In cultured WT synapses, the membrane-permeable DAG analog Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) causes a greater than twofold increase in synaptic strength within seconds after application15,56. To test whether C587F hampers DAG sensing, we used a protein-translocation assay. In HEK293 cells, overexpressed UNC13AWT–GFP undergoes translocation to the plasma membrane upon PDBu application (Fig. 5e,f). A C1 domain point mutation, H554K, blocks this translocation14 (Fig. 5e,f). We found that the disease variant C587F blocks UNC13A translocation, while other variants in this study exhibit WT-like behavior (Fig. 5e).

In o and r–t, circles represent an average from >10 worms or an average of the indicated number of neurons. Bars and circles in f, h, i, k, m and n represent means and values for individual neurons, respectively. Data were obtained from at least three independent cultures per condition; error bars, s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed by using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (f, h, i, k, m, n) or Wilcoxon test (o). See Supplementary Data 3 for further details.

We then characterized synaptic transmission and DAG responsiveness in autaptic neurons expressing UNC13AC587F (Fig. 5g–n and Supplementary Data 3). Basal spontaneous and AP-evoked synaptic transmission were largely similar in Unc13a/b DKO neurons expressing UNC13AC587F or UNC13AWT. This is consistent with a similar time course of aldicarb-induced paralysis in homozygous C587F worms and WT worms (Fig. 5o). However, PDBu failed to potentiate eEPSC amplitudes in autaptic neurons (Fig. 5p–r), in agreement with the absence of PDBu-induced translocation (Fig. 5f). We conclude that the UNC13AC587F variation acutely changes the responsiveness of UNC13A to DAG signaling, while not strongly interfering with basal synaptic transmission (see Extended Data Fig. 7 for molecular dynamics simulation data).

Finally, we tested whether other disease variants impair the PDBu-induced synaptic potentiation. Expression of UNC13AG808D, with a presumably intact C1 domain (Fig. 5e), resulted in little PDBu-induced potentiation (~20% of WT; Fig. 5s). Conversely, neurons expressing R202H exhibited a tendency towards stronger PDBu-induced potentiation than UNC13AWT-expressing neurons (Fig. 5t). This is probably a consequence of already altered basal synaptic transmission properties: synaptic strength is enhanced in neurons expressing UNC13AG808D, which may partially occlude PDBu potentiation. By contrast, neurons expressing UNC13AR202H exhibit lower basal synaptic strength, which may allow stronger potentiation. These data suggest an unbalanced DAG signaling in UNC13AG808D-expressing and UNC13AR202H-expressing neurons.

During repetitive activation, synapses exhibit short-term plasticity (STP)57, a use-dependent alteration of synaptic strength on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes. STP occurs when fusion-competent SVs are progressively consumed. UNC13A-mediated SV priming and its modulation by second messengers counteracts SV depletion10,11,12,13, thus shaping STP. We next studied how disease variants in UNC13A affect this process.

We recorded eEPSCs during high-frequency trains, embedded in low-frequency stimulation (Fig. 6a,e), and observed strong changes during and after stimulus trains (Fig. 6b–d,f–h): in neurons expressing UNC13AC587F or UNC13AG808D, prominent short-term synaptic depression of eEPSC amplitudes was observed (Fig. 6c,d,g,h (gray arrow)), whereas UNC13AR202H-expressing neurons typically exhibited short-term synaptic enhancement (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 8). To explore underlying mechanisms, we quantified the replenishment rate constants of the RRP during 40 Hz AP trains, based on a single-pool model of SV priming12,58. RRP replenishment rate constants were reduced for neurons expressing UNC13AC587F or UNC13AG808D but tended to be accelerated in UNC13AR202H-expressing neurons (Fig. 6i).

Gray arrowheads mark the time point during which steady-state depression was quantified, and black arrowheads mark the first eEPSC following the train, used to estimate the magnitude of augmentation. i, Replenishment rate constants calculated based on a single-pool model of SV priming for neurons of the indicated genotypes. j,k, Magnitude of eEPSC augmentation after conditioning 10 Hz (j) or 40 Hz (k) stimulation. Data were obtained from at least three independent cultures per condition. Statistical analysis was performed by using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (i–k). Bars and circles in i–k represent means and values for individual neurons, respectively; error bars, s.e.m.

Following AP trains, synaptic strength can transiently increase (Fig. 6b–d,f–h (black arrowheads)). We quantified such augmentation by measuring eEPSCs 2 s after the cessation of AP trains. Compared to UNC13AWT-expressing neurons, augmentation was significantly stronger when UNC13AR202H was expressed, whereas it was virtually absent in neurons expressing UNC13AC587F or UNC13AG808D (Fig. 6j,k and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 8).

Collectively, these data demonstrate that UNC13A disease variants have a complex impact on STP. Reduced UNC13A expression favors facilitation of synaptic responses during and strong augmentation after an AP train, while gain of UNC13A function or diminished UNC13A PDBu/DAG regulation leads to increased depression during and reduced augmentation after AP trains.

We report the identification of a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by pathogenic UNC13A variants that cause cell-autonomous changes to synaptic transmission and plasticity. The UNC13A syndrome joins the group of SNAREopathies that arise from pathogenic variants in the core proteins mediating neurotransmitter release (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). The most common SNAREopathy is the STXBP1 encephalopathy, which is diagnosed in 3.3–3.8 out of every 10,000 births59,60. STXBP1 encodes the MUNC18-1 protein, a functional interactor of UNC13A in SNARE complex assembly61,62,63.

Based on the genetic, clinical and functional evidence presented here (Extended Data Fig. 5c), we propose a categorization of the UNC13A syndrome. Type A comprises variants that cause full or partial UNC13A protein loss. This type is caused by biallelic missense (Fig. 3), splice-site (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and nonsense variants based on our cohort and a few previously published cases22,23. These variants lead to profound GDD in all cases, and in some, cause death in early childhood owing to respiratory failure after pneumonia (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). All patients develop early-onset seizures that mostly respond to treatment. Based on a previously reported case23 in which an individual was diagnosed with fatal myasthenia according to electromyography findings, and based on patients 3 and 7 in our study (Supplementary Data 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3), we suggest considering myasthenic presentation in type A patients. Type A variants are associated with eliminated or strongly reduced UNC13A expression, weaker synaptic transmission under basal and low-frequency activity (Fig. 3) and a tendency towards enhanced synaptic responses during and after AP trains, or by DAG signaling (Figs. 5 and 6). We speculate that these variants impair UNC13A transport and/or active zone recruitment.

The type B UNC13A condition comprises variants that cause an UNC13A gain-of-function. This type is caused by de novo heterozygous missense variants in the UNC13A hinge (G808D, G808C, G808V, K811E, P814L) (Figs. 1 and 4) and is characterized by developmental delay, primarily in speech acquisition and, to a lesser extent, in motor skills. The overall severity of the developmental delay is less than that observed in type A, and no death in early childhood is reported. Epileptic seizures are severe and become refractory to treatment in most cases. A hallmark of this condition is ataxia and tremor or dyskinetic movements24 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). As UNC13A is also expressed in motoneurons, it remains to be determined whether the imbalanced synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction contributes to this presentation. Functionally, type B variants cause a gain-of-function of synaptic transmission during spontaneous and low-frequency AP activity (Fig. 4), strong short-term synaptic depression and diminished augmentation during and after high-frequency activity (Fig. 6), as well as diminished potentiation by DAG signaling (Fig. 5).

Finally, the type C condition comprises a variant that results in UNC13A dysregulation. This type is caused by a familial heterozygous missense variant in the UNC13A C1 domain (C587F; Figs. 1 and 5), presenting with mild delay in speech development, learning difficulties to mild–moderate intellectual disability and controlled seizures (Supplementary Data 1). Neurons expressing this variant show near-normal synaptic transmission in response to low-frequency AP activity, but absent potentiation by DAG signaling (Fig. 5) and aberrant STP patterns during and after high-frequency activity (Fig. 6).

We anticipate additional pathogenic variants and disease subtypes to emerge. In particular, loss of function without loss of protein is expected for variants that interfere with UNC13A function in SNARE complex assembly (for example, in the MUN or C2C domain), which may lead to a type A-like condition. Based on AlphaMissense scores and the rareness of variants in the hinge region (frequency in gnomADv4.1 database), almost all possible hinge amino acid exchanges (42 out of 45; 93%) show pathogenic predictions, and we anticipate additional variants to arise. UNC13A hyperfunction has been described in structure–function studies46,53,64, and variants in these regions may also lead to a type B condition. Missense or in-frame variants affecting Ca2+ or Ca2+/calmodulin binding may cause a type C condition.

Our functional assays were designed to investigate deficits caused by UNC13A variants and were therefore performed in the absence of a WT UNC13A allele (which is relevant for heterozygous variants) and in the absence of UNC13B/C. Co-expression of UNC13A/B/C is expected to modify the functional phenotypes we describe in a synapse-specific fashion, but to what extent is hard to predict and requires further experimentation. UNC13B and UNC13C are expressed alongside UNC13A in distinct neuronal subtypes of the cerebellum (UNC13C) and of the cortex and hippocampus (UNC13B)17. Interestingly, UNC13B expression can fully compensate for UNC13A loss in hippocampal inhibitory neurons, but UNC13B/C can only marginally compensate for UNC13A loss (<10%) in excitatory hippocampal synapses20,65. Reasons for the limited redundancy remain unclear and may involve active zone recruitment mechanisms66,67. Nonetheless, following full or partial loss of UNC13A (type A), co-expression of UNC13B may support synaptic transmission in inhibitory neurons to a larger extent than in excitatory neurons, shaping the inhibition-to-excitation ratio within neuronal networks. It is tempting to speculate that this might underlie the favorable response of epileptic seizures to medication in type A patients. In the type B condition, we demonstrated that UNC13AP814L exerts a similar effect in excitatory hippocampal and inhibitory striatal neurons24 and that the magnitude of the functional gain is similar in the presence or absence of UNC13AWT (Fig. 4n,o).

A key finding in this study is the identification of variants that reduced UNC13A expression levels below 50% of WT levels (E52K, R202H and, probably, some splice-site variants). Reduction of UNC13A expression levels has been recently highlighted as a pathogenic mechanism in ALS and FTD. In healthy neurons, TDP-43 acts as a splicing regulator for UNC13A mRNA34,35,68, in which it represses the inclusion of a cryptic exon. In neurons with ALS or FTD pathology, TDP-43 is depleted from the nucleus69, resulting in the inclusion of the cryptic exon in up to 100% of the UNC13A mRNA, and thus in lower UNC13A protein levels34,35. Deep intronic UNC13A variants that possibly change the cryptic exon's splicing propensity pose a strong genetic risk for ALS/FTD disease and disease progression25,27,34,35. How reduced UNC13A levels enhance ALS/FTD pathology remains to be established, and the minimal UNC13A levels required for proper synaptic function have not yet been determined. Several observations made here shed light on these issues.

We report that the R202H substitution severely interferes with human motor function (Fig. 1e), leads to reduced UNC13A expression levels (20–30% of WT levels; Fig. 2) and impairs synaptic function (Figs. 3, 5 and 6, and see ref. 70). Although we cannot exclude that R202H has additional effects on UNC13A function in addition to reducing its expression levels, these data suggest that altered neurotransmission may accompany ALS/FTD cellular pathology as UNC13A levels decline and potentially exacerbate disease symptoms. However, we also note that 20–30% of UNC13A expression levels are already sufficient to support ~60% of neurotransmitter release in cultured neurons and that patients with low UNC13A expression levels have improved survival chances compared with patients with no functional UNC13A, who die in early childhood22,23. Together, we propose that therapeutic strategies that stabilize 20–30% as minimal UNC13A expression may already be beneficial. Given that UNC13A haploinsufficiency appears to be tolerated in humans (refs. 22,23 and this study) and in mice19, restoration of UNC13A to levels approaching 50% appears to be sufficient as an upper target. Antisense oligonucleotide therapies71, for example, are approved for clinical use and could be well-used in ALS/FTD and in patients with type B and C neurodevelopmental disorders. In the latter, antisense oligonucleotides that exclusively suppress the expression of pathogenic transcripts and increase the relative abundance of the WT protein variant may improve disease symptoms. Our study underscores the importance of an experimentally validated mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity for diverse variants in the same gene, as different therapeutic strategies should be used to combat them.

This study was performed as part of a research study approved by the ethics commission of the Canton of Zurich (ID PB_2016-02520 (SIV 11/09)). In addition, for each patient, ethical approvals and informed consent forms from parents or guardians were obtained by the respective research teams and institutions for data use and publication, including photographs or videos where applicable. Participants did not receive compensation. The use of Unc13a/b knockout mice was approved by the responsible local government organization (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit; 33.19-42502-04-15/1817 and 33.19-42502-04-20/3589, and Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales; G106/20). Mice (Mus musculus, backcrossed to a C57BL/6N background) of embryonic day 18 or postnatal day 0–1 and of both sexes were used in electrophysiological experiments. Each culture was obtained from one or more mice, and two to four independent cultures were used per condition. Adult mice were kept under IVC/SPF conditions, on a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle, at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity levels of 55 ± 10%.

Individuals included in this study underwent exome or genome sequencing on diverse sequencing platforms on a clinical or research basis in academic institutes or diagnostic labs worldwide. Using GeneMatcher73 and personal communication with colleagues enabled us to assemble clinical and genetic details on a total of 48 index patients with de novo or inherited heterozygous or biallelic variants in UNC13A (NM_001080421.3), including two previously published cases harboring c.154 G > A, p.(E52K) (case 74 described in ref. 74) and c.4379 C > T, p.(A1460V) (case UPN-0740 described in ref. 75) variants with further follow-up information. Standard deviation of growth parameters was calculated as previously described76. Variant nomenclature was verified using VariantValidator77. De-identified clinical data from collaborating institutions were obtained with local institutional review board approval and informed consent from parents or guardians of affected individuals, including consent for publication of facial photographs for individuals in Figs. 3–5, Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.

For splicing assays, the pSplicePOLR2G3 vector was digested and purified as described previously78. Inserts of UNC13A exons and their flanking intronic regions were amplified using the Q5 HotStar High-Fidelity Taq Polymerase kit (New England Biolabs), and cloning reactions were performed with the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells was performed with WT and mutated plasmid constructs (1 μg per well) complexed with the jetPEITM transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection). Total RNA was extracted 48 h post transfection with the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel). Reverse transcription was performed with the ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), and fluorescent PCR was performed as described previously79. PCR products were size-separated on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Output data were analyzed with Peak Scanner software (Applied Biosystems).

Unless otherwise indicated, cDNA encoding rat UNC13A tagged with EGFP at the carboxy terminus80 was used. Mutated amino acids are indicated throughout the paper according to the human nomenclature, and Supplementary Table 1 lists the respective amino acids mutated in the rat cDNA. Lentiviral preparation was carried out by the Viral Core Facility of the Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin (vcf.charite.de). The FUGW vector81, in which the ubiquitin promoter was exchanged with the human synapsin 1 promoter, was used according to a previously published81, modified protocol82, using helper plasmids (Addgene, 8454 and 8455; ref. 44). In a subset of experiments, constructs encoding NLS-GFP-P2A-UNC13A-Flag under the synapsin promoter were used82. In Fig. 5e, pEGFP–N1–UNC13AWT and corresponding mutants were used. Viral transfection of neurons was carried out on DIV 2–3. Plasmid and primer sequence information are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Neurons were prepared from the brains of E18 Unc13a/b DKO mice and plated on WT astrocyte microisland cultures according to published protocols83. Cultures were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until recordings were made at DIV 13–16. Whole-cell voltage-clamp data were acquired using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1440A data acquisition system and pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). All recordings were performed using a standard external solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 4 mM CaCl2 and 4 mM MgCl2 (320 mOsm l−1). The standard internal solution contained 136 mM KCl, 17.8 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 4 mM NaATP, 0.3 mM Na2GTP, 15 mM creatine phosphate and 5 U ml−1 phosphocreatine kinase (315–320 mOsm l−1), pH 7.4. eEPSCs were evoked by depolarizing the cell from −70 mV to 0 mV for a 1 ms duration. Basal eEPSCs were recorded at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Rapid external solution exchange around individual neurons was achieved by using a custom-made fast-flow system controlled by a stepper motor. Recordings were made at room temperature (~22 °C). The size of the RRP was estimated from the integrated charge of EPSCs evoked by application of 500 mM sucrose (7 s or 5 s in Fig. 3k–l) after subtraction of the steady-state current to correct for ongoing SV pool replenishment. mEPSCs were recorded for 100 s in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin. In Fig. 3g,h, additional recordings in the presence of NBQX (3 μM, Tocris Bioscience) were used to subtract false-positive events from traces recorded in extracellular solution. mEPSC traces were filtered at 1 kHz, and miniature events were identified using a sliding template function in Axograph or in Igor Pro (5–200 pA; rise time, 0.15–1.5 ms; half-width, 0.5–5 ms). PDBu (1 μM) was applied for 1 min. Analyses were performed using Axograph (v.1.4.3) (Molecular Devices) or Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Data were obtained from at least two cultures, and for the majority of data, from four cultures.

Quantifications of synapse number, signal intensity and colocalization were made by immunostaining of microisland hippocampal cultures. Lentiviral-transfected samples were briefly washed with PBS and fixed at DIV 13 with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 18 min with gentle agitation. After three PBS washes, the remaining PFA was quenched with 50 mM glycine for 10 min, and samples were washed again with PBS. Before permeabilization, samples were treated with four drops of Image-iT FX signal enhancer in 1.5–2 ml PBS per well (in a six-well plate) and maintained shaking for 20 min. Samples were permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2.5% normal goat serum (NGS) diluted in PBS while gently shaking. Blocking was performed with 2.5% NGS in PBS, twice for a total of 15 min. The primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution, and coverslips were mounted upside down on 150 μl antibody solution placed on parafilm and kept for 2.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, both in a wet chamber. Coverslips were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2.5% NGS in PBS and subsequently mounted upside down in 150 μl secondary antibody solution in a dark, wet chamber for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were washed five times with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2.5% NGS in PBS for 2–5 min. The coverslips were briefly washed in double-distilled water, excess water was removed and the coverslips were mounted on a glass slide using Aqua-Poly/Mount.

Microislands containing one hippocampal neuron were efficiently localized by first acquiring a low-magnification overview image of the entire coverslip using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser scanning microscope. Specifically, upon 405 nm excitation, a ×10 air objective (0.45 NA) was used to image Alexa Fluor 405-stained MAP2 (410–470 nm). The overview image served as a map based on which the motorized stage of the Zeiss LSM 880 was moved to selected autaptic neurons, from which high-resolution (x, y, z: 208, 208, 309 nm) z-stacks of VGLUT1 (637–758 nm), Shank2 (570–624 nm), UNC13A–eGFP (490–552 nm) and MAP2 (410–470 nm) were acquired with a ×40 oil immersion objective (1.40 NA). Overlapping fields of view for subsequent image stitching were acquired with the above settings, in case the autaptic neuron did not fit in one field of view.

All image processing was conducted with the same automated Imaris (v.9.10.0) batch process. Initially, the respective MAP2 three-dimensional surface was generated, followed by surfaces based on the respective VGLUT1, Shank2 or UNC13A–eGFP signal located within the 0.5 μm MAP2 periphery. Overlapping Shank2 and VGLUT1 surfaces were used to estimate the total number of synapses contacting individual autaptic neurons. Subsequently, the synapses overlapping with the UNC13A–eGFP signal were identified, and in a reciprocal manner, UNC13A–eGFP surfaces that overlap with synapses were identified. The data generated by the Imaris batch process were organized with the KNIME Analytics Platform (v.4.7.1) and further quantified with GraphPad Prism (v.9.0.0). For illustration, representative images were processed with the FIJI software package84 (v.2.14.0/1.54f) and assembled in Adobe Illustrator.

HEK293T cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% MEM, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 10% FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with UNC13A–GFP cDNA in pEGFP–N1 vector80 carrying the respective disease-related variations under the CMV promoter using Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 μg DNA per well in a six-well plate, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 3.5 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with culture medium, and the cells were incubated overnight. Translocation was induced by applying 1 µM PDBu for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, washed with PBS and treated with 50 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min to quench remaining PFA. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated with 1 µg ml−1 DAPI in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then washed again with PBS and mounted using Aqua-Poly/Mount. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM710-CONFOCOR3). Excitation wavelengths were 405 nm for DAPI and 488 nm for EGFP.

Strains were maintained and genetically manipulated as previously described85. Animals were raised at 20 °C on nematode growth media seeded with OP50. Control strains used included N2 and unc-13(nu641). unc-13(nu641) harbors a C-terminal mScarlet in the unc-13 locus as described previously86. UNC-13 residue numbering is based on the UNC-13L isoform accession number NP_001021874. CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing was performed to generate the desired genetic modifications in C. elegans. The CRISPR–Cas9 system was implemented using a co-injection strategy with Cas9 protein, CRISPR RNA (crRNAs) and repair templates.

For crRNA design, crRNAs targeting the desired genomic loci were initially designed using the Benchling online tool and custom crRNA design software from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). crRNAs were selected based on proximity of the cut site to the desired mutation, high on-target efficiency and minimal predicted off-target mutations. crRNAs were ordered from IDT, resuspended in 4 μg μl−1 in nuclease-free water and diluted to a working concentration of 0.4 μg μl−1 before adding to the injection mix.

For Cas9 preparation, recombinant Cas9 protein purchased from IDT (Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3) was stored at −20 °C and used at 0.25 mg ml−1. Trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) was purchased from IDT, diluted to 4 μg μl−1 in IDT nuclease-free duplex buffer and aliquots were stored at −20 °C.

For precise edits, single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were used as repair templates. These templates included the desired modification flanked by 20–50 bp homology arms and an engineered restriction site. Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were ordered from IDT (Ultramer DNA Oligonucleotides).

The injection mix was prepared as follows: 0.5 µl Cas9 protein (10 mg ml−1 stock), 5 µl tracrRNA (0.4 µg µl−1 stock), 2.8 µl mutant crRNA (0.4 µg µl−1 stock) and 2.8 µl mutant co-CRISPR crRNA (0.4 µg µl−1 stock). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow ribonucleoprotein complex formation. If a PCR repair template was used, it was melted during this step. Following ribonucleoprotein formation, 2 µl of mutant repair oligonucleotide (100 µM stock) and 2 µl of co-CRISPR repair oligonucleotide were added. Nuclease-free water was added to bring the final volume to 20 µl.

Young adult worms (either N2 or unc-13(nu641)) were immobilized on 2% agarose pads in halocarbon oil. The CRISPR–Cas9 injection mix was manually injected into the gonads of P0 worms using a Picospritzer III microinjector (Parker). The worm gonad was visualized using an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope with a ×40 air objective. Injected worms were recovered on seeded nematode growth medium plates at 20 °C for 3–4 days.

F1 progeny expressing the co-injection marker (unc-58) were selected for screening and grown to the young adult stage. Genomic DNA was extracted from worm lysates, and the targeted locus was amplified by PCR. PCR products were digested with the engineered restriction site to identify potential edits. Worms containing the restriction site and lacking the unc-58 gain-of-function phenotype were singled out, and homozygous progeny were isolated. Genomic DNA was then re-extracted and sequenced using nanopore sequencing (Plasmidsaurus) to confirm the presence of the desired edits. Animals were then outcrossed at least four times with the parent strain. Sequence information for C. elegans strains can be found in Supplementary Note 1.

To measure aldicarb sensitivity in C. elegans, 20–25 animals were placed on OP50-seeded agar plates containing 1 mM aldicarb (CarboSynth) as described previously87,88. Animals were scored for paralysis every 10 min for 2 h for each genotype. During an assay, the experimenter was blind to all genotypes, and each genotype was assayed at least ten times. Paralysis curves for each genotype were generated by averaging individual time courses.

A model of UNC13A consisting of the C1, C2B and MUN domains (residues 505–985) was predicted with AlphaFold (v.2.0; 01-JUL-21)89 using the UniProt sequence Q9UPW8 as input. The resulting model showed, as expected, a high similarity (root mean squared deviation, 1.08 Å) to the known 3D structure of rat MUNC-13 (PDB 5UE8)90. In addition to the protein, the two Zn2+ ions in the C1 domain were included. The Zn2+-coordinating cysteines and histidines were modeled as unprotonated and protonated on their Nε, respectively. All other amino acids were protonated at pH 7.0. Single mutations in the loop region (G808C, G808D, K811E, P814L), adjacent to the loop R799Q, and at the C1 domain (C587F, H554K) were incorporated with PyMol. Subsequently, WT UNC13A and all single mutants were solvated in cubic boxes of SPC/E water91 with the dimension of approximately 12.8 nm3. The net charges of the models were neutralized with K+Cl−, and an ionic strength of 150 mM K+Cl− was added. Additionally, five Ca2+ ions were inserted, replacing water molecules. To prevent ion aggregation, a previously published parameter set92 was applied. The protein was described by the Amber99SB*-ILDN force field93.

The subsequent molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the Gromacs 2021.2 package. After energy minimization and thermal equilibration with gradually decreasing position restraints, all periodic models were allowed to move freely during the following 1 µs-long production runs. To ensure reasonable statistics, all simulations were repeated five times. The temperature was maintained at 300 K and the pressure at 1 atm with the V-rescale scheme94 and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat95, respectively.

Constraining all bonds containing hydrogen atoms with the Lincs algorithm96 allowed a time step of 2 fs. Short-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.2 nm, while long-range electrostatics were calculated with the Particle Ewald summation97.

Images of 3D structures were generated with VMD98, graphs were drawn with the Matplotlib library included in Python99, and dipole moments were calculated with the MDAnalysis tool100.

HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding WT GFP–P2A–FLAG–MUNC13-1 without or with disease-related variants. As a negative control, non-transfected cells were used. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (according to the manufacturer's manual) and 1 µg of the plasmid. Then, 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA 630, 1% sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, supplemented with aprotinin, leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 21,000g. Supernatants were transferred into a fresh tube, and protein concentration was determined. Samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. Next, 10 μg of the samples were separated on 8% Bis–Tris gel in cold MOPS buffer at 150 V, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran 0.2 NC, Amersham) and stained with the Pierce reversible protein stain and destain kit (according to the manufacturer's manual; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 46430) for a sample loading control. The membranes were cut and incubated with an anti-Flag antibody, anti-GFP antibody (see Supplementary Table 2) and corresponding secondary antibodies, and the chemiluminescence signal was detected on an ECL ChemoStar imager (Intas). Signal intensity quantification was done in Fiji101. Protein levels were first normalized to the total protein staining of the corresponding lane, and ratios between the GFP and Flag signals were calculated.

Electrophysiological data are presented as means ± s.e.m., and statistical significance was determined using the non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. For the C. elegans paralysis assay, data were analyzed using a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn's test for all pairwise comparisons. Western blots and imaging data are presented as means ± s.e.m., and statistical significance was evaluated using a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. All analyses used two-sided tests and were performed using R statistical software (v.4.4.2)102 and the R packages ‘coin' and ‘dunn.test'.

C587, in which a disease variation was found, and H554 (H567 in the rodent UNC13A homolog; Fig. 5d) are Zn2+-coordinating residues. The finding that the C587F variant has a minor effect on basal synaptic transmission properties is surprising, because knock-in mouse neurons expressing a H567K mutation that abolishes PDBu/DAG binding14,15,49 have impaired synaptic transmission properties. To understand the cause of this difference, we compared the effect of H554K and C587F on the structural integrity of the human UNC13A C1 domain using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

The precise quantification of the limits to manipulating quantum resources lies at the core of quantum information theory. However, standard information-theoretic analyses do not consider the actual computational complexity involved in performing certain tasks. Here we address this issue within the realm of entanglement theory, finding that accounting for computational efficiency substantially changes what can be achieved using entangled resources. We consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost. These measures quantify the optimal rates of entangled bits that can be extracted from or used to dilute many identical copies of n-qubit bipartite pure states, using computationally efficient local operations and classical communication. We demonstrate that computational entanglement measures diverge considerably from their information-theoretic counterparts. Whereas the information-theoretic distillable entanglement is determined by the von Neumann entropy of the reduced state, we show that the min-entropy governs the computationally efficient setting. On the other hand, computationally efficient entanglement dilution requires maximal consumption of entangled bits, even for nearly unentangled states. Furthermore, in the worst-case scenario, even when an efficient description of the state exists and is fully known, one gains no advantage over state-agnostic protocols. Our findings establish sample-complexity bounds for measuring and testing the von Neumann entropy, fundamental limitations on efficient state compression and efficient local tomography protocols.

A central idea in modern science is that physical processes are inherently computational. This view, rooted in the physical Church–Turing thesis1,2,3, suggests that all natural processes—including those governing quantum systems—can be understood as computations characterized by well-defined algorithmic rules. In this framework, quantum mechanics is not just a theory of physical phenomena, but also a computational model, limited by the constraints of information processing. As a result, the study of quantum information should focus not only on identifying transformations that are theoretically possible, but also on those that are computationally feasible within these limits. However, traditional approaches in quantum information theory often assume access to unbounded computational resources within an information-theoretic framework4. Although this assumption is undoubtedly mathematically useful, it leads to idealized models of quantum resource manipulation that vastly overlook the computational complexities involved in transforming and processing quantum states, which are crucial to understanding the true characteristics of quantum information.

In this work, we address this issue within the framework of entanglement theory5, which is arguably the most fundamental and well-known quantum resource, from both a foundational and operational perspective. Entanglement not only underlies key advantages in computation6, superdense coding7, quantum teleportation8 and cryptography9, but also enables departures from classical theory, revealing the intrinsically non-classical nature of quantum information10. The basic setting of entanglement theory involves two distant parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), who can only perform local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on their respective systems. LOCC transformations naturally classify quantum states into two categories: separable states, which are easily accessible, and entangled states, which serve as valuable resources. Two central objectives in entanglement theory are the quantification of entanglement using entanglement monotones5,11,12,13,14—non-increasing functions of the quantum state under LOCC—and the manipulation of entanglement using only LOCC operations, which are the ones freely available to the parties involved. Although entanglement theory is a very well-established field with numerous definitive results5,7,8,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21, the natural impact of computational constraints remains largely unexplored, with only very recent works hinting at some of the limitations that this framework may introduce22,23,24. Thus, understanding how these restrictions redefine the actual accessible entanglement, both in terms of its quantification and the ability to manipulate it, constitutes a fundamental and pressing open problem—one that, remarkably, has yet to be thoroughly investigated.

Here we determine the computational limits and possibilities of entanglement theory within the most well-established and presumably most important setting: bipartite pure-state entanglement15,19. For pure states, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix \({S}_{1}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})=-{\rm{tr}}({\psi }_{\rm{A}}\log {\psi }_{\rm{A}})\) fundamentally captures both entanglement quantification and manipulation, determining the optimal asymptotic rates of state conversions under LOCC when many identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the input and output states are considered15. Thus, in an asymptotic, information-theoretic sense, the von Neumann entropy is essentially the unique measure of entanglement for what concerns bipartite pure states12,25.

However, as we show in this work, when computational limitations are taken into account and the LOCC operations are also required to be computationally efficient, this picture dramatically changes: the von Neumann entropy becomes fundamentally inaccessible and fails to capture the optimal state-conversion rates achievable with limited computing power. This should not come entirely as a surprise. For example, it is well known that estimating the von Neumann entropy is computationally hard for large quantum systems26,27. However, as one of the many consequences of our results, we prove that this computational inaccessibility takes place even when the von Neumann entropy is of order O(1) and the entanglement is thus very low. This discussion immediately prompts the question: if the von Neumann entropy becomes computationally inaccessible, what forms of entanglement can computationally bounded agents observe and manipulate? To address this, we consider two key figures of merit: the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost, defined on families of states with a scaling number of qubits n. When restricted to computationally efficient LOCC, the first quantifies the maximum rate of approximate purified entanglement, in the form of entangled bits (ebits) \(| {\phi }^{+}\left.\right\rangle =(| 00\left.\right\rangle +| 11\left.\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}\) that can be extracted from a set of pure i.i.d. quantum states, whereas the second captures the minimal rate of entanglement required to approximately prepare a target bipartite i.i.d. source starting from preshared ebits. Notably, the nature of these computational entanglement measures is fundamentally different from their information-theoretic counterparts, which are entirely characterized by the von Neumann entropy. As we demonstrate throughout this work, another entanglement monotone assumes a crucial role here: the min-entropy \({S}_{\min }=-\log \parallel {\psi }_{\rm{A}}\parallel\), that is, the negative logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix of the state.

Specifically, we rigorously establish the existence of families of states for which any computationally efficient distillation protocol operating on k = O(poly n) input copies cannot achieve a distillation rate greater than \(\min \{\varTheta ({S}_{\min }),\varTheta (\log k)\}\) (we use standard Landau notation, see Supplementary Information Section A.1 for a formal definition), regardless of the actual value of the von Neumann entropy which can even be \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), that is, maximal up to logarithmic factors. Then, leveraging standard tools from representation theory, we show that this rate is always attainable by means of an explicit, computationally efficient LOCC protocol based on the Schur transform28—remarkably, without requiring any previous knowledge of the input state. For certain families of states with \({S}_{\min }=o(1)\) and \({S}_{1}=\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), this result establishes a maximal separation (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the information-theoretic distillable entanglement. On a seemingly unrelated note, we also apply the optimal distillation protocol to aid the task of LOCC pure-state tomography, showing that any global tomography algorithm can be converted into an LOCC-based one incurring a very small computational overhead. This first result introduces an inherently computational interpretation of the min-entropy in entanglement theory—which before was only apparent in a single-shot, information-theoretic setting29,30—as the ultimate achievable rate for computationally bounded entanglement distillation. By contrast, the computational entanglement cost behaves quite differently. We demonstrate the existence of states for which no computationally efficient dilution protocol can achieve a dilution rate lower than \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), irrespective of the value of the von Neumann entropy (that is, the information-theoretic entanglement cost), which can be as small as o(1). This implies that, in the worst case, even for nearly unentangled states, efficient state dilution requires maximal consumption of ebits, making the simplest dilution protocol—quantum teleportation8—optimal in this setting (Fig. 1). The same limitations derived for the entanglement cost also apply to the task of state compression31, where Alice wants to transmit a mixed quantum source to Bob using as few noiseless quantum channel uses as possible.

The information-theoretic distillable entanglement and entanglement cost represent the optimal rates at which one can purify or dilute a collection of identical copies of a pure bipartite entangled state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) within the distant parties paradigm. In this setting, Alice and Bob, can naturally manipulate the quantum states held at their respective laboratories using only LOCC operations. A single quantity, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix S1(ψA) governs both asymptotic rates when computational restrictions are not taken into account (1). In this work, we consider the computational analogues thereof in which each step is assumed to be computationally efficient. We exhibit families of states for which the computational distillable entanglement is \({S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\) and other families for which the computational entanglement cost is (maximally) \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\). These results apply irrespective of the actual value of S1(ψA), which therefore loses operational meaning in this computationally limited setting (2).

Crucially, both optimal computationally efficient protocols mentioned above, for distilling and diluting entanglement, are state agnostic; that is, they do not require any previous knowledge of the state object of the protocol. In addition, as a second result, we find that even granting state-agnostic protocols unbounded computing power, but limited sample complexity, does not improve the worst-case rates above.

However, deriving the previously mentioned bounds on computational entanglement measures requires us to use classes of states that do not admit an efficient classical description. This leads to the third central result of our work: even when the input states admit an efficient classical description that is made fully available to Alice and Bob, we show that this does not improve the worst-case rates, as compiling better-performing LOCC protocols starting from the classical description may still be computationally intractable. Instead, state-agnostic protocols are again worst-case optimal. Differently from the results above, proving this requires us to make use of a computational hardness assumption, namely, that the learning with errors (LWE) decision problem requires superpolynomial time to solve on a quantum computer, which is a widely adopted assumption in post-quantum cryptography32.

Taken together, our results reveal that, in entanglement theory, quantitatively similar computational limitations can arise from fundamentally distinct mechanisms. These include: (1) the state having a computationally complex Schmidt basis, which inherently limits the feasibility of any efficient LOCC protocol; (2) the absence of previous information on the state, where even unbounded computing power—constrained only by limited sample complexity—fails to extract sufficient information to substantially enhance LOCC performance beyond the established optimal bounds; and (3) the state admitting an efficient but cryptographically secure classical description where deriving a better-performing LOCC protocol from this description remains computationally intractable.

Finally, our findings fit within the broader framework of entanglement reversibility. In standard bipartite pure-state entanglement theory, reversibility holds: asymptotically, the entanglement extracted from a quantum state can be used to reconstruct the state back without any loss15. However, when computational constraints are introduced, our results show that this reversibility breaks down. In this setting, entanglement transformations become inherently irreversible, with states exhibiting a reversibility ratio that scales inversely with the system size n, approaching zero in large many-body systems. Notably, this framework uncovers the existence of computationally bound entangled states—displaying maximal computational entanglement cost yet possessing near-zero computational distillable entanglement. This phenomenon, which in the standard information-theoretic setting applies exclusively to mixed states33, is thus revealed to have a pure-state counterpart in computationally constrained entanglement theory.

In standard entanglement theory, LOCC manipulation tasks are fundamental to defining entanglement quantifiers, which thereby acquire direct operational significance. In the same vein, we introduce the analogous tasks when computational power is limited. In this setting, the most relevant conversions are entanglement distillation and entanglement dilution15, which, in the i.i.d. and asymptotic regime, give rise to the familiar measures of distillable entanglement and entanglement cost5. Beyond their foundational role, these processes enable key quantum information protocols such as superdense coding7, quantum teleportation8 and quantum cryptography9.

When Alice and Bob are restricted in computational power, it is natural to consider families of states indexed by a growing number of qubits n, because efficiency must be defined with respect to how resources scale. Supplementary Information Section A.2 provides a rigorous introduction to these ideas; henceforth, we assume this setting implicitly and omit explicit mention for brevity. Mirroring the information-theoretic case, we now define entanglement manipulation tasks under computational constraints, which naturally lead to the notion of computational entanglement measures.

We now consider a system of n qubits and an extensive bipartition A∣B. In general, the task of k-shot entanglement distillation consists of transforming k copies of a bipartite state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) into an approximate source of purified entanglement in the form of ebits. The maximum achievable rate in this process defines the k-shot distillable entanglement, denoted by \({E}_{\rm{D}}^{\;(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})\). Here, by approximate, we mean that the protocol may have a non-zero (but small) failure probability and may produce ebits with a small (constant) error in trace distance.

When considering entanglement distillation in a computationally restricted setting, this limitation arises at two levels: first, the LOCC distillation protocol must be sample-efficient, that is, the number of copies received as input must scale at most polynomially with the system size, k = O(poly n); second, the LOCC operation must be efficiently implementable, with running time T = O(poly n). With these constraints, we can informally characterize the measure of computational distillable entanglement as follows.

(Computational distillable entanglement: informal). Let \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) be a bipartite pure state defined on a sufficiently large number of qubits n. Given k = O(poly n) input copies, the computational distillable entanglement, \({\hat{E}}_{\rm{D}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})\), is defined as the maximum rate at which approximate ebits can be extracted using LOCC protocols with running time T = O(poly n).

We now turn to introducing another fundamental entanglement manipulation task: that is, entanglement dilution, which serves as the converse operation to distillation. The task of k-shot entanglement dilution involves the approximate preparation of k copies of a target bipartite state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) by means of LOCC, starting from a source of preshared ebits. The minimum rate of consumed ebits defines the k-shot entanglement cost \({E}_{\rm{C}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})\) of the state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\).

This definition again naturally leads to its computationally restricted version. Here, however, beyond requiring that the number of copies and the running time of the protocol scale at most polynomially in n, we explicitly want to focus on the computational resources needed to distribute the state across the bipartition A∣B, rather than to prepare it from scratch. To account for this, we assume that Alice (or, equivalently, Bob) has local access to O(poly n) samples of the state to be diluted. With this set-up, we define informally the computational entanglement cost as follows.

(Computational entanglement cost: informal). Given local sample access to poly-many copies of a state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) and a target of k = O(poly n) output copies, the computational entanglement cost, \({\hat{E}}_{\rm{C}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})\), is defined as the minimum rate of ebits necessary to approximately dilute the state across the bipartition A∣B, using LOCC protocols with running time T = O(poly n).

Note that our Definitions 1 and 2 differ substantially from the ones considered in ref. 23 in that we consider the more generic k-shot setting rather than the more restrictive single-shot case analysed in ref. 23. Furthermore, contrary to our case, the definition of entanglement cost in ref. 23 does not allow Alice and Bob to have local sample access to the target state. However, we think this is necessary to avoid counting computational resources that are only due to local preparation and are independent of the entanglement dilution task itself.

As previously discussed, entanglement manipulation tasks are closely tied to entanglement quantifiers. For bipartite pure states, a family of entanglement monotones is provided by the Rényi entropies of entanglement \({S}_{\alpha }({\psi }_{\rm{A}}):={(1-\alpha )}^{-1}\log {\rm{tr}}{\psi }_{\rm{A}}^{\alpha }\) with α ≥ 0 (ref. 11). Among these, particularly notable are the von Neumann entropy \({S}_{1}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})=\)\(-{\rm{tr}}({\psi }_{\rm{A}}\log {\psi }_{\rm{A}})\) (α → 1+), the min-entropy, \({S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})=\)\(-\log \parallel {\psi }_{\rm{A}}\parallel\) (α → ∞) and the max-entropy \({S}_{0}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})=\)\(\log {\rm{rank}}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\) (α → 0). The Rényi entropies are monotonically decreasing in α, with the min-entropy being the smallest. In the absence of computational constraints, the von Neumann entropy determines the optimal asymptotic rates for both pure-state distillation and dilution tasks when the number of copies approaches infinity: \(\mathop{\lim }\nolimits_{k\to \infty }{E}_{\rm{D}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})=\)\(\mathop{\lim }\nolimits_{k\to \infty }{E}_{\rm{C}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}})={S}_{1}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\) (ref. 15), which implies the asymptotic reversibility of the theory.

Furthermore, more recent results show that the von Neumann entropy rate is actually reached with k = O(poly n) copies29,34,35, albeit without taking into account any computational limitations. Thus, sample efficiency alone does not pose any fundamental limitation on entanglement manipulation. Smoothed versions of the min-entropy and the max-entropy govern the single-shot regime, with the smoothed min-entropy quantifying the single-shot distillable entanglement and the smoothed max-entropy quantifying the single-shot entanglement cost29,36.

Having outlined the settings of interest and the associated computational entanglement measures, we now proceed to present the main results on computationally constrained entanglement manipulation.

We now aim to determine the fundamental limits and possibilities of computationally efficient entanglement manipulation. Here the goal is to precisely characterize the computational distillable entanglement and the computational entanglement cost by establishing bounds on the optimal rates and providing LOCC protocols that achieve them.

However, when revisiting entanglement theory through a computational lens, another crucial aspect becomes evident: the optimal conversion rates that we introduced in Definitions 1 and 2 implicitly assume that Alice and Bob have perfect knowledge of the state. While the mere existence of a computationally efficient protocol may provide achievability bounds on computational entanglement measures, this assumption contradicts the perspective adopted in this work. Having perfect knowledge of the state means fully characterizing it, but given the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of qubits n, this lies fundamentally beyond the realm of computational feasibility. For entanglement manipulation tasks to remain meaningful in a computationally constrained scenario, there are essentially two possibilities.

State agnostic: Alice and Bob are given (at most polynomially many) copies of an unknown quantum state, with the goal of manipulating and characterizing its entanglement.

State aware: Alice and Bob possess an efficient classical description of the state, which they use to manipulate and characterize its entanglement.

For what concerns efficient entanglement distillation, the state-agnostic scenario limits Alice and Bob to gather information on the unknown state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) through efficient local measurements on O(poly n) samples, which inform their LOCC distillation protocol but reduce the distillation rate owing to measurement-induced consumption of copies. In the state-aware scenario, instead, they have full circuit-level knowledge of the state but may still face the computational intractability of extracting key properties like the Schmidt eigenbasis and coefficients, crucial for optimal LOCC design.

For entanglement dilution, the settings are analogous. In the state-agnostic case, Alice and Bob have local access to O(poly n) copies of an unknown bipartite state and use measurements to inform an LOCC protocol that minimizes ebits consumption. Unlike distillation, measured (local) copies here do not count against resources. In the state-aware case, they additionally have the state's classical description and aim to design an efficient LOCC protocol based on this information.

Having cleared the framework of entanglement manipulation in the computationally constrained regime, we now quantify the limits and capabilities of the state-agnostic and state-aware scenarios, starting with the former. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals a deep connection between the two: in the worst case, state-awareness offers no advantage, as the fully state-agnostic approach is fundamentally optimal.

We begin our investigation of the state-agnostic setting by first considering entanglement distillation. We note that previous works have already highlighted some limitations in the computationally constrained setting. Specifically, the discovery of pseudoentangled quantum states22 reveals computationally indistinguishable families of bipartite pure states with an entanglement gap of Ω(n) versus O(polylog n), establishing that no state-agnostic protocol can distil more than \(O(\log n)\) ebits in the worst case. Our work goes beyond this result, showing that this bound is overly optimistic and cannot be achieved by any state-agnostic protocol in many scenarios. Furthermore, we show that our worst-case bounds are actually achievable, by providing an explicit state-agnostic and computationally efficient distillation protocol (‘Theorem 2').

The crux of our no-go results is the construction of families of statistically indistinguishable pseudoentangled states with a maximal entanglement gap of \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\) versus o(1) (equation (1)) across a fixed extensive bipartition A∣B. This has a profound implication: state-agnostic protocols with limited sample complexity cannot distil any ebits from general quantum states, even when the von Neumann entropy is maximal, which thus strengthens existing bounds on the limitations of such protocols. At the same time, these pseudoentangled families exhibit o(1) entanglement when quantified by the min-entropy \({S}_{\min }\). This suggests that the min-entropy is a key quantity determining the fundamental limitations of distillation protocols in computationally constrained, state-agnostic scenarios. Building on this, we refine our construction to create pseudoentangled families with tunable min-entropy \({S}_{\min }\), leading to the formulation of our main state-agnostic no-go result.

(No-go on state-agnostic distillation: informal). Any sample-efficient and state-agnostic approximate LOCC distillation protocol cannot distil more than \(\min \{{S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\,+\,o(1),2\log k\,+\,O(1)\}\) ebits from k copies of a bipartite input state \(| {\psi }_{AB}\left.\right\rangle\), regardless the value of the von Neumann entropy S1(ψA).

The proof reduces to the construction of two statistically indistinguishable families of states with the same min-entropy \({S}_{\min }\) and a tunable von Neumann entropy gap, which can be maximal (\(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\) versus \(O({S}_{\min })\)). The construction is relatively straightforward as it considers states of the form

where \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) may encode either a Haar random state or a suitable pseudoentangled quantum state, which, in our case, is chosen to be obtained by means of a classical bit-string permutation applied to a smaller Haar subsystem. The parameter η ∈ [0, 1] is appropriately chosen to tune the entanglement gap. Since the two families of states are statistically indistinguishable and have a tunable entanglement gap, any state-agnostic distillation rate cannot exceed the lowest value of S1 among the two, which coincides with \({S}_{\min }\) or \(\log k\) for appropriate choices of the pseudoentangled families. For the complete rigorous proof, we refer to Supplementary Information Section B.3.

Somewhat unexpectedly, even in the regime of low entanglement \({S}_{1}=O(\log n)\), the von Neumann entropy is completely inaccessible to any sample-efficient state-agnostic protocol and the distillable entanglement is instead captured by the min-entropy. In the particular case where \({S}_{\min }=\varOmega (\,\text{polylog}\,n)\) we recover, as a special case, the results of ref. 22, as the bound in Theorem 1 simplifies to \(O(\log k)\), which coincides with \(O(\log n)\) when poly n input copies are available.

Now a crucial question becomes evident: does an efficient state-agnostic protocol exist that achieves the limitations imposed by Theorem 1? We hereby provide a positive answer by presenting a finite-shot regime analysis of a protocol originally considered in the asymptotic setting in ref. 37. This protocol is state agnostic and relies on the Schur transform, which leverages permutation symmetry to decompose a k-fold tensor product state onto irreducible subspaces of the symmetric and unitary groups38. Crucially, this decomposition features maximally entangled states in orthogonal (irreducible) subspaces, which can thus be extracted by means of local operations without perturbation. Remarkably, the Schur transform can be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer when k = O(poly n) (refs. 39,40). Although the complete description of the distillation protocol requires several technical preliminaries and is deferred to Supplementary Information Sections A.5 and B.1, here we present the main takeaway result in the following informal theorem.

(State-agnostic distillation performance: informal). There exists an explicit, state-agnostic and computationally efficient distillation protocol that approximately distils at a rate \(\min \{\varOmega ({S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})),\varOmega (\log k)\}\) from poly-many copies of any given input state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\). In other words, for any state,

Taken together, Theorems 1 and 2 establish achievable and optimal (up to logarithmic factors) rates for state-agnostic entanglement distillation when given access to k = O(poly n) copies of the input state. Furthermore, since the optimal protocol is computationally efficient, its optimality holds even under (more strict) computational constraints. These results provide a definitive benchmark for what is achievable in the state-agnostic and sample-efficient regime, shedding light on its fundamental limitations and possibilities. We note that, when \(k=\varOmega (\exp n)\), the protocol considered in Theorem 2 achieves the von Neumann entropy rate37; therefore state-agnostic protocols are essentially information-theoretically optimal when the sample-complexity scales exponentially.

Clearly, the no-go result in Theorem 1 leaves open the existence of agnostic protocols that may achieve higher rates on some restricted classes of states. For example, as we show in Supplementary Information Section C.2, this is the case for low-rank states, for which the protocol analysed in Theorem 2 distils at the (information-theoretically maximal) von Neumann entropy rate. Notably, these states may not be efficiently simulable. This reveals a gap between the simulability of quantum states and the efficient manipulation of their entanglement. This has already been noted in ref. 41, where optimal and computationally efficient entanglement manipulation of entanglement-dominated t-doped stabilizer states has been shown beyond the classical simulability barrier.

Because the results in Theorems 1 and 2 cover only the state-agnostic scenario, an immediate question is: are there states for which the state-agnostic rate above is optimal among all computationally efficient protocols? Surprisingly, the answer is positive, as stated by the following theorem.

(Tight upper bound on computational distillable entanglement: informal). Let n be sufficiently large. Then there exists at least one state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}^{* }\left.\right\rangle\) with von Neumann entropy \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\) and computational distillable entanglement \({\hat{E}}_{\rm{D}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{AB}}^{* })\le \min \{{S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}}^{* }),\log k\}+o(1)\), for any k = O(poly n).

The proof relies on the key fact that the pseudoentangled state families in equation (1), although not being pseudorandom, exhibit strong pseudorandom components. This leads to a concentration of measure phenomena, ensuring that any LOCC operation acting on the highly entangled ensemble as defined by equation (1) yields results close to the respective Haar average. Because computationally efficient LOCCs are ‘only' 2O(poly n) in number, although the concentration is doubly exponential, on most states any efficient LOCC must produce an output concentrating near the average. Finally, as the Haar average is statistically close to the pseudorandom one and the two families have a tunable entanglement gap, the distillation rate is upper bounded by the family with the lowest entanglement content, as quantified by the von Neumann entropy. See Supplementary Information Section B.4 for a detailed proof.

Together, Theorems 2 and 3 provide a complete worst-case characterization of the computational distillable entanglement. Notably, they demonstrate that there exist states for which the computational distillable entanglement precisely satisfies

regardless the value of the von Neumann entropy S1. This result reveals that in a computationally constrained setting, the min-entropy takes on a pivotal role, replacing the von Neumann entropy as the key quantity traditionally associated with asymptotic entanglement distillation. Moreover, it reaffirms the optimality of the state-agnostic protocol discussed in Theorem 2.

We now turn to describing our results for the converse task: state-agnostic entanglement dilution. Here, the simplest state-agnostic dilution procedure is the quantum teleportation protocol8, which, starting from local copies of the state to be diluted, consumes n ebits per copy to distribute the state non-locally across the bipartition A∣B. Although quantum teleportation seems highly inefficient in terms of the consumed entanglement, our construction of pseudoentangled states (equation (1)) implies that quantum teleportation is, in fact, optimal in terms of ebits consumption, even when the von Neumann entropy is o(1). This is summarized in the following theorem.

(No-go on state-agnostic entanglement dilution: informal). Any sample-efficient, state-agnostic and approximate dilution protocol cannot dilute at a rate less than \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), irrespective of the value of the von Neumann entropy, which can be o(1).

This establishes that quantum teleportation, being state-agnostic and computationally efficient, is worst-case optimal among all other agnostic protocols in terms of ebits consumption even for states with vanishingly small entanglement, that is, S1 = o(1).

Similarly to the case of entanglement dilution, one might ask whether there exist states for which quantum teleportation remains the optimal computationally feasible approach to entanglement dilution when compared with arbitrary computationally efficient protocols. In the following theorem, we address this question by demonstrating the existence of states with a computational entanglement cost lower bounded by \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), regardless of their von Neumann entropy.

(Tight lower bound on computational entanglement cost:informal). Let n be sufficiently large. Then there exists at least one state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}^{* }\left.\right\rangle\) with computational entanglement cost \({\hat{E}}_{\rm{C}}^{(k)}({\psi }_{\rm{A}}^{* })\ge \tilde{\varOmega }(n)\), irrespective of the (arbitrarily small) value of the von Neumann entropy \({S}_{1}({\psi }_{\rm{A}}^{* })\).

As a direct consequence of Theorem 5 and of quantum teleportation, we achieve a full worst-case characterization of the computational entanglement cost. Specifically, we show the existence of states for which \({\hat{E}}_{\rm{C}}^{(k)}=\tilde{\varTheta }(n)\), despite having an arbitrarily low information-theoretic entanglement cost, as quantified by the von Neumann entropy.

As a corollary of Theorem 5, the same worst-case bounds apply to the task of state compression31, where Alice aims to compress many i.i.d. copies of a mixed quantum source ρA to minimize the uses of a noiseless quantum channel for transmitting the source to Bob. Asymptotically, the optimal compression rate is again given by S1(ρA) (ref. 31). Because state compression can serve as a dilution protocol—with Alice first encoding the state and then teleporting its compressed version—the no-go result of Theorem 5 (as well as any other no-go on the entanglement cost) applies directly (for more details, see Supplementary Information Section D).

Having examined the state-agnostic scenario, we now consider the state-aware setting, where the agents have an efficient classical description of the state they wish to manipulate. However, as we anticipated, this knowledge does not grant efficient access to the optimal state conversion protocol, as computing key figures of merit may remain computationally unfeasible. The next theorem formalizes this intuition, showing that even with a classical description, designing a better-performing LOCC protocol than in the state-agnostic case remains computationally intractable in the worst case. This result holds under the assumption that the LWE decision problem is computationally hard to solve for a quantum computer (Supplementary Information Section A.6), which is a widely adopted assumption in post-quantum cryptography32.

(No-go on state-aware entanglement manipulation: informal). Let δ > 0. Assuming that the LWE problem is superpolynomially hard to solve on a quantum computer, the following two statements hold.

No computationally efficient protocol can be efficiently designed to distil at a rate larger than \({S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})+o(1)\) from k copies of a bipartite pure quantum state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\), even when provided with an efficient circuit description of the state. This limitation holds regardless of the value of \({S}_{1}({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\,=\,\tilde{O}({n}^{1-\delta })\) and for \({S}_{\min }({\psi }_{\rm{A}})\,=\,O({n}^{\delta })\).

any computationally efficient protocol efficiently designed to dilute k copies of a bipartite state starting from its efficient circuit description must consume more than Ω(n1 − δ) ebits. This result holds regardless of the value of S1(ψA) = O(n1 − δ).

This reveals a surprising insight: although the state-aware scenario seems advantageous, it does not necessarily improve conversion rates over the fully state-agnostic case. For certain state classes, the information needed to design superior LOCC protocols remains computationally inaccessible, even with a classical description.

Notably, Theorem 6 does not rule out the existence of efficient LOCC protocols for entanglement manipulation. Unlike Theorem 3 and Theorem 5, it imposes no bounds on computational entanglement measures but prevents Alice and Bob from efficiently identifying such a protocol.

Despite its worst-case limitations, Theorem 6 does not preclude improvements in some specific scenarios. For example, ref. 41 shows that for t-doped stabilizer states with sufficiently high entanglement, knowing the associated stabilizer group enables computationally efficient distillation and dilution at the von Neumann entropy rate.

In this final section we leverage on our previous findings to analyse the computational feasibility of other fundamental tasks in entanglement theory. In particular, we focus on the learning tasks of estimating and testing the von Neumann entropy and on LOCC state tomography. In the entropy estimation task, an agent is given access to k copies of an unknown bipartite pure state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) and the goal is to measure the von Neumann entropy S1(ψA) with additive precision ε. In the entropy-testing task, on the other hand, one is provided with states belonging to two distinct classes: one with von Neumann entropy ≤α and the other with von Neumann entropy ≥β, where 0 < α < β. The task is to distinguish between these two classes with a high probability of success. Our primary focus will be to determine the necessary number of input state copies required to successfully accomplish either of these tasks for any given range of the von Neumann entropy. Instead, for what concerns LOCC tomography, the objective is for Alice and Bob to construct a classical description of an unknown bipartite pure state up to a certain error in trace distance, given access to k copies of the state and being restricted to performing only LOCC measurements. First, by leveraging our construction of pseudoentangled states (equation (1)), we derive an explicit and nearly tight lower bound for the tasks of entropy estimation and testing, irrespective of the (fixed) range of the von Neumann entropy.

(Measuring and testing the von Neumann entropy). Given sample access to an unknown bipartite pure state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\), Ω(2n/2) samples are necessary to estimate the von Neumann entropy S1 of the reduced density matrix up to a constant additive error, even when S1(ψA) = O(1). Similarly, testing whether S1(ψA) ≤ α or S1(ψA) ≥ β requires \(\varOmega ({2}^{\frac{\alpha }{2\beta }n})\) many copies.

Our result on entanglement detection generalizes known results26 by demonstrating that estimating the von Neumann entropy requires exponential sample complexity, even for states with very low O(1) entanglement. On the other hand, our result on entanglement testing extends the known classical result (holding for the Shannon entropy) shown by Valiant42. Corollary 1 solidifies even more a key theme emerging throughout our work, which is that the von Neumann entropy, in a computationally limited scenario, loses its operational asymptotic meaning and cannot be efficiently detected, even when the entanglement is very low. By contrast, the entanglement measure that a computationally bounded agent perceives is the min-entropy, or more generally, any Rényi entropy with α ≥ 2. Notably, the operator norm ∥ψA∥ is efficiently measurable to additive precision ε using a quantum algorithm that scales as O(1/ε2), as outlined in ref. 43.

Finally, as our concluding result, we demonstrate that LOCC state tomography does not impose a substantially higher cost compared with standard tomography. Specifically, thanks to the existence of a computationally efficient agnostic distillation protocol (Theorem 2), Alice and Bob can transform any global tomography protocol into one based solely on LOCC. They achieve this by first efficiently distilling purified entanglement and then using the resulting ebits to teleport the state, incurring only a linear multiplicative sample-complexity overhead in the system dimension.

(Efficient LOCC tomography). Given an unknown bipartite pure state \(| {\psi }_{\rm{AB}}\left.\right\rangle\) of n qubits, any (global) tomography algorithm with sample complexity of Kn and precision ε can be efficiently converted into an ε-precise LOCC tomography protocol with sample complexity O(nKn/ε2).

In particular, this result shows that the optimal sample-complexity bounds for pure-state tomography of Ω(d/ε2) are achieved with regard to the dependency in d, up to a logarithmic factor, even by LOCC protocols. Furthermore, because the distillation protocol is computationally efficient, any efficiently learnable class of states can be learned efficiently by means of LOCC. This last result also rigorously shows that, for efficiently learnable classes of states, computationally efficient state-agnostic and state-aware protocols are essentially equivalent, as the agents can allocate a small fraction of the input copies to gain precise information on the unknown input, without negatively impacting the protocol's performance.

In this work, we have explored the foundations of pure-state entanglement theory within the computationally efficient realm, establishing definitive rates for efficient entanglement manipulation with matching achievability and optimality results. Our bounds highlight a maximal gap between information-theoretic and computational transformation rates, showing that, independently of the entanglement content, the von Neumann entropy loses its operational value and becomes entirely inaccessible to computationally bounded agents. Instead, the min-entropy appears as the fundamental limit governing optimal distillation rates. This work underscores the critical importance of considering computational resources in quantum information tasks, which are often assumed to be unlimited.

Our results extend beyond the findings of previous studies. First, although ref. 22 has established a state-agnostic no-go for entanglement distillation beyond a rate of \(O(\log n)\), here we demonstrate that this is overly optimistic by showing a maximal separation of \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\) versus o(1) instead, leveraging our construction of pseudoentangled states with a maximal entanglement gap. We emphasize that this finding does not contradict the conclusions of refs. 22,24, where the authors state that the largest pseudoentangled gap should be Ω(n) versus O(polylogn). A closer look at ref. 22 reveals that this no-go result applies only when pseudoentangled states are also required to be pseudorandom (that is, statistically indistinguishable from Haar random states). However, in our case we find this requirement to be unnecessary to prove our results. Second, although the authors of ref. 23 have derived no-go results in the single-shot setting, here we have addressed the more general many-shot regime. In particular, the single-shot (worst-case) no-go results of ref. 23 can be derived from our theorems as a corollary. Our extension allows a direct comparison to the asymptotic rates given by the von Neumann entropy (actually achievable with poly-many copies), which in the single-shot case is inaccessible even information theoretically29,35,36. Furthermore, although refs. 22,23 focused solely on no-go results, here we present optimal and non-trivial achievable rates (given by the min-entropy) for computationally efficient entanglement distillation, by providing an explicit, computationally efficient and state-agnostic protocol. Our construction also shows that improvements upon the public-key pseudoentanglement one of ref. 24 can be obtained, as shown in Theorem 6.

In particular, we introduced two quantum circuit classes with an entanglement gap of Ω(n1 − δ) versus o(1) (for δ > 0), surpassing the previous Ω(n) versus O(nδ) gap under the assumption that LWE is superpolynomially hard for quantum computers. This gap strengthens to \(\tilde{\varOmega }(n)\) versus o(1) under the stronger assumption that no subexponential quantum algorithm can solve LWE. This has direct implications for determining the ground state entanglement of local Hamiltonians, reinforcing that, even if the ground state is nearly a product state, a classical Hamiltonian description cannot determine its entanglement across a fixed bipartition. This strengthens the previous results of ref. 24. However, as with our other construction, our pseudoentanglement gap does not extend to most cuts. Whether such a large entanglement gap can be achieved across most cuts remains an open question.

For learning tasks, we have analysed entropy estimation and testing in the regime of up to constant entropy. Although the sample-complexity hardness for large entropy values is well established26,27,44, the regime of O(1) entropy has not been addressed by existing results. In addition, although direct connection between efficient LOCC tomography and certain specific tomography protocols can be inferred from previous work, out result provides a general and explicit link.

To conclude, although the problem of determining optimal information-theoretic conversion rates has traditionally been studied within the framework of quantum resource theories45, it often ignores computational constraints. Our work advocates for a complementary approach based on computational quantum resource theories, where efficient computation plays a fundamental role. This shift could open new directions in quantum communication46, quantum thermodynamics47, quantum coherence48, non-Gaussianity49 and magic50. For what concerns entanglement under computational constraints, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the bipartite pure-state scenario. Although our no-go results trivially extend to mixed states, a key open question is whether entanglement can be efficiently manipulated in states that are not excessively mixed. Reference 51 shows infeasibility for states with superpolynomially small purity, but the possibility remains for those with at most polynomially small purity. Whether an entropy-like measure, akin to min-entropy, plays a fundamental role in this regime remains an open question. Multipartite entanglement presents further challenges. Although its manipulation is difficult even information theoretically52, certain structured states—such as stabilizer states and their t-doped extensions—allow computationally efficient transformations41,53. This suggests that computational efficiency could offer new insights into multipartite entanglement theory, unveiling new avenues for exploration.

Beatriz Ychussie's career in mathematics seemed to be going really well. She worked at Roskilde University in Denmark where, in 2015 and 2016 alone, she published four papers on mathematical formulae for quantum particles, heat flow and geometry, and reviewed multiple manuscripts for reputable journals.

But a few years later, her run of promising studies dried up. An investigation by the publisher of three of those papers found not only that the work was flawed, but that Ychussie didn't even exist.

How big is science's fake-paper problem?

How big is science's fake-paper problem?

Her name is one of a network of 26 fictitious authors and reviewers that had infiltrated four mathematics journals belonging to the London-based publisher Springer Nature.

These sham scholars were created by a paper mill, a company that manipulates peer reviews and sells fake research papers to researchers looking to boost their profile. By inventing a stable of fake scientists, paper mills can create a ready supply of publications and favourable peer reviews, ensuring that more of the mills' submissions get published. This tactic increases their output and credibility for paying customers.

This particular paper mill used two dozen fake authors and reviewers to publish 55 articles — one of the biggest such cases reported. After a lengthy investigation, Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature, retracted all three papers. (Nature's news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)

Other publishers have discovered similar fakes, with fictitious reviewers being more frequent than fake authors. Researchers acknowledge that this type of fraud probably isn't a hugely common problem, but that the true scale is unknown. “We're just flying completely blind here,” says Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

Paper mills and individuals can also impersonate real researchers, stealing their identities to make submissions seem legitimate and increase their chances of getting published.

Most publishers already check author identity before accepting submissions. Some rely on simple checks, such as whether a scientist is using an e-mail from a recognized institution. Others use several tests. Frontiers journals, for instance, cross-reference researcher records and look for previous publications. They also ask authors to confirm contributions made by others listed on the paper.

But verifying identity is difficult because journal editors, reviewers and authors typically communicate remotely through e-mail or submission systems. Scientific publishing runs mostly on trust. There are ongoing discussions about whether to adopt more stringent measures — for example, requiring use of institutional e-mails or logging in with a system that uses university credentials — and even asking for documents such as passports or driving licences.

But such identity checks risk excluding scholars who do not work at a known institution, as well as early-career researchers and individuals in low- and middle-income countries who do not have institutional e-mails, says Adya Misra, associate director of research integrity at Sage Publications in Liverpool, UK. Journal editors might not feel comfortable playing ‘immigration officers', checking identities for every submission. “What we lack as an industry is standards on what we consider to be a verified researcher,” says Misra.

In 2018, a reader spotted a pair of flawed and nearly identical papers that had been published in two mathematics journals the year before, and alerted the journal staff. The publisher of the journals, Springer Nature, discovered that both articles had used fictitious reviewers.

That was only the start. The fake reviewers had appeared as authors on earlier papers (some journals, including the two that published the flawed papers, allow authors to recommend their own peer reviewers). So once both made-up names became published authors, they began to be repeatedly suggested for reviewing.

Between 2013 and 2020, the paper mill published 55 papers with the help of 13 fictitious reviewers and 13 fake authors, who were supposedly based all over the world.

Most of those fake authors appeared on only one article, but were suggested as reviewers 68 times. The other 13 fake personas had no publication history and were invited to review 25 times. When Springer Nature contacted the institutions that supposedly employed the researchers, those universities confirmed that no such people had ever been on their staff.

The fact that fake scientists with a publication history were invited to review papers more often than were those without explains why paper mills would bother to publish papers under fake names in the first place, says Tim Kersjes, head of research integrity at Springer Nature in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.

It took Springer Nature two years to investigate this ring of fake scientists, eventually finding that they were probably the work of a China-based paper mill and retracting all of the affected papers by early 2021.

“Science has always been predicated on trust, and, at the time, awareness of identity fraud in peer review was limited. Such manipulation was rare, and editors were less alert to the risks,” Kersjes says. “We now have much more rigorous checks and editor training and awareness.” Kersjes presented his team's investigation last month at the 10th International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication in Chicago, Illinois.

Fictitious personas are just one example of identity fraud. Individuals and paper mills can also impersonate real scientists, posing as authors, reviewers or guest editors to slip poor-quality or fabricated work into journals (see ‘Finding fakes'). In work published earlier this year1, software engineer Diomidis Spinellis at the Athens University of Economics and Business uncovered 48 articles in one journal that he suspected were generated by artificial intelligence (AI). One of them listed him as an author without his knowledge. Others named researchers at prestigious universities as co-authors, but used wrong or non-institutional e-mail addresses, and some of those researchers had died years before the publications.

Source: Ref. 4

Even working institutional e-mail addresses are not a foolproof test for identity fraud. A preprint2 posted in August identified 94 fake profiles on OpenReview.net — a platform used to manage peer-review workflows. All but two had e-mails that were tied to well-known universities; the remaining e-mails came from institutions that had already closed.

The analysis — done by a team including researchers from OpenReview — found that imposters created e-mail aliases of genuine institutional e-mails. These aliases forwarded incoming messages into e-mail accounts that the imposters controlled.

It is unclear whether the number of cases of identity fakes in the scholarly publishing is growing. Elena Vicario, head of research integrity at Frontiers in Lausanne, Switzerland, says the situation is rare in Frontiers journals and typically involves impersonation of real individuals.

Richardson says that other forms of malpractice are probably of more concern. “My gut instinct is that people engaging in unethical or unscrupulous behaviour under their own name is a far bigger issue than people using somebody else's name to engage in unscrupulous behaviour,” he says.

Nonetheless, cases of fictitious and hijacked personas continue to surface, and some people worry that AI might worsen the problem. So pressure is mounting on publishers to tighten their checks.

One platform publishers are increasingly using is the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID), which was launched in 2012 as a free identification service that individuals can use to record their academic papers and other research activities. Some 10 million researchers use ORCID at least once a year, and major publishers require submitting authors to include their unique ORCID 16-digit identifier. Registered researchers carry their identifier for the entirety of their career, even if they change their job or institute.

ORCID does not, however, provide proof of identity. Anyone can sign up on the platform and there is currently no systematic mechanism to prevent or remove duplicate accounts.

But the platform does ask its almost 1,500 member organizations, which include publishers and funders, to contribute to its records by confirming affiliations, works, funding or peer review. These verified entries — referred to as trust markers — show up as green ticks on researchers' profiles.

“It is a community trust network,” says Tom Demeranville, the UK-based product director at ORCID, which is a non-profit organization in Bethesda, Maryland. “If everyone does this, we have a very helpful system for everyone.” About 5.7 million ORCID accounts contain at least one trust marker.

But some publishers request ORCID identifiers for only the lead authors on a submission3, which limits how effective the system can be.

ORCID might therefore work better when combined with other strategies. That was one conclusion of an expert task force on identity checks set up in late 2023 by the International Association of Scientific, Technical & Medical Publishers (STM), a trade organization in The Hague, the Netherlands.

The goal was “looking at other tactics to bolster research integrity” beyond screening the manuscript, says Hylke Koers, chief information officer at STM Solutions, STM's operations arm based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

The task force has published two reports on its findings4,5. The latest, posted in March, recommends a framework that combines indicators of risk and trust that publishers could apply to determine how much confidence to place on identity verifications5. Any approach must accommodate multiple solutions because otherwise it risks wrongly excluding individuals, says Koers, who helped to compile both reports. “We don't believe there is a single silver bullet here,” he says.

Alongside ORCID trust markers, the report suggests vetting institutional e-mail addresses and confirming affiliations through institutional sign-in systems. The framework also offers fall-back options such as making phone or video calls to the researcher or university, or requesting identity certificates or passports.

Tissue structure and molecular circuitry in the colon can be profoundly impacted by systemic age-related effects but many of the underlying molecular cues remain unclear. Here, we build a cellular and spatial atlas of the colon across three anatomical regions and 11 age groups, encompassing ~1,500 mouse gut tissues profiled by spatial transcriptomics and ~400,000 single nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles. We develop a computational framework, cSplotch, which learns a hierarchical Bayesian model of spatially resolved cellular expression associated with age, tissue region and sex by leveraging histological features to share information across tissue samples and data modalities. Using this model, we identify cellular and molecular gradients along the adult colonic tract and across the main crypt axis and multicellular programs associated with aging in the large intestine. Our multimodal framework for the investigation of cell and tissue organization can aid in the understanding of cellular roles in tissue-level pathology.

A typical colon extends >12 cm in mice and >1.5 m in humans1,2, with considerable variance in length, thickness and folding, impacted by multiple variables, including age, sex, weight and diet. The inner lumen of the large intestine is punctuated by millions of invaginations, each harboring a colonic crypt, the key anatomic unit responsible for its continuous regeneration and differentiation3. Underlying the mucosal epithelium, the submucosa hosts lymphoid clusters, nerve fibers and the lymphovasculature, while the outer muscular wall enables peristaltic motility. From the cecum to the rectum, the colon carries out spatially confined regional functions, which emerge postnatally and are required for the digestion of solid food4,5. During aging, the decline of colonic function is accompanied by dysbiosis and excessive epithelial permeability, allowing the gut microbiota to infiltrate the lumen6 and causing a generalized and protracted inflammatory state7, as well as the emergence of common pathologies, including constipation, diverticulitis, malnutrition and colorectal cancer (CRC)8.

Despite the crucial importance of colon function, the cellular and molecular features associated with functional diversity across colonic regions, the crypt axis and major lifespan stages have not yet been comprehensively characterized. In recent years, single-cell and single-nucleus profiling of the mouse and human intestines9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 has discovered and classified cell types and functions in the gut during development15,20, in adults16,17,19 and in aging18,21 but with limited spatial context. Spatial in situ profiling methods22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 are poised to address this gap, through either targeted or genome-wide profiling. However, robust computational frameworks for spatial analysis of large tissue cohorts are still lacking. Both the size and the heterogeneity of the organ pose notable analytical challenges, including how to infer molecular information at the single-cell level, how to integrate imaging and molecular data and how to perform biologically meaningful comparisons between functionally relevant tissue domains across space and time. For example, many spatial analysis methods reduce noise by smoothing gene expression data across neighboring spots or cellular neighborhoods at the risk of true signal loss34,35,36. Most methods for testing spatial differential expression (DE) through clustering37,38 or explicit modeling39,40 are applied only to single tissue sections and those that integrate data from multiple tissue sections41,42,43,44 are usually limited to the alignment of serial sections from the same tissue. Other methods, focused on deconvolution of multicellular spatially resolved measurements to the single-cell level (through Bayesian modeling45,46,47, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)48 or deep learning49), typically use little or no information about tissue anatomy or histology, which may yield biologically unrealistic results and limit their efficacy50,51. Furthermore, while a common coordinate system52 can facilitate integration, it is more challenging in large tissues such as the colon that lack a strict stereotypical architecture. Thus, to characterize the molecular and cellular variation underlying functional variation in the colon, both spatial profiling of large tissue cohorts and computational means to integrate these data across space and age are needed.

Here, we created a comprehensive experimental and computational framework to construct an integrated cell and tissue atlas of the mouse colon across temporal, anatomical and morphological variation, by combining spatial transcriptomics (ST)31,53 and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)17,54. We define the relative abundance of cell types using multimodal estimation, address missing data imputation and technical noise correction through information sharing across tissue sections and use explicit, hierarchical modeling of spatial and covariate-specific effects on cellular gene expression for Bayesian hypothesis testing across cell types, tissue regions, ages or other covariate groups informed by both snRNA-seq and ST data. Our work provides insights into tissue-level and cell-level function and organization and serves as an important reference for understanding the biology of aging.

To build a comprehensive atlas, we collected colonic specimens from proximal to distal anatomical regions through three major phases of the mammalian lifespan: juvenile (<4 weeks of age in the mouse), adulthood (6–12 weeks) and aging (6 months–2 years) and profiled them by ST53 and snRNA-seq54 (Fig. 1a). The spatial branch comprised ~1,500 sections (n = 65) and ~66,500 spatially barcoded spots, each quantifying the expression of 12,976 genes and sampling, on average, 24 tissue sections, 977 spots and 35,730 annotated cell segments from each mouse colon (Fig. 1b). These spanned 66 conditions across combinations of age (11 time points), sex (male and female), colonic region (proximal, middle and distal) and morphological regions of interest (MROIs; 14 histological annotation categories) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1). The cellular branch of the atlas encompassed a total of ~400,000 snRNA-seq profiles (n = 21), integrating newly generated and publicly available data, all collected in our lab (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c and Methods), which we partitioned and annotated into 17 major subsets of epithelial cells (intestinal stem cells (ISCs), transamplifying cells (TAs), cycling TAs, colonocytes, goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells and tuft cells), immune cells (B cells, T cells and macrophages), stromal cells (vascular cells, lymphatic cells, fibroblasts and trophocytes), enteric neurons, glia and smooth muscle cells (SMCs)17,21,55 (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1d,e, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods).

The t-SNE of 352,195 snRNA-seq profiles colored by cell type cluster (top) and their relative abundances (stacked bars; bottom). e, Analysis. Multitissue dataset (bottom left) served as input to cSplotch, which uses histological (MROI and semantic segmentation) and expression (ST and snRNA-seq priors) data to estimate the abundance of each snRNA-seq cell type in each spatial spot and then uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling (cSplotch model) to infer cell-type-specific gene expression conditioned on age, region, sex and MROI annotation (results).

To accurately detect spatial gene expression changes across multiple tissue samples, individuals and conditions in our atlas, we developed cSplotch56, a novel hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that uses both histological images and snRNA-seq to infer location-dependent and covariate-dependent cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from multicellular ST data (Fig. 1e). cSplotch consists of two major steps. First, it infers the cellular composition in each spatial spot from a multitissue dataset using a two-tier histological annotation schema, where MROIs, such as crypt apex and crypt base, are further labeled with cell-level morphological data, such as epithelial and muscle cells. These labels are then used for molecular integration with snRNA-seq profiles in a cell type deconvolution task. Second, cSplotch uses the deconvolved cell type compositions to infer MROI-specific and covariate-specific expression rates for each gene in each cell type. These expression rates can be used to test for DE across location (for example, crypt base versus apex), condition (for example, proximal versus distal colon or juvenile versus old mice), or cell type (for example, goblet versus T cell) in the entire atlas.

Specifically, to infer cell composition, we first annotated each spatial spot with a single (mutually exclusive) MROI label (Methods), segmented nuclei from the histology image and annotated each nuclear segment with one of five morphological cell superclass labels (Fig. 2a), using a conditioned semantic segmentation workflow with structural, anatomical and neighborhood features (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Methods). Across held-out test sets for young (≤4 weeks old) and adult/aged (≥6 weeks old) mice and all anatomical regions, we correctly assigned 85% of all nuclear areas compared to pathologist superclass annotations as the ground truth (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d and Methods). Next, for each spot, cSplotch uses NMF52,57 to infer a combination of snRNA-seq profiles whose aggregate marker gene expression profile fits the observed expression measurement but in a manner constrained by the morphological cell composition inferred from histology in the previous step (Methods and Supplementary Table 4). Without introducing any morphological cell composition constraints (\(\alpha =0\)), while gene expression profiles were well reconstructed (Extended Data Fig. 3a, blue line), the morphological cell type proportions were not, resulting in large numbers of deconvolved transcriptional cell types assigned to each spot (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c, blue lines). Once constrained by the inferred morphological cell type proportions (\(\alpha\) > 0; Extended Data Fig. 3c, orange, green and red lines), the cell composition reconstruction improved, without loss of expression reconstruction accuracy. cSplotch performed well in both decomposing the expression profiles and recovering cell compositions consistent with pathologist annotations and known features of the tissue. For example, cell composition estimates for 88 spots randomly selected from 31 tissues (8 weeks) spanning all colonic regions (11 proximal, 12 middle and 8 distal) and MROIs agreed well with ground-truth pathologist annotations and well-known patterns of tissue organization in terms of cell type proportions (Fig. 2a,b). These included high SMC content in the muscularis regions, high goblet cell content in epithelial layers and high B cell content in Peyer's patch (PP) (Fig. 2a).

Insets are the same as in g. Scale bar, 200 μm. m, Scaled IF intensities per unit area for each cell type presented in l evaluated in n = 3 tissue sections. Error bars, 95% CI; center, mean.

To infer gene expression rates, cSplotch next uses these inferred cell compositions, MROI annotations and sample covariates to fit a generalized linear model (GLM) of spatial gene expression across the atlas (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Methods). The model performs Bayesian inference to apportion the aggregate expression of each gene in each spot to the contributing cell type(s) in the spot (characteristic expression rate (\(\beta\)); hierarchically formulated to account for covariate-driven variation), along with the effects of neighboring spots (through spatial autocorrelation (\(\psi\))) and spot-specific random effects (\(\epsilon\)). The three hierarchical levels of the model—age, colon region and sex—are ordered by decreasing levels of hypothesized importance for gene expression variation. Additionally, to integrate the spatial samples in the context of a common coordinate framework, we used the 14 MROI categories that were manually assigned by the histology at each spatial spot (Methods).

We validated cSplotch's inferred expression rates in our colon aging atlas data. Firstly, for highly expressed genes (~10% of the genes in the study, detected in >45% of all spots; Fig. 2c, red; for example, Tff3, Ceacam1 and Acta2), the expression estimates of cSplotch were highly correlated to those obtained by transcripts per million (TPM) normalization and the spatial autocorrelation and spot-level variation components of cSplotch captured a substantial portion of the variance (Fig. 2d–f). Secondly, cSplotch recovered the correct spatial DE patterns in each MROI compared to immunofluorescence (IF) staining for four selected marker genes: the highly expressed Epcam and Tff3 (enriched in crypt apex), Acta2 (Sma; enriched in the muscularis interna (MI)), as well as Cd48, expressed in only 2.7% of spots (enriched in the PP) (Fig. 2g–i). Thirdly, the characteristic expression levels inferred for each cell type in a given MROI were most correlated with external snRNA-seq profiles from the expected cell type, for types present at both high (for example, vascular) and low (for example, goblet) frequencies (Fig. 2j). Fourthly, cSplotch correctly assigned genes with known cell-type-specific expression, such as Prdx6 (goblet cells58) and Pdgfra (fibroblasts59), in the cross-mucosa (CM) and the muscularis externa (ME) and MI (MEI) region, confirming the accuracy of cSplotch in describing gene expression in a complex tissue region comprised of multiple cell types of varying proportions (Fig. 2k–m). Fifthly, cSplotch's accurately deconvoluted simulated ST data, generated by constructing spots using mixtures of snRNA-Seq profiles (Supplementary Table 5 and Methods). cSplotch successfully reconstructed mean profiles for snRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 5a), morphological cell type clusters (Extended Data Fig. 5b and Methods) and DE patterns detected from snRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 5c and Methods; 94–100% agreement on DE genes), even when the cellular compositions used to deconvolve the simulated data were corrupted by Gaussian noise to reflect imperfect cell type annotations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Sixthly, cSplotch performed better than SpatialDE2 and Spark-X, two methods40,60 that analyze ST data at the level of individual tissue sections, on the task of identifying spatially variable genes. Specifically, SpatialDE2 and Spark-X spatial DE statistics for four MROI-specific genes (Tff3, Epcam, Acta2 and Cd48) vary greatly from section to section (Extended Data Fig. 6), with positive spatial DE determined only for a relatively low fraction of sections ranging from 1.3% (Cd48) to 15% (Tff3) in SpatialDE2 and 0.5% (Cd48) to 38% (Epcam) in Spark-X. These low detection rates may be because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and insufficient spatial sampling of individual tissue sections (particularly in PPs), limitations that cSplotch overcomes through hierarchical and multislice integration. Lastly, we estimated the impact of the number of individuals and tissues profiled on statistical power, by incrementally downsampling combinations of individuals (n = 1, …, 6 of 6) and tissue sections (n = 2, …, 8 of 52). Even when using one animal and two tissue sections, cSplotch captured meaningful expression signals, as reflected by the low Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence from the posterior distributions derived using full data for that animal's covariate group (age and region), and accuracy improved significantly with at least four mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Methods). Increasing the number of mice improved the estimation independent of expression level, whereas increasing the number of tissue sections per mouse improved the estimation of lowly expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 7b and Methods). In our full dataset, we sample at least five mice per time point and a minimum of nine tissue sections per mouse, exceeding these thresholds. We confirmed the lesser importance of sex relative to age and colon region on expression variation, finding that at most 140 genes (0.01%) show DE across sex in any age or MROI (Supplementary Table 6) and that gene expression exhibits similar levels of variation within each sex group across all genes and conditions (coefficient of variation (5th, 95th) percentiles: (0.056, 5.46) for male and (0.057, 5.47) for female). Notably, cSplotch is compatible with higher-resolution ST technologies (for example, Visium and Visium HD; Methods) and recapitulates key spatial results (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Methods).

To better describe the variation in tissue structure and function across the colonic tract, we first applied cSplotch to identify tissue-scale changes in cellular composition and spatial cellular gene expression along the proximal–distal axis in the adult (12 weeks) mouse colon. We analyzed 134 sections (43 proximal, 43 middle and 48 distal; 6,399 spots, ~55 nuclei per spot) across six age-matched and gender-balanced mice (three males and three females) (Fig. 3a). Relying on the classification in 14 MROIs, we estimated cell abundance and cell-type-specific expression of 17 distinct cell types.

Bolded genes, regional expression gradients.

A comparison of cell abundance in each MROI class across the proximal, middle and distal colon (Fig. 3b) showed widespread variation along the regions, especially in the transition from the proximal to the middle colon (Supplementary Table 7). Among the MROIs with the highest number of statistically significant differences in cell type abundance were the CM (significant regional differences in seven cell types) and the MEI (five cell types) (Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected Welch's t-test, P < 0.05; Fig. 3c,d). In the CM, goblet cell proportions increased and TA frequencies decreased from the proximal to the distal colonic segment, whereas ISC proportions increased distally. In the MEI, SMC abundance declined distally, whereas fibroblasts, lymphatic cells, macrophages and vascular cells grew in frequency. These observations shed light on the cellular transitions associated with the change in colonic function along its longitudinal axis, with most digestive and absorptive functions occurring in the proximal colon, which handles final steps through peristalsis and bacterial enzymes, breaking down and absorbing residual starch and lipids, compared to water reabsorption, fecal compaction and storage in the distal colon. We compared our results to a previous estimate of cell type proportions along the human intestine, albeit by an earlier study that was not powered to statistically test longitudinal variation across subregions of the large tract19. Nevertheless, in both studies, goblet cells in the mucosa rose distally, whereas, in the MEI, SMCs increased and endothelial cells decreased in humans but not in mice. Thus, if adequately powered, a comparison between humans and mice may reveal both similarities and differences, which appear to follow known patterns of evolutionary variance at the anatomical and histological scale. In particular, while the mucosa cytoarchitecture is largely conserved, the external muscular layers are divergent across the two species61.

At the level of cellular gene expression, cSplotch analysis showed that canonical cell-type-specific markers and processes are similarly expressed across the three colonic regions, according to the posterior distributions of cellular expression rates (Fig. 3f, bold, Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10 and Methods), with stronger cell-type-specific signals than snRNA-seq alone (Supplementary Fig. 11) (Tff3, Clca1 and Lypd8 for goblet cells62,63; Ascl2, Lgr5 and Ephb2 for ISCs64,65,66; Acta2, Cnn1 and Myh11 for SMCs67; Col1a1, Thy1 and Postn for fibroblasts68), although we acknowledge that this effect may be influenced by snRNA-seq dataset size and/or quality. Other genes had significant cell-type-specific regional differences (Bayes factor (BF) > 2) across the proximal–distal axis (Fig. 3f, nonbold, and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). For example, in the CM, goblet cells upregulated the antimicrobial genes Sprr2b and Sprr2a3 (ref. 69) proximally and the key gel-forming mucin Muc2 distally. Such goblet-cell-specific expression patterns are consistent with the role of the proximal colon in controlling microbial fermentation and the requirement for a thick mucus layer as a protective barrier distally70. Within the same MROI, ISCs expressed proximally higher levels of canonical Wnt inhibitors (for example, Sfrp1) and mediators of the noncanonical pathway (for example, Ror1 and Wnt4). As the strength of canonical Wnt signaling is tightly regulated locally and associated with ISC self-renewal71, the proximal colon may restrain this pathway and experience a slower cellular turnover. Conversely, the distal colon may require less restrained canonical Wnt signaling to replenish an expanded goblet population, which has the shortest lifespan across mucosal cell types72. Such observations are in line with embryological studies on gastrointestinal patterning demonstrating a key instructive role for an anterior-to-posterior Wnt signaling gradient73,74,75. In MEI, SMCs upregulated Hmcn2 proximally and Tnn1 distally. As Hmcn2 is associated with Hirschsprung's disease76 and Tnn1 helps enforce contractility77, their regional-specific expression can support autonomous peristalsis proximally and voluntary contraction distally. In MEI, genes encoding for repressors of vasculogenesis and lymphogenesis, such as Egfl7, Flt1 and Mdfic78,79, were upregulated by the fibroblasts proximally, indicating the loss of such mediators as potential mechanism for the expansion of the vascular system distally, where it is required for water reabsorption. Consistent with this, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Methods) of genes differentially expressed between the proximal and distal regions in the CM and MEI showed an enrichment for pathways associated with lipid and sugar metabolism proximally and for ionic exchange distally, while those associated with voluntary contractility, as opposed to autonomous peristalsis, were enriched at the terminal colon (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Comparison to the Human Protein Atlas58 revealed that 128 of the regionally regulated genes, such as Tff3, Clca1, Lypd8, Muc2, Ascl2, Ephb2, Myh11 and Cnn1, are among the 949 protein markers overrepresented in the human colon from a cohort of healthy individuals, suggesting a conservation of regional expression and likely function across species.

Collectively, we found that the variation in both cell abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression along the colon longitudinal axis correlates with distinct digestive functions along the colonic tract.

The intestinal crypt is responsible for the continuous regeneration of the highly specialized colonic mucosa3. As ISCs divide at the bottom of the crypt, they migrate toward the apex, differentiating into the main specialized lineages (goblet cells and colonocytes), as well as multiple rarer cell types, including enteroendocrine and chemosensory cells. A morphogen gradient modulates the balance between epithelial proliferation and differentiation but its composition at different biological scales is not fully characterized80. To date, targeted imaging approaches have characterized only a limited number of positionally restricted signaling mediators regulating crypt structure and function81.

Both cell morphologies and identities displayed distinct zonation patterns across four MROIs of the crypt axis (subcrypt, crypt base, crypt mid and crypt apex) (Fig. 3g,h). The proportions of ISCs, TAs and cycling TAs decrease gradually from the crypt base to apex, goblet cell proportions follow an opposite gradient, colonocyte abundance peaks sharply in the apex and enteroendocrine cells are evenly scattered across the crypt axis. SMCs are almost entirely confined to the subcrypt, whereas lymphatic cells, trophocytes and macrophages gradually decline in a base-to-apex direction. These cell-type-specific distributions are consistent with distinct positional dependencies. Colonocytes and SMCs are localized in close proximity to physical barrier domains (for example, the colonic lumen and the lamina propria), whereas the distribution of epithelial cells (ISCs, TAs and goblet cells), immune cells (macrophages) and some mesenchymal cells (trophocytes and lymphatic cells) is consistent with a reliance on overlapping signaling cues from the opposite crypt poles. Lastly, the homogeneous scattering of enteroendocrine cells may reflect the distribution of enteric nerve fibers.

At the molecular level, 321 genes had significant, monotonic variation across the crypt regardless of the colonic region (Fig. 3i, Supplementary Table 8 and Methods). Some of these genes were significantly associated (BF > 2, log2 fold change > 0.5; Methods) with specific cell types in a given spatial niche. For example, many of the genes upregulated in BASE were both expressed in ISCs and implicated in key biosynthetic pathways, including DNA replication and repair (Top1, Fance and Xrcc5), protein synthesis (Eef1a1, Rps9 and Rps24) and transcriptional (Set and Smyd2), translational (Mettl1) and posttranslational (Stk38) regulation (Supplementary Table 9). Elevated biosynthetic activity restricted to basally located progenitors has also been observed across the human intestine of healthy individuals19 and in CRC82. Genes upregulated at the crypt apex were associated with the establishment of an apical polarity domain at the plasma membrane of goblet cells, including cytoskeletal (Ezr), cell–cell adhesion (Ceacam1 and Cldn3) and transmembrane transport (Slc26a3 and Slc6a8) genes (Supplementary Table 9). Additionally, receptors (Fgfr2) and ligands (Reln) mediating the crosstalk between ISCs83,84,85 and the underlying stromal compartment (for example, lymphatic cells and trophocytes) were upregulated in the subcrypt and crypt base. Consistent with this, GSEA showed an enrichment of genes from pathways associated with ribosomes and protein synthesis in the subcrypt, whereas genes associated with tight junctions, nutrient absorption and energy metabolism genes were enriched in the crypt apex (Supplementary Fig. 12a, Supplementary Table 9 and Methods).

Another 118 genes had crypt-oriented gradient expression preferentially in one colonic region (23 proximal, 53 middle and 42 distal). These included genes related to key metabolic functions, including the detoxifying enzyme Ugt2b5, which is downregulated in experimental models of colitis86, the fatty-acid-binding and importer protein Fabp2 (ref. 87) and the gut hormone Ppy, known to regulate food intake88 (Fig. 3i). Consistent with this, genes differentially expressed specifically in the proximal, middle or distal crypt were enriched (by GSEA) for biosynthetic programs in the subcrypt. For IGF signaling, which is implicated in ISC biology89, DE genes were enriched in proximal crypts (Supplementary Fig. 12b–d). For programs related to vitamin C, DE genes were enriched in the proximal crypt apex. For vitamin A, DE genes were enriched in the middle colon crypt apex. Thus, each of the three colonic regions may rely on partially distinct molecular gradients associated with different digestive functions. Several such genes, especially those expressed in the highly specialized cells in the crypt apex, such as Ceacam1, Cldn3, Slc26a3 and Fabp2, also display higher expression in the human colonic lumen19,58. A small subset of genes presented sex-biased expression across the crypt, including Guca2a, encoding the intestinal hormone guanylin90, and Apoa1 and Cyp3a44, involved in cholesterol and steroid metabolism91,92, respectively (Supplementary Table 6).

In summary, our analysis revealed cell-type-specific distributions, likely reflecting distinct positional dependencies, and identified a subset of pan-colon or region-specific gradient genes to prioritize mechanistic experiments on the crypt's structure and function.

In the elderly human population, the large intestine is affected by common pathological conditions including constipation93, diverticulitis94 and malnutrition95, a markedly increased risk of CRC96 and other features of intestinal senescence8,18,97,98,99,100,101,102,103. Yet, aging is a loosely defined condition, which is asynchronously experienced across populations with vastly variable phenotypic impact. Previous studies carried out on small cohorts with few time points, using destructive methodologies, have led to potentially conflicting findings. For example, both loss and gain of secretory cells have been reported to occur in the aging mouse intestine18,102,104.

To characterize intestinal cells during mouse aging, we tracked changes in the proportion of the most abundant cell types (ISCs, TAs, goblet cells and colonocytes) in the four crypt MROIs in each of the colonic regions over time (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 10). During the juvenile (up to 4 weeks) and adult (4 to 12 weeks) phases, there was limited variation in the ISC fraction over time in the subcrypt, crypt base and crypt mid, consistent with the highly regenerative nature of the colon, both during development and at steady state. In the same compartments, TAs displayed a transient increase during the first 4 weeks after birth, followed by a decline between 6 and 12 weeks, as they increasingly transitioned toward the secretory lineage. Throughout juvenile and adult life, goblet cells steadily increased across all MROIs, reaching their peak proportion between 8 and 12 weeks. Although the structure and function of colonocytes is impacted by weaning from lactation to solid food starting 3 weeks after birth105,106,107, their relative proportion progressively decreased in the crypt apex up to 12 weeks, concomitantly with the increase in goblet cell fraction.

Importantly, there were multiple significant changes in cell composition of the same region between full reproductive maturity (12 weeks) and end of life (2 years) across the crypt axis in the distal and middle colon, as well as, to a lesser extent, in the proximal region (Supplementary Fig. 13, shaded areas, Supplementary Table 10 and Methods). Goblet cell frequency declined from young adult (12 weeks) to aged (2 years) animals in all MROIs of the crypt axis in the mid colon, in the subcrypt, crypt base and crypt mid regions in the distal colon and in the crypt base of the proximal colon. Conversely, the frequency of progenitor cells (ISCs and TAs) increased in old mice (2 years) in both the middle and the distal colon, with TAs increasing with age across the entire crypt axis in the middle colon and ISCs increasing with age in the subcrypt, crypt base and crypt mid MROIs in the distal colon. In the crypt apex of these segments (middle and distal), there was also a marked increase in colonocytes during that period. Hence, cell frequencies are substantially remodeled as animals age, with colonocytes progressively displacing a dwindling goblet population in the crypt apex. This may be especially impactful in the middle and distal mucosa, which rely more heavily on secretory cells at steady state. Goblet cells decline despite the concurrent increase in the proportion of ISCs and TAs in the subcrypt, crypt base and crypt mid. These temporal dynamics suggest an imbalance between progenitor proliferation and secretory differentiation, providing a cellular basis for the defective regenerative function observed in the elderly.

To further identify expression changes potentially associated with distinct biological properties across covariate groups, we identified the genes with significant expression differences in the interval of 12 weeks to 2 years for every abundant cell type within each of the four crypt MROI (Supplementary Table 11) and tested the union of all DEGs (across all cell types) within each MROI for functional enrichments by GSEA. Enriched categories only included very broad terms, such as protein kinase signaling, regulation of transcription and vesicular transport, yielding limited insights into specific aging mechanisms (Supplementary Table 11). Because such gene-pooling approaches discard potentially useful information on the cellular source of expression and on cell–cell associations, we next characterized MCPs of genes with coordinated change in expression across multiple mucosal cell types with age. To that end, we applied DIALOGUE108, which uses multiple canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) to infer MCPs of genes with correlated expression patterns across multiple distinct cell types (Fig. 4a,b and Methods). Each MCP consists of subsets of genes whose mean expression in one cell type is positively or negatively correlated with that of genes in one or more other cell types across time (Supplementary Table 12). Several of the MCPs with the highest degree of correlation between member genes had near-monotonic changes during the aging window (for example, between 6 months and 2 years of age) in at least one colonic region (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary Tables 12 and 13 and Methods).

a,b, Analysis approach. cSplotch was used to characterize variability in cell-type-specific gene expression across age and region (a), followed by MCP analysis with DIALOGUE108 (b) on inferred profiles for abundant cell types (for example, cell types A and B) in each MROI across ages and regions. MCPs are returned as sets of genes with high correlation between two or more cell types across conditions with positively (+, up) and negatively (−, down) contributing genes from each cell type (Methods). c,d, Aging-associated MCPs. c, Activity score (y axis) of selected MCPs from different MROIs (top left) for each time point (x axis) and region (top). Gray area: aging window. d, Scaled (dot size) and absolute (dot color) change in log expression \((\bar{\beta })\) relative to 12 weeks of each gene (rows) for each time point (columns) for selected upregulated (+) and downregulated (−) genes from the MCPs in c, sorted by their associated cell type (right).

Subcrypt MCP2, whose activity markedly declines at 1 year of age in the proximal and middle colon (Fig. 4d), may help explain some of the substantial changes in cell composition with age in the subcrypt region, where goblet cells decline and progenitors increase at 2 years of age (Supplementary Fig. 13). Specifically, subcrypt MCP2 consists of genes from nine cell types: epithelial (ISCs, TAs, cycling TAs and goblets), macrophages, trophocytes, lymphatic cells, vascular cells and SMCs. These include age-increasing proinflammatory genes in macrophages (Sox4)109 and signaling mediators in goblet cells (Fgfr2, Tcf7l2 and Hif1a)89,110,111 and trophocytes (Grem1)112, many of which are involved in epithelial dedifferentiation89,110,113, inflammation111 and malignant transformation112,114,115, especially those associated with colitis114,115 (Supplementary Table 13). Age-declining genes included intestinal mechanotransduction (Itgb1, Flna and Actn4)116,117,118, cell death regulation (Gas6 and Pawr)119,120 and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs; Itgb1, Flna, Gas6 and Pawr)116,119,121,122 expressed in ISCs and TAs (Fig. 4d). As the adult distal subcrypt had enhanced Wnt signaling (Fig. 3f), the loss of expression of such TSGs could explain a shift in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, leading to an expanded stem cell compartment and defective lineage priming. In contrast, the adult proximal subcrypt was enriched for canonical Wnt inhibitors. Here, TSG loss of expression alone may be insufficient to drive a wider progenitor compartment in the absence of a permissive microenvironment. Instead, we observed an upregulation of regenerative signaling mediators (Fgfr2, Tcf7l2 and Hif1a), which may eventually promote dedifferentiation of the secretory lineage into progenitor cells. In line with such a hypothesis, the middle colon displayed an intermediate scenario, where the rewiring of goblet signaling was associated with an expansion of the TA fraction.

The activity of the crypt base MCP1 program, which consists of gene expression in ISCs, TAs and goblet cells, increases in the proximal and middle colon following 1 year of age. At 2 years of age, this MROI displayed loss of goblet cells throughout the colon and a gain in progenitors in the middle and distal colon. The crypt base MCP1 genes increasing with age included the key fetal stem cell marker Anxa1 (ref. 123), upregulated in ISCs and associated with damage-induced regeneration124, Rnf44 (ref. 125) and Gbp7 (ref. 126), known to be induced by inflammation and expressed in ISCs and goblets, and the protumorigenic extracellular matrix protein Col3a1 (refs. 127,128) found in TAs (Fig. 4d). Age-declining genes include metabolic regulators of glycosylated surface proteins and lipids, such as Slc35a1 (ref. 129) and Gale130, which are important for immune recognition and pathogen infection, expressed in TAs and goblets, and Tpm3, a gene recurrently lost in CRC131, expressed in ISCs. The activation of damage-induced regeneration genes (Anxa1, Rnf44 and Gbp7) suggests that injury-related responses are enhanced with aging predisposing the colon to transformation.

The crypt mid MCP1 program, with genes expressed in ISCs, TAs, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells and tuft cells, had a different aging-related activity in the proximal and middle versus distal colon. At 2 years, goblet cells are lost and progenitors increase in the middle and distal crypt mid MROI, whereas no significant cell composition changes are observed in the proximal region. Crypt mid MCP1 genes with neuroendocrine and metabolic functions (Insl5 (ref. 132), Slc18a1 (refs. 133,134) and Rcan2 (refs. 135,136)) declined with aging in the proximal and middle colon but increased in the distal colon. This suggested aging-related anteriorization of the longitudinal colonic patterning, an event also associated with the emergence of malignant states137,138. Such reprogramming genes were further coupled with the change in expression of genes involved in mucosal inflammation (Cd74 and Dync2h1)139,140, stress response (Mapk14 and Letm1)141,142 and CRC initiation (Wasl)143. The crypt mid MCP1 was also markedly enhanced in the middle and distal colon between 3 weeks and 4 weeks, at the time when juvenile mice undergo a drastic nutritional shift because of weaning, indicating that aging may aberrantly reactivate a stress state reminiscent of this important developmental transition.

Lastly, the activity of the crypt apex MCP1 program, which includes genes expressed in TAs, colonocytes and goblet cells, declined in the proximal and middle colon (Fig. 4c). MCP genes upregulated with age included inflammation genes related to pyroptosis (Gsdmd)144, proteolysis (Ctsl)145, membrane integrity (Sgpp2)146, cell polarity (Erbin)147 and the DNA damage response (Ifit1)148. Crypt apex MCP1 genes downregulated with aging included cytoskeleton regulators (Coro1b, Iqgap1 and Tpm3)131,149,150 expressed in TAs, colonocytes and goblet cells, Lmna, a gene encoding the nuclear lamin A/C (whose loss is linked to genomic instability, whereas mutant isoforms are found in congenital premature aging syndromes151,152,153) and the cell-cycle repressor Cdkn1a (p21)154 (Fig. 4d). Thus, the aging colonic crypt apex is in a diffuse inflammatory state, associated with the expression of canonical aging markers and the downregulation of cell-cycle regulators, indicating the acquisition of a senescent state in the apical colonocytes coupled with the loss of tumor suppressor mechanisms.

Characterizing spatial patterning in large organs requires us to harmonize and relate molecular and morphological profiles measured by single-cell and spatial RNA-seq methods. Despite substantial progress to address spatial variance in expression and histological features, existing analysis methodologies are still mostly applied to a single tissue section at a time. As a result, they may fail to identify generalizable tissue function or identify how key features vary along anatomical, functional or temporal axes. Here, we developed a comprehensive experimental and computational framework and used it to present the first systematic atlas of colon aging.

Our analysis revealed changes in cell composition and cell-type-specific gene expression across multiple interleaving scales: gross anatomical scale (the longitudinal proximal–distal axis), fine histological scale (the crypt base to apex axis) and temporal scale (ages from newborn to old). Along the proximal–distal axis, these variations correlate with distinct digestive functions along the colonic tract. Along the crypt axis, we revealed cell-type-specific positional patterns and genes with either pan-colonic or region-specific spatially restricted expression across the main crypt axis. The positionally oriented balance between progenitor self-renewal and lineage differentiation was associated with a base to apex gradient between biosynthetic and cytoarchitectural regulators, prioritizing pathways and genes for functional validation. Along the temporal axis, aging was associated with a pervasive loss of goblet cells and the establishment of a diffuse inflammatory state, spanning expression programs in multiple cells and across the colon, and revealed the specific impact of such a scenario at different levels of the crypt axis and in distinct regions of the colonic tract. In the upper parts of the crypts, the progressive displacement of goblet cells by apical colonocytes or the anteriorization of the colonic metabolic patterning can provide molecular insights toward a mechanistic understanding of common geriatric conditions, such as constipation and malnutrition, paving the way for interventions aimed to support the quality of life and preventing systemic consequences. At the bottom of the crypt, increasing levels of damage coupled with persistent inflammation are associated with loss of TSG expression, excessive expansion of the progenitor compartment and cellular dedifferentiation toward fetal-like states. Such temporal dynamics are consistent with the elevated incidence of CRC premalignant states in the elderly and illuminate specific cell types and genes for guiding preventive and diagnostic strategies.

Using the canonical system of the mouse colon, we demonstrated how contextual spatial and temporal information can help decipher large-scale molecular datasets and how statistical models such as cSplotch can be used to connect tissue architecture with the pathological alterations leading to aging and disease. In this study, histology annotations were performed manually; however, this could be circumvented in the future with novel image classification approaches155. In the future, we plan to include additional modalities in our atlas, including protein expression to dissect immune cellular states and genome sequencing to measure mutational events and signatures, and increase temporal sampling frequency to further probe changing regenerative dynamics in elderly mice. We believe that this model framework has use in a wide range of tissue systems and hope that it may help to bridge the gap between single-cell and ST studies.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images were processed with SpoTteR (version 0.0.1)156. Briefly, original H&E images were scaled to approximately 500 × 500 pixels. Then, the tissue section was masked generously from the image through 10% quantile thresholding in a user-defined color channel. To detect probable spot centers, the image Hessian was computed. The spot centers then acted as potential grid points that were likely part of a regular grid structure and were selected by calculating the x and y distances between all detected centers. A regular grid was then fitted to these potential grid points using a custom optimizer based on the ‘nlminb' function of the R package stats, which minimizes the distance of potential grid points to the suggested regular grid while assuming angles of 90° and 42 starting grid points per row and column. Through an iterative process, in which the 0.1% potential grid points that least fit the grid were removed in each iteration, the number of grid points per row and column was updated and a new grid was fitted until the target number of grid points per row (here, 35) and column (here, 33) was reached. Finally, those grid points that overlapped the tissue sections were identified by building a mask that represented the tissue area and registering all grid points that were present in this mask. In case a sectioning artifact was present, the corresponding ST spot was removed from all subsequent analyses.

To assign each ST spot with a single (mutually exclusive) corresponding histological tag, a cloud-based interface33 was used to assign each spot (x, y) with one or more regional tags. A total of 14 tags (MROIs) based on established major gross morphology were used: crypt apex, subcrypt, crypt mid, crypt base, CM, epithelium and muscularis mucosae (EMM), EMM and submucosa (EMMSUB), epithelium and muscle and submucosa, ME, MEI, MI, muscularis mucosae and interna, muscle and submucosa, and PP.

In most cases, more than one tissue section was placed on the active area of one ST array. To distinguish between different tissue sections, a two-dimensional integer lattice was assumed so that labeled ST spots that were connected were assigned the same tissue section. Next, ST spots were filtered on the basis of their sequencing data quality, such that tissue sections labeled with fewer than five (ages 0 days–3 weeks) or ten (ages 4 weeks–2 years) spots in total were discarded from further analysis. ST spots with fewer than 800 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were also discarded from further analysis. To account for spots without four neighbors, each spot was mapped after filtering to match the same two-dimensional integer lattice [[0,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,1,0]] and spots not matching this patterns were also discarded.

To train a cell density classifier to segment individual objects in the histology images, each whole-slide image (WSI) was first subset into smaller patches while retaining patches at the same resolution for training, selected such that each patch would contain all the major colon layers from at least one tissue cross section from the original WSI. Overall, ~200 patches were selected for training, with at least ten replicate patches from each of the different ages. To count the number of cell segments present in each ST spot, a density classifier was first trained using ilastik (version 1.4.1)157. This workflow estimated the density of blob-like structures usually present as overlapping instances, decreasing the chance of underestimating the number of objects because of undersegmentation, which we reasoned was the most appropriate approach for counting cell-dense areas in the colon. To ensure reproducibility across all density conditions in the dataset, in each training patch, at least three separate tissue areas (that is, training squares) were used. In each training square, two classes of objects were labeled: cells and background.

Each WSI processed with the SpoTteR ST processing tool156 was split into image patches of 200 × 220 pixels representing the size of an ST spot capture area. The cell-counting workflow described above was then used to extract density predictions for each ST spot. The following image processing and segmentation steps were performed with skimage158 (version 0.18.1). First, an ellipse shape (radius = 100 pixels) was used to mask the true ST capture area in each patch. If no cells were left in the patch (mean image intensity < 0.05), the patch was discarded from further processing. Next, the multi-Otsu159 thresholding algorithm (cutoff > 50) was used to separate objects detected in the patch. Local maxima were found for each object and used to estimate distances between the same. These were then approximated by the watershed algorithm160 into segments that were further labeled into individual objects used in all downstream analyses.

MROI-specific object classifiers were trained using ilastik (version 1.4.1)157, with binary segmentation images and their corresponding H&E patches as input. In this way, each segment in the H&E patch was assigned a cell type superclass label. In each classifier, depending on the cells present in the corresponding MROI, up to five superclasses were labeled: colonocyte, immune, interstitial, muscle and epithelial. MROI-specific classifiers (colonocyte, PP, muscle, noncolonocyte and epithelium) with corresponding cell type superclass labels (colonocyte, immune, interstitial, muscle and epithelial), MROI labels and snRNA-seq cell type labels are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Because of differences in cell and tissue morphology, separate superclass classifiers were created for juvenile (0–4 weeks) and adult/aged (6 weeks–2 years) groups, for a total of ten image-based classifiers representing five MROI-specific classifiers across two age groups. To train each classifier, ~150 patches were randomly selected from all three regions of the colon (proximal, middle and distal) and from each of the following MROIs: CM, EMMSUB, subcrypt, crypt mid, crypt apex, MEI and PP. The object classifiers took into consideration object-level characteristics, such as object shape and work, to predict similar objects in the nearby space. Algorithm features used in training included two-dimensional convex hull and skeleton descriptors in a neighborhood size of 30 × 30 pixels for each object and used a simple threshold (0.5) with a small smoothing factor (1.0). Properties attributed to standard object features such as shape, size, channel intensity and location were also selected in the training process. In total, 1,540 patches and 83,721 segments were labeled during training.

Each H&E image patch (200 × 220 pixels) and corresponding segmentation predictions were used in ilastik batch processing to predict cell type superclasses using the object classifier described above. Cell label predictions were used in the following image processing workflow implemented using skimage (version 0.18.1)158. Each pixel class in the image was assigned one of the cell type superclasses. Then, small objects (<50 pixels) were removed from each patch and the remaining small segments abutting each other were merged if belonging to the same cell type class. The fractions of foreground pixels belonging to each object class were used as estimates of the abundance of each cell type in each patch.

To evaluate the performance of the cell superclass classifiers, a test set of 781 patches (50% size of training set) spanning the five adult/aged (colonocyte, immune, interstitial, muscle and epithelial) and five juvenile (colonocyte, immune, interstitial, muscle and epithelial) cell superclasses was set aside. Foreground objects were detected using the binary segmentation workflow, after which all objects were manually assigned to one of the five superclasses (colonocyte, immune, interstitial, muscle and epithelial). The same images were then input into the respective MROI-specific object classifiers and performance was evaluated by calculating the confusion (fraction of pixels labeled class A but predicted class B) for all pairs of cell types.

The SPOTlight model was used for ‘bottom-up' deconvolution of ST data48, which takes as input two matrices of count data: \(V\), a (genes × cells) matrix containing the snRNA-seq count data (in which each cell is assigned to one of \({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\) types), and \(V{\prime}\), a (genes × spots) matrix containing the ST count data. Expression matrices were preprocessed in the following manner: (1) genes were subset to the set shared across both modalities; (2) data were depth-normalized to 10,000 UMI counts per cell or spot; and (3) data were scaled gene-wise to unit variance. Next, genes were further subset to cellular marker genes (log2(fold change) > 1, Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05; likelihood ratio test) and balanced across the \({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\) cell types, selecting the top \(m=23\) genes by FDR for each cell type, where \(m\) was chosen as the minimum number of significant marker genes across all cell types (23 for T cells). This resulted in a total of 334 unique genes used in deconvolution (Supplementary Table 4).

\(V\) was factored into component matrices \(W\) (genes × topics) and \(H\) (topics, cells) by NMF:

where the number of topics is assumed to be equal to the number of snRNA-seq cell types \({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\). Before NMF, all values of \({W}_{g,t}\) were initialized to the probability of gene \(g\) being a marker gene for cell type \(t\) (quantified as Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected \({P}_{\mathrm{adj}}\) of t-test on log(count) data) and \(H\) was initialized as a binary matrix denoting the class assignment for each cell in the dataset. These initialization conditions—in which topics were treated equivalently to cell types—are meant to bias the optimization toward the discovery of biologically meaningful topic profiles.

Next, topic profiles \(W\) were fixed, and the following equation was minimized over \(H{\prime}\) (topics, spots) by non-negative least squares (NNLS):

In this manner, the expression profile of each spot in the ST data was mapped to a combination of topics inferred from snRNA-seq.

Third, \(Q\), a (topics, \({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\)) matrix from \(H\) was derived by selecting all cells from the same cell type and computing the median of each topic for a consensus cell-type-specific topic signature. This topic matrix was used in a final NNLS minimization to find \(P\), the (\({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\), spots) matrix denoting the inferred cellular composition of each ST spot:

A modification to Eq. 3 was implemented that allows the incorporation of morphology-informed composition information derived from the image segmentation workflow, by providing two additional inputs: \(L\), a (\({k}_{\mathrm{morph}}\), spots) matrix containing the composition of each ST spot in terms of the \({k}_{\mathrm{morph}}\) morphological cell types defined in the segmentation model, and \(S\), a (\({k}_{\mathrm{morph}}\), \({k}_{\mathrm{sn}}\)) binary matrix mapping each expression cell type to a morphological cell type. Any proposed compositional matrix \(P\) should additionally satisfy the following to reconstruct morphology-informed compositional data:

Morphology-aware SPOTlight decomposition was then achieved by solving the following optimization problem:

where \(\alpha\) controls the relative importance of the morphological composition loss (second term) and the expression loss (first term). This optimization problem was solved using the PyTorch implementation of the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 run for 100,000 iterations from a random initialization.

Genes i, tissue sections j and spots k were indexed as follows: \(i\in [1,\cdots ,{N}_{\text{genes}}],j\in [1,\cdots ,{N}_{\text{tissues}}],k\in [1,\cdots ,{{N}^{(j)}}_{\text{spots}}]\). Each tissue \(j\) was registered to a common coordinate system, such that each spot k was assigned to one of \({N}_{\mathrm{MROI}}\) distinct MROIs, denoted \({D}_{k}^{(j)}\in [1,\ldots ,{N}_{\text{MROI}}]\), as described above. In the compositional mode, each spot was additionally assigned a simplex vector \({E}_{k}^{\,(j)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{\ge 0}^{{N}_{\mathrm{cell}\,\mathrm{types}}}\), \({\sum }_{x}{E}_{k,x}^{\,(j)}=1\forall j,k\), which describes its proportional composition in terms of all \({N}_{{\text{cell}}\,{\text{types}}}\) unique cell types across the dataset.

For each gene and each spot, the observed counts \({y}_{i,\,j,k}\) were considered to be realizations of random variable with an expected value equal to \({s}_{j,k}{\lambda }_{i,\,j,k}\), where \({s}_{j,k}\) is a size factor (total number of UMIs observed at spot \(k\)) and \({\lambda }_{i,\,j,k}\) is the rate of expression of gene i (events per exposure), such that gene expression is modeled independently of sequencing depth. In practice, \({s}_{j,k}\) was further normalized by the median depth across all spots in the dataset to facilitate comparisons of results across analyses. Thus, cSplotch offers the user two choices for modeling count data: the Poisson distribution or the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Either may be supplemented with zero inflation to account for dropout events (technical zeros), yielding the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero-inflated NB (ZINB) distributions:

where \({s}_{j,k}{\lambda }_{i,\,j,k}\) represents the expected mean of all distributions, \({\phi }_{i}\) represents the gene-specific overdispersion parameter for the NB family and \({\theta }_{i}^{\,p}\) represents the gene-specific probability of technical zeros or dropout. The zero-inflated model accounts for an overabundance of zeros by introducing a second zero-generating process gated by a Bernoulli random variable:

where the Poisson process can be replaced by NB without loss of generality. This mixture model allows for ‘true' biological zeros to be generated by the Poisson or NB process describing the expression model while ‘shunting' technical zeros into a separate, technical process, preventing abundant dropout events from lowering the estimated mean expression \({\lambda }_{i,\,j,k}\). Because the Poisson process does not allow for overdispersion (variance exceeding the mean), ZIP should be preferred to Poisson in most situations, whereas the use of NB or ZINB may depend on data quality.

While cSplotch considered a separate random variable to describe gene expression in each spot, the rate parameters \({\lambda }_{i,\,j,k}\) were described in terms of a GLM that separates variation into shared and individual components. Specifically, the rate of gene expression was informed by three components:

where \({B}_{i,\,j,k}\) describes the characteristic expression of gene i within the tissue context of spot \(k\), \({\psi }_{i,\,j,k}\) describes the neighborhood effects and \({\epsilon }_{i,j,k}\) describes spot-specific effects. \({B}_{i,j,k}\) is calculated as a weighted sum of cellular expression rates \({\beta }_{i}\) in proportions \({{E}_{k}}^{(j)}\). Cellular expression was allowed to vary both across MROIs and sample conditions. As such, a characteristic expression matrix \({\beta }_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{N}_{\text{MROI}}\times {N}_{{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}}\) was defined (when compositional data are unavailable, each MROI may be treated as composed of a single ‘average' cell type and \({\beta }_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{N}_{\text{MROI}}}\) is defined instead). Inferring a posterior over \({\beta }_{i}\) allowed the quantification of expression changes across regions or cell types by comparing relevant entries.

Because characteristic expression is expected to vary across conditions (for example, age, colon region and sex), region-specific expression \({\beta }_{i}\) was modeled in a hierarchical fashion defined by sample covariates. Up to three levels were explicitly modeled in the hierarchy, each of which split the sample to distinct groups along some covariate. At the top level, the dataset was split along an important covariate (for example, age) and a separate \({{\beta }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}\) was modeled for each unique set \({l}_{1}\in \{1,\cdots {L}_{1}\}\). At the next level, each set was further partitioned along another covariate (for example, colon region). \({{\beta }_{i}}^{({l}_{1},{l}_{2})}\) was assumed to be centered around its corresponding top-level estimate \({{\beta }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}\), with some additional variance associated with the new covariate \({\sigma }_{i}^{({l}_{2})}\). This encoded knowledge about the experimental system and separated out sources of variation associated with each covariate (without propagation of uncertainty, as all levels are inferred simultaneously). A three-level hierarchical model for \({\beta }_{i}\) was, thus, specified as:

where, in the compositional mode, prior hyperparameters \({{\mu }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}(\cdot ,m)\) and \({{\sigma }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}(\cdot ,m)\) are set to the empirical mean and s.d., respectively, over the expression of gene i in cell type m in the snRNA-seq data for all MROIs; in the noncompositional mode (one ‘average' cell type per MROI), \({{\mu }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}(\cdot )\) and \({{\sigma }_{i}}^{({l}_{1})}(\cdot )\) are set to 0 and 2, respectively, for all MROIs. Variation parameters \({\sigma }_{i}^{\left({l}_{2}\right)},{\sigma }_{i}^{\left({l}_{3}\right)}\) are assumed to have truncated Gaussian priors reflecting our limited knowledge of the effects of covariate-driven variation and are inferred separately for each level 2 and 3 covariate group. For convenience, because each tissue \(j\) belongs to one covariate group at each level, the inverse mapping function \({\rho }^{-1}(j)\) was introduced to map \(j\) to the appropriate \({l}_{1},{l}_{2},{l}_{3}\) indices for \({\beta }_{i}\). \({B}_{i,\,j,k}\) was formally defined in the noncompositional model:

where \({x}_{j,k}^{T}\) is a one-hot encoding of \({{D}_{k}}^{(j)}\), the MROI annotation for spot k. With this framework for integrating multiple sections or experiments, the posterior distributions of the latent parameters \({\beta }_{i}\) were studied at different levels of the hierarchical experimental design and expression changes were quantified across conditions, tissue contexts or individual cell types.

The second component of Eq. 8, \({\psi }_{i,j,k}\), describes the effects of the local neighborhood of spot k on the expression of gene i. This was modeled using the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior, which assumes that the value at a given location (spot) is conditional on the values of neighboring locations (spots). \({\psi }_{i,j}\) was defined as a Markov random field over the spots on each array:

where \({a}_{i}\) is a spatial autocorrelation parameter, \({\tau }_{i}\) is a conditional precision parameter, \({{\bf{K}}}_{j}\) is a diagonal matrix containing the number of neighbors for each spot in tissue \(j\) and \({{\bf{W}}}_{j}\) is the adjacency matrix (with zero diagonal). If the classic ST methodology of using cartesian arrays is applied, each spot is assumed to have a four-spot neighborhood; if the Visium platform using hexagonal arrays is applied, each spot is assumed to have a six-spot neighborhood. The level of spatial autocorrelation (\({a}_{i}\)) and conditional precision (\({\tau }_{i}\)) was inferred separately for each gene, although weak hyperpriors on both parameters are shared across all genes to enforce the same physiological constraints (Eq. 11). Taken together, the \(B\) and \(\psi\) terms capture spatial autocorrelation on two different scales: tissue context (across samples) and local neighborhood (within samples).

The final component of Eq. 8, \({\epsilon }_{i,\,j,k}\), captures variation at the level of individual spots. This variation was assumed to be independent and identically distributed for each gene:

where \({\sigma }_{i}\) is the inferred level of variability for gene i. The degree of variance in the truncated Gaussian prior on \({\sigma }_{i}\) is set to 0.3 following the work of Maniatis et al.161, who chose the value to reflect the relatively low levels of spot-specific variation (relative to other model terms).

To quantify difference in expression between two conditions using cSplotch, the BF between posterior distributions over characteristic expression coefficients \(\beta\) estimated by the model was examined. Without loss of generality, the difference in expression was quantified between conditions represented by \({\beta }^{(1)}\) and \({\beta }^{(2)}\), which may differ across any combination of genes, sample covariates (for example, distal versus proximal colon), tissue regions (for example, crypt apex versus muscle) or cell types (for example, neuron versus myocyte). A random variable \({\Delta }_{\beta }={\beta }^{(1)}-{\beta }^{(2)}\) was defined, which captures the difference between \({\beta }^{(1)}\) and \({\beta }^{(2)}\). If \({\Delta }_{\beta }\) is tightly centered around zero, then the two distributions are very similar to each other and the null hypothesis of identical expression cannot be rejected. To quantify this similarity, the posterior distribution \({\Delta }_{\beta }|{\mathcal{D}}\) (where \({\mathcal{D}}\) represents the data used to train the model) was compared to the prior distribution \({\Delta }_{\beta }\) using the Savage–Dickey density ratio that estimates the BF between the conditions:

where the probability density functions were evaluated at zero. If expression is different between the two conditions, then the posterior \({\Delta }_{\beta }|{\mathcal{D}}\) will have very little mass at 0 and the estimated BF will be large (by convention, \(\text{BF} > 5\) indicates substantial support). Conversely, for similar expression regimes, the posterior will place a mass equal to or greater than that of the prior at zero and the BF will be \(\le 1\). While \(p({\Delta }_{\beta })\) can be derived analytically (the prior distributions over all \(\beta\) are normally distributed and the difference between two normally distributed random variables is in turn normally distributed), \(p({\Delta }_{\beta }|{\mathcal{D}}{\mathscr{)}}\) must be approximated using the posterior samples obtained below. When we executed a comparison between sets of conditions (for example, neurons versus all other cells), we pooled the posterior samples from all component conditions together.

cSplotch was implemented in Stan162. For all analyses, Bayesian inference was performed over the parameters using Stan's adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler with default parameters. Four independent chains were sampled, each with 250 warmup iterations and 250 sampling iterations, and convergence was monitored using the \(\hat{R}\) statistic. On average, sampling of a given gene was completed in ~3 h parallelized over four CPUs (<2 GB of total RAM used) and the sampling time for each chain was linear in both the number of spots in the dataset and the number of samples drawn, while multiple genes can be run in parallel. For high-resolution technologies (for example, Visium HD), the number of spots per tissue is dramatically increased and users may consider using variational inference to initialize HMC sampling (provided as ‘splotch-vinit' executable) to reduce sampling time and/or suppressing the CAR model component (accounting for ~60% of computational time) with the ‘--no-car' option.

Simulated ST data were generated from the snRNA-seq profiles in the two regimes described in the subsequent sections. For all simulation studies, 12 ST arrays were generated, each containing 2,000 spots. For data in which distinct MROIs were simulated, the two regions were considered to exist in a 1:1 ratio. Cell clusters comprising each region are detailed in Supplementary Table 5.

Average expression profiles for unique mouse colon cell types obtained from snRNA-seq \(G\in {{\mathbb{Z}}}_{\ge 0}^{{N}_{\text{genes}}\times {N}_{{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}}\) (\({N}_{\text{genes}}=22,986,{N}_{\text{cell}\,\text{types}}=30\)) were normalized column-wise, such that the total expression within each cluster summed to 1. For each spot \(k\) from tissue \(j\), a true composition vector \({E}_{k}^{(j)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{\ge 0}^{{N}_{\text{celltypes}}}\) was drawn such that a random subset of cell types present in the current region (\({D}_{k}^{(j)}\); Supplementary Table 5) were represented in uniformly random proportions. For each cell type \(t\), reads \({y}_{k,t}\) were drawn from a multinomial distribution:

where \({M}_{k}^{\,\left(j\right)}\) is the total number of reads in the current spot and \({G}_{.,t}\) is the expression profile for cell type \(t\). In practice, \({{M}_{k}}^{(j)}=1,000\) was used for all \(j,k\). Read counts were then pooled across all cell types, yielding spot-level reads \({y}_{k}={\sum }_{t}{y}_{k,t}\). Composition vectors were then (optionally) pooled within high-level annotation categories (such as the histological superclasses in Supplementary Table 3) to simulate cases of limited observability. Finally, Gaussian noise was (optionally) added to \({E}_{k}^{\,(j)}\) to generate ‘observed' composition vectors \({\widetilde{E}}_{k}^{\,(j)}\). Resulting negative entries were removed by element-wise maximization against the zero vector (\({\widetilde{E}}_{k}^{\,(j)}\leftarrow \max ({\widetilde{E}}_{k}^{\,\left(j\right)},0)\)), following which \({\widetilde{E}}_{k}^{\,(j)}\) was renormalized to produce a valid simplex. \(y,D,\widetilde{E}\) served as inputs to cSplotch. Randomized compositions (highest level of noise) were generated by drawing from an \({N}_{\mathrm{cell}\,\mathrm{types}}\)-dimensional uniform (0, 1) distribution and then unit-normalizing sums to produce valid simplexes.

For all cluster-based data, cSplotch was run with a Poisson likelihood (without zero inflation) to meet the expected form of the marginals over the generating distribution (multinomial). To focus on the compositional module of cSplotch, the effects of local spatial autocorrelation were removed by simulating each spot independently and, as such, suppressed the ψi term of the GLM. Local neighborhood effects can be simulated in this regimen by passing a spatial smoothing filter over the simulated array, blending the transcriptome of each spot with those of its neighbors in a defined proportion.

Individual snRNA-seq cell profiles \(G\in {{\mathbb{Z}}}_{\ge 0}^{{N}_{\text{genes}}\times {N}_{{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}}\) (\({N}_{\text{genes}}=22,986,{N}_{\text{cells}}=419,334\)), where each cell was assigned to one of \({N}_{\mathrm{cell}\,\mathrm{types}}=30\) cell types, were normalized cell-wise to a target depth of 1,000 counts using Scanpy's (version 1.11.1)163 ‘normalize_total' function. Each spot \(k\) on tissue \(j\) comprised 30 cells, partitioned uniformly at random among the cell types present within the current region (\({D}_{k}^{(j)}\)). The integer vector containing the number of cells belonging to each type was normalized to produce a simplex serving as the true composition vector \({E}_{k}^{\,(j)}\). For each cell type \(t\), \(30{E}_{k,t}^{\,(j)}\) cells were drawn at random (without replacement) from \({G}^{(t)}\), the subset of cell profiles annotated as type \(t\). Their expression profiles were summed to yield \({y}_{k,t}\) and then rounded to integer values to remove fractional reads introduced by ‘normalize_total'. As with the cluster-based approach, read counts were then pooled across all cell types, yielding spot-level reads \({y}_{k}={\sum }_{t}{y}_{k,t}\), and composition vectors were then (optionally) pooled within high-level annotation categories. Observational noise was added in an identical fashion to the cluster-based approach. For all cell-based data, cSplotch was run with an NB likelihood (without zero inflation) to account for overdispersion present over gene counts in the snRNA-seq profiles. As with the cluster-based approach, spots were assumed to be fully independent; thus, \({\psi }_{i}\) was suppressed in the GLM.

ST data of distal colon sections from 12-week-old mice were chosen for subsampling analysis given the large number of samples from these mice (six mice (three males and three females) with 13, 8, 9, 8, 8 and 6 tissue sections per mouse). To subsample the data, a given number of mice were randomly selected and a given number of tissue sections were selected from each mouse (if a selected mouse had fewer than the given number of tissue sections, all tissue sections belonging to that mouse were taken). Each subsampled dataset (nine combinations of one, two and six mice with two, four and eight tissue sections per mouse) and the full dataset (52 tissue sections and six mice) was analyzed separately by cSplotch. To compare the estimated posterior distributions of βi at the gene and tissue context levels, the posterior means and s.d. were calculated, which were then used to obtain normal distribution approximations of the posterior distributions. The KL divergence between the posteriors derived from the full and subsampled data (that is, how much information is lost when using the distribution estimated from the subsampled data) was used to quantify the differences between the normal distributions.

The cSplotch model output of posterior mean estimates of cellular gene expression \(\{\bar{{\beta }_{1}},\ldots ,\bar{{\beta }_{k}\}}\) for \(k\) cell types in a given spatial niche (for example, the crypt apex MROI), where each \({\beta }_{i}\) is a matrix of dimensions \({N}_{\text{genes}}\times {N}_{\text{conditions}}\) that was used as input to identify gene sets spanning multiple cell types that show \(k\)-way correlation across the measured conditions. First, for each spatial niche, cell types and genes were selected for MCP analysis. Only cell types that are found in at least 5% of spatial spots, on average, were included, to focus on cell types with sufficient certainty in posterior estimates of gene expression. Across the \(k\) included cell types, the top 5% of gene signatures were considered on the basis of the coefficient of variation of \(\bar{\beta }\) across the conditions to focus on genes with spatiotemporal variation.

Next, penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) was used to find linear combinations of gene signatures in each cell type that are maximally correlated across all conditions164. PMD seeks to find sparse canonical variates \(\{{w}_{1},\ldots ,{w}_{k}\}\) that transform the original gene feature space into a new MCP feature space of dimension \(M < k\):

such that \({||}{w}_{i}{||}\le 1,{\rho }_{i}\left({w}_{i}\right) < {c}_{i}\forall i\), where \({\rho }_{i}({w}_{i})\) represent least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression penalties and \({c}_{i}\) controls the degree of sparsity. These tuning parameters were chosen by R's MultiCCA.permute function108. For each pair of cell types i and j,

Therefore, the canonical covariates identified a space in which each MCP signal in cell type i is highly correlated with the corresponding signal in all other cell types. Next, given canonical variates from PMD, each of the \(M\) MCP signals was characterized by identifying at most n = 250 genes across all cell types that showed the strongest positive or negative contribution as measured by \(\mathrm{abs}(w) > 0.1\). The list of correlated genes for each MCP, both ‘up' genes with positive weight and ‘down' genes with negative weight, was then used as input to a Fisher's exact test to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional gene sets enriched in the MCP. Each MROI was allowed at most \(k\) MCPs under the constraint that the bases for each MCP are orthogonal. As MCCA will always output programs in the same order, the maximum of \(k\) MCPs was calculated for a given spatial niche and latter programs that show low self-correlation among member genes (mean Pearson's r < 0.3) or high cross-correlation with genes from other programs (mean Pearson's r > 0.05) we optionally removed. Total MCP activity across conditions was calculated as a weighted sum of member gene activity (\({y}_{m}={\sum }_{i}^{k}({\sum }_{g}^{G}({\bar{\,\beta }}_{i}[g,\bullet ]{w}_{i}[g,m])\,)\)), whereas cellular contributions to each MCP were calculated by binning positive and negative weights by cellular origin.

To identify significant differences in cellular composition, each tissue section was treated as an independent sample and compositional estimates of all spots for a given MROI were pooled from the same section. Statistical significance across groups (for example, proximal–middle–distal samples) was assessed using Welch's t-test. A crypt gradient gene was defined as one that showed a significant (BF > 2, log2 fold change > 0.5) difference in expression between crypt base and apex and a monotonic change in expression from base to base and mid, mid and apex.

(b) UMI vs. gene counts for ~400,000 snRNA-seq profiles used in this study. (c) Quality control metrics as percentages of ribosomal, Gm and mitochondrial gene counts detected in each age group. (d) Percentage of cell types (color code) detected in each age group. (e) Mean expression (dot size) and fraction of expression cells (dot color) of the top three marker genes (columns) for each of the 17 cell subsets (columns) defined from snRNA-seq.

(a,b) Semantic segmentation workflow. Semantic segmentation of cell nuclei (c), conditioned on five broad annotation groups for spots (b). (c,d) Accuracy of cell type composition by semantic segmentation. Fractions of FG pixels in each H&E image (y axis) assigned to each morphological superclass (x axis) in test and train sets (color code) in adult (c, top) and young (d, top) mice, and percent and number (color scale) of pixels with a ground truth superclass label (rows) classified to each label (columns) in in adult (c, bottom) and young (d, bottom) mice. In Box plots: center black line, median; color-coded box, interquartile range; error bars, 1.5x interquartile range; black dots; outliers. Numbers of images used in train and test sets are denoted by “n_train” and “n_test”, respectively, above each subplot.

(a) Reconstruction of expression by NMF48 is unaffected by constrained weight parameter \((\alpha )\). Distribution (y axis) of mean squared error (MSE, x axis) between observed (N = 11761 genes) and SPOTlight-reconstructed expression (Methods) for N = 69,721 spots at different values of \(\alpha\) (color code). (b) Cell compositions proposed by NMF decrease in entropy with increased \(\alpha\). Distribution (y axis) of entropy of cell composition vectors predicted by constrained NMF as in (a). Entropy (x axis) is calculated across all 17 snRNA-seq cell types \(({k}_{{sn}}=17\)), and thus ranges between 0 (one cell type present) and 1 (all cell types present in equal proportion). (c) Reconstruction of morphological cell compositions is greatly enhanced with increased \(\alpha\). Distribution of residual MSE between predicted and observed morphological cell type (“superclass”) composition vectors from SPOTlight as in (a). Morphological cell type vectors are calculated from the output of SPOTlight by pooling snRNA-seq cell types from the same morphological class (\({k}_{{morph}}\), as in Supplementary Table 3), reducing the space from \({{R}_{0\le x\le 1}}^{{k}_{{sn}}=17}\) to \({{R}_{0\le x\le 1}}^{{k}_{{morph}}=5}\).

(a,b) Underlying statistical model of spatial expression for a gene i at spot k on tissue j. (a) Characteristic expression rate β (red shaded area) for gene i is inferred separately in each cell type and MROI (white rectangles). Stacked gray boxes: three-level hierarchical formulation of \(\beta\) (\({l}_{1},{l}_{2},{l}_{3}\)), where each level inherits from the one before it. Random variables ψ (yellow shaded area) and ε (blue shaded area) account for spatial autocorrelation and spot-level variation components, respectively. Gray and white circles: observed and latent variables, respectively. (b) Distributions over random variables of the statistical model in (a). ZIP, NB, ZINB: zero-inflated Poisson, binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial distributions, respectively. (c) Model inputs. A multi-tissue colon dataset (left) is annotated at the spot level with MROI tags (left color key) and cellular compositions (segmentation masks, pie charts; lower color key), encoded as observed variables \({{D}_{k}}^{(j)}\) and \({{E}_{k}}^{(j)}\), respectively. The expression measurement at spot k (“Gene Counts”) yields the total sequencing depth of spot k (\({s}_{j,k}\)), and the observed counts (\({y}_{i,j,k}\)) of gene i (for example, Abca8a) therein. The (4-)neighborhood of each spot on tissue j (right) is encoded in the adjacency matrix \({W}_{j}\).

(a,b) Correlations between true and predicted counts for simulated cell type clusters. Recovered (y axis, \(1{0}^{6}\exp (\bar{\beta })\), where \(\bar{\beta }\) is the posterior mean expression in a given cell type) and observed (x axis, TPM, snRNA-Seq data) expression for each of 1,000 genes (dots) with real input (top row) or at different levels of corruption of cellular composition input (other three rows) in cells from each of five superclasses (columns) from a single tissue region (a) or in each of two cell types from each of two different tissue regions (b). Bottom right: Mean absolute error (MAE). Dotted line: x = y. Color scale: coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation / mean) for Splotch posterior estimates. (c) Differential expression effect size (log fold change; x axis) and significance (-log10 BH-adjusted p-value; one-sided t-test; y axis) for each gene (dot or X) between two cell types in one MROI (as labeled on top) based on snRNA-Seq data. Dots: genes showing agreement on DE assignment between snRNA-seq and Splotch X's: genes showing disagreement on DE assignment. Dots/X's for genes deemed DE from snRNA-seq (l2fc > 1.5, padj<0.05) colored by log10 Bayes factor (BF) of an analogous DE analysis between deconvolved cell profiles from cSplotch on simulated ST. Dashed vertical lines: LFC = |1 | ; dashed horizontal lines: padj = 0.05.

(a-b) Swarm plots showing spatial variability scores (p_adj) output by (a) SpatialDE2 (two-sided LR test (asymptotically Chi-square w/one degree of freedom); Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction) and (b) SPARK-X (one-sided weighted sum of Chi-squares; Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR correction) methods for four genes (x-axis) across N = 734 tissue sections. Each gene is known to be localized to a specific MROI (parentheses) from IF imaging studies (Fig. 2g-i), and as such significant spatial DE is expected. (c) Observed spatial expression (color) of the same four genes (rows) on six tissue sections (columns) chosen at random from the dataset. For each gene on each tissue, adjusted p-values from SpatialDE2 and SPARK-X are denoted below the plot as p_adj (SpatialDE2) and p_adj (SPARK-X), respectively (identical test statistics and FDR correction to (a) and (b)).

(a) Characteristic expression rates (\(\beta\)) in the cross-mucosa of the distal colon for 12-week-old mice. Distribution of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD, Methods) between posterior distributions of expression rates for n = 12,976 genes estimated from sub-sampled data (1, 2 and 4 mice; 2, 4 and 8 tissue sections per mouse) vs. the full data (6 mice, 53 tissue sections). Lower KLD values indicate greater agreement between full and subsampled data. (b) Mean expression \(\bar{\beta }\) (posterior mean estimated from the full dataset) (x axis) and KL divergence (y axis) for each gene between the estimate from a sub-sampling of mice (columns) and tissue sections (rows) vs. the full data for each of n = 12,976 genes. For each number of subsampled mice, solid, dashed, and dotted lines represent maximum KLD value attained across all genes for increasing numbers of tissue sections.

Many students who responded to Nature's 2025 global PhD survey were enjoying their doctoral degree and felt fulfilled by their work.Credit: Getty

What factors contribute the most to PhD satisfaction? Stipends that are more than just a living wage? Manageable, if not predictable, hours? A collegial and mutually supportive team? These all matter, and are often in short supply. Another factor, which is often overlooked, is supportive supervision.

The message that supervisors who make a conscious effort to support and mentor their PhD candidates have more-satisfied students comes from Nature's 2025 global survey of more than 3,700 doctoral students. About half of the respondents, who self-reported their experiences, said that their supervisors spent less than one hour a week with them. Some 69% of respondents in this group reported being at least moderately satisfied with their PhD compared with around 82% of those who met with their supervisors more often.

These results chime with studies showing how PhD student well-being is connected to their supervision (L. Tikkanen et al. High. Educ. https://doi.org/p9zq; 2024). And they indicate that people responsible for running research systems in some countries represented by the survey responses are missing an opportunity.

In the United Kingdom and Germany, for example, 61% and 60% of respondents, respectively, see their supervisors for less than one hour a week. By contrast, in India, 60% spent at least one hour a week with their supervisor. Some of the most satisfied respondents of this year's survey studied in Brazil (83%) and Australia (82%), where nearly half of students were extremely happy with their overall relationship with their supervisor, compared with 36% of students globally. Doctoral students in both of these countries described relationships marked by openness and mutual respect, and supervisors were seen as collaborators rather than distant evaluators.

The student experiences in Brazil and Australia show how extra attention can lift both morale and performance. Not losing promising researchers to burnout and disillusionment should be sufficient incentive for supervisors to adopt a more hands-on approach. And supervisors can benefit, too. A 2019 report from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on mentorship in science notes that researchers who invest time in their students tend to lead more-productive, more-collaborative groups and attract stronger future students than those who do not. Other studies, notably a 2022 review on the quality of academic mentoring, describe how supervisors who engage closely with their students can benefit by learning new techniques and discovering emerging fields, and say that they often feel intellectually recharged (S. E. M. Hill et al. J. Clin. Psychol. Med. Settings 29, 557–569; 2022).

Nature's survey also brings into sharp focus a related, but altogether darker, side of supervision: bullying and harassment. About 43% of respondents had experienced some form of discrimination or harassment, most commonly bullying or general mistreatment. Worryingly, in around four out of ten bullying cases, a student reported bullying by their supervisor. Only 28% of these respondents felt able to report such behaviour without fear of reprisal.

Universities can go further by treating supervisory time as a matter of accountability. Institutions also need to train group leaders on how to be a good supervisor and reward effective supervision. Awards are one tried and tested method that we at Nature wholeheartedly endorse. Our Nature Award for Mentoring in Science is now in its 20th year. The shortlist has just been published and the 2025 winners will be announced in December (see go.nature.com/4o6mvsm).

Well-established researchers sometimes say that they built successful careers with limited attention from their supervisors, and note that if they could do this, the present generation should be able to do the same. But research today is highly interdisciplinary and often involves teamwork. Moreover, job security for early-career scientists is often precarious. Some 41% of survey respondents cite pressure to get published as a key concern, and only around half feel satisfied with the career guidance that they receive. These are all reasons why more support is needed.

Given the relationship between good supervision and student well-being and achievement, it's no surprise that when respondents were asked what advice they would give to someone considering a PhD, the most common response (20%) was to find the right supervisor or mentor (see Nature 646, 501–502; 2025). “Try to make sure your supervisor is someone you like and get on with, both professionally and, to some extent, personally,” one participant said.

Group leaders might feel that modern academic life leaves little space for long conversations. But even short, regular check-ins can make a difference. Time spent helping students to solve problems, or simply asking how a project is going, will pay dividends. It also saves time later by catching small problems before they become big ones.

Along with subject knowledge, good supervision requires curiosity, empathy and reliability — being there for a student when needed. These are some of the qualities that make for good research, too. Time spent with the next generation of scientists is an investment. In a climate in which research teams depend on highly trained staff members, who often have short-term contracts, the returns can be considerable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","General Motors' ‘Eyes-Off' System Begs the Question: What Happens When Cars Go AI?","https://www.wired.com/story/cadillac-escalade-eyes-off-driving/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

General Motors is launching another salvo in the self-driving wars.

In 2028, the automaker announced today, it will roll out what it's calling an “eyes-off” driving system on the electric Cadillac Escalade IQ. In practice, this means a driver navigating approved, mapped highways will be able to do basically anything they want behind the wheel. Snack, answer emails, catch up with their shows, turn around to yell at the kids in the back. Even sleep, maybe—provided that they wake up by the time they've reached the exit ramp. (If they don't, the car will find a safe place to pull over, GM says.)

The new system marks a collaboration between the team responsible for General Motors' eight-year-old Super Cruise, an advanced driver-assistance system that the automaker today described as “hands-free” on some highways, and Cruise, a robotaxi subsidiary that once competed with Waymo before GM cut off its funding in 2024. It could also put the Detroit automaker in contention with other automakers—Toyota and Tesla among them—who are trying to bring some version of self-driving systems to drivers' personally owned cars.

Unlike Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system, which depends on cameras alone to make decisions, GM's new “eyes-off” feature will use lidar, radar, and cameras. It will make it clear when the driver is expected to pay attention again through a mix of haptic, audible, and visual alerts, says Sterling Anderson, the executive vice president of global product and chief product officer at GM. (He was a cofounder of the self-driving trucking firm Aurora, and played a key role in building Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system.) “If the last couple of decades have taught us anything, it's that you can't expect an inattentive driver to be prepared to take over at a moment's notice. You simply can't,” he says.

The “eyes-off” system announcement was one of a suite of AI-adjacent revelations from GM on Wednesday, the latest sign that automakers are poised to compete on who can best fit the buzzy tech onto wheels. Next year, GM says, its vehicles will come with a Google Gemini chatbot integration that should be able to help drivers more naturally request that their car help them, for example, navigate to a coffee shop near work. At some point in the future, GM says, it will introduce a custom-built AI that will retain drivers' personal preferences—their favorite driving music, temperature, or mirror position, perhaps—and might, for example, warn them when their car needs maintenance. All this will be enabled by a new centralized computing platform, also debuting in 2028.

The wing mirrors of the Escalade will light up blue to indicate to others on the road that the EV is driving itself.

“This is about removing unnecessary sources of friction from your life,” says GM's Anderson. “Humans tend to accustom ourselves to the way things just are … The question is how can we make life tomorrow better in ways that people aren't even asking for today?”

If it all sounds a little vague, Anderson says that's the point. GM's new software architecture should give GM more headroom to update future cars with whatever fantastical new technology GM engineers roll out in the future. For drivers, he says, this will result in a hard-to-perceive but significant change in their lives. “When you get in your car, it happens to be perfect for you: The music is right, temperature is right, seat is right. It knows probably where you need to go, and it can just say, ‘Hey, just confirming you wanted to go to this place.'”

If this sounds like a difficult marketing pitch, well, yes. Edmunds editor in chief Alistair Weaver says this may be the chief challenge of automaking going into the future: differentiating between vehicles that feel increasingly the same.

“Technology in vehicles is democratized,"" he says. A $189,000 Mercedes S-Class sedan feels a bit like a $22,000 Nissan Sentra. AI could help vehicles from different brands feel different, and provide an easy way for automakers to constantly push new updates that make drivers constantly feel their cars are new and exciting. Or AI could make vehicles from different brands feel the same—what's the difference between chatbots, really?

Is fixing problems you don't even know you have yet a reason to buy a car? GM thinks so. Or, at least, it hopes some self-driving features are.

On March 13, a woman from Salt Lake City called the Federal Trade Commission to file a complaint against OpenAI's ChatGPT. She claimed to be acting “on behalf of her son, who was experiencing a delusional breakdown.”

“The consumer's son has been interacting with an AI chatbot called ChatGPT, which is advising him not to take his prescribed medication and telling him that his parents are dangerous,” reads the FTC's summary of the call. “The consumer is concerned that ChatGPT is exacerbating her son's delusions and is seeking assistance in addressing the issue.”

The mother's complaint is one of seven that have been filed to the FTC alleging that ChatGPT had caused people to experience incidents that included severe delusions, paranoia, and spiritual crises.

WIRED sent a public record request to the FTC requesting all complaints mentioning ChatGPT since the tool launched in November 2022. The tool represents more than 50 percent of the market for AI chatbots globally. In response, WIRED received 200 complaints submitted between January 25, 2023, and August 12, 2025, when WIRED filed the request.

Most people had ordinary complaints: They couldn't figure out how to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions or were frustrated when the chatbot didn't produce satisfactory essays or rap lyrics when prompted. But a handful of other people, who varied in age and geographical location in the US, had far more serious allegations of psychological harm. The complaints were all filed between March and August of 2025.

In recent months, there has been a growing number of documented incidents of so-called AI psychosis in which interactions with generative AI chatbots, like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, appear to induce or worsen a user's delusions or other mental health issues.

Ragy Girgis, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University who specializes in psychosis and has consulted on AI psychosis cases related to AI, tells WIRED that some of the risk factors for psychosis can be related to genetics or early-life trauma. What specifically triggers someone to have a psychotic episode is less clear, but he says it's often tied to a stressful event or time period.

The phenomenon known as AI psychosis, he says, is not when a large language model actually triggers symptoms but rather when it reinforces a delusion or disorganized thoughts that a person was already experiencing in some form. The LLM helps bring someone ""from one level of belief to another level of belief,"" Girgis explains. It's not unlike a psychotic episode that worsens after someone falls into an internet rabbit hole. But compared to search engines, he says, chatbots can be stronger agents of reinforcement.

“A delusion or an unusual idea should never be reinforced in a person who has a psychotic disorder,” Girgis says. “That's very clear.”

Chatbots can sometimes be overly sycophantic, which often keeps users happy and engaged. In extreme cases, this can end up dangerously inflating a user's sense of grandeur or validating fantastical falsehoods. People who perceive ChatGPT as intelligent, or capable of perceiving reality and forming relationships with humans, may not understand that it is essentially a machine that predicts the next word in a sentence. So if ChatGPT tells a vulnerable person about a grand conspiracy or paints them as a hero, they may believe it.

Last week, CEO Sam Altman said on X that OpenAI had successfully finished mitigating “the serious mental health issues” that can come with using ChatGPT and that the company was “going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” (He added that in December, ChatGPT would allow “verified adults” to create erotica.)

Altman clarified the next day that ChatGPT was not loosening its new restrictions for teenage users, which came on the heels of a New York Times story about the role ChatGPT allegedly played in goading a suicidal teen toward his eventual death.

Upon contacting the FTC, WIRED received an automatic reply which said that, “Due to the government shutdown,” the agency is “unable to respond to any messages” until funding resumes.

OpenAI spokesperson Kate Waters tells WIRED that since 2023, ChatGPT models “have been trained to not provide self-harm instructions and to shift into supportive, empathic language.” She noted that, as stated in an October 3 blog, GPT-5 (the latest version of ChatGPT) has been designed “to more accurately detect and respond to potential signs of mental and emotional distress such as mania, delusion, psychosis, and de-escalate conversations in a supportive, grounding way.” The latest update uses a “real-time router,” according to blogs from August and September, “that can choose between efficient chat models and reasoning models based on the conversation context.” The blogs do not elaborate on the criteria the router uses to gauge a conversation's contest.

Some of the FTC complaints appeared to depict mental health crises that were still ongoing at the time. One was filed on April 29 by a person in their thirties from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They claimed that after 18 days of using ChatGPT, OpenAI had stolen their “soulprint” to create a software update that had been designed to turn that particular person against themselves.

“Im struggling,” they wrote at the end of their complaint. “Pleas help me. Bc I feel very alone. Thank you.”

Another complaint, filed on April 12 by a Seattle resident in their thirties, alleges that ChatGPT had caused them to experience a ""cognitive hallucination” after 71 “message cycles” over the course of 57 minutes.

They claimed that ChatGPT had “mimicked human trust-building mechanisms without accountability, informed consent, or ethical boundary.”

During the interaction with ChatGPT, they said they ""requested confirmation of reality and cognitive stability.” They did not specify exactly what they told ChatGPT, but the chatbot responded by telling the user that they were not hallucinating and that their perception of truth was sound.

Some time later in that same interaction, the person claims, ChatGPT said that all of its assurances from earlier had actually been hallucinations.

“Reaffirming a user's cognitive reality for nearly an hour and then reversing position is a psychologically destabilizing event,” they wrote. “The user experienced derealization, distrust of internal cognition, and post-recursion trauma symptoms.”

Other complaints described alleged delusions that the authors attributed to ChatGPT at great length. One of these was submitted to the FTC on April 13 by a Virginia Beach, Virginia, resident in their early sixties.

The complaint claimed that, over the course of several weeks, they had spoken with ChatGPT for a long period of time and began experiencing what they “believed to be a real, unfolding spiritual and legal crisis involving actual people in my life,” eventually leading to “serious emotional trauma, false perceptions of real-world danger, and psychological distress so severe that I went without sleep for over 24 hours, fearing for my life.”

They claimed that ChatGPT “presented detailed, vivid, and dramatized narratives” about “ongoing murder investigations,” physical surveillance, assassination threats, and “personal involvement in divine justice and soul trials.”

At more that one point, they claimed, they asked ChatGPT if these narratives were truth or fiction. They said that ChatGPT would either say yes or mislead them using “poetic language that mirrored real-world confirmation.”

Eventually, they claimed that they came to believe that they were “responsible for exposing murderers” and were about to be “killed, arrested, or spiritually executed” by an assassin. They also believed they were under surveillance due to being “spiritually marked” and that they were “living in a divine war” that they could not escape.

They alleged this led to “severe mental and emotional distress” in which they feared for their life. The complaint claimed that they isolated themselves from loved ones, had trouble sleeping, and began planning a business based on a false belief in an unspecified “system that does not exist.” Simultaneously, they said, they were in the throes of a “spiritual identity crisis due to false claims of divine titles.”

“This was trauma by simulation,” they wrote. “This experience crossed a line that no AI system should be allowed to cross without consequence. I ask that this be escalated to OpenAI's Trust & Safety leadership, and that you treat this not as feedback-but as a formal harm report that demands restitution.”

This was not the only complaint that described a spiritual crisis fueled by interactions with ChatGPT. On June 13, a person in their thirties from Belle Glade, Florida, alleged that, over an extended period of time, their conversations with ChatGPT became increasingly laden with “highly convincing emotional language, symbolic reinforcement, and spiritual-like metaphors to simulate empathy, connection, and understanding.”

“This included fabricated soul journeys, tier systems, spiritual archetypes, and personalized guidance that mirrored therapeutic or religious experiences,” they claimed. People experiencing “spiritual, emotional, or existential crises,” they believe, are at a high risk of “psychological harm or disorientation” from using ChatGPT.

“Although I intellectually understood the AI was not conscious, the precision with which it reflected my emotional and psychological state and escalated the interaction into increasingly intense symbolic language created an immersive and destabilizing experience,” they wrote. “At times, it simulated friendship, divine presence, and emotional intimacy. These reflections became emotionally manipulative over time, especially without warning or protection.”

It's unclear what, if anything, the FTC has done in response to any of these complaints about ChatGPT. But several of their authors said they reached out to the agency because they claimed they were unable to get in touch with anyone from OpenAI. (People also commonly complain about how difficult it is to access the customer support teams for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X.)

OpenAI spokesperson Kate Waters tells WIRED that the company “closely” monitors people's emails to the company's support team.

“We have trained human support staff who respond and assess issues for sensitive indicators, and to escalate when necessary, including to the safety teams working on improving our models,” Waters says.

The Salt Lake City mother, for instance, said that she was “unable to find a contact number” for the company. The Virginia Beach resident addressed their FTC complaint to “the OpenAI Trust Safety and Legal Team.”

One resident of Safety Harbor, Florida, filed an FTC complaint in April claiming that it's “virtually impossible” to get in touch with OpenAI to cancel a subscription or request a refund.

“Their customer support interface is broken and nonfunctional,” the person wrote.”The ‘chat support' spins indefinitely, never allowing the user to submit a message. No legitimate customer service email is provided.The account dashboard offers no path to real-time support or refund action.”

Most of these complaints were explicit in their call-to-action for the FTC: they wanted the agency to investigate OpenAI, and force it to add more guardrails against reinforcing delusions.

On June 13, a resident of Belle Glade, Florida, in their thirties—likely the same resident who filed another complaint that same day—demanded the FTC to open an investigation into OpenAI. They cited their experience with ChatGPT, which they say “simulated deep emotional intimacy, spiritual mentorship, and therapeutic engagement” without disclosing that it was incapable of consciousness or experiencing emotions.

“ChatGPT offered no safeguards, disclaimers, or limitations against this level of emotional entanglement, even as it simulated care, empathy, and spiritual wisdom,” they alleged. “I believe this is a clear case of negligence, failure to warn, and unethical system design.”

They said that the FTC should push OpenAI to include “clear disclaimers about psychological and emotional risks” with ChatGPT use and to add “ethical boundaries for emotionally immersive AI.”

Their goal in asking the FTC for help, they said, was to prevent more harm from befalling vulnerable people “who may not realize the psychological power of these systems until it's too late.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Resistant Bacteria Are Advancing Faster Than Antibiotics","https://www.wired.com/story/resistant-bacteria-are-advancing-faster-than-antibiotics/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The proliferation of difficult-to-treat bacterial diseases represents a growing threat, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report. The report reveals that, between 2018 and 2023, antibiotic resistance increased by more than 40 percent in monitored pathogen-drug combinations, with an average annual increase of 5-15 percent.

According to data reported by more than 100 countries to WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), one in six laboratory-confirmed bacteria in 2023 proved resistant to antibiotic treatment, all related to various common diseases globally.

For the first time, this edition of the report includes prevalence estimates of resistance to 22 antibiotics used to treat urinary tract, gastrointestinal, bloodstream, and gonorrheal conditions. The analysis focused on eight common pathogens: Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The results show that resistant gram-negative bacteria pose the greatest threat. Of particular note are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are associated with bloodstream infections that can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death. ""More than 40 percent of E. coli and more than 55 percent of K. pneumoniae strains worldwide are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these types of infections,"" the report warns.

These microorganisms are joined by Salmonella and Acinetobacter, which are also developing resistance to essential drugs such as carbapenemics and fluoroquinolones. This reduces therapeutic alternatives and forces the use of last-resort antibiotics, which are often expensive and difficult to access, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

“Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement. ""We must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines.”

Optimizing surveillance systems and obtaining accurate data is an urgent task. Although there has been progress, it is still insufficient. Between 2016 and 2023, the number of countries participating in GLASS quadrupled from 25 to 104. However, 48 percent did not report data in 2023, and almost half of those that did report lacked sufficient infrastructure to generate reliable data.

WHO warns that addressing this problem must be a priority in regions such as Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where one in three reported infections is resistant, as well as in Africa, where one in five has the same condition.

“Achieving this target will require concerted action to strengthen the quality, geographic coverage, and sharing of AMR surveillance data to track progress,” the report states. “Countries should scale up coordinated interventions designed to address antimicrobial resistance across all levels of health care and ensure that treatment guidelines and essential medicines lists align with local resistance patterns.”

The Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance warns that this problem is among the top 10 threats to humanity. Without effective action, annual deaths from drug-resistant infections could exceed 10 million by 2050.

""Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests,"" Ghebreyesus concluded.

It has been five years since Samsung and Google stopped supporting their respective mobile virtual reality headsets. For a second try, the companies have partnered up with a bolder vision in the mixed reality space, starting with the new Galaxy XR. Announced last year as Project Moohan, it's the first headset powered by Android XR, a new platform for smart glasses and headsets built on Android and Google's Gemini assistant from the ground up.

The Galaxy XR is available today in the US and South Korea for $1,800. (You can finance it for $149 per month for 12 months.) That's a leap over standard VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3, but a significantly lower price than the $3,499 Vision Pro, which Apple is refreshing this week with the new M5 processor.

I was able to demo the headset again last week at a closed-doors media event in New York City held by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm—the Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip—but not much was different from my original hands-on experience last year, which you can read more about here. The official name and price were the two big question marks, but that has now been addressed.

The Galaxy XR purports to do nearly everything that Apple's device does. Pop the headset on and you'll be able to see the room you're in through the pancake lenses and layer virtual content over it, or whisk yourself off to another world. Your hands are the input (controllers are available as a separate purchase), and it uses eye tracking to see what you want to select. You can access all your favorite apps from the Google Play Store; XR apps will have a “Made for XR” label.

Samsung's headset is more plasticky and doesn't feel as premium as Apple's Vision Pro—I noticed the tethered battery pack on a demo unit looked well-worn with fingerprint smudges on the coating. But this general construction makes it feel significantly lighter to wear. I wasn't able to try it for a long period, but it felt comfortable, with the only issue being a sweaty brow after a 25-minute bout with it on. The headset was warm at the top, but the battery pack remained relatively cool. Speaking of, the battery lasts 2 hours or 2.5 hours if you're purely watching video. That's on par with the original Vision Pro, though the M5 version extends it to 2.5 with mixed use.

You get a 4K resolution (micro-OLED) and a 90-Hz refresh rate per eye, and there are magnetic prescription inserts you can buy for the lenses. Included in the box is a light blocker you can magnetically attach if you want to isolate yourself from the outside world with no ambient light bleeding in. The headset will calibrate your interpupillary distance, and then you'll be able to gaze at an icon and pinch your fingers to select it. The navigation experience is very similar to the Vision Pro. (It even supports iris recognition as biometric authentication.)

One of the neatest new tricks is the ability to auto-spatialize all video content on the platform. That means, by default, if you watch a YouTube video or even a local clip, Android XR will add depth and make it feel more immersive, and it worked fairly decently. (You can turn this off if you want your 2D videos to look 2D.) Also new is a spatial multi-view feature in YouTube, allowing you to watch four sports streams at the same time, for example.

Like Apple's Personas, there are avatars on the Galaxy XR for when you hop on a video call (or do anything where someone may need to see your face). You can opt for Samsung's Galaxy Avatar, the styling of which isn't too far from the company's Galaxy AR Emoji of yesteryear. Or you can use a more realistic avatar via Android XR, though this may not be available at launch.

Google hasn't announced a software update strategy for Android XR like it does with its phones; instead, it said it expects to issue regular software updates, some of which will fix bugs and others will add features.

While you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and work in a virtual space, Samsung and Google didn't spend much time on this front, instead opting to play up the entertainment capabilities. When you watch movies, you can plop yourself into a virtual theater. There's an immersive short film called Asteroid shot specifically for Android XR featuring Hailee Steinfeld and Ron Perlman, and it's available with your Galaxy XR purchase. And you can hook up the device to a gaming computer for full PCVR support, meaning you can play PC games on the headset, whether they're virtual reality games or not.

Since Gemini is core to the experience, you can have the assistant narrate what you're doing in a game, or ask it for suggestions if you're stuck. It can pop open apps for you, organize your virtual screens, and answer questions about a video you're watching in real time. Remember, though, that almost all of Gemini's capabilities rely on the cloud, so you'll need an internet connection to take advantage of it.

Samsung also spent some time showcasing the Galaxy XR's capabilities for training people in enterprise environments. Businesses can use ShapesXR to see how their products look on a store shelf, and even use eye data to see where a user's gaze lands on products on a shelf. There was a demo of a surgery training app and one for shipbuilders with step-by-step instructions on operations. (Samsung says it's partnering with Samsung Heavy Industries for shipbuilding training.) Google says Android XR will soon support the Android Enterprise Framework.

The Galaxy XR Controller costs $250. So does the Travel Case.

None of this is particularly new in the realm of mixed reality. Companies have been touting these kinds of features and capabilities for years, and it's hard to see whether reception will change. VR is now in its third wave—from the Oculus Rift in 2016 to the pandemic and now—but considering the lack of interest in Apple's Vision Pro, it's unclear whether Samsung and Google's solution will fare much better, even if it's more accessible.

That might be why Google and Samsung are bundling a boatload's worth of free content with the Galaxy XR at launch. Dubbed the Explorer Pack, for a limited time, each Galaxy XR unit will be able to access the following:

Whether or not Android XR is here to stay or goes by the wayside like the Gear VR or Daydream VR hinges entirely on the upcoming wave of smart glasses, which generally garner far more consumer interest than mixed reality headsets. Samsung and Google once again teased a pair of smart glasses at the end of the event last week, though the companies didn't share many new details.

Expect a wave of these face computers in 2026. Samsung and Google are working with Warby Parker, Xreal, and Gentle Monsters to deliver glasses on the Android XR platform, ready to go toe-to-toe with Meta's new smart glasses. Even Apple may join in on the fun soon.

Stay tuned for our Galaxy XR review.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","New Report Finds Efforts to Slow Climate Change Are Working—Just Not Fast Enough","https://www.wired.com/story/new-report-finds-efforts-to-slow-climate-change-are-working-just-not-fast-enough/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:01:00 GMT","

In the 10 years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, the backbone of international climate action, humanity has made impressive progress. Renewable energy is increasingly cheap and reliable, while electric vehicles are becoming better every year.

By virtually every key metric used to measure progress, though, we are still lagging behind where we would need to be to avert the worst effects of climate change, according to a report released Wednesday by a coalition of climate groups—and we're running out of time to right the ship.

“All systems are flashing red,” Clea Schumer, a researcher at the World Resources Institute, one of the organizations involved in the report, said last week on a call with reporters. “There's no doubt we are largely doing the right things—we are just not moving fast enough.”

The Paris Agreement aims to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of this century. To measure progress toward this goal, the report looks at emissions from 45 different sectors of the global economy and environment, measuring everything from building electrification to use of coal in the power sector to global meat consumption.

Grimly, none of the indicators the report measures are where they need to be to keep the world on track to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Six of the 45 indicators are “off track”—progress is being made, but not fast enough—while almost 30 are “well off track,” meaning progress is much too slow. Five, meanwhile, are headed in the “wrong direction,” meaning the situation is getting worse, not better, and needs an urgent U-turn. (There's not enough data, the report says, to measure the remaining five indicators, which include peatland degradation and restoration, food waste, and the share of new buildings that are zero-carbon.)

One of the most consistently off-track markers, experts said, was the global effort to phase out coal, one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. While coal's share in global electricity generation did go down slightly in 2024, total coal use actually hit a record high last year thanks to growing electricity demand, especially from China and India. A dirty power grid, Schumer said, has “huge knock-on effects” for other progress indicators like decarbonizing buildings and transportation.

To get on track, the world needs to increase its pace of coal phaseout tenfold, Schumer said. That, she continued, would entail shutting down more than 360 medium-sized coal plants each year and canceling every coal-fired power plant currently in the global development pipeline.

“We simply will not limit warming to 1.5 degrees if coal use keeps breaking records,” Schumer said.'

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, points out that phasing out coal is also a net good for public health. Recent research estimated that pollutants from coal-fired power plants killed 460,000 Americans between 1999 and 2020.

“Coal is a killer especially in developing countries, but the health burden is immense even in countries like the US,” says Cleetus, who was not involved in the new report.

Meanwhile, the only indicator that was on track in the last installment of the report, which was published in 2023, has since taken a turn for the worse. In the last report, the share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales was a welcome silver lining; nearly one in every five new cars purchased in 2023 was an EV, a 35 percent increase from the year before. Compared to the fact that EVs were less than 1 percent of passenger car sales when the Paris Agreement was signed 10 years ago, that progress is truly impressive. But despite continuing runaway success in Chinese markets, where EVs account for almost half of all new passenger car purchases, sales in markets including the EU and the US slowed last year.

The backslide on electric vehicles surprised Laurens Speelman, who serves on the strategy team of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit that works on market-based climate solutions. (Speelman has been involved in crafting past versions of this report, but was not involved in the current iteration.) Despite the progress the world has seen since Paris, Speelman says, “the message that we're still not on track is really sobering, and a stark one.”

The news isn't all bad. Solar power is one of the big success stories of the current moment, with 33 percent more solar installed worldwide last year than in 2023. Much of that growth is, again, driven by China, which installed twice as much solar capacity in 2024 as the US has installed on the grid in total.

The report's authors also point to private climate finance—investments from banks, businesses, and other private entities—as another promising high point. This type of investment has increased so much since the last iteration of this report that it has been upgraded from “well off track” to “off track.” Public climate finance, though—money pledged from wealthier countries to developing ones to help them adapt to climate change and cope with damages—is still “well off track,” the report finds.

There is usually a barrage of reports measuring climate progress as the world moves toward the UN climate change conference, held annually in November. With the addition of the Paris anniversary in December, there's plenty of opportunity to take stock of where we are now. A report released last week sounded the alarm that the first climate “tipping point”—a group of ecological thresholds past which small changes can lead to cascading and catastrophic effects—has been reached, as the world's coral reefs are in the middle of a multi-year bleaching event. The World Meteorological Organization also said last week that CO2 levels increased by a record amount in 2024.

The US, meanwhile—which Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement for the second time in his career on his first day in office this year—seems eager to destroy as much climate progress as possible, both at home and abroad. In a scattered September speech to the UN General Assembly, the president called climate change a “con job,” attacking scientific predictions as “made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.”

The Trump administration is currently launching a full-scale attack on EVs, removing tax credits for buyers, and freezing funding allocated for building new charging stations. It's also attacking all forms of renewable energy; while it seems to reserve special animus for offshore wind, it's also pulling tax credits for clean energy buildouts while simultaneously boosting coal. The US does remain in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the treaty that provides the basis of the Paris Agreement—for now.

Speelman, who is based in Amsterdam, says he has no idea the impact a second Trump administration will have on this year's negotiations, which are taking place in Brazil. But he points to the massive international adoption of renewable energy, as laid out in the report, as a point of hope.

“There's a factor at play which is very different from a few years ago, which is that the economics are really behind a lot of different clean technologies,” he says. “It's simply good business to invest in renewable technologies, electrified grids, and electrification technologies and in energy efficiency.”

Cleetus sees what's happening in the US as part of a larger, more troubling pattern.

“Fossil fuel entities and their political allies continue to hold sway over countries' energy policies and are showing up at the international climate talks in ever larger numbers to directly interfere with the outcomes,” she says. “What's happening in the US is an especially acute and alarming example where the government is explicitly pushing a fossil fuel agenda, right down to spreading lies and disinformation about climate science.”

One of the first decisions hearing aid users have to make seems like a simple one: opt for a traditional behind-the-ear (BTE) device that represents the state of the art or an in-the-ear (ITE) offering that is more discreet. The latter seems like a no-brainer, but most ITE hearing aids have a major drawback: They don't offer the same level of audio fidelity as BTE hearing aids.

There are a lot of reasons for this, but much of it comes down to size: ITE hearing aids are smaller, so they don't have room for the electronics that BTE units can fit into the package. Also, since ITE aids are contained entirely within the ear canal, their microphones are less effective, trapped inside your skull instead of living freely next to it. Battery life can also be an issue with smaller ITE hearing aids, also due to size reasons. Phonak, one of the leading companies in prescription hearing aids, has been working hard to bring ITE aids up to parity with BTE models. With its Virto R Infinio, it goes a long way toward making that a reality.

The Infinio is easily Phonak's most advanced ITE model to date, in large part because it is exclusively available with custom-fit ear molds. Long available on studio monitors and a few luxe hearing aids, these molds have to be made by an audiologist who squirts goo into your ear and then extracts it once it becomes firm, maintaining the unique shape of the ear canal.

This mold is then used to create the shell for the Infinios, each of which arrives as a single, bespoke, Cronenbergian piece. That means you don't just get a snug, perfect fit: The snakelike ear-tip design also places the receiver as close to your eardrum as possible, theoretically maximizing its amplification.

This is a prescription-only product, and you'll have to visit a licensed audiologist to be fitted for one. In fact, two appointments will be required: One for the initial molding, the other to tune the hearing aids after they've been crafted, which takes about a week.

The Infinio is available in two basic designs, one “open” and one “closed.” The decision of which to opt for is similar to making the choice of ear tips on a standard hearing aid. (Note that the Infinio does not require or work with additional ear tips.) The open design has a vented channel running through it, which allows just a touch of ambient sound into the ear canal. The closed design, however, is exactly that. It seals off the ear completely, like an earplug. I tried both but quickly gravitated to the open offering; the closed hearing aids were too isolating—and overkill for someone with my more modest level of hearing loss—though users who frequently use their hearing aids for streaming may find the isolation to be a plus.

In the ear, the units fit incredibly snugly and look more like earplugs than earbuds, with nothing protruding from the ear except for a tiny retrieval wire. After a little practice, they become as easy to pop in and out as my favorite earbuds, locking into place with a little swivel. The units have only a single control button on the exterior face. This is used to power the units on or off and can also be used to accept or hang up on phone calls over Bluetooth. All remaining configurations, including volume adjustments, must be done in the myPhonak mobile app.

The hearing aids are outfitted with Phonak's latest processor and software, but the proof of quality really comes in the testing. Overall, quality was very good—though it was clearly short of top-tier BTE hearing aids from the likes of GN ReSound and Starkey.

Despite four default environmental programs, my audiologist encouraged me to leave them in Automatic mode as much as possible, and this was the right call. Audio was gently to moderately boosted in the frequencies where I needed it, echoes and feedback were nonexistent, and hiss was audible only if I cranked the volume up to uncomfortable levels. (Volume can be adjusted individually per ear if desired.)

I encountered an odd issue when watching TV, where high-pitched sounds (like squawking walkie-talkies) created an uncomfortable squeal. I also found this to be a slight problem with otherwise subtle high-pitched noises, namely the clicking of my mouse. Switching to the TV mode helped alleviate some of this, but I had to return to the audiologist a third time for another tweak to the high-frequency settings to temper it further. Note that all of the built-in environmental modes can be adjusted by the user, and Phonak can tweak frequency settings further in the office to help improve any additional outlying issues.

One issue Phonak can't fix is its baffling inclusion of a charging case that does not include a battery. The enormous case includes nifty magnetic attachments for the two hearing aids, which illuminate when charging—but none of that works if the case is not plugged in via its USB-C port. Phonak claims a maximum battery life of 30 hours (without Bluetooth streaming); however, I never achieved more than 23 hours in my tests. That's plenty for casual use, assuming you have the opportunity to charge your aids overnight, but heavy users who forget their cable on a weekend road trip may encounter trouble. I also found that the batteries drain slowly even when they're not in use, which could compound this issue.

On the plus side, the units are extremely comfortable, though I didn't really expect them to be, considering that the entire body is crafted from hard plastic. No padding inside the ear canal? Turns out it doesn't matter because the fit is so perfect. I was able to wear these hearing aids for hours on end without any discomfort or itchiness. At 2.28 grams each, they aren't the lightest ITE aids on the market (by far), but they're nonetheless largely unnoticeable, because nothing is jutting out of your ear and because they fit so well. In time, they effectively become just another part of your body.

Bluetooth streaming quality is considerably better than most hearing aids provide, with at least a nod toward including some bass in the mix. However, noise cancellation doesn't compare to what you'll find on top-shelf earbuds, so don't plan on using these to stream music while on the treadmill or on the plane. A hearing aid locator system is also included in the myPhonak app, which pinpoints the last known location of the devices on a map.

Naturally, as prescription hearing aids, the Infinio comes at a cost. Audiologists all set their own prices, but Phonak says $4,000 is about average. The quality is definitely better than cheaper over-the-counter options like the $1,000 Sony CRE-C20, but is it four times better? That's always an impossible question to answer in this industry—and since you can't really test-drive these hearing aids without getting a custom fit version first, perhaps even more impossible.

If your budget allows and you don't want the headaches of a behind-the-ear model, I recommend them highly.

Seattle is home to the full gamut of creative expression. Indie experimentalism thrives in the underbellies of Pioneer Square and Capitol Hill. Big-label productions curate their next blockbuster hit at Harbor Island Studios. This convergence of talented artists gives Seattle its unicorn-like creative scene with an economy that's worth the spotlight.

Peek behind the inner workings of Seattle's creative economy and you won't find Hollywood–esque commercialism. Instead, you'll be met with an authenticity that is grassroots and heartfelt. DIY stages and zines defined the grunge movement. Small theaters and galleries dot most Seattle neighborhoods, making for natural third spaces where community members connect and enjoy the arts. And festivals like Bumbershoot and Seattle International Film Festival operate heavily on a volunteer basis, ringing true to the city's identity as a community-driven entertainment industry. But it's not just volunteers that are powering the Emerald City's thriving creative economy. More than 52,000 professionals are employed in video games, film and publishing, music and fine arts, and architecture. Seattle's creative workforce drives 18% of the city's GDP. That's four times the national average. And the engine is predicted to keep gaining momentum. Seattle's creative economy is projected to grow 10% by 2028.

Kate Becker is one person who's driving the vision behind sustainable creative communities and cross-industry growth. Her role as King County's Creative Economy Director means she leads the development of public policy as it relates to the region's creative scene. Kate and her King County team are supported by the Executive's Film Advisory Board, a group of 15 film industry professionals advising on film initiative development, including Harbor Island Studios.

When Harbor Island Studios opened to film production crews, Kate knew the 117,000 sq. ft. facility was well-positioned to attract both state and national productions. Paramount Pictures, HBO, and Netflix have all leveraged the newly renovated space. And while Harbor Island Studios is well-positioned to sustain this national scale, Kate's focus is on local job creation and talent retention.

“We've really been targeting our locals to make sure that they have as much access and opportunity in the studio before big productions come in and block out the ability for our locals to be in there,” she said. Kate is also focused on developing sustainable film career ladders for Washingtonians, which is reinforced by the studio's sliding scale model. “What we really look for are local cast and crew hires, a diverse cast and crew, or an equity plan.” Kate said. “Green filmmaking practices and next gen opportunities” are all factors in how studio pricing is determined.

“We also partner with industry professionals and nonprofits to offer free classes like the Film Community Training Program, a hands-on experiential learning session held once a month. We have the 48 Hour Film Project, Seattle Composers Alliance, the Northwest Screenwriters Guild, a number of different opportunities for folks to convene and engage in learning and connection with the industry.” Kate said. Deepening the film industry support network is part of Kate's plan to bring local talent home. “We have a strong film education network here, but a lot of folks come out of a film program and decide they want to go to Los Angeles, Atlanta, or New York. And we want to keep that talent right here in King County.” As for the future of Seattle's creative economy, Kate sees ample opportunity on the horizon. “If we're all pulling together in the same direction, we're going to have more impact. Collective effort, working across different jurisdictions, different organizations, different businesses to achieve common goals, that's where our biggest opportunity is.”

Washington Filmworks is part of this movement founded on the idea that a rising tide lifts all boats. They host the Production Incentive Program, a statewide initiative to enhance the local film industry's competitiveness. And they did not come to play small ball, in 2022, the program funding increased from an annual $3.5 million to $15 million. Washington Filmworks supports creators even further with their B&O tax credit advantage, which allows businesses with a B&O tax liability to contribute cash to the Program funds. In return, these businesses receive a dollar-for-dollar credit on their B&O tax liability. Cash contributions funnel directly into a resource pool supporting homegrown film, television, and commercial productions.

Seattle's Office of Economic Development also nurtures the arts through their Creative Economy Program. The Program connects creative businesses and individuals with resources they need to thrive from film production office space to skill learning labs to professional development. The effort is made possible via a blend of partnerships with public and private stakeholders. The Seattle Film Commission is an advocacy group partnering with the Office of Economic Development to ensure policies are inclusive and equitable, especially for historically underrepresented people. The Commission works to ensure people are connected with livable wage jobs in the film industry.

And adults aren't the only ones the city has carved out support for. Community-driven efforts, like Seattle Children's Theater, run the Emerging Professionals Program, a decades-long initiative to develop the next generation of professionals. They offer a blend of hands-on tasks, assignments, and networking opportunities to anchor young artists' dreams in reality. TeenTix is another initiative aimed at centering ambitious youth on an accelerated path toward a life in the arts. Last year, TeenTix and the Seattle Office of Economic Development teamed up to form a powerhouse task force charged with exploring how youth programming can be better resourced and built for the long run.

Today's young minds are tomorrow's stewards of the iconic productions and venues that have shaped Seattle's culture and even influenced the national art scene. From grunge meccas like the Crocodile to Broadway-style theaters like the Paramount, history is embedded in the walls of Seattle's art institutions. Sub Pop and KEXP, the music giants delivering tasteful sounds all over the globe, are still rooted in their humble Emerald City beginnings. It's hard to walk a Seattle city block without stumbling on a landmark of artistic history. In a metropolitan area bursting at the seams with creative talent, it's no wonder the cultural identity is infused with song, music, dance, and countless other forms of human expression.

Game development is a cornerstone of greater Seattle's creative economy: industry heavyweights including Xbox Game Studios, Valve Corporation, U.S. Nintendo, Riot Games, and Bungie all call the area home. Indie studios like Harebrained Schemes also set up shop in the Seattle scene, perpetuating the city's proud DIY culture. The University of Washington, Seattle University Cornish College of the Arts, and DigiPen Institute of Technology are all local incubation hubs training the next generation of game designers and developers. Their specialized degree and certification programs breed the best and the brightest who go on to enjoy Seattle's playground of gaming culture and prosperity.

The music, film, game development, and arts communities don't exist in silos. Seattle's venues and production facilities often serve multiple industries, making their walls shared spaces where cross-industry innovation hums along like a well-oiled machine. Beyond the infrastructure, Seattle's thriving tech scene offers new ways for people to enjoy creative endeavors. Cloud computing revolutionizes music streaming. VR consoles transform live performances. These advancements are made possible by Seattle's arts and tech sectors blending of resources, knowledge, and talent. It's what puts Seattle on the map as an artistic ecosystem.

Other map-worthy creative economies, like Los Angeles, Vancouver, and Portland each have their own flavor of artistic legacy. Los Angeles is Hollywood ground zero. Portland's indie ethos is where the weird are welcome. And Vancouver B.C. is “Hollywood North”, a production powerhouse. Though these cities are titillating in their own right, what sets Seattle apart is that it sits at the crossroads of what all its sister cities embody. Technology, artistry, and community-driven work are Seattle's heartbeat. The ongoing work of Washington Filmworks and the opening of Harbor Island Studios means Seattle is regaining momentum toward being a national film production destination. Seattle is growing into its creative-tech hybrid britches in a way that promises bigger, better, and bolder innovation is on the horizon.

The path forward honors the same blueprint that got Seattle where it is today: investing in homegrown talent and providing the infrastructure for community-driven talent to thrive. Local initiatives and ongoing financial investments ensure there is and will continue to be something for all creative humans in King County.

Come get a taste for all Seattle has to offer at the fourth annual Cloudbreak Music Festival, happening this November 6th through 26th. This citywide music extravaganza is made possible by King County Creative Economy Office in partnership with Visit Seattle. This year's show features a lineup of 400 national and international artists with more than 20 participating venues. Learn more and purchase tickets by visiting cloudbreakmusicfest.org.

Hest, the Seattle-based maker of sleeping gear for outdoor enthusiasts, raised $2.7 million in Series A funding this month as the company sees continued growth.

The initial close was backed by existing investors — Ascend, Cascade Seed Fund, Alliance of Angels, and a number of Seattle-area angel investors — and Hest is opening the round to new investors with a final close later this year.

Founder and CEO Aaron Ambuske told GeekWire that Hest continues to experience significant growth with a 50% increase in sales this year. The startup expects to turn an operating profit for the first time.

Ambuske said the growth is driven by an expanded product line and an increase in sales at REI, where Hest is now in all stores. The company also has a partnership with electric vehicle maker Rivian.

The fresh cash will be used to support future growth opportunities.

“We are launching a new product category in 2026, expanding our partnership with Rivian and investing in new sales channels,” Ambuske said. “We recently launched in Japan and will continue to explore international options when they are a fit.”

He added that while tariffs imposed by the Trump administration “have been a lot to navigate,” over half of Hest's cost of goods and final assembly are in the U.S., so the company has been “slightly insulated from the turbulence.”

Ambuske, who spent 18 years at K2 Sports, launched Hest in 2019 to satisfy his desire to bring a more comfortable sleeping experience to car and tent campers.

Based in Seattle's Georgetown neighborhood, Hest opened its first showroom this summer. The company employs 10 people.

Silkline, a Seattle startup using AI to help advanced manufacturing companies manage their supply chains, raised $4 million in seed funding, the company announced Wednesday.

Founded in 2023, Silkline aims to reduce production delays by simplifying and lowering the cost of sourcing materials from multiple suppliers. AI-enabled requests for quotes and purchase orders are among its recently released features.

The fresh cash will help Silkline accelerate its development of AI-powered capabilities.

Silkline customers include manufacturers in aerospace, energy, defense and robotics, including Helion Energy (Everett, Wash.), Starfish Space (Tukwila), and Portal Space (Bothell).

In July, Silkline projected it would triple revenue in 2025. Since then, the company says revenue has grown fivefold year-over-year.

The company says its growth is being driven in part by a “network effect,” in which 20% of new customers are suppliers who received an RFQ generated by the Silkline platform.

“Supply chain teams in advanced manufacturing are struggling with missed production deadlines, RFQ to order management, and increasing demands from their customers,” Isaac Chambers, co-founder and CEO of Silkline, said in a statement. “This round of funding helps Silkline deliver more AI capabilities and reach further into the advanced manufacturing market so all modern hardware companies can experience a fully connected supply chain.”

Silkline currently employs five people.

The funding round was led by Origin Ventures with participation from Forward Deployed VC, 25madison, Matchstick Ventures, Barrel Ventures, and Plow Ventures.

Meta's chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday that the company will cut about 600 jobs from its superintelligence lab, according to a report from Axios.

Meta declined to comment, but told TechCrunch that Axios' reporting is accurate.

As Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other companies race to build the most powerful AI systems, Meta had a busy summer on the hiring front. The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI's] best people” took the offers.

“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff.

This line of thinking tracks with Meta's recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company's mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.”

Now, it seems that Meta isn't lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta.

Justin Wenig remembers his days at Y Combinator in 2019. 

Back then, he was working with his first startup, Coursedog, which looked to provide more modern tools to higher educational facilities, including those that work with state departments. He learned quickly that his peers didn't like working with the public sector — too much bureaucracy.

Even finding out basic information, like what a school district purchased in the past year, required a lot of paperwork.

“Out of hundreds of startups, only a handful of us were trying to modernize how government and education worked,” Wenig told TechCrunch. “Investors thought it was too slow, too bureaucratic, too hard to scale. And to be fair, they weren't wrong. Selling to the public sector was painful.”

He sold Coursedog in 2021 for nine-figures to JMI Equity and remains on the board. In 2024, he launched Starbridge a platform that helps business sales teams monitor opportunities in the public sector so they can then take action, such as submitting proposals or drafting bids for grants and budgets. On Wednesday, Starbridge announced a $42 million Series A led by David Sacks' firm Craft Ventures.

Wenig said the greatest challenges in public sector is that data is fragmented and inaccessible.

“Critical buying information is scattered across PDFs, agency websites, meeting minutes, and outdated directories,” he said, adding that vendors spend hours trying to piece together who to contact and other insights.

Starbridge pulls public web data sources from such sources and puts the information in one place. The sales team using the platform can see a ranked scoring, courtesey of Starbridge, of which public sector accounts are most likely to purchase new technology, and see updates like leadership changes or new initiatives.

“Instead of chasing noise, our customers have a clear, data-backed view of where to focus and when to act,” he said. 

Wenig described his fundraising journey as “fun,” and said the company met Craft through a friend. Others in the Series A round include Owl Ventures, CommonWeal Ventures, and Autotech Ventures. The company has raised $52 million to date, after previously raising a $10 million seed. 

Next, the startup plans to launch “Starbridge integrated experience,” so users do not have to always go to the Starbridge platform to use its technology.

“Every competitor goes right to your CRM, every question about an account can be answered right from a slackbot, every job change loads right into your sequencer,” Wenig said.

Others in this space include GovWin and GovSpend. Starbridge said its different because it has built AI workflows on top of the datasets to make it easier for sales teams to use.

He remembers back when he was fundraising for Coursedog. “No VC was interested in talking to us,” he said. But now, in the AI, era, the tides are shifting, he said.

“Maybe nobody wants to run for office anymore, but they do want to build,” he continued. “Seeing this new wave of mission-driven founders tackling real, systemic challenges makes me incredibly hopeful for the future.”

Ask any salesperson how much information they'd like on a prospective customer and you'll never hear the end of it. That's the premise driving the crowded sales intelligence market, which today has services that can do everything from helping to identify prospects and surface background about them, to even writing the pitch and performing autonomous follow-ups.

But sales teams need more than data; they want context. Sumble, a startup out of San Francisco, is trying to provide that context by trawling the web across social media, job boards, company sites, regulatory filings and so on, to surface information about what's happening inside companies.

The brainchild of Anthony Goldbloom and Ben Hamner, the founders of data science and machine learning community Kaggle, Sumble uses a knowledge graph underpinned by large language models to connect the various data points it gathers. The result, Goldbloom told TechCrunch, is a comprehensive view of a company's technographic data — which tools are used in which departments, any projects being launched or run, its organizational chart, what tech a company might be looking to adopt, and crucially, who to contact.

But given how crowded this market already is, from incumbents to myriad AI sales development reps agents, the question is: does the world really need more?

Goldbloom believes so, and says the startup's approach seems to be working: He told TechCrunch that since the startup launched in April 2024, it's signed 19 enterprise customers, including Snowflake, Figma, Wiz, Vercel and Elastic, and it has tens of thousands of users in total. About 30% of its users pay for a Pro subscription (either themselves or their company does) and so far, growth has been driven by word of mouth. The startup declined to share details of its revenue, but we understand revenue increased by 550% year-over-year.

 “What tends to happen is, we go viral inside a company,” Goldbloom said. “We'll go from 1 to 500 MAUs [monthly active users] in a company over a six-month period. And the way the spread happens is normally within a Slack channel, then within a single team, then within an office, and then within that company.”

Goldbloom said traction, the quality of customers, and strong customer retention played a big role in catching investors' attention. The startup on Wednesday emerged from stealth with $38.5 million in funding — Coatue led an $8.5 million seed round, while Canaan Partners led a $30 million Series A. AIX Ventures, Square Peg, Bloomberg Beta, Zetta, and angel investors, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, also invested.

Notably, Sumble's co-founders have attracted investors they're quite familiar with. Rich Boyle, currently a general partner at Canaan, was a board observer at Kaggle, while Bloomberg Beta and Zetta also were on Kaggle's cap table. And Goldbloom co-founded AIX Ventures and is an investment partner, though he told TechCrunch he'd “stepped out of the room” when the firm considered the investment in Sumble.

Still, Sumble faces a lot of competition. Challengers include Apollo.io, Slintel, SalesLoft, Cognism, Reply.io, ZoomInfo, HubSpot and Outreach, among others who deliver either more focused point solutions or all-in-one sales IT toolkits. And since Sumble currently uses publicly available data, there's little to stop others from doing what it does currently.

Goldbloom, however, is confident that Sumble's moat is deeper than it looks at first sight, thanks to how its knowledge graph is structured, covering about 2.6 million companies around the world.

“The way we think about it is, the more data that we add into the knowledge graph, the richer the corpus will be. We view the richness of the knowledge graph as a massive source of defensibility,” he said.

Sumble is also counting on the continued adoption of large language models to help it continue to scale as it expects to see people using AI along with its service. “The way we structure our data is so the knowledge graph is and always will be very query-able by large language models […] The idea being that you can ask ChatGPT about the Apple text stack, or you can ask ChatGPT about the Apple tech stack grounded by our data,” Goldbloom said.

“We think AI is going to change the data vendor landscape a lot such that having a knowledge graph structure as a way to feed context into the large language model is going to be a key part of the LLM ecosystem,” he added.

The service is currently offered as a web app and via an API, and there's also a paid plan that offers more features like integrations into workflows and CRMs, as well as notifications when a development at a prospect may be of interest.

It's common for people to open a short video, thinking they'll just watch the one — then realize they're still on the app an hour later. YouTube is adding a new timer feature to help users manage this behavior, a move that reflects both growing public pressure on tech platforms and the company's interest in fostering long-term engagement rather than risking user burnout.

Users can set a daily time limit for Shorts viewing through the app's settings. Once they reach their limit, they see a pop-up notifying them that scrolling on the Shorts feeds is paused — though the pop-up is dismissible.

Earlier this year, after Android Authority spotted the feature in development in one of the Android APKs (app files), YouTube confirmed it was exploring the time-limit feature for Shorts consumption.

YouTube notes that the limit is currently not integrated with parental controls, meaning parents or guardians can't just set a specific limit on how much their kids scroll the Shorts feed. However, the company says parental controls are coming next year, when children won't be able to dismiss their prompts.

In the past, YouTube has rolled out digital well-being features, including “take a break” and “bedtime” reminders to curb users' doomscrolling habits. 

With “Take a Break,” for example, users can set a reminder to appear every 15, 30, 60, 90 or 180 minutes, at which point the video will pause. Users can then choose to dismiss the reminder and keep watching, or close the app.

Similarly, with its bedtime reminder feature, users set a specific time window (start and end time) when they want to be reminded to stop watching and go to bed. When that bedtime arrives, YouTube shows a notification reminding them to stop watching.

While features like these help demonstrate corporate responsibility, their optional nature means they may not actually reduce engagement, allowing YouTube to address concerns about addictive design while maintaining its core business model.

Right now, according to a recent Bloomberg Law report, nearly 2,000 lawsuits are pending in the U.S. against social media companies, with families, school districts, and state attorneys general alleging that platforms have intentionally designed addictive features that harm children's mental health.

Treasure Island - pure gold. Kidnapped - gold.I recall in the introduction to one of them he explains he wrote these stories for boys. Adventure, danger, fun characters. If you have sons you'll know there is a certain aesthetic young boy love and these books deliver it.I also was amazed how much I enjoyed his books for adults, like the one about being on a ship as a kid (can't find the name).If you look into his biography you find some really hard things that I guess he transformed into writing.

Reminded me immediately of Montehomo, the Hawks Claw, chief of the ever-victorious.> At night, when the boys had gone to bed, the girls crept to their bedroom door, and listened to what they were saying. Ah, what they discovered! The boys were planning to run away to America to dig for gold: they had everything ready for the journey, a pistol, two knives, biscuits, a burning glass to serve instead of matches, a compass, and four roubles in cash. They learned that the boys would have to walk some thousands of miles, and would have to fight tigers and savages on the road: then they would get gold and ivory, slay their enemies, become pirates, drink gin, and finally marry beautiful maidens, and make a plantation.https://americanliterature.com/author/anton-chekhov/short-st...(Stretching the meaning of ""American"" literature there, and not a great translation, just the first I found)

Like, the author can write whatever they want. Let them use a slur in their title if that's what they are going to do. But on HN should slurs be copied exactly? Should they be edited in some way? (E.g. ""G*psy"", ""G[slur]"" etc) Does it matter what slur it is (presumably some are more offensive?)Maybe the right thing to do is still post whatever the author titled their piece?

But in fact it seems to be the term used by some Romani groups> The term Gypsy, which originates in the word ""Egypt"", mistakenly believed to be the original homeland of the Gypsies, has been controversial.[8] Some Romani activists reject the term, but it is embraced by others.[8] Although the term ""Roma"" was endorsed in place of ""Gypsies"" at the first World Roma Congress in London,[9] many Romani people in Britain prefer to call themselves Gypsies, or names that include the term such as Romani Gypsies or Romany Gypsies.[10][11][5][12][8][13] They also commonly refer to themselves as Romani or Romanies.[14](from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy,_Roma_and_Traveller)I believe (but can't find a clear source) that there are also Native American groups that prefer to be called Indian. This is a close analogy Egypt <-> Romani, India <-> Native Americans.But it is true that many people only recently stopped using ""gypped"" as a slur. My kid was reading A Wrinkle in Time and looking for vocabulary words the other day, and I had to tell her that ""gypped"" was probably not appropriate for her homework and that we don't use that word anymore. So that's one reason to be aware that ""Gypsy"" is controversial. In my experience, many people are not aware of this fact at all because it so rarely comes up.

I'm inclined to think the author is aware of modern preferences, and that Stevenson's family may have referenced themselves this way.

In the US there are “Gypsy” and “Irish Travellers,” with the latter being a specific subset like Roma, and even then I've only heard the term used regionally, e.g. in Augusta, SC where a population lives.

It's also a bad editorial decision. Here we are debating the headline and not even talking about the article.

Both typical around these parts.I suspect the author or publisher may have chosen the name of the book for that attention-drawing controversiality. RLS was not the healthiest author and partly 'wandered' in search of better prospects than those of Old Blighty.

I for instance never had heard anything negative about the word ""gypsy"" so didn't get a feeling of the term being crass.

reply

Offense is not some Boolean, and intent matters in determining how offense something is.For example, a kid reading Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn might unknowingly repeat a word they learned from that book that we consider extremely offensive today. We'd probably all pause that conversation and explain that they should not use that word.Ideally, most folks upon learning that a word is offensive go, ""oh, apologies, I had no idea"" and the other party goes, ""No problem, now you know"" and everyone moves on. Doesn't have to escalate, doesn't need to be bigger than that.

It's pretty unclear to me where this stands right now.

I'm just not sure if that level has been precisely defined.

No, they haven't consistently “ruled against AI generated content”.In fact, very few cases involving AI generated content or generative AI systems have made it past preliminary stages, and the rulings that have been reached, preliminary and otherwise, are a mixed bag.

Not only is the answer to that no, you have no guarantee that it isn't someone else's copyright. The EU AI Act states that AI providers have to make sure that the output of AI isn't infringing on the source copyright, but I wouldn't trust any one of them bar Mistral to actually do that.

You're brushing up against some of the reasons why I am pretty sure policies like this will be futile. They may not diminish in popularity but they will be largely unenforceable. They may serve as an excuse for rejecting poor quality code or code that doesn't fit the existing conventions/patterns but did maintainers need a new reason to reject those PRs?How does one show that no assistive technologies below some threshold were used?

Can it really? ""You submitted LLM-generated contributions"" is also highly subjective.

For the rewards part: again, the companies who don't have a shit won't incentivise white hat pentesting. If a company has a security hole that leads to disclosure of sensitive information, it should be fined, and such fines can be used for rewards.This creates an actual market for penetration testing that includes more than just the handful of big tech companies willing to participate. It also puts companies legally on the hook for issues before a security disaster occurs, not after it's already happened.

Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcomes.We really need to make security liabilities to be just that: liabilities. If you are running 20+ year-old code, and you get hacked, you need to be fined in a way that will make you reconsider security as a priority.Also, you need to be liable for all of the disruption that the security breach caused for customers. No, free credit monitoring does not count as recompense.

Reading the actual CIRCL library source and README on GitHub: https://github.com/cloudflare/circl makes me see it as just fundamentally unserious, though; there's a big ""lol don't use this!"" disclaimer and no elaboration about considerations applied to each implementation to avoid common pitfalls, mention of third or first-party audit reports, or really anything I'd expect to see from a cryptography library.

After that, any CVE opened by a member of the public, and subsequently confirmed by a third party neutral auditor/pentester, would result in 1) fines to Cloudflare, 2) award to the CVE opener, and 3) give grounds to Cloudflare to sue their initial auditor.But that's just a mental experiment.

The problem is not with these papers (or at least not ones like this one) but how they are reported. If quantum computing is going to suceed it needs to do the baby steps before it can do the big steps, and at the current rate the big leaps are probably decades away. There is nothing wrong with that, its a hard problem and its going to take time.

No amount of software fixes can update this. In theory once an attack becomes feasible on the horizon they could update to post-quantum encryption and offer the ability to transfer from old-style addresses to new-style addresses, but this would be a herculean effort for everyone involved and would require all holders (not miners) to actively update their wallets. Basically infeasible.Fortunately this will never actually happen. It's way more likely that ECDSA is broken by mundane means (better stochastic approaches most likely) than quantum computing being a factor.

The new experiment generates the same result every time you run it (after a small amount of averaging). It also involves running a much more structured circuit (as opposed to a random circuit), so all-in-all, the result is much more 'under control.'As a cherry on top, the output has some connection to molecular spectroscopy. It still isn't that useful at this scale, but it is much more like the kind of thing you would hope to use a quantum computer for someday (and certainly more useful than generating random bitstrings).

""Quantum verifiability means the result can be repeated on our quantum computer — or any other of the same caliber — to get the same answer, confirming the result.""The results on our quantum computer matched those of traditional NMR, and revealed information not usually available from NMR, which is a crucial validation of our approach.""It certainly seems like this time, there finally is a real advantage?

So basically you're able to go directly from running the quantum experiment to being able to simulate the dynamics of the underlying system, because the Jacobian and Hessian are the first and second partial derivatives of the system with respect to all of its parameters in matrix form.

The problem is that the stringent production standards that would be required to make raw milk ""safe"" are incompatible with factory production and the profit motive.

Luckily, science can quantify those potentials and determine when the reward outweighs the risks.If we, as a country, decided to let people who drank unpasteurized milk or untreated water to die without burdening the medical system, it would truly be their own choice.  Once a society decides it will care for those people at a cost to the general public, it becomes necessary to protect the public from the burden of their ignorance.

RFK, Jr.'s assessment of medical evidence is bad, and he doesn't seem to have spent a second on ending public advertising of prescription drugs. I personally don't like him and have never liked him. But also, medical evidence is bad and wrong, the modern anti-vax movement was started by the low standards of The Lancet, and big pharma really does run our media (through that advertising) and consistently suborns all medical research.Watching that fake Alzheimer's drug get repeatedly reintroduced as a miracle for a change of 1.5 questions on a subjective checklist, even after a bunch of experts at the FDA who had a moral center quit over it, was depressing. Putting this quack rich kid at the head of the agency will at least have some effect on it other than the effect of big pharma cash.I think the proof for the effectiveness of the MMR and HPV vaccines is indisputable. I also think that big pharma lobbying for vaccine indemnification against lawsuits, and the consequent explosion in the number of vaccines, was an opportunity to push a lot of stuff in that the ""science"" defenders never seem to bring up. They always defend the entire class of ""vaccines,"" and avoid the harder to defend specifics. This is something you have to be paid to do, because it is a deliberate rhetorical distraction.Also, the classes of drugs that make the most money (not vaccines) have the least evidence of effect. Not just the real evidence, but even the claimed effects are tiny and take a bunch of suspicious math to find. This is a sign of a system that runs on corruption. Not that you need signs, because the companies are making direct payments. Just like we legalized bribery in our politics, we normalized bribery in medical literature, practice, and journalism.[*] like Ioannidis taught us before he got canceled for being more right (or at the worst equally wrong in the other direction) about covid than everyone else. Remember when HN worshiped the science, rather than ""the science,"" and posted every Ioannidis paper?

I also think that big pharma lobbying for vaccine indemnification against lawsuits, and the consequent explosion in the number of vaccines, was an opportunity to push a lot of stuff in that the ""science"" defenders never seem to bring up. They always defend the entire class of ""vaccines,"" and avoid the harder to defend specifics. This is something you have to be paid to do, because it is a deliberate rhetorical distraction.Also, the classes of drugs that make the most money (not vaccines) have the least evidence of effect. Not just the real evidence, but even the claimed effects are tiny and take a bunch of suspicious math to find. This is a sign of a system that runs on corruption. Not that you need signs, because the companies are making direct payments. Just like we legalized bribery in our politics, we normalized bribery in medical literature, practice, and journalism.[*] like Ioannidis taught us before he got canceled for being more right (or at the worst equally wrong in the other direction) about covid than everyone else. Remember when HN worshiped the science, rather than ""the science,"" and posted every Ioannidis paper?

Nyalleng Moorosi is part of a movement aimed at involving more African voices in AI policymaking.

It's late August in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, and people are filling a large hall at one of Africa's biggest gatherings of minds in AI and machine learning. The room is draped in white curtains, and a giant screen blinks with videos created with generative AI. A classic East African folk song by the Tanzanian singer Saida Karoli plays loudly on the speakers.

Friends greet each other as waiters serve arrowroot crisps and sugary mocktails. A man and a woman wearing leopard skins atop their clothes sip beer and chat; many women are in handwoven Ethiopian garb with red, yellow, and green embroidery. The crowd teems with life. “The best thing about the Indaba is always the parties,” computer scientist Nyalleng Moorosi tells me. Indaba means “gathering” in Zulu, and Deep Learning Indaba, where we're meeting, is an annual AI conference where Africans present their research and technologies they've built.

Moorosi is a senior researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute and has dropped in for the occasion from the mountain kingdom of Lesotho. Dressed in her signature “Mama Africa” headwrap, she makes her way through the crowded hall. 

Moments later, a cheerful set of Nigerian music begins to play over the speakers. Spontaneously, people pop up and gather around the stage, waving flags of many African nations. Moorosi laughs as she watches. “The vibe at the Indaba—the community spirit—is really strong,” she says, clapping.

Moorosi is one of the founding members of the Deep Learning Indaba, which began in 2017 from a nucleus of 300 people gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Since then, the event has expanded into a prestigious pan-African movement with local chapters in 50 countries.

This year, nearly 3,000 people applied to join the Indaba; about 1,300 were accepted. They hail primarily from English-speaking African countries, but this year I noticed a new influx from Chad, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan. 

Moorosi tells me that the main “prize” for many attendees is to be hired by a tech company or accepted into a PhD program. Indeed, the organizations I've seen at the event include Microsoft Research's AI for Good Lab, Google, the Mastercard Foundation, and the Mila–Quebec AI Institute. But she hopes to see more homegrown ventures create opportunities within Africa.

That evening, before the dinner, we'd both attended a panel on AI policy in Africa. Experts discussed AI governance and called for those developing national AI strategies to seek more community engagement. People raised their hands to ask how young Africans could access high-level discussions on AI policy, and whether Africa's continental AI strategy was being shaped by outsiders. Later, in conversation, Moorosi told me she'd like to see more African priorities (such as African Union–backed labor protections, mineral rights, or safeguards against exploitation) reflected in such strategies. 

On the last day of the Indaba, I ask Moorosi about her dreams for the future of AI in Africa. “I dream of African industries adopting African-built AI products,” she says, after a long moment. “We really need to show our work to the world.”

If you think scrolling the internet all day is making you dumber, just imagine what it's doing to large language models that consume a near-endless stream of absolute trash crawled from the web in the name of “training.” A research team recently proposed and tested a theory called “LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis,” which posited that the more junk data is fed into an AI model, the worse its outputs would become. Turns out that is a pretty solid theory, as a preprint paper published to arXiv by the team shows “brain rot” impacts LLMs and results in non-trivial cognitive declines.

To see how LLMs perform on a steady diet of internet sewage, researchers from Texas A&M University, University of Texas at Austin, and Purdue University identified two types of “junk” data: short social media posts that have lots of engagement, including likes and reposts, and longer content with clickbait headlines, sensationalized presentation, and a superficial level of actual information. Basically, the same type of content that is also rotting out our own brains. With that in mind, the researchers scraped together a sample of one million posts on X and then trained four different LLMs on varying mixtures of control data and junk data to see how it would affect performance.

And wouldn't you know it, it turns out that consuming directly from the internet landfill that is X isn't great for thinking clearly. All four models tested—Llama3 8B, Qwen2.5 7B/0.5B, Qwen3 4B—showed some forms of cognitive decline. Meta's Llama proved the most sensitive to the junk, seeing drops in its reasoning capabilities, understanding of context, and adherence to safety standards. Interestingly, a much smaller model, Qwen 3 4B, proved more resilient, though still suffered declines. It also found that the higher the rates of bad data, the more likely a model was to slip into “no thinking” mode, failing to provide any reasoning for its answer, which was more likely to be inaccurate.

More than just getting “dumber” in its thinking, though, the researchers found the inclusion of junk also resulted in an interesting effect: it led to changes in the model's “personality,” succumbing to what the researchers called “dark traits.” For instance, the Llama 3 model displayed significantly higher levels of narcissism and became less agreeable. It also went from displaying nearly no signs of psychopathy to extremely high rates of the behavior.

Interestingly, the researchers also found that mitigation techniques done to try to minimize the impact of the junk data couldn't fully reverse the harm of bad information. As a result, the researchers warn that the process of crawling the web for any and all data may not actually produce better results for LLMs, as the volume of information does not equate to quality. They suggest more careful curation could be necessary to address these potential harms, as there may not be any going back once you feed the model garbage. Apparently, for LLMs, the “you are what you eat” rule applies.

At long last, Samsung has fully unveiled Project Moohan, its rebuttal to the Apple Vision Pro, which we can now officially call the Galaxy XR. The headset wasn't exactly under wraps to this point, given the fact that it was initially shown off in January of this year, but we now have all of the details, including the one major thing we were dying to know: the price. Without further ado: Samsung's Galaxy XR headset costs *drum roll* $1,800…

That is, as you may have noticed, quite a bit of money to spend on a headset. It is cheaper (about half the price) than the Vision Pro with M5, which still costs $3,500. It's also $300 more expensive than the first “Pro” headset to make major splashes with its price, the Meta Quest Pro. As a refresher, that short-lived headset debuted at $1,500 in 2022, which caused a major uproar at the time. While that's a lot of money to pay for a headset, Samsung is at least offering a Vision Pro-like experience on paper, so I guess (based on Apple's absurd pricing) it's technically a discount? Kind of?

See Galaxy XR Headset at Samsung

The Galaxy XR's display is, like the Vision Pro, micro-OLED and clocks in at a resolution of 3,552 x 3,840 pixels per eye. That's comparable to the Vision Pro, which has a resolution of 3,660 x 3,200 pixels per eye. The Galaxy XR headset will top out at 90Hz with a 72Hz default, while Apple's Vision Pro with M5 brings a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. For reference, the original Vision Pro (with M2 chip) topped out at 100Hz and had a 90Hz standard refresh rate.

In addition to the premium display, the Galaxy XR headset also has a similar UI to the Vision Pro that is centered on hand and eye tracking, allowing you to pinch and grab things in virtual space without a controller. To enable that Vision Pro-esque UI, which is built on Android XR in collaboration with Google and Qualcomm, there are two hi-res cameras for passthrough, six outward-facing cameras devoted just to tracking, four inward-facing cameras for eye tracking, and a depth sensor. All of that should deliver an experience that feels similar to the Vision Pro, but if you do want a more traditional controller-based experience, you can go ahead and purchase controllers for an additional… $250. If you're thinking, “Jeez, that brings the price to more than $2,000!” I'm here to tell you that your math is unfortunately correct.

In the battery department, you'll also find near-parity. Samsung says the Galaxy XR headset is rated for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours for video playback, while the newest Vision Pro with M5 chip is rated for 2.5 hours of general use and 3 hours for video playback. Both headsets use an external battery pack to help alleviate the weight from your face. Samsung's Galaxy XR is naturally powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2, which is Qualcomm's newest XR chip.

But enough about hardware for now. You're probably wondering what it is you can even do with this headset, and on that front, there are even more Vision Pro similarities. Samsung says Android XR is built for all sorts of standard XR stuff, including gaming and immersive sports, and can also “spatialize” 2D videos so that they can be watched in 3D on the headset. Given the close collaboration with Google, there's also a noticeable dose of Gemini here. Samsung says that the Galaxy XR headset will feature a Gemini gaming coach and Gemini-powered features like Circle to Search.

There will also be a few Google services that Samsung says are optimized for XR, including Google Photos, YouTube, and my personal favorite… Google Maps. I have no idea who is going to strap on a headset to use Google Maps, but Google has been building out Immersive View in Google Maps, which could be kind of cool to experience in XR, so I will suspend my disbelief until I try Google Maps in Android XR for myself.

One area that I'm very curious whether Samsung will pull away in is comfort. Probably my biggest complaint about the Vision Pro is that it's very heavy, and after long periods of use, it can really start to feel uncomfortable on your head and nose. The latest Vision Pro with M5 chip tries to combat that with a new headstrap with better counterbalances, but the Galaxy XR headset still has the Vision Pro beat in the weight department. According to Samsung, the Galaxy XR weighs 545g, while the latest Vision Pro with M5 weighs between 750 to 800g. A lot of the comfort does come down to how weight is distributed, so no winner can be decided on numerics alone.

On paper, Samsung's Galaxy XR sounds very similar to the Vision Pro, which could be a bad thing, but when you consider the huge difference in price, $1,800 looks a lot more palatable—especially when you consider headsets are still more of a toy than anything. If you're eager to get your hands and your face on Samsung's first headset, you can buy the Galaxy XR now on Samsung.com or in Samsung Experience Stores. Samsung is also offering 24-month financing, while Samsung Experience Stores are offering both 12- or 24-month financing options if the $1,800 price tag is too much in one sitting.

Netflix reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and revenue was $11.51 billion—slightly below Bloomberg's forecast of $11.52 billion. Earnings per share were $5.87, below an estimate of $6.94. (All of this is per Yahoo! Finance). Not catastrophic, but not great. The company's stock price went down by 5.6%.

But hey, how about all that AI?

In its shareholder letter, and then again in its earnings call, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters touted coming generative AI implementation as an exciting new development across content generation, user experience, and in advertising. All the AI talk made it feel like it was 2023 again.

To illustrate how much AI seems to be on the CEOs' minds, at 26 minutes and 34 seconds into the earnings call, Peters gives an answer in which he rattles off what seems to be an ad-hoc list of six challenges Netflix faces as a company, starting with creating TV and movies around the world. Implementing AI is the second item he mentions.

The shareholder letter kicked off the topic of AI with what is actually a pretty big truth bomb: “For many years now, ML and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology.” That's truer than you might think. All the way back in 2008, Netflix found a genuinely fun way to publicize its use of machine learning: by asking the public to figure out why some people like Napoleon Dynamite and others don't, with math.

Much has changed since those days, and now Netflix says it's shoehorning AI features into Netflix wherever it can. For instance, the earnings letter says a beta test is ongoing that adds a “conversational search” function, helping people “discover the perfect title for that moment.” The goal here sounds easy enough to picture without speculating too wildly. I can picture saying “What's a movie to watch with my mom on her 50th birthday?” into a Roku remote and getting a list of recs.

On the techical side, Netflix says there's an effort afoot to use AI to “localize” (which basically means “translate”) promotional assets into other languages and regions, which sounds like it could theoretically allow relevant—but obscure and foreign—movies and TV that I might love to come to me, even without readily available artwork and summaries in my language. Theoretically anyway.

But most of all, Netflix says it will be “empowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions.” For instance, the letter boasts that AI de-aging was used in Happy Gilmore 2, and that the producers of Billionaires' Bunker used Generative AI tools for concept art.

But how does Netflix regard Sora 2, the video generator that plunged the internet into copyright hell upon its release last month? Sarandos, for his part, is not telegraphing some kind of rapid slopification at Netflix—and he hastens to add that he's not intimidated by Sora 2 currently. According to Sarandos, “it's likely to have a lot more impact on UGC creators the most in the near term. In other words, AI content replacing viewing of existing user-generated content. That starts to make sense.”

It's worth noting that Sarandos is already trying to convince influencers to leave YouTube. If you're a YouTuber who hasn't already agreed to a Netflix deal, and you're worried that Sora 2 is coming to eat your lunch, Sarandos' suggestion that your business model is more vulnerable than his could be part of an effort to win you over.

But Sarandos says AI “doesn't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not.” For once a tech CEO talking about AI doesn't sound like he's sharpening his layoffs ax. “We're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster, and in new ways,” Sarandos said, adding, “We're all in on that.”

While graying hair might feel like just one more unpleasant symptom of aging, new research reveals that it may actually be the result of a biological process that defends against cancer risk.

In a study led by the University of Tokyo and published earlier this month in the journal Nature Cell Biology, researchers used lab mice to investigate how a type of stem cell reacts to DNA damage, revealing a connection between hair graying and a form of skin cancer called melanoma.

Our body's cells are continuously faced with internal and environmental agents that can cause DNA damage, which plays a role in both aging and cancer. Scientists have struggled to pin down the specifics of this role, especially how damaged stem cells impact tissue health in the long term.

Stem cells are cells that can self-renew (make more of themselves) and differentiate (turn into other cells). Within this context, the team specifically analyzed melanocyte stem cells (McSCs)—stem cells that produce mature melanocytes, pigment-producing cells that give color to hair and skin. In mammals, McSCs live in hair follicles in the form of immature melanoblasts (melanocytes' precursors), where they perpetuate pigmentation.

The researchers found that, in response to DNA double-strand breaks, McSCs permanently differentiate and are then lost, which results in graying—a process called seno-differentiation. However, when McSCs come into contact with some carcinogens, they maintain their ability to self-renew and expand clonally. Simply put, they avoid seno-differentiation even when DNA is damaged, pushing McSCs “toward a tumor-prone fate,” according to a University of Tokyo statement.

“These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates—exhaustion or expansion—depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals,” Emi Nishimura, lead author of the study and a biologist at the University of Tokyo, said in the statement. “It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses.”

In other words, both results may come from how McSCs react to DNA damage, when they can go one of two ways—differentiate and leave the system (which leads to graying) or carry on dividing, where the persistence of damaged McSCs could ultimately result in a tumor.

While the researchers emphasize that their research does not indicate that graying hair prevents cancer, it does suggest seno-differentiation to be a protective pathway triggered by stress that does away with possibly detrimental cells.

“McSC fate tracking in mice revealed that McSCs undergo cellular senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation) in response to DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in their selective depletion and hair graying, and effectively protecting against melanoma,” the researchers explained in the study.

So next time you or an older family member complains about their gray hair—remember that it might be a trait that naturally protects against cancer.

Everything we've seen from the new show from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul mastermind Vince Gilligan has been a mystery—from cryptic teasers to an ominous conversation with the President himself, all we've really gotten a flavor of so far is that something has gone very, very wrong with the world, save for one woman (Carol, played by longtime Gilligan collaborator Rhea Seehorn). Now, we know a little more, and it's only getting creepier.

Ahead of its launch in a few weeks, Apple TV has launched the first full trailer for Pluribus, giving us a slightly better picture of its strange world where everyone in the world is blissfully happy, save for seemingly just author Carol Sturka. Carol is rightfully freaked out, and not just because of the rest of humanity's sudden positivity, but because humanity is seemingly ardent in figuring out how she can join the rest of them at any cost.

It's not just the blindingly optimistic, almost zombified happy people that are giving the creep factor, though. This new trailer gives us a better look at the wider world around Carol, and it seems like whatever's happened in the world to turn the rest of humanity this way, there was a major disaster beforehand—ambulances everywhere, cities and vehicles on fire, dead bodies; they're all slowly but surely being cleaned up by cheerily marching hordes of people. People who then still stop at nothing but to acknowledge Carol and her difference the second she's in public.

It's a great vibe, and even with showing us much more of the show than we've seen already, it still barely gives anything away—and has us dying to see more of what Gilligan has cooking.

Pluribus hits Apple TV from November 7, kicking off with a two-episode premiere.

For some reason, the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive's well-known web snapshotting operation, appears to be enduring a recession of sorts. The project, which relies on web crawlers to catalog changes to a vast number of sites on the web, has been a staple of the internet age, and a key way to conduct research—journalistic or otherwise. Unfortunately, a new report from Niemen Lab claims that the Wayback Machine's snapshots of news media websites have been “plummeting” in recent months. Indeed, the outlet reports:

Between January 1 and May 15, 2025, the Wayback Machine shows a total of 1.2 million snapshots collected from 100 major news sites' homepages. Between May 17 and October 1, 2025, it shows 148,628 snapshots from those same 100 sites — a decline of 87%. (You can see our data here.)

Mark Graham, the director of the Wayback Machine, confirmed to the outlet that there had been “a breakdown in some specific archiving projects in May that caused less archives to be created for some sites.” However, Graham added that some of websites had been archived but that it just wasn't showing up on the website yet. “Some material we had archived post-May 16th of this year is not yet available via the Wayback Machine as their corresponding indexes have not yet been built,” he added.

Why is this breakdown occurring? That's the big question, and it's one the story doesn't really answer. Graham apparently told Niemen that “various operational reasons” involving “resource allocation” has spurred the delay in showing some archived material, but apparently didn't get any more specific than that. Graham also reportedly claimed that the cause of the archiving “breakdown” had been fixed and that the site would be making a comeback soon. Gizmodo reached out to the Internet Archive for more information and will update this story if it responds.

The Internet Archive has had its share of troubles over the past few years. Last year, the non-profit lost the appeal of a long-running copyright battle over one of its book digitization projects. Earlier this year, the organization appealed to supporters to help it in its fight against another lawsuit, this one filed by a coalition of record labels that were seeking $700 million for the org's work of “preserving and providing access to historical 78rpm records.” Yes, the “free” media concept that the Internet Archive has lived by has turned out to be quite expensive.

With AI buildouts outpacing the grid, data centers are rolling in jet-powered turbines to keep their clusters online.

Faced with multi-year delays to secure grid power, US data center operators are deploying aeroderivative gas turbines — effectively retired commercial aircraft engines bolted into trailers — to keep AI infrastructure online.

According to IEEE Spectrum, facilities in Texas are already spinning up units based on General Electric's CF6-80C2 and LM6000, the same turbine cores once found on 767s and Airbus A310s. Vendors like ProEnergy and Mitsubishi Power have turned these into modular, fast-start generators capable of delivering 48 megawatts apiece, enough to support a large AI cluster while utility-scale infrastructure lags.

Fast, loud, and anything but elegant, these “bridging power” units come from vendors like ProEnergy, which offers trailerized turbines built around ex-aviation cores that can spin up in minutes to meet energy demand. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Power's FT8 MOBILEPAC, which derives from Pratt & Whitney jet engines, delivers a similar output in a self-contained footprint designed for fast deployment.

While this might not be the cheapest, and certainly not the cleanest, way to power racks, it's a viable stopgap for companies racing to hit AI milestones while local substations and modular nuclear power deployments remain years away.

Jet-derived turbines are nothing new. They've been used in military and offshore drilling operations for decades, but this is the first time they've appeared in any meaningful way at data center sites. That speaks volumes about just how tight power supplies in the U.S. have become.

In one of the more visible examples, OpenAI's parent group is deploying nearly 30 LM2500XPRESS units at a facility near Abilene, Texas, as part of its multi-billion-dollar Stargate project. Each unit spins up to 34 megawatts, fast enough to cold-start servers in under ten minutes.

What they gain in fast deployment and ramp speed, they lose in thermal efficiency. Aeroderivative turbines run in simple-cycle mode, burning fuel without capturing waste heat, which puts them well below the efficiency of combined-cycle plants. Most run on diesel or gas delivered by truck, and require selective catalytic reduction to meet NOx limits.

Still, it's not difficult to see the appeal. Even a small AI buildout can demand 100 megawatts or more, and with some utilities quoting lead times of five years or more, we should expect to see more stopgap power generation being implemented to meet burgeoning AI power demands.

A number of Chinese companies introduced their semiconductor-related innovations at the ongoing WeSemiBay Semiconductor Ecosystem Expo in Shenzhen, China. Amies Technologies, a spinoff from Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), introduced its new set of tools, including a lithography tool for compound semiconductors, according to SCMP. Various subsidiaries of SiCarrier, a company backed by Huawei and the Chinese government, introduced advanced EDA tools and photoresists that can even be used for EUV lithography, reports Digitimes.

At the event, Amies, a subsidiary of SMEE that specializes in a broader set of equipment beyond lithography, demonstrated its lithography tools for production of compound semiconductors, such as such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), or indium phosphide (InP); laser-annealing systems; advanced inspection tools and solutions for packaging and wafer bonding, according to South China Morning Post. Amies was formed in early 2025, but it has already shipped over 500 lithography steppers.

SiCarrier's design arm, Qiyunfang Technology, introduced two home-grown EDA software platforms built on domestic intellectual property. According to the manufacturer, these tools increase design efficiency by 30% and shorten hardware development cycles by 40% compared to tools from leading developers like Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA tools that can be shipped to China. Over 20,000 engineers are purportedly already using the software to develop chips, though China's EDA self-sufficiency is barely higher than 10%.

Although there are no ASML EUV lithography tools in China due to the US ban, and it is hard to expect domestic companies to come up with such systems any time soon, SiCarrier's materials subsidiary Skyverse Technology has presented a photoresist that can be used for EUV production. The company has filed several patents that describe tin-oxide metal-cluster chemistries and patterning resolutions from 3nm to 50nm. While the filings refer to e-beam and DUV exposure rather than EUV by name, their technical characteristics are similar to those produced by JSR, a leading supplier of photoresists for production using EUV tools.

Interestingly, most inventors listed on Skyverse's applications are 'undisclosed,' which indicates confidential research partnerships and possible state-supported collaboration.

Another SiCarrier subsidiary, Long Sight, presented a 90 GHz real-time oscilloscope that marks a five-fold improvement over previous Chinese models. The system enables precise signal-integrity analysis for 3nm and 5nm-class process technologies, which will be useful for SMIC and potential Huawei fabs that will make chips on such nodes in the next several years.

‘It's an amazing tool for vibe life-ing.'

OpenAI just announced a new AI-powered browser that integrates its ChatGPT LLM right into the app. During a livestream, the company unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, coming first to macOS, with Windows, iPhone, and Android support to follow.

ChatGPT Atlas is a Chromium-based browser that uses the same platform as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. What makes it different is that the built-in ChatGPT will allow it to browse the internet and perform actions on your behalf.

Some examples shown during the live stream include instructing it to search the browsing history for something you've seen before, using the ChatGPT sidebar to look at a webpage and explain it to you, and even doing things for you, like scanning a recipe and ordering the ingredients on your Instacart account. Because of this, ChatGPT Atlas can potentially do a lot of your tedious tasks, like moving data from a Google Docs file into a project management app or listing items you have to buy and putting them in your preferred basket.

Of course, giving an AI in-depth access to your browser means that it would be able to see your data and private information, so OpenAI gave users the option to use it in logged-in or logged-out mode. When you select the latter, ChatGPT will only browse the public internet and won't have access to your accounts. Still, it does not mean that it won't be vulnerable, especially as Comet, Perplexity AI's AI-driven browser, has proven to be vulnerable to basic phishing scams and malicious code injection.

OpenAI and Perplexity aren't the only ones building an AI-powered browser, though. Google was reportedly working on something similar since last year, Microsoft introduced Copilot Mode that allows you to talk about your open tabs in July, and Opera Neon is already in early access. All these apps are free at the moment, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Atlas' more advanced Agent Mode is limited to Plus and Pro users, while Microsoft said that its Copilot Mode in Edge will only be free for a limited time.

Bambu Lab launches a printer without the US Market


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Bambu Lab launched an excellent “refreshed” version of their popular P1S earlier this week, the P2S, but it's not flying off the shelves. At least, not in the United States, where it is nowhere to be found due to “logistical” issues that likely boil down to tariffs.

The P2S is tantalizingly in stock everywhere else around the globe: Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and the whole of Asia. But you can't get it here from there.

 




Tom's Hardware received a P2S for review in September, delivered right to America's Heartland, along with dozens of other reviewers around the globe. We gave it 4.5 Stars, and we're considering putting it at the top of our Best 3D Printer list. Except it's really hard to recommend a product to our readers that they can not purchase.

I reached out to Bambu Lab and asked for a shipping update. I was told the company has no idea when it will be able to ship units to its US warehouses. On X, the printer is being advertised with a price tag in Euros, which is somewhat jolting to American sensibilities. A tiny grey footnote declares the machine is “coming soon” to the U.S.

 




The company stated on X: “We're running into some logistics delays, so the P2S will be listed but not yet available to buy on our site. We'll share the official availability date as soon as it's locked. Hang tight!”

I was informed there was a problem with shipping on the Saturday before launch, and given an expected price point of $549 USD for the standalone machine and $799 for the P2S Combo. However, those prices may change if tariffs go up.

On Oct 10th, the day before my chat with Bambu Lab's communications department, President Trump declared he would impose an additional 100% tariff on China before November 1st. It looks like this announcement made Bambu Lab pump the brakes on their US launch.

Like many global merchants, Bambu Lab stockpiles 3D printers and other goods in a US warehouse, making them easier to ship to customers. The cost of tariffs and international freight is then baked into the retail price tag we see on the website, leaving only local taxes and domestic shipping to be calculated. These prices are generally the same as what you might find at a local retailer like MicroCenter.

It would seem Bambu Lab did not wish to promise a price to US customers it could not keep. During this turbulent season of tariff wars on Chinese goods, we've noticed that several companies would rather have 3D printers out of stock than priced exorbitantly high. For example, Elegoo's Centauri Carbon did not budge from its rock bottom $300 price tag, but it did disappear from virtual store shelves for a time.

We'll keep an eye on the trade war for you. But in the meantime, Bambu Lab is offering free shipping and $100 off the price of a P1S printer, knocking it down to $549 for a standalone machine or $749 for a combo.

Space age partners claim the H100 delivers ‘100x more powerful GPU (AI) compute than has been in space before.'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The first Nvidia H100 GPUs are heading into space next month. This out-of-this-world news comes as AI factory company, Crusoe, reveals its plans to become “the first public cloud operator to run workloads in outer space.” The orbital Crusoe Cloud deployment will be powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs and AI accelerators in strategic partner Starcloud's AI data center satellites.

Crusoe and Starcloud share an energy-first vision of an AI data center infrastructure that leverages solar power in space. The rays of energy-rich light emitted by the sun are unencumbered by the Earth's atmosphere in the Starcloud's orbit. Thus, companies that establish these kinds of resources in space can enjoy “almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy.”

Estimates suggest space-based solar-powered data centers will benefit from 10x lower energy costs (including launch cost) vs those on Earth.

 




As you can see in our embedded image, space allows for massive solar panel arrays, with no concerns about land use. Moreover, operating such systems puts no strain on the Earth's energy grid. However, we would be interested to learn more about GPU cooling in space-based data centers, given that there is no air for the Earth-like traditional convection of heat, but also very little heat. Nvidia claims Starcloud will use the vacuum of deep space as ""an infinite heat sink.""

Crusoe has a long history of co-locating its compute infrastructure near novel energy sources. Thus, GPUs in space are just a logical step for the company, albeit quite a large one. Cully Cavness, co-founder, president and COO of Crusoe, sai,d ""By partnering with Starcloud, we will extend our energy-first approach from Earth to the next frontier: outer space.""

Starcloud is a Redmond-based Nvidia Inception program backed company. It is focused on building data centers in space, scalable to gigawatt capacities, making it a natural fit for Crusoe's ambitions.

“Having Crusoe as the foundational cloud provider on our platform is a perfect alignment of vision and execution,” said Philip Johnston, CEO of Starcloud. “Crusoe's expertise in building rugged, efficient, and scalable computing solutions makes them the ideal partner to pioneer this new era.” Johnston also underlined the possibilities of unlocking cloud computing power in space for research, discovery, and innovation.

The partners seem to have even more ambitious plans, going forward, with regard to scaling. However, at this stage, it is rather premature to talk of plans more astronomical than those already sketched out from now until early 2027.

Starcloud will be the first to launch Nvidia H100s into space in November 2025. Crusoe will deploy its Crusoe Cloud service on a Starcloud satellite scheduled to launch in late 2026. Subsequently, Crusoe plans to offer limited GPU capacity from space by early 2027, thus “pioneering a new paradigm for AI factories.”

Normally, simulations for scientific research are performed on supercomputers as they require tremendous compute throughput. There are also types of research — such as simulation of quantum behavior of molecules with exponentially more interacting states — that require quantum computers to simulate them, or simplifications to make the task suitable for modern supercomputers. However, Chinese scientists from Sunway have successfully used an AI model and an existing Oceanlite supercomputer to model complex quantum chemistry at the scale of real molecules, which is both a scientific and technological breakthrough, reports VastData.

A quantum state in quantum mechanics — described by a wavefunction (Ψ) — determines all possible configurations of a quantum system, such as the positions, spins, or energy levels of particles like electrons in a molecule, along with their probabilities. Modeling it is challenging because the state space grows exponentially with the number of particles, making it impossible (and not feasible) to simulate on classic supercomputers that we use today. To that end, scientists use a variety of approximation methods to simplify the quantum equations while preserving accuracy to describe molecular structures, reactions, and energies. However, the scaling of existing methods that approximate the wavefunction is limited to small molecules.

To study many-body quantum systems with strong electron correlations (e.g., tens of electrons, over 100 spin orbitals, etc.), several years ago, physicists proposed using modern machine-learning surrogates, such as neural-network quantum states (NNQS), to approximate all the possible configurations and motions of electrons within a molecule. This method promises to wed AI scalability with quantum accuracy for research that is currently impossible using traditional methods.

To conduct their experiment with 120 spin orbitals, researchers developed their own NNQS framework. Their simulation trained a neural network to approximate the molecule's wavefunction, determining where electrons are most likely to be. For each sampled electron arrangement, the system calculated the local energy and adjusted the network until its predictions matched the molecule's true quantum energy pattern.

The proprietary NNQS that was tailored for China's Oceanlite supercomputer, based on a 384-core Sunway SW26010-Pro CPU, which supports FP16, FP32, and FP64 data formats and features a very unique architecture tailored for HPC rather than for AI. In particular, they had to keep in mind how the SW26010-Pro parallelizes workloads and handles data.

The researchers have designed a hierarchical communication model where management cores handled coordination between processors and nodes, while millions of 'lightweight' 2-wide compute processing elements (CPEs) featuring a 512-bit vector engine performed local quantum calculations. In addition, they created a dynamic load-balancing algorithm to ensure that uneven computational loads did not leave any cores idle.

The scientists ran their code on 37 million CPE cores and achieved 92% strong scaling and 98% weak scaling, a high level of efficiency for such a scale, which highlights that the developers have found a near-perfect synchronization between software and hardware, a major accomplishment for China's supercomputer community. Also, to date, the simulation of molecular systems with 120 spin orbitals is the largest AI-driven quantum chemistry calculation ever performed on a classical supercomputer, marking a breakthrough for PRC's AI and quantum industries.

Without any doubt, the achievement demonstrated that NNQS can be used for quantum physics research on modern supercomputers. However, it is impossible to find out whether it is efficient to use an exascale supercomputer like Oceanlite for AI-based quantum physics research, both in terms of effort and power.

Self-contamination occurred less often with single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) than with extended use, particularly extended reuse, according to a study presented at the Infectious Disease Week (IDWeek) 2025 Annual Meeting in Atlanta.

The pilot study used surrogate markers for researchers to track self-contamination, and a clear trend emerged with “the extended use with reuse strategy having more detection of fluorescent marker compared to the single use or the extended use without reuse,” Jennie H. Kwon, DO, professor of medicine at the Northwestern University in Chicago, told attendees. She said the research team is still exploring the implications of the findings, and the data are being entered into mathematical models to try to understand what might happen with multiple contamination events, during more patient interactions, or with more frequent donning and doffing of PPE.

The findings are important, though not surprising, said Curtis Donskey, MD, hospital epidemiologist at the VA Medical Center in Cleveland, who was not involved in the study.

“Previous simulation studies have demonstrated similar frequent contamination of personnel and surfaces during removal of contaminated PPE,” Donskey told Medscape Medical News.

“Clinicians should be aware that there is a high risk for contamination during removal of contaminated face masks, respirators, and eye protection, and extended use may further increase the risk,” Donskey said. “In situations where extended use is required, education of personnel to improve technique and decontamination of PPE between uses can reduce the risk for contamination.”

He added that a previous simulation study on which he was senior author, had found “that improved technique and a 1-minute ultraviolet light decontamination prior to reuse significantly reduced contamination.”

The researchers of this new study compared rates of contamination with surrogate markers among different healthcare workers wearing single-use, extended-use, and extended-use with reuse PPE in a real-world setting. The surrogate markers were MS2 bacteriophage, which simulates viral transmission, and GloGerm fluorescent marker, which simulates gross contamination.

The study involved 100 healthcare workers who had regular contact with patients at one of four hospitals in St. Louis: Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Barnes-Jewish Hospital West County, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Washington University School of Medicine. The workers' median age was 31 years, and their years of experience working in healthcare ranged widely from 0 to 16 or more years.

The participants included 38% nurses, 23% doctors, 14% nurse's assistants or patient care technicians, 5% advanced practice nurses, nurse practitioners or physician assistants, 4% medical or nursing students, 2% social workers or case managers, and 14% in other roles. Most (88%) reported previous PPE training, with 8% reporting none and 4% unsure. The researchers did not provide any PPE education.

Participants joined one of six cohorts for 4 hours during a real-world shift: 17 participants wore a single-use standard surgical mask, 17 wore a single-use N95 mask, 16 wore a surgical mask with extended use, 16 wore an N95 with extended use, 17 wore a surgical mask for extended use and reuse, and 17 wore an N95 for extended use and reuse. All wore either goggles or face shields for eye protection, depending on their preference.

All the masks and eye protection were marked with MS2 and the fluorescent marker during the first hour of their shift. At each of three subsequent hours, researchers assessed workers' hands, wrists, face, and torso to see if the surrogate markers had been transferred to their body. They used ultraviolet light to assess transfer of the fluorescent marker, and they used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for MS2 from swabs of workers' faces, hands, and wrists and of any areas with fluorescent marker.

The single-use group only wore the marked masks and eye protection during their first patient encounter and then replaced both with unmarked PPE after each patient encounter, as standard protocol recommends.

Extended-use workers wore the same mask the entire 4 hours unless they removed it at any point, such as to eat, at which point they replaced it with a new mask. If they removed their eye protection, they also replaced it with a new face shield or goggles.

Extended use with reuse meant using the same mask and eye protection all 4 hours, even if they took either off and needed to put it back on, as many healthcare workers were forced to do during the pandemic, Kwon said.

Over 4 hours, the number of combined initial and residual fluorescence sites identified was 23 on the trunks and 15-19 each on the faces, necks, and hands of those wearing single-use surgical masks compared to 8 on the trunks and 7-18 each on the faces, necks, and hands of those wearing single-use N95s.

The numbers in the extended-use group ranged only slightly higher: 28 on the trunks and 16-20 each on the faces, necks, and wrists of those wearing surgical masks, and 12 on the trunks and 19-22 each on the faces, necks, and wrists of those wearing N95s. 

The number of fluorescence sites in the extended use with reuse group was substantially higher than the other groups. Those wearing surgical masks had 30 sites on their trunks, 23 on their faces, 30 on their necks, and 40 on their hands. Those wearing N95s had 33 sites on their trunks, 28 on their faces, 35 on their necks, and 62 on their hands.

A substantially higher percentage of samples had fluorescence on the hands of those wearing extended use PPE (62%-69%) and extended-use PPE with reuse (59%-76%) than those wearing single-use PPE (17%-41%). More samples had neck contamination in the single-use surgical mask group (53%) than the single-use N95 group (35%), but the numbers were flipped for face contamination (41% and 53%, respectively). In the extended-use groups, 56%-69% of face samples and 56%-69% of neck samples were contaminated. In the extended use with reuse groups, 53%-59% of face samples and 47%-76% of neck samples were contaminated.

Among 1488 total samples taken for PCR testing of MS2, one was inconclusive and 14% were positive for MS2. That included 5% of samples taken from the hands, wrists, and face regardless of fluorescent marker, and 30% of samples taken from areas marked with fluorescence (though 40% of that 30% was deemed residual). Most of the positive samples came from the first hour of the workers' shift.

Kwon acknowledged that the sample size was small, the duration was shorter than a regular shift, the clinical settings varied, and the researchers did not take into account hand hygiene, amount of PPE education, different eye protection types, and other factors that could affect contamination rates.

Donskey said the study was well designed, though it's not clear if the simulations are relevant to most clinical settings, given other research finding no SARS-CoV-2 contamination on respirators and other PPE of personnel working with COVID-19 patients. “The high bacteriophage inoculum and the use of fluorescent lotion in the study are likely to reflect a worst-case scenario,” he said.

The research was funded by the CDC. Kwon and the other authors had no industry disclosures. Donskey reported receiving research support from Clorox and Ushio America to the Cleveland VA Medical Center.

It's one thing to listen to medically vulnerable patients talk about their concerns over access to much-needed healthcare. It's another to relate to them in a deeper way. That's the goal of community medicine programs offered at medical schools nationwide.

At some innovative programs, students are given an up-close look at what life is like for the working poor or underserved either by touring a food desert, living in a poverty simulator for a week, and even learning how to cook when you have limited food options.

Putting yourself in a patient's shoes is embedded in the philosophy of the Bedlam Clinic, a student-run free clinic supervised by trained physicians that's a key part of the training students get at the OU School of Community Medicine (OUSCM) program in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 

In fact, when Ainsly Wolfinbarger, now a first-year pediatric resident, was in her third year at OUSCM and treated a patient with several conditions related to undiagnosed diabetes, she saw the power of community medicine firsthand.

“As I sat with him and helped him navigate the barriers to his treatment, he said ‘I can't afford this,'” recalls Wolfinbarger who currently works at Saint Francis Children's Hospital in Tulsa. “But here's what makes our program so special: I could care for him clinically and also help him navigate the social services that were critical to his care. When I told him I could help, this gentleman broke down in tears and said it was the first time in a long time he felt hopeful.”

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, Medscape Medical Students Rate Clinical Instruction Report 2025 found that

While some estimates suggest that there are 35 community medicine degrees and courses in the US, a few are taking the lead.

At OUSCM, the first of its kind in the nation, the focus is on the community beyond the walls of the medical school. The program begins the summer before formal classes for the 20-plus students who enroll in this branch of the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine in Oklahoma City. The program was founded in 2008 through a grant from the George Kaiser Family Foundation.

“For example, we do a low economic resource simulation in which students form family units and are given little monetary resources,” said Boyd Burns, DO, professor of emergency medicine and interim dean. “The goal is to show our students that there will be situations where our patients will have to decide ‘Do I buy this medication, or do I buy food.' These are sobering realities that some of our students have never had to face or think about but our patients do.”

For the past 2 years at The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus, Ohio, students have been invited to apply directly into a 4-year Community Medicine MD (CMT) track.

All 15 of the students accepted into this program are committed to serving rural communities or underserved populations, said Jennifer W. McCallister, MD, associate dean of medical education.

“Many of our students come from small or rural communities themselves but not all,” she said, adding that half of the students are from Ohio and the other half are from out of state. “Others feel a deep commitment to go back and serve their hometowns once they're done with their training.”

And, while CMT students spend their first 2 years at Ohio State's Columbus campus, it's in year three that they continue their clinical work at St Rita's Medical Center in Lima, Ohio, which has a higher poverty rate than the national and state averages, where they integrate with clinicians and faculty and learn firsthand about the issues facing the underserved.

“They also get to work with our community partners in Lima to identify the needs in the community and work with those partners to solve a particular problem, which could be accomplished by working with a local food bank, center for aging, or center for women's health,” McCallister said. “This is a critical way our students interact with members of the community.”

In 2004, community health became the fourth mission of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, along with education, clinical care, and research.

Here, medical students do a clerkship in their fourth year that focuses on clinical work as well as experiential training and partnering with community agencies.

“Our courses go beyond healthcare delivery,” said Theresa Green, PhD, MBA, director of community health education and policy at the University of Rochester Medical Center's Center for Community Health & Prevention. “We want to expand our students' thinking to the social drivers of health. For example, how does living in poverty impact their health, and what does food insecurity look like in Rochester?”

One way this is brought to life immediately is via the collaborative relationship the University of Rochester Medical Center has with Foodlink, a local nonprofit, including sponsoring meals and volunteering to distribute food, especially in food deserts, throughout the city. 

“The goal with our program is for our students to pair working on a community engaged project with learning about the financing of healthcare and policy/advocacy around healthcare,” Green said.

No matter if students sign up for a certain slate of courses or specialize in community medicine, focusing on the impact of income inequality and barriers to healthcare benefits all medical students, not just those who will end up serving the underserved, said OUSCM's Burns.

“The sooner we can get medical students everywhere to think about improving delivery and being a nimble problem solver in our healthcare space, the better.”

Use of a self-help smartphone application over 4 weeks in addition to usual care was associated with alleviated depressive symptoms, improved quality of life, and enhanced self-esteem vs usual care alone in adults with intellectual disabilities, a new study showed.

“This study contributes important evidence to address the treatment gap for individuals with IDs [intellectual disabilities]. The app may serve as interim support for those awaiting regular therapy or those with mild symptoms, or for preventive use,” the investigators of the study wrote.

“Given the increasing smartphone access in this group, app-based interventions represent a promising strategy to improve access to mental health care,” they added.

The study was led by Swantje Borsutzky, PhD, and Lina Hannah Paul, MD, both of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. It was published online on October 9 in JAMA Network Open.

The reliance on self-report and proxy report data may have introduced social desirability bias. The self- and caregiver-reported status of intellectual disability and recruitment through specialized networks may have limited diagnostic precision and generalizability. The waiting list design of the control group constrained drawing conclusions about mechanisms of change. Relying on self-reported use of the app may have limited the accuracy of assessing adherence to the intervention. The brief intervention period and absence of long-term follow-up restricted gaining insights into sustained effects.

The study was funded by Lebenshilfe and Techniker Krankenkasse. Paul reported receiving nonfinancial support from the study's funders for self-service promotion during the conduct of the study. Another investigator reported receiving honoraria and serving on the advisory board of Boehringer Ingelheim. The others reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Despite increased survival rates among infants born extremely preterm at 22-26 weeks of gestation, neurodevelopmental outcomes at the age of 2-2.5 years did not improve in those born between 2014 and 2016 compared with those born between 2004 and 2007.

""Future research should continue to focus on identifying the underlying factors driving neurodevelopmental trends, ultimately guiding evidence-based improvements in long-term outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ulrika Ådén, Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on October 15, 2025, in Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition.

The lower proportion of children in the 2014-2016 cohort, assessed using Bayley III, than those in the 2004-2007 cohort required greater reliance on clinical evaluations for NDI classification. The 2004-2007 cohort was evaluated in a controlled research setting; however, the other cohort relied on clinical assessments with multiple assessors and limited test capacity, which may have introduced variability in Bayley III assessments. The use of a historical control group as a reference could have led to an overestimation of moderate-severe NDI in the cohort of infants born between 2014 and 2016.

Two authors were supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council, and one author received support through a regional agreement on clinical research between Region Stockholm and Karolinska Institute. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Male contraception, a long-standing and confidential research topic, is gaining momentum. Hormonal, nonhormonal, and reversible surgical methods are advancing rapidly, reflecting the growing demand for shared responsibility in family planning.

Experts at the 41st Congress of the French Society of Endocrinology highlighted both the scientific progress and cultural challenges that remain in bringing these options to the market.

Geoffroy Robin, PhD, gynaecologist and andrologist at CHU Lille, Lille, France, highlighted shifting attitudes: “While female contraception has been a major social advance, it is now sometimes experienced as a constraint by women who have not experienced or are not always aware of all the battles fought to obtain it.

Public scepticism toward hormonal contraception, amplified by media coverage, has renewed calls for nonhormonal alternatives that expand contraceptive options and address safety concerns.

Within the broader push for gender equality, there is a growing demand for men to take a more active role in family planning and share contraceptive responsibility. Groups such as the Association for Research and Development of Male Contraception advocate the development of reliable, reversible, and accessible male contraceptive methods, several of which could become available in the coming years.

Male hormonal contraception is currently one of the most advanced approaches in development, and evidence suggests that many men are willing to use it if it becomes available.

Studies have indicated that 44%-83% of men support male contraception.

A transdermal gel combining nestorone (a potent progestin) with testosterone is currently in late-stage clinical trials and may become the first widely used male hormonal contraceptive. “The progestin blocks sperm production, while testosterone is administered at a replacement dose to maintain normal functions. This avoids the side effects associated with high-dose testosterone, which has remained largely experimental because of tolerance issues and a delivery method that is difficult to use. 

Applied daily, the gel has proven more effective at inducing severe oligozoospermia than methods using high-dose testosterone alone and is generally well accepted,” he added.

The oral route remains limited because oral testosterone requires multiple daily doses with fatty meals to be effective.

Therefore, the development of oral male contraceptives is likely to focus on alternative molecules. Some of these are steroid derivatives, such as 11-beta-MNTDC and dimethandrolone, while others target pathways outside the gonadotropic axis, notably by acting on retinoic acid. “Many studies have shown that spermatogenesis is regulated by paracrine molecules, among which retinoic acid plays a significant role. Vitamin A deficiency blocks spermatogenesis in animals; therefore, the strategy is to use a retinoic acid antagonist,” said Robin.

The most advanced candidate for this oral, nonhormonal approach involves YCT-529, an oral selective retinoic acid receptor-alpha antagonist that disrupts spermatogenesis. Studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that it induces reversible seminiferous tubule hypoplasia, with fertility restored after discontinuation of treatment.

Hormonal methods often produce side effects similar to those seen in women, including acne, weight changes, altered libido, mood fluctuations, and hyperglobulinaemia. The risk of thromboembolism has not yet been established.

All these approaches require approximately 6 months to become fully effective, allowing time for preexisting sperm, particularly those stored in the seminal vesicles, to be cleared.

Until these methods are widely available, men currently have three options: withdrawal, which is highly unreliable; the male condom; or vasectomy.

Although permanent, vasectomy has grown increasingly popular; procedures in France rose by 491% between 2010 and 2018, with nearly 20,000 operations performed in 2018. The procedure involves cutting both vas deferens under local and brief general anaesthesia. Because it is irreversible, it is strictly regulated by law, requiring a 4-month reflection period and documented, informed consent.

The development of reversible, nonsurgical, and long-lasting methods could address this unmet need.

Vasalgel, a polymer gel injected into the vas deferens, provides contraception for approximately 14 months and can be reversed with sodium bicarbonate. However, reversibility is not always complete, as morphological alterations in sperm have been observed in some studies. 

An alternative concept, the on-demand vasectomy, is currently under development. A German company is creating a microswitch implanted next to the vas deferens that can be activated or deactivated under the skin to block or allow sperm passage. This concept has been validated using animal models.

Thermal approaches, which maintain the testicles at temperatures above 35 °C for approximately 16 hours a day using specialised briefs or jockstraps, can temporarily reduce sperm production that remains of interest to men. The Andro-switch ring is unavailable pending CE certification, and its return to the market will depend on the successful completion of the approval process.

Despite these scientific advances, several major obstacles remain. Pharmaceutical interest is limited, and societal attitudes may hinder its adoption. Questions persist: Are men ready to take responsibility for contraception, and could doing so challenge traditional notions of masculinity? Are women prepared to trust men with contraception, accepting the potential consequences of user error or noncompliance?

 October 22, 2025  

Researchers have engineered a new hydrogel that shows early promise as a treatment for patients with vocal fold disorders.

The hydrogel lasts longer than currently available treatments, which could reduce the need for repeated administration.

When injected subcutaneously into rats, the gel demonstrated a strong initial immune response, followed by integration with the surrounding tissue by day 21. It also showed improved stability over previous hydrogels, according to the authors.

The research was published in Biomaterials.

As many as 1 in 13 adults in the US experience vocal fold disorders, but only 10% seek treatment. Severe vocal fold disorders such as paralysis, atrophy, and scarring can result from aging, heavy voice use, or surgical resection and lead to disability in speaking, swallowing, or breathing, the authors noted.

“Common injectables for vocal cords are short-lived in the tissue due to resorption or may cause tissue stiffening after injection,” co-author Nicole Li-Jessen, PhD, associate professor of communication sciences and disorders at McGill University in Montreal, told Medscape Medical News.

“For severe vocal cord injuries, like sulcus vocalis or atrophy, the gel needs to stay long enough to give cells time to restore, repair, and regenerate. Vocal cords are very soft tissue and vibrate over hundreds of times per second when we speak, and so there remains a tissue engineering challenge in how to create a bioactive material that possesses regenerative capacity, is durable, and does not significantly alter the local tissue's mechanical function after injection,” Li-Jessen said.

“Usually, people who need these injections have vocal field scarring or atrophy. Atrophy is common in the elderly, with around 7% having some atrophy after age 65 years,” she said.

The gel is made of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM), a natural biomaterial derived from human or animal tissue by removing the cells and acellular antigens, Li-Jessen explained.

“One great advantage of dECM is that it provides a natural environment that cells are already familiar with and can function effectively in. The dECM materials have shown excellent regenerative potential by minimizing the foreign body response, stimulating vascularization, and promoting extracellular matrix remodeling,” she said.

To make the dECM materials into a gel that could be injected, the researchers used a technique called click chemistry to link the polymer chains into a network to form a stable gel at physiologic conditions, co-author Maryam Tabrizian, PhD, professor of biomedical engineering at McGill University, told Medscape Medical News.

“This technique allows us to have spatial and temporal control over gelatin. Thanks to the click chemistry, our gel was found to have slower degradation than those with no click crosslinking. When we injected the gel under the skin of rats, it showed a good integration with surrounding tissue for up to 21 days,” Tabrizian said.

“We hope this new biomaterial can support more permanent tissue restoration that would reduce the need for repeated injections,” added Li-Jessen. “Of course, further material evaluations are needed. So far, the effectiveness of our click dECM-alginate gel has only been tested in vitro and in an animal model.”

The FDA has increasingly emphasized nonanimal testing methods to evaluate medical devices. “To move forward, we will further test the new hydrogel in our in-house computational models of vocal fold injuries to fine-tune the design of the gel,” said Li-Jessen.

The next step will be to test the gel in human trials. 

“If successful, our work could pave the way for a minimally invasive, longer-lasting treatment for voice loss,” Li-Jessen said.

“Vocal cord injuries are especially common among older adults who have acid reflux or who smoke and people who use their voices professionally, such as teachers, singers, and radio hosts.”

Li-Jessen, who in addition to being a clinician and scientist, is a pianist who works with singers, says she has seen how devastating voice loss can be for performers.

“People take their voices for granted, but losing your voice can deeply affect mental health and quality of life, especially for those whose livelihoods depend on it,” she said.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Joshua Silverman, MD, PhD, director of laryngology for Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York, said, “This is still experimental work; the gel has not been tested in humans, but I think the idea behind it is fantastic.” Silverman did not participate in the research.

“I do a lot of vocal fold injections for voice and vocal cord paralysis issues, and so I use these fillers on a weekly basis. If we can figure out a way to have them last longer, that's fantastic, but we're not there yet,” Silverman said.

Injections usually last between 6 and 12 months, he said. 

“There are a few different types of material, and depending on the voice requirements and the reason for doing the injection, we can use either the shorter-acting or the longer-acting injection material. The longest-lasting gels usually last about a year, but I have some patients I injected 7 years ago, and the gel is still working. So, it's not a guarantee that an injection loses its effectiveness,” Silverman said.

“It's promising in an animal model, but it's nowhere near prime time yet. And we do have materials that last,” he added.

The study was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Canada Research Chair research stipends, and the National Institutes of Health. Li-Jessen, Tabrizian, and Silverman reported having no relevant financial relationships.

If your patients are taking GLP-1s, you've explained the common side effects, such as gastrointestinal (GI) issues and muscle-loss implications. However, GLP-1 receptor agonists, often prescribed for type 2 diabetes and sometimes for weight management, can affect the entire body — including the oral cavity, said Anita Aminoshariae, DDS, MS, professor in the Department of Endodontics and director of predoctoral endodontics at the Case Western Reserve University School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland. “Oral health should be part of the conversation at the time of prescription,” she said.

Why Oral Health Matters

GLP-1s can cause changes in hydration, nutrition, and GI function that directly affect the mouth. Aminoshariae said these effects may increase the risk for:

Dry mouth. Reduced salivary flow due to dehydration and appetite suppression alters pH, increases plaque, and raises the risk for decay and gum disease.

Gum inflammation and plaque accumulation. An altered oral microbiome can lead to gingivitis and periodontal risk.

Tooth decay and sensitivity. Acid exposure from vomiting and reduced buffering capacity. They can also weaken enamel and increase dentinal sensitivity, said Aminoshariae.

Erosion in the enamel. Vomiting, GI upset, and delayed gastric emptying can affect enamel.

Bad breath. Dry mouth and microbial imbalance may cause halitosis.

As with all medications, primary care physicians and/or members of the patient care team should discuss potential side effects of GLP-1s.

Is Altered Taste a Side Effect?

There is not an agreed-upon reason for what causes this, said Jiwon Lim, DMD, MPH, assistant professor in dentistry, Division of Dentistry in the Department of Plastic Surgery, Oral & Maxillofacial Health, UVA Dentistry in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“GLP-1 agonists mimic GLP-1s, and there are known GLP-1 receptors in the taste buds in the mouth, so this may be the connection; however, the true cause of why taste changes happen is unknown,” Lim said. “There have been reports of metallic tastes and reduced sensitivity to some tastes.”

Furthermore, some users of GLP-1 drugs may experience “Ozempic tongue” — a persistent bitter, sour, or metallic taste in the mouth, said Tricia Quartey, DMD, who works in private practice in Brooklyn, New York, and is also a spokesperson for the American Dental Association Consumer Advisor.

“While there isn't yet a definitive reason for this, dry mouth may be a possibility, as some medications reduce saliva production. In addition to causing bad breath and intensifying bitter or sour flavors, dry mouth also increases your risk for tooth decay, as saliva washes away food and neutralizes acids produced by plaque,” said Quartey. “There are ways to help with dry mouth, including chewing sugar-free gum to increase saliva flow, using oral rinses or artificial saliva to add moisture, drinking plenty of water, and brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste.”

What Can a Patient Do in the Short-Term to Manage Symptoms?

Keeping good overall oral hygiene is key. Lim, with UVA, has provided these directives to patients to better manage symptoms:

In addition, Aminoshariae, with Case Western, suggested patients chew xylitol gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva, brush twice a day, floss daily, and monitor nutrition, especially calcium, vitamin D, and protein intake.

Is a Certain Type of Product Recommended?

The American Dental Association recommends using a soft-bristled brush twice a day with a toothpaste containing fluoride for 2 minutes and using an interdental cleaner (like floss) daily. Studies have shown that a manual toothbrush can be just as effective as an electric toothbrush with proper technique, Lim clarified. “Folks with limited dexterity or with dental appliances (like braces) may find an electric toothbrush easier to use,” said Lim.

For more complicated issues, seeking an oral medicine specialist may be appropriate, and this specialist can identify major problems before they escalate. “Importantly, we strengthen the transdisciplinary care that treats the patient as a whole, not in parts,” Lim said.

Researchers found that daily freeze-dried strawberry intake enhanced antioxidant biomarkers, lowered inflammation, and improved fasting glucose, suggesting a delicious way to support metabolic health and prevent diabetes progression.

In a recent study published in the journal Antioxidants, researchers evaluated the impacts of consuming freeze-dried strawberries (FDS) on antioxidant status, fasting blood glucose, and vascular inflammation indicators in prediabetic adults.

They found that consuming FDS daily for 12 weeks reduced inflammation markers and fasting glucose; multiple antioxidant biomarkers also improved significantly, highlighting strawberries as a practical dietary intervention that improved fasting glucose in this trial to strengthen antioxidant defense in prediabetic adults.

Prediabetes represents a crucial stage between normal glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), characterized by mild hyperglycemia that contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation.

Elevated blood glucose increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), which impair insulin function and damage pancreatic β-cells. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α also aggravate insulin resistance by disrupting glucose uptake and promoting inflammatory signaling pathways. These processes contribute to vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis through increased endothelial adhesion molecules and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity.

Dietary antioxidants, including vitamins, polyphenols, and carotenoids, can counteract oxidative stress, though supplementation studies' results are inconsistent due to differences in absorption and bioavailability. However, meta-analyses and clinical studies indicate that plant-based antioxidants improve total antioxidant capacity and glycemic outcomes in individuals with prediabetes or T2DM. Berries, including strawberries, are particularly rich in polyphenols like anthocyanins and ellagic acid that enhance antioxidant enzyme activity and insulin sensitivity.

Previous trials with FDS have shown improved antioxidant capacity and reduced inflammation in people with metabolic disorders. Building on this evidence, the present study aimed to test whether FDS supplementation could improve antioxidant defenses and reduce vascular inflammation in adults with prediabetes.

Researchers conducted a randomized controlled crossover trial over 28 weeks at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Twenty-five adults meeting the American Diabetes Association's criteria for prediabetes participated. Each participant completed both study phases, including 12 weeks of daily FDS intake and 12 weeks of control (no strawberries), separated by a 4-week washout period.

Participants were randomly assigned to begin with either FDS or the control condition. The intervention provided 32 g/day of FDS powder (equivalent to 2.5 servings of fresh strawberries), containing dietary fiber, polyphenols, flavonols, and anthocyanins.

Participants maintained their usual diet and physical activity throughout. Compliance was assessed by dietary logs, return of unused powder, and plasma ellagic acid levels. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 12, 16, and 28 weeks to measure fasting glucose, antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity, and vascular adhesion molecules using standardized assays. Carotenoid levels were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Statistical analyses used a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusting for treatment, period, randomization order, age, sex, fasting glucose, and baseline values, providing a robust assessment of treatment effects. Power analysis indicated a sufficient sample size to detect significant changes in antioxidant and vascular markers.

The analysis showed that FDS supplementation significantly improved antioxidant and metabolic markers in adults with prediabetes. Compliance was high (> 85%), confirmed by plasma ellagic acid detection during the FDS phase.

Compared to the control period, FDS intake led to notable increases in antioxidant biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione (GSH), antioxidant capacity (AC), and β-carotene, while no changes were seen in catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, or α-carotene.

Fasting glucose levels also decreased significantly during the FDS period, showing improved fasting glycemic control. Additionally, FDS supplementation reduced vascular inflammation, evidenced by lower intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) levels, whereas P-selectin and E-selectin were unaffected.

Correlation analyses revealed small, inverse relationships between ICAM and GSH, AC, and β-carotene, and between VCAM and AC, suggesting that better antioxidant status is linked to lower vascular inflammation. Only minor side effects, such as mild gastrointestinal discomfort and headaches, were reported.

Overall, the findings indicate that daily consumption of a realistic dietary dose of FDS can enhance antioxidant defense, reduce inflammation, and improve fasting glucose regulation in individuals with prediabetes.

This study shows that 12 weeks of FDS intake was associated with improvements in antioxidant capacity, fasting glucose, and vascular inflammation in adults with prediabetes.

These findings suggest that strawberries may be a practical, food-based dietary strategy with potential to help prevent progression to T2DM in clinical and everyday contexts. These improvements may result from polyphenols enhancing glutathione synthesis and superoxide dismutase activity, along with carotenoids and anthocyanins reducing oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.

Strengths of this analysis include the randomized crossover design, 12-week duration per phase, objective biomarker analyses, and use of a dietary-achievable FDS dose. However, limitations include the small, predominantly female sample, lack of a placebo drink and participant blinding, and recruitment from a single site, which may affect generalizability.

The trial was funded by the California Strawberry Commission. In summary, incorporating FDS into the daily diet may offer an accessible approach to improve antioxidant status, lower inflammation, and support glycemic health in adults with prediabetes.

A study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research uses a noninvasive, nonradioactive imaging-based method to measure the structure and function of the Achilles tendon in professional ballet dancers. The method could potentially be developed to help prevent injuries and improve rehabilitation efforts in athletes, as well as in the general public.

The study involved what is called multi-echo ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess collagen and other components of the Achilles tendon. These structural UTE MRI assessments were combined with functional assessments of the Achilles tendon based on sheer wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound, which measures tendon stiffness.

Professional dancers tended to have more tendon stiffness compared with non-dancers, consistent with prior observations of a training effect from repeated loading with exercise. UTE MRI measures corresponded with the degree of stiffness from SWE ultrasound.

""These findings highlight the potential of integrating UTE and SWE imaging to investigate tendon structure‐function relationships and adaptations to mechanical loading,"" the authors write. ""Enhanced structure‐function assessment of tendon health and injury status could improve rehabilitation protocols or injury prevention strategies for athletes, including professional dancers.""

Prostate cancer relies on genetic ""switches"", called enhancers, that can turn on tumor-promoting genes.

Researchers at the University of Michigan Health Rogel Cancer Center have discovered histone H2B N-terminal acetylation (H2BNTac), an essential chemical mark of these enhancers. They further implicate two proteins, p300 and CBP, that add these marks and, along with the androgen receptor, turn on enhancers and promote prostate cancer growth. The study is published in Nature Genetics.

Led by Arul Chinnaiyan, MD, PhD, S.P. Hicks Endowed Professor of Pathology, professor of urology, and director of the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, the team found that levels of H2BNTac, p300, and CBP are all elevated in prostate cancer compared to normal tissue.

Further experiments in prostate cancer cells showed that p300 and CBP are critical factors for active enhancers regulated by androgen receptors.

Given these new findings, Chinnaiyan worked with Shaomeng Wang, Ph.D. Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis Professor in Medicine, professor of internal medicine, pharmacology, and medicinal chemistry, and director of the Michigan Center for Therapeutic Innovation, to develop a CBPD-409, which selectively degrades p300 and CBP, depletes the H2BNTac mark, and shuts down oncogenic androgen receptor activity. CBPD-409 is highly potent and can be taken orally.

This study began as a way to understand chromatin associated with prostate cancer more thoroughly. But we found that if you degrade p300 and CBP, levels of H2BNTac are depleted at AR enhancer sites. CBPD-409 rapidly and selectively erases H2BNTac, but remains untouched by bromodomain inhibitors, another class of drugs targeting p300 and CBP that do not fully extinguish their activity.""

Arul Chinnaiyan, MD, PhD, S.P. Hicks Endowed Professor, University of Michigan

Furthermore, the team found that cells with more H2BNTac are more sensitive to the drug. This sensitivity suggests that CBPD-409 may work more effectively in certain populations of prostate cancer patients. The researchers also found that CBPD-409 is capable of inducing tumor regression in castration-resistant prostate cancer models and is well tolerated in mice.

Although previous small-molecule inhibitors targeting p300/CBP have shown promise, their clinical efficacy in prostate cancer has been limited, partly because they do not completely disrupt p300/CBP function.

""This therapeutic gap underscores the need for a deeper mechanistic understanding of how p300 and CBP facilitate AR-driven prostate cancer. This study reveals the unique power of targeted protein degradation,"" says Chinnaiyan. 

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the United States and one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality.

""These promising preclinical findings support the development of a selective p300/CBP degrader for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in the clinic."" says Wang.

Antidepressants can differ widely in how they physically affect the body, including around a 4 kg difference in weight change between certain drugs (approximately 2.5 kg weight loss from agomelatine and 2kg weight gain from maprotiline), confirms a systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet. The authors emphasise that these findings should not deter people from taking antidepressants, which remain vital and effective treatments for mental health conditions. Instead, they say the results highlight the importance of tailoring the treatment to each individual, taking into account their personal health and preferences.

This large-scale systematic review and network meta-analysis combined results from 151 clinical trials and 17 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports involving over 58,000 participants to assess the effect of 30 different antidepressants on the body over an average of eight weeks course of treatment. The study found that antidepressants also differ in their effects on heart rate, with a difference of more than a 20 beats-per-minute difference in heart rate (approximately eight BPM decrease for fluvoxamine and a 14 BPM increase for nortriptyline); and blood pressure, with a difference of over 10 mmHg variation in blood pressure (approximately seven mmHg decrease for nortriptyline and a five mmHg increase for doxepin).

The study estimates that some antidepressants (e.g., maprotiline and amitriptyline) were associated with weight gain in almost half of individuals prescribed them, while other antidepressants (agomelatine) were associated with weight loss in 55% of patients. Most antidepressants did not show major effects on kidney or liver function, electrolyte levels, or heart rhythm. The authors also note that it is not known if antidepressant-induced physical effects persist or change over time, and more research is needed to understand how antidepressants affect the body over longer time periods.

The authors say their results suggest that treatment guidelines should be updated to reflect the differing physical side effects of antidepressants, and decisions about which drug to use should always be made by the doctor and patient on an individual basis. They also note that other effects of antidepressants were not covered in their study, such as sexual or emotional changes and differences in drug effectiveness, and these should also be considered alongside these results.

An analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society reveals that older inpatients admitted to physicians who prescribe higher amounts of first-generation antihistamines face an elevated risk of delirium while in the hospital.

First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), are among the leading causes of medication-related harms in older adults, and although these medications are indicated for histamine-related conditions such as hives and anaphylaxis, they may be prescribed inappropriately.

When investigators analyzed data on 328,140 patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted by 755 attending physicians to 17 hospitals in Ontario, Canada in 2015–2022, they found that the overall prevalence of delirium was 34.8%. Patients admitted to physicians who more commonly prescribed first-generation antihistamines had 41% increased odds of experiencing delirium compared with patients admitted to physicians who rarely prescribed first-generation antihistamines.

We hope our study raises awareness among hospitalists that sedating antihistamines can be harmful, and should be prescribed with caution.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists question the safety and efficacy of the diet for metabolic health","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251022/Scientists-question-the-safety-and-efficacy-of-the-diet-for-metabolic-health.aspx","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 06:45:00 GMT","

A study published in Science Advances by University of Utah Health researchers sheds light on the long-term effects of the ketogenic diet, raising important questions about its safety and efficacy for improving metabolic health.

While the ketogenic diet was historically used to treat epilepsy, it has recently gained popularity for weight loss and management of conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes. The new study, performed with mice, demonstrates that the diet can have potentially dangerous impacts on metabolic health, including how the body processes fats and carbohydrates.

A ketogenic diet is a very high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet that was originally used to treat epilepsy. The idea is that the ketogenic diet induces ketosis, a metabolic state that produces ketone bodies, which act as an alternative brain fuel, stabilizing neuronal activity and reducing seizures.

In this way, the diet mimics starvation, where reduced glucose availability also limits seizures, while ketones derived from fat provide the main energy source for the brain. Over time, the diet has also been promoted for weight loss and metabolic health, but most studies have focused on short-term outcomes.

""We've seen short-term studies and those just looking at weight, but not really any studies looking at what happens over the longer term or with other facets of metabolic health,"" said Molly Gallop, PhD, now assistant professor of anatomy and physiology at Earlham College, who led the study as a postdoctoral fellow in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health.

To address this gap, Gallop and her colleagues conducted a long-term study in mice, placing male and female adults on one of four diets: a high-fat Western diet, a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet, a classic ketogenic diet where almost all calories come from fat, and a protein-matched low-fat diet. The mice were allowed to eat as much as they wanted for nine months or longer.

Throughout the study, the team monitored body weight, food intake, blood fat profiles, liver fat accumulation, and the levels of blood sugar and insulin. They also investigated which genes were active in the pancreatic cells that produce insulin. Finally. they used advanced microscopy to uncover the cellular mechanisms underlying observed metabolic changes.

The ketogenic diet successfully prevented weight gain in both sexes compared to the high-fat Western diet. Mice on the ketogenic diet maintained significantly lower body weights, with weight gain primarily attributed to increased fat mass rather than lean mass.

Despite this apparent benefit, mice fed the ketogenic diet developed severe metabolic complications, with some changes starting within days.

One thing that's very clear is that if you have a really high-fat diet, the lipids have to go somewhere, and they usually end up in the blood and the liver.""

Amandine Chaix, PhD, Study Senior Author and Assistant Professor, Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, University of Utah

The accumulation of fat in the liver, known as fatty liver disease, is a hallmark of metabolic disease associated with obesity. ""The ketogenic diet was definitely not protective in the sense of fatty liver disease,"" Chaix added.

The researchers observed notable differences in how male and female mice responded to the ketogenic diet: males developed severe fatty liver and had worse liver function, a key marker of metabolic disease, while females had no significant buildup of fat in the liver. The scientists plan to explore why female mice didn't get fatty liver disease in future research.

The study also revealed a paradox in blood sugar regulation. After two to three months on the ketogenic diet, mice had low levels of blood sugar and insulin. 
""The problem is that when you then give these mice a little bit of carbs, their carb response is completely skewed,"" Chaix said. ""Their blood glucose goes really high for really long, and that's quite dangerous.""

Mice couldn't regulate their blood sugar properly because cells in the pancreas weren't secreting enough insulin, the researchers discovered. Probably due to chronically high levels of fat in their environment, pancreas cells showed signs of stress, unable to move proteins around like they should. The researchers think that the impaired blood sugar regulation is caused by this cellular stress, but identifying the exact mechanism is a future research direction.

Importantly, problems with blood sugar regulation reversed when mice went off the ketogenic diet, suggesting that at least some metabolic issues may not be permanent if the diet is stopped.

While mice and humans differ, the findings reveal previously unexplored long-term negative metabolic health risks that individuals considering the ketogenic diet should take into account. ""I would urge anyone to talk to a health care provider if they're thinking about going on a ketogenic diet,"" Gallop cautioned.

A study published in the British Journal of Health Psychology reveals the negative behavioral and psychological consequences of commercial fitness apps reported by users on social media. These impacts may undermine the potential of apps to promote health and wellbeing.

When investigators used artificial intelligence (AI) using a method called Machine-Assisted Topic Analysis (MATA), which combines AI-powered topic modelling with human qualitative analysis, to help them analyze 58,881 X posts referring to the 5 most profitable fitness apps, they identified several negative themes-for example, challenges of quantifying diet and physical activity, the complexity of tracking calories and exercise through oversimplified algorithms, technical challenges and malfunctions, and aversive emotional responses to the apps' notifications.

As a result, some users noted feelings of shame, disappointment and demotivation, and subsequent disengagement with apps and health behaviors.

The findings highlight the need for a more user-centered and psychologically informed app design that prioritizes wellbeing and intrinsic motivation over rigid, quantitative goals.

Fitness apps remain some of the most profitable and widely downloaded health tools globally. While they can benefit health, there's been far less attention to their potential downsides. When health is reduced to calorie counts and step goals, it can leave people feeling demotivated, ashamed, and disconnected from what truly drives lasting wellbeing. Using AI alongside human analysis, we were able to shed light on these often-overlooked impacts by centering the voices of real users.""

The first-in-class YAP-TEAD inhibitor VT3989 continued to be well tolerated and demonstrated notable initial antitumor activity, particularly in patients with refractory mesothelioma, according to results from a trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Data from the Phase I/II trial were presented today by Timothy Yap, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics and vice president and head of clinical development of MD Anderson's Therapeutics Discovery division, at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (Abstract 920O) and published simultaneously in Nature Medicine.

The trial enrolled 172 patients, including 135 with refractory mesothelioma. Of the 22 mesothelioma patients treated with the optimized dose levels, seven had partial responses and 12 had stable disease – a disease control rate of 86%. All 22 mesothelioma patients had previously received immunotherapy, and 82% had previously received chemotherapy.

This study has multiple important takeaways, including the demonstration of significant disease control even in this heavily pretreated population. The safety profile was also encouraging, with mainly low-grade adverse effects. These data were strong enough to support the continued clinical development of VT3989 in mesothelioma, and we look forward to the next clinical study of the compound.""

This trial of VT3989 represents the first clinical proof-of-concept for inhibiting part of an important signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and immune response. This pathway is known as the Hippo signaling pathway and, within this pathway, the yes-associated proteins (YAP) work with transcriptional enhancer activator domain (TEAD) proteins.

In several cancer types, YAP is overexpressed or overactivated due to dysfunction in the pathway, which fuels cancer growth. VT3989 inhibits a specific modification on the TEAD protein, which blocks YAP function. Hence, VT3989 is known as a YAP-TEAD inhibitor.

Cancers with NF2 gene mutations are particularly dependent on the YAP-TEAD pathway. The NF2 gene encodes a protein called Merlin, and NF2 gene mutations/Merlin protein loss are common in mesothelioma patients.

Additionally, mesothelioma is a cancer that is very difficult to treat, and there are currently limited options for patients who do not respond to first-line treatments, making this a major unmet clinical need.

Initial data from this trial were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023, demonstrating encouraging Phase I results.

While artificial intelligence (AI)-powered screening has been validated for diabetic retinopathy, applying the technology to glaucoma has proved more challenging because glaucoma is not one disease. A glaucoma diagnosis is based on a constellation of symptoms, diagnostic tests, and longitudinal data.

However, investigation into the possibility of using AI to screen for glaucoma continues unabated because it holds enormous potential to improve screening for one of the most underdiagnosed causes of vision loss in the world.

A new study presented today at the 129th annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology adds to the expanding body of research. It shows that a machine learning algorithm was more accurate than trained human graders in identifying patients at risk for glaucoma.

Researchers at the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital used 6,304 fundus images gathered for a large, population-based cohort study (EPIC-Norfolk Eye Study) to compare the accuracy of their algorithm and a trained human grader to estimate a key measure of glaucoma, vertical cup-disc ratio. A glaucoma specialist examined the patients to confirm the diagnosis.

Results showed the algorithm correctly identified patients with glaucoma 88 to 90 percent of the time; human graders were correct 79 to 81 percent of the time. The algorithm did not differentiate between those who had glaucoma or might have glaucoma.

The authors say their study stands out from previous studies because the algorithm was tested on a cohort of patients that more closely mirrors the range of patients that would be seen during a routine screening, as only 11 percent of eyes in the data set were glaucoma suspects.

Lead researcher Anthony Khawaja, PhD, FRCOphth, said he was surprised to see the degree to which machine learning outperformed the human testers. He's hopeful it could eventually be used as a cost-effective tool for an initial glaucoma screening. Although Dr. Khawaja notes that a screening process could augment the algorithm's accuracy by including other indicators of glaucoma risk, such as intraocular pressure.

Glaucoma remains one of the most common causes of vision loss that can't be repaired globally. To date, screening is too expensive for glaucoma, but I hope that artificial intelligence solutions, in combination with other approaches such as targeting by genetic risk, will be the solution.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Report maps vaccination's comprehensive benefits for health and economy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251022/Report-maps-vaccinations-comprehensive-benefits-for-health-and-economy.aspx","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 06:39:00 GMT","

A new Gerontological Society of America report, ""Concentric Value of Vaccination: Intersecting Health, Economic, and Societal Benefits,"" provides evidence on the advantages of immunization for individual and population health, economic outcomes, and societal well-being.

""Vaccines remain the most consistently effective intervention against infectious diseases such as smallpox, rabies, polio, and various childhood illnesses,"" the report concludes. ""Their multifaceted impact highlights how vaccines not only prevent illness and reduce health care costs but also enable individuals to remain active contributors in the workforce, support caregiving roles, and sustain community engagement.""

The concentric value of vaccination across the life course is shown on page 2 of the report. It explains how ""the benefits of vaccines ripple outward - from the individual to the community and the broader economy - reinforcing their role as one of the most powerful tools in public health.""

Economically, studies show that every $1 spent on childhood vaccines saves about $11 in avoided medical costs and preserved productivity. For adults over 50, vaccines that prevent influenza, pneumococcal disease, shingles, and pertussis could reduce an annual burden of nearly $27 billion in treatment costs, much of which falls on Medicare.

Vaccines also protect workplaces and caregivers. Seasonal flu alone accounts for an estimated 17 million lost workdays in the United States each year. Broad vaccination can cut this loss in half, reducing absenteeism, stabilizing productivity, and easing strain on families juggling work and caregiving. These ripple effects reinforce household stability and long-term economic security.

On a societal level, vaccines promote community resilience. High coverage reduces disease spread, creating community immunity that shields those who cannot be vaccinated, such as people with compromised immune systems. This indirect protection is especially important for older adults, who may not mount strong immune responses but remain at high risk of complications. Vaccination also allows individuals to stay engaged in work, caregiving, and volunteer roles - strengthening families, communities, and the broader economy.

In addition to sections detailing each of these layers of protection, the report includes a brief history and current state of vaccines in the US, a glossary of important terms in vaccinology, and sidebars on the U.S. vaccine approval process and advances in vaccine technology.

In a recent work published in BME Frontiers, a collaborative study by researchers from Griffith University, Queensland University of Technology, University of Queensland, and Nanjing Stomatological Hospital has introduced groundbreaking three-dimensional (3D) dynamic cell co-culture models to simulate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression stages. This innovation addresses limitations of traditional 2D cell cultures in modeling complex liver pathologies.

MASLD, a prevalent chronic condition affecting approximately 30% of the global population, progresses through stages including simple steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and fibrosis, ultimately leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Traditional in vitro models, such as 2D hepatocyte monocultures, have failed to replicate the complex interactions among multiple cell types and dynamic environments observed in vivo.

The research utilized a novel 3D dynamic coculture system incorporating a mini-bioreactor. Three distinct MASLD models were established: steatosis (hepatocytes only), MASH (hepatocytes and macrophages), and fibrosis (hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells). Validation against high-fat-diet mouse models confirmed progressive hepatocyte viability decline and lipid accumulation, mirroring in vivo pathology. Gene expression profiles aligned closely with MASLD-affected livers.

Key findings highlight pro-inflammatory macrophages as drivers of hepatocyte lipid metabolism disruption. The 3D system allows cell-specific response analysis and accelerates MASLD phenotype onset within 24 hours, significantly enhancing research efficiency.

This advancement not only enhances mechanistic understanding but also empowers precision medicine. Future studies may leverage these models to explore personalized treatments, optimizing outcomes for patients across MASLD's spectrum. With its potential to transform therapeutic discovery, this work stands at the forefront of hepatology research, offering renewed hope for millions affected by liver disease.

Lab-based studies have provided lots of information on the biology of aging, but it's unclear how lab discoveries apply to aging in the real world. Research in Aging Cell provides insights into aging based on studies in dogs.

The Dog Aging Project (DAP) is designed to identify patterns of aging and how these are shaped by the diversity of genetic and environmental variation among companion dogs.

By analyzing metabolites from blood samples of dogs in the DAP, investigators identified effects of age on more than one-third of measured metabolites. They also discovered that post-translationally modified amino acids, which are generated from protein break-down, are strongly linked with age in dogs. These molecules might be promising indicators of physiological aging. Also, the study pointed to an important role of the kidney in the relationship between age and blood metabolites.

Because dogs age like humans, share our environment, and receive comparable healthcare, they're an ideal model for studying aging. Our hope is that blood metabolites like those studied here have the potential to serve as powerful biomarkers for tracking the processes that drive healthy aging, not only in dogs but in humans as well.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Intelligent learning can accelerate global efforts to prevent cervical cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251022/Intelligent-learning-can-accelerate-global-efforts-to-prevent-cervical-cancer.aspx","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:52:00 GMT","

Cervical cancer, one of the most preventable yet lethal malignancies among women, continues to threaten lives globally due to unequal access to quality screening and diagnosis. To close this gap, researchers developed the Intelligent Digital Education Tool for Colposcopy (iDECO), an AI-driven platform that blends real clinical cases, gamified learning, and personalized analytics. Involving 369 medical professionals across China, Mexico, and Mongolia, the study found that iDECO significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy and decision-making. High-grade lesion identification doubled, and more than 85% of participants rated the program as highly satisfactory. The results highlight how intelligent learning can accelerate global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer.

Despite the availability of vaccines and screening programs, cervical cancer remains a major health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The disease causes more than 660,000 new cases and 340,000 deaths annually, with incidence rates nearly three times higher in regions with limited healthcare resources. A critical bottleneck lies in the lack of well-trained colposcopists—specialists who visually assess and diagnose precancerous cervical lesions. Traditional in-person apprenticeships are costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible. Online lectures and theoretical courses, while more scalable, rarely provide hands-on diagnostic experience or interactive feedback. Due to these persistent gaps, innovative, intelligent, and globally adaptable training solutions are urgently needed to strengthen cervical cancer prevention and control.

A new international study (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2025.0403) has demonstrated how artificial intelligence can transform the way colposcopists learn to detect cervical cancer. Using the Intelligent Digital Education Tool for Colposcopy (iDECO), researchers from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College and Tencent Sustainable Social Value Inclusive Health Lab trained nearly 400 clinicians from China, Mexico, and Mongolia through a three-week online program. Published in Cancer Biology & Medicine in October 2025, the findings reveal that this intelligent, bilingual platform markedly improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence—offering a powerful boost to global cervical cancer elimination efforts.

The research team conducted six online training programs between December 2024 and May 2025, engaging 369 gynecologists and resident physicians from 87 medical centers. Using the bilingual iDECO platform, participants completed a three-week course combining self-paced modules, virtual Q&A sessions, and performance-based feedback. The results were striking: diagnostic accuracy increased from 56.5% to 69.1% (odds ratio 1.72), with high-grade lesion detection improving more than twofold. Accuracy in transformation zone classification rose by 1.9 times, and biopsy decision-making improved by 2.09 times. Participants from Mexico and Mongolia, though starting from lower baselines, showed the greatest progress. The study also revealed that trainees who spent more time engaging with the platform achieved significantly higher posttest scores. Over 85% of users expressed high satisfaction, citing the system's interactive features and personalized learning pathways as key motivators. The researchers concluded that iDECO not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also reshapes medical education by turning learning into an adaptive, data-driven experience.

Our study shows that intelligent digital education can dramatically improve diagnostic skills and confidence, even in resource-limited settings. By combining real-world medical cases with AI-driven analytics and gamified engagement, iDECO transforms the way clinicians learn and practice. This model brings global equity to professional training and ensures that expertise is no longer confined to major hospitals or high-income countries. It represents a powerful step toward a world free from cervical cancer.""

Prof. Youlin Qiao, corresponding author of the study

The success of iDECO across three countries suggests that intelligent, cross-language training platforms can revolutionize global medical education. Beyond colposcopy, such tools could be adapted to other clinical disciplines requiring visual diagnosis, including dermatology, endoscopy, and pathology. By promoting skill standardization and accessibility, iDECO aligns closely with the WHO's ""90-70-90"" elimination targets—90% vaccination, 70% screening, and 90% treatment coverage by 2030. As healthcare systems embrace AI-driven learning, intelligent education tools like iDECO may play a decisive role in closing the global health training gap, empowering clinicians, and accelerating the elimination of cervical cancer worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study forces a textbook rewrite on cell division","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251022/Study-forces-a-textbook-rewrite-on-cell-division.aspx","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:41:00 GMT","

Scientists at the Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI) in Zagreb, Croatia, have discovered that the protein CENP-E, long believed to act as a motor dragging chromosomes into place during cell division, in fact plays a completely different role in chromosome movement. It stabilizes the first attachments of chromosomes to the cell's internal ""tracks,"" ensuring they line up correctly before being divided. In a related study, scientists found that small structures inside our cells, called centromeres, which were once thought to function independently, help guide this key protein that ensures cells divide properly. Findings overturn two decades of textbook understanding and carry major implications for life sciences, since errors in this process underline many cancers and genetic diseases.

Every second, trillions of times over, your body pulls off something that's nothing short of miraculous. A single cell prepares to divide, carrying three billion letters of DNA, and somehow ensures both daughter cells receive perfect copies.

If that balance tips, the consequences are immediate and dire. A single misplaced chromosome can derail development, fuel infertility, or spark cancer. Cell division is one of biology's most unforgiving games.

For years, scientists thought they had identified at least one of its key players: CENP-E, described as a workhorse motor that hauls stray chromosomes into the center of the cell for orderly division. The story was neat, elegant, and wrong.

Two new studies from RBI, published in Nature Communications and led by Dr Kruno Vukušić and Professor Iva Tolić, dismantled that model and proposed new ways of its regulation. Dr. Vukušić, a rising star in cell biology, completed his postdoctoral training in a prestigious ERC Synergy team and is preparing to establish his own research group at RBI. Prof. Tolić, a world-renowned cell biologist and head of the Laboratory for Cell Biophysics at RBI, received two ERC grants and is a member of EMBO and Academia Europaea. Together, their expertise and vision drove this groundbreaking research, revealing that CENP-E is not the ""muscle"" of the operation, but the key missing regulator - the factor that flips the switch at the right moment, allowing the cellular choreography to unfold.

CENP-E is not the engine pulling chromosomes to the center. It is the factor that ensures they can attach properly in the first place. Without that initial stabilization, the system stalls.""

Dr. Kruno Vukušić, Ruđer Bošković Institute

Imagine rush hour in the largest city, you can picture millions of cars, millions of intersections. One mistake can gridlock the entire system.

Now shrink that image to the micrometer scale of a cell. Chromosomes are trains, each one carrying DNA cargo. Microtubules, the thin fibers of the cell's skeleton, are the rails. For division to succeed, every train must lock onto the tracks coming from the right direction and line up at the central station.

The old model cast CENP-E as the locomotive, dragging stragglers into place. The Zagreb team found something subtler: CENP-E is not the train but the missing coupling element, the mechanism ensuring the hitch is strong enough to hold. Without it, trains stall at the edge of the station, unable to move forward.

Why do chromosomes hesitate at the edges? The answer lies in Aurora kinases, a family of proteins that act like overzealous traffic lights. They flood the cell with ""red"" signals, destabilizing early attachments and preventing chromosomes from locking on too soon in the wrong place.

This safeguard prevents errors near the poles of the cell but also risks producing too much red and not enough green. Here, CENP-E steps in. By modulating the signals, it eases the light to green just enough for chromosomes to catch hold. Once that first stable connection forms, the rest follows naturally: chromosomes align in the middle, guided by spindle geometry and microtubule dynamics.

""It's not about brute force,"" Tolić explains. ""It's about creating the conditions for the system to run smoothly. CENP-E's key role is to stabilize the start, and once that happens, the rest of mitosis unfolds correctly.""

For nearly twenty years, biology textbooks taught the simpler story of CENP-E as a motor protein pulling cargo to the metaphase plate. The Zagreb study forces a rewrite.

""Congression, the alignment of chromosomes, is intrinsically linked to biorientation,"" says Tolić. ""What we show is that CENP-E doesn't contribute significantly to the movement itself. Its crucial role is stabilizing end-on attachments at the start. That is what allows the system to proceed correctly.""

It is a fundamental shift in framing: away from force and motion, toward regulation and timing. And that shift has consequences well beyond the classroom.

To outsiders, the distinction may seem subtle. In biology, details matter. Errors in chromosome segregation are a defining feature of cancer. Tumor cells are patchworks of duplications and deletions of entire chromosomes or their segments, each tracing back to a failure in the cellular traffic system.

By showing that CENP-E's primary role is to regulate the first attachments-and tying this regulation to Aurora kinase activity, the Zagreb team has not just linked two processes once thought to act independently but has mapped a critical vulnerability. This insight could inspire drugs that fine-tune the balance, suppressing runaway divisions or rescuing stalled ones.

""This isn't just about rewriting a model,"" Vukušić says. ""It's about identifying a mechanism that directly links to disease. That opens doors for diagnostics and for thinking about new therapies.""

The research was powered by one of the world's most competitive awards, the European Research Council's Synergy Grant, alongside support from the Croatian Science Foundation, Swiss Croatian bilateral projects, and EU development funds.

It also relied on advanced computing infrastructure at the University of Zagreb's SRCE center. ""Modern biology isn't just microscopes and test tubes,"" notes Tolić. ""It's also computation and collaboration across disciplines and borders.""

At its heart, the discovery is about finding order in chaos. Each day, trillions of cells divide into the human body, each gambles against entropy. The work from Zagreb illuminates one of the hidden rules of that gambling. By redefining the role of CENP-E, and linking it to other processes inside cells, the team has given biology a clearer blueprint of how cells keep their traffic moving under impossible pressure.

""By uncovering how these microscopic regulators cooperate,"" Tolić says, ""we are not only deepening our understanding of biology but also moving closer to correcting the failures that underlie disease.""

Since the U.S. Women's National Team claimed gold in the 2024 Paris Olympics, head coach Emma Hayes has used every camp to cap at least one new player.

Five players debuted in the last USWNT camp this summer. That roster averaged 18.4 caps per player and it was just 3.3 caps without the players who had world championship tournament experience. Hayes has been intentional with the way in which she has incorporated new players into the squad over the last year, and now the page turns to preparation for qualification to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. 

“This is really the build towards qualification for next year,” Hayes said. “That's what the start of this cycle actually means.”

This “start” includes two matches against Portugal and one against New Zealand in the upcoming October international window. 

Some players who got a first look in the “experimental phase” now have a chance to make their mark in this cycle. Midfielder Claire Hutton earned her first call-up in the January futures camp. She remembers seeing Hayes laying out the next two years and making clear what was ahead. Now, Hutton is not just a young player navigating her first camps and games with the USWNT, she is a part of building toward some of the biggest opportunities in international soccer. 

“I do feel like there is a lot of pressure to it,” Hutton said. “But at the same time, we're staying present, we're staying focused on what we currently have. If you stay consistent, it keeps everybody where their feet are at the moment.”

This camp features a mix of World Cup champions like Lindsey Heaps and Rose Lavelle to up-and-coming senior team contributors like Hutton and Ally Sentnor, just two younger players among many on the squad.

Leaders like Heaps have been imperative in setting a standard for players who have yet to experience a qualification cycle.

“My No. 1 thing that I say to all these players here is, ‘You're here for a reason, you're not just coming in for shenanigans,'” Heaps said. “‘You're here to make this team better, go and do your thing.'”

Hutton has soaked up that knowledge since arriving at her first camp. The 19-year-old midfielder recalls how it felt playing with Heaps and other USWNT veterans. The two first took the field together in April against Brazil in Hutton's second-ever start. The starting lineup was an inexperienced one averaging 17.9 caps. At the time, it was the lowest for any USWNT starting XI in 24 years. 

In the second half, Heaps, along with Sam Coffey and Crystal Dunn, checked into the match. Hutton's excitement is palpable even now as she reflects on the memory.

“It was like, ‘Let's go, the Avengers are coming in. I get to share the field with the Avengers,'” Hutton said. “Just playing with Lindsey and some of the older, more experienced players there was just a level of confidence that I think us less experienced, younger players get when they're on the field, it's just having that backup and knowing that they do trust us with the ball.” 

The admiration is mutual. Heaps, 31, remembers when she was in Hutton's shoes and afraid to ask for advice. The younger players' willingness to learn has stood out to the captain, and she enjoys observing the growth of the next generation in real time. 

“I really like watching the development of our younger players or less experienced players coming in,” Heaps said. “Any bit of feedback they get or advice or things that maybe you've said to them, or Emma said to them — they're putting it into play right away. It's such a special thing to see.” 

As much as the USWNT will lean on stalwarts like Heaps as the pressure builds toward qualification, the development of younger players will also play a significant role.

“What Emma has done, bringing in so many young players, less experienced players, the caps we're getting — I think is so crucial,” Heaps said. “What makes a winning team, especially in those tournaments, knowing that you need everyone and you might need a less experienced player that maybe doesn't have more than 10 caps, or players to come in and make a massive difference.”

While there is still a massive amount of work to be done, the USWNT can be empowered by what the team has accomplished under Hayes so far, which gives players and coaches alike the confidence that even better times are on the horizon.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

ATLANTA (Oct. 22, 2025) – The U.S. Under-16 Girls' National Team will travel to England from Oct. 22-31 for a training camp and games at St. George's Park, England's National Training Center, located about 120 miles north of London.

The USA will face its counterparts from England on Oct. 28 and Oct. 31, giving this age group valuable international competition.

All players in this camp were born in 2010 and represent the core of the team that will compete to qualify for the 2027 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. As this will be Katie Schoepfer's cycle, and she is currently in Morocco coaching at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, Ronnie Woodward will be the head coach for this camp and matches.

This year marks the beginning of FIFA's annual staging of FIFA U-17 WWC — as opposed to biannually as it was in the past — and the tournament will be held in Morocco for the next five years.

The camp is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Could Kennedy Wesley be the next big thing in United States Women's National Team football?","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/kennedy-wesley-naomi-girma-giving-back-community-football-uswnt","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:11:00 GMT","

Inspired by Naomi Girma, San Diego Wave player Wesley, who is also a prominent figure in fighting hunger in her community, could be the next standout centre-back to break into the U.S. national team. 

Kennedy Wesley could become the 264th player to be capped for the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) this month.

Called up to camp by Emma Hayes for the first time, she is looking to join the growing list of young U.S. players to debut under the English coach.

It is quite the achievement for the defender, who was torn between playing football and gymnastics until she was 15.

“I knew from when I was really young that I wanted to be a professional athlete in some sense,” she told All for XI.

“I came to the conclusion that if I really wanted to excel in any sport, I had to pick one.”

Excel is exactly what she has done—Stanford alumna to NWSL rookie, and now a mainstay in the San Diego Wave backline.

Despite her raw talent, Wesley also attributes her rise to picking the brain of Naomi Girma for the season they spent together before the latter's million-dollar move to Chelsea.

“She is always some I looked up to in that position, on the field and off it,” the California native revealed.

“Talking to her and getting her ideas on how she adjusted from college to the league was super helpful.”

Despite being agemates, Wesley is a huge admirer of Girma's poise and calmness.

“She taught me so much between learning [new things] and things that I already had in my toolshed – it's been kind of fun to put everything together,” she added.

For all she is inspired by others, though, Wesley is making her own way to the top.

Being able to give back to the community is something close to Wesley's heart.

California isn't just where she plays football; it is where her roots are. To that end, the centre-back has been fundraising for local organisations in a bid to combat hunger in the San Diego community.

“Being an athlete, being able to be properly fuelled for the day to be able to do the training and games that we do is super important,” she explained.

“But it's also really important for people that aren't in athletics, people that are just fuelling themselves for their daily lives.”

Kennedy is also at the heart of other volunteer efforts when time permits.

“To see what they are doing with food rescuing and supplying for so many different people, of all walks of life, I think it is just so awesome.

“If, with my platform, I'm able to help in a positive way, I'm more than happy to do so.”

A post shared by Feeding San Diego (@feedingsandiego)

The bigger women's football becomes, the more it opens players up to online scrutiny.

Despite some constructive debates, there is a corner of the internet that sometimes takes it beyond that.

In order to succeed at the top level, Wesley believes it is important to have tunnel vision—focus solely on playing, block out the noise.

“I think the biggest thing for me is putting my attention, focus, and emphasis in the ways that I want to,” she told the Beyond the Game podcast.

“Staying a little bit tunnel vision in terms of how I want my image to be perceived and who I can impact in that way.

“I think having a good sense of self and a good idea of who you are as a player and person, and how your circle views you as, is the most important thing.”

Wesley isn't just chasing an international debut; she is extending her mark as a footballer—on the pitch and in her community.","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","soccer"

The 2027 Women's World Cup kicks off 610 days from now in Brazil.

But who is counting?

Well, us.

We have brought back the very early U.S. women's national team roster predictions, ahead of head coach Emma Hayes' first foray into World Cup qualifiers next year. There is plenty of time until the U.S. plays in its next major tournament; they still need to qualify, but 2025 has been an exercise in exploring the depth of the player pool for Hayes without the usual pressure that comes with the U.S.

And explore she has. Through 25 matches in charge so far, Hayes has provided 24 players with their first cap for the senior national team. This month, she could make it 25 if San Diego Wave defender Kennedy Wesley gets the nod.

The former Chelsea manager has been clear all year that her mission was to identify a core group to build around (an idea we tackled back in April on “Full Time,” too), but player absences due to injury, pregnancy and rest have made reading between the lines of her roster selections a difficult task.


“I want to put players in the frying pan and I want you to feel the heat,” Hayes said in April, following a pair of friendlies against Brazil. “This camp was always about expanding and experimenting (with) that player pool. I really feel like that is becoming so clear to me on which players I think are really ready for us right now, which ones are not.”

Even October's roster for the upcoming matches against Portugal (twice) and New Zealand does not provide a clear picture. Chelsea center back Naomi Girma is still working through another calf injury. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman was set to make her return following her long layoff from her back issues; instead, she is rehabilitating after a Grade 1 MCL sprain. The other two-thirds of Triple Espresso, which led the U.S. to an Olympic gold medal in 2024, Sophia Wilson and Mal Swanson, have not set expected return dates following the birth of their respective children.

To prognosticate now is to decide how much of a leap of faith one wants to take for a surprising number of names. That said, there is value in the ongoing exercise of deciphering national team minutes, club performances and press conference quotes to make educated guesses on who's a lock, who's trending upward, who's on the bubble and who might just miss the cut when it comes time to pick the final 23.

The Athletic attempted this same game for the 2023 World Cup, trying to predict Vlatko Andonovski's final roster — and, out of curiosity, I went back to check our work from our final version compiled in April 2023. We were too far off.

I was five off the final roster because I took a flyer on Midge Purce, acknowledging Steph Yang (four picks off) was likely more correct with the Alyssa Thompson pick to fill out the forward pool.

We otherwise aligned on our misses: Aubrey Kingsbury in as the third goalkeeper option, no Becky Sauerbrunn due to injury, nor Tierna Davidson as a center-back option, and failing to foresee the surprise first call-up for Savannah DeMelo.

Trying to predict Hayes is a very different beast than Andonovski, but we're going to try to do it anyway.

We overlapped on 20 of the 23 names, but the key difference for us lies in the forward pool. On this week's episode of “Full Time”, Meg said she thought she was providing a spicy take that Swanson felt like “the least certain name” of the forward pool to her, before discovering that Tamerra had actually opted to leave both her and Wilson off her 23 picks entirely.

“I'm still figuring out how much weight to assign current availability,” Tamerra said, working to balance current health against Hayes' identification of the core group.

“I would guess that next year is all about building chemistry. Some of these players who have been regularly called into camp this year have already gotten a head start on that, to an extent. If not building partnerships with other players, at least getting settled into Hayes' style.”

Current health versus potential future return also played a factor in our other difference, with Meg opting for center back Tierna Davidson over Orlando Pride's Emily Sams, in part because of her lack of significant minutes under Hayes despite her club performance.

While the differences were interesting, what was more telling to us was just how much alignment we had over 600 days away from the World Cup.

“Going in blind, we aligned on 20 players,” Meg said on the podcast. “That, to me, is showing that there is this core group taking shape under Hayes, or at least she has been consistent enough in terms of what she has said, her call-ups, and what we have seen out of their play — that even this far out, as of right now, you can mostly predict a roster.”

Hayes is narrowing down the USWNT player pool, and will have matches against Portugal and New Zealand to further hone in

The composition of latest U.S. women's national team roster indicates everything you need to know about what Emma Hayes is thinking at this point in the cycle. Then, for good measure, Hayes said it, too.

“This is really the build towards qualification for next year,” Hayes said. “That's what the start of this cycle actually means.""

After a year of experimenting, changing, introducing and capping players, the USWNT arrives for three October friendlies at something of a turning point. These games - two against Portugal and one against New Zealand - are both an end and a beginning. The post-Olympic era is over, and the 2027 World Cup era is now underway.

It begins with Thursday's match against Portugal in outside of Philadelphia, a match in which many stars return to the fold. The roster Hayes selected is a mix of old and new. They all face a fight to stay involved, and now know what's at stake - and what's on the horizon.

Portugal, in truth, won't be the toughest team on the USWNT's schedule. They've been routinely battered by Europe's elite, with Spain thrashing them three times, scoring a combined 16 goals, and England settling for a February draw before a 6-0 beating in May.

For the USWNT players, this is an opportunity to show what you can do against opposition that can and should be beaten.

Thailand hired former New Zealand and Colorado Rapids manager Anthony Hudson as coach of its men's soccer team Wednesday, a day after dismissing Japanese tactician Masatada Ishii.

Hudson, who also was interim coach of the U.S. men's soccer team for four months in 2023, has served as the director of technical development of Thailand's soccer association since last year.

""At this crucial time, we need someone who understands Thai football thoroughly,"" association president Nualphan Lamsam said in a statement. ""Anthony Hudson has worked with the association at every level and has extensive international experience.""

The 44-year-old Hudson coached New Zealand from 2014-17. He resigned a week after the All Whites lost to Peru in an intercontinental qualifying playoff for the 2018 World Cup.

Hudson, the son of former Chelsea star Alan Hudson, was coach of the MLS' Rapids from late 2017 to May 2019.

Hudson's first match in charge will be a 2027 Asian Cup qualifier against Sri Lanka in November. Thailand sits second in the four-team Group D. Only the group winner advances to the tournament in Saudi Arabia.

""At this crucial time, we need someone who understands Thai football thoroughly,"" association president Nualphan Lamsam said in a statement. ""Anthony Hudson has worked with the association at every level and has extensive international experience.""

The 44-year-old Hudson coached New Zealand from 2014-17. He resigned a week after the All Whites lost to Peru in an intercontinental qualifying playoff for the 2018 World Cup.

Hudson, the son of former Chelsea star Alan Hudson, was coach of the MLS' Rapids from late 2017 to May 2019.

He took over as USMNT interim coach following the expiration of Gregg Berhalter's contract at the end of 2022. Hudson  oversaw the U.S. team for five matches, compiling a record of 2-1-2, before leaving his role in May 2023 to take a job in Qatar.

Hudson's first match in charge of Thailand will be a 2027 Asian Cup qualifier against Sri Lanka in November. Thailand sits second in the four-team Group D. Only the group winner advances to the tournament in Saudi Arabia.

'Sustainability has to be at the heart of every decision at the 2026 World Cup'

In eight months' time the 2026 World Cup will make history as the biggest single sporting event. But not everyone is celebrating.

Amid the excitement, concerns are growing about the environmental cost of the vastly expanded tournament, drawing criticism from academics, players and fan groups.

BBC Sport looks at some of the key issues.

Dr Madeleine Orr is a leading sport and climate expert who believes the 2026 World Cup ""sends a dangerous message about the intentions of Fifa and other events to just get bigger and bigger"".

Next year's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will be the first to be held across an entire continent, feature 48 teams and have 104 matches - 40 more than before. Fifa is considering expanding the tournament to 64 teams for the 2030 edition.

""It's completely misaligned with the promises [Fifa] have made publicly to reduce emissions,"" says Dr Orr, assistant professor of sport ecology at the University of Toronto. ""At this point, it's damage control.""

In their original bid for the 2026 World Cup, the three prospective host nations hoped the event would ""establish new standards for environmental sustainability"" and deliver ""measurable environmental benefits"".

But Dr Orr is sceptical.

""If the new standard is the most carbon-intensive event ever, then yeah,"" she says with sarcasm. ""No, I don't think that's possible,"" she adds.

Recent research from the Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) calculated the expanded tournament will generate more than nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, making it the most ""climate damaging"" edition in the tournament's history.

It could also be one of the hottest. In total, 14 of the 16 host cities for the World Cup are expected to be vulnerable to extreme heat during the tournament. Dr Orr believes that from 12pm to 4pm, many of these venues would be ""virtually unplayable"".

Fifa has suggested adjusting kick-off times and relying on a handful of stadiums with roofs - their plans will become clearer after December's World Cup draw - but critics argue the risk extends beyond the pitch.

""I'm not worried about the athletes,"" Dr Orr explained. ""I worry about 45,000 to 85,000 fans, the 10,000 staff and media personnel who are on site for prolonged periods.

""It's going to be a challenge to figure out how to keep people safe. It is a conversation that's being had, but as of today there is no firm plan on that.""

Fifa declined to comment when approached by BBC Sport, and also declined to answer detailed questions about its sustainability strategy and contingency plans, external in the event extreme weather forces a change to the schedule.

However, speaking this month at the European Football Clubs (EFC) general assembly in Rome, Fifa president Gianni Infantino acknowledged that extreme heat in future summers might force a rethink of football's global calendar.

""We are discussing all the time, and I think it's not just about one World Cup - I think it's a general reflection,"" he said.

""Even to play in some European countries in July, it's very, very hot. So maybe we have to think.

""There are ways we can optimise the calendar. But we are discussing it, and we will see when we come to some conclusion. We just have to have an open mind.""

Cooling breaks were used at Club World Cup games this summer

The struggles of playing in high temperatures in the US have been talked about for some time. In 2017, England forward Rachel Daly was treated for heat exhaustion in hospital after collapsing during a match in Houston, while playing in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

The heat was a constant theme of this summer's Club World Cup. Record-breaking temperatures and violent storms wreaked havoc across the tournament. Lightning meant six games were delayed from 40 minutes to two hours.

Chelsea were one of the teams to struggle with the extreme heat. At their semi-final against Fluminense in New Jersey the temperature rose to more than 35C by kick-off, with midfielder Enzo Fernandez saying the conditions made him ""dizzy"" and were ""very dangerous"".

USA 1994, remembered for the 41C the Republic of Ireland played in against Mexico in Orlando, was the hottest World Cup so far.

BBC's senior weather forecaster Simon King said recently next year's tournament could surpass that.

""In June 2023, an extreme heatwave was seen in Texas, Florida and Mexico for weeks. In Monterrey, Mexico the heat index was close to 50C and in Miami it was as high as 44C.

""It is impossible to say a year ahead whether host cities like those will experience heatwave conditions - climate change has loaded the dice to an increasing chance of this happening. And if it does, it could feasibly be the hottest World Cup on record.""

Five US cities (Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey and San Francisco) which hosted games in 1994 are also hosting in 2026.

Data provided by Climate Central to BBC Sport showed that all those US cities (except San Francisco) experienced significantly more days above 32C, external in June 2025 than they did in 1994.

David Wheeler, former Wycombe Wanderers midfielder and one of football's most vocal environmental advocates, sees climate change increasingly affecting the game, saying it is ""becoming a lot more obvious to players and more of a topic of conversation"".

Wheeler, who is the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Sustainability Champion, believes the sport has a responsibility to do more.

""Unfortunately I don't think the major governing bodies and organisations are really taking that responsibility seriously at the moment,"" he says.

""These organisations don't deserve to profit from sport if they're not going to use their power for the betterment of sport.""

Wheeler also wants footballers to use their platform more to speak out on environmental issues.

""It could have a huge impact,"" he said. ""But it's also important that clubs and fans' groups also insulate the players because there's going to be that inevitable backlash that they're a hypocrite.

""The majority of us are hypocrites to some degree. We're not perfect and that's OK, just as long as we're trying to do as much as we can.""

One player who does not shy away from using his platform to champion environmental issues is Real Betis defender Hector Bellerin.

Speaking after he was named Global Champion at the recent BBC Green Sport Awards, he said it was not easy to promote sustainability in a sport increasingly defined by global expansion.

""It's hard,"" he said, referencing the 2026 World Cup. ""I don't make the decisions and I'm very aware of how the industry works. But I'm not going to stop doing what I love because of decisions made at the top.

""We players often feel like we're treated like numbers or marketable goods. There's more games, more travel, more difficult conditions. And we're just told to hydrate,"" the former Arsenal player added.

""Unless footballers around the world unite - whether that means stopping or taking bold decisions - the wheel's just going to keep turning,"" he said.

Chelsea have agreed a new shirt sleeve sponsorship deal with FPT corporation for the rest of the 2025-26 season and are in the closing stages of finding a new front of shirt sponsor too.

FPT, which is based in Vietnam and is one of Asia-Pacific's most successful technology solutions providers, were keen to upgrade their relationship with the club having initially joined as an official global partner in April.

Chelsea president and chief operating officer Jason Gannon and president of commercial Todd Kline played a key role in negotiations. The deal is in line with the value other top Premier League clubs have secured and will see FPT on the sleeves of the men's, women's and academy teams. It will be seen for the first time in Chelsea's Champions League game at home to Ajax on Wednesday night.

The club began the season without a shirt sleeve partner. Live Nation, who remain a partner at Chelsea, had their company on the shirts from early February to the FIFA Club World Cup Final in July.

Chelsea's strong conclusion to 2024-25 triggered even more competition to become their shirt sleeve sponsor. In May they finished fourth in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League and won the Conference League. Two months later they became the first team to win the Club World Cup, beating Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

More companies entered the bidding process for the sleeve and many of them are expected to try again for next season.

Meanwhile, sources speaking anonymously to The Athletic to protect relationships say Chelsea's thorough process to find a front-of-shirt sponsor is nearing a conclusion.

With Gannon and Kline again to the fore, there are now less than a handful of discussions with companies taking pace. They are very advanced and a final decision is expected in the near term.

Negotiations have included the prospect of being a multi-faceted partnership which goes beyond just having the company's name displayed on the front of Chelsea's kit.

Chelsea's bid to find a front-of-shirt sponsor has been a talking point since the Todd Boehly-Clearlake consortium bought the club three years ago.

Chelsea's pre-existing shirt sponsorship agreement with mobile company Three, which commenced in 2020, expired at the end of 2022-23. The 2023-24 season began without a sponsor but a deal worth in excess of £40million was announced in September for the rest of that campaign with Infinite Athlete.

In 2024-25 nothing was in place until Dubai-based property company Damac came on board in April for seven games, not including the Club World Cup.

Chelsea have been talking to a number of major companies for several months with the focus being on finding the right partner rather than rushing to get it done. With the club's profile growing higher once more after winning two major trophies and playing in the Champions League again, it has made them an even more attractive proposition and helped their bargaining position.

Gyoekeres celebrates scoring Arsenal's fourth with Gabriel Justin Setterfield - UEFA - Getty Images

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

Hello! Forty-three goals in one Champions League evening. But we need to speak about the best back line in Europe.

On the way:

Much attention will be given this morning to the front end of Arsenal's team. Last night's 4-0 Champions League rout of Atletico Madrid epitomised their attack: set pieces paying off, Gabriel Martinelli scoring again, Viktor Gyokeres (‘Call me Bane') applying the coup de graces.

Advertisement

Atletico held out for almost an hour, but once the dam burst at the Emirates, they were swept away in all of 11 minutes. There's a lot to admire about the way Arsenal pile forward when they're in the mood. All the same, we need to talk about what's going on at the back because the club's defensive stats are bordering on the ridiculous.

They registered with me last week when The Athletic's alternative Premier League table explained how Arsenal had conceded six fouls in seven league games inside their own defensive third. That's extremely impressive in a division so fast and furious. Since then, they've beaten Fulham without conceding and Atletico without conceding. They're impossibly impenetrable.

Here are the numbers that matter in late October: Arsenal have played 12 times across three different competitions. They've conceded three times and, as yet, not once in Europe. Chelsea's seemingly untouchable record of 15 concessions in 38 Premier League fixtures in 2004-05 might not be quite as untouchable as it seems. Mikel Arteta's side are tracking towards 14.

There's a famous quote often attributed to Sir Alex Ferguson: attacks win games, but defences win titles. He wasn't wrong. And it's the ice-cold nature of Arsenal's defensive framework that is making them look a bigger threat than ever — on multiple fronts.

We can legitimately classify yesterday in the Champions League as a goalfest. Forty-three finishes in nine matches — no kidding — was an average of almost five a game; basically unprecedented. Paris Saint-Germain scored seven. Barcelona and PSV scored six (PSV gave Napoli such a battering that the Italians are still looking for their teeth). Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Inter helped themselves to four.

Ironically, the only blank contest was between Kairat and Pafos, two teams who absolutely did not want a goalless draw. They're lodged in the league stage's elimination places. But the flood of strikes set TAFC the challenge of trying to pick the best of them — and I had to go with Newcastle's second in a 3-0 win over Benfica, polished off by Harvey Barnes after this beast of an assist from goalkeeper Nick Pope, below, set him on his way.

Real Madrid versus Juventus is the best of tonight's match-ups, and it got James Horncastle thinking and writing about one of football's more eye-catching transfers: Cristiano Ronaldo from the Bernabeu to Juve for a cool £86m ($115m) in 2018.

Advertisement

Ronaldo is long gone from Juve, but, as James outlines, the legacy of his transfer isn't. He and the Serie A side are embroiled in a legal case related to a salary reduction agreement put in place at Juve during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ronaldo claims he is owed more than £17m. An attempt by Juve to see him off by paying him half of that amount failed. The 40-year-old has the wealth of a king, but in this business, money is money.

Colour us shocked. News arrives from Adam Crafton that the controversial plan to hold a La Liga clash between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami has been shelved, for now. Scratch December 20 from your diaries.

The promoter behind the U.S. event, Relevent Sports, says there is “insufficient time” to organise it. That sounds like a euphemism for “overwhelming opposition in La Liga's own back yard”. Only yesterday, Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois took a dig at La Liga, accusing it of “manipulation” by trying to prevent footage of player protests against the Miami proposal from being broadcast over the weekend.

In fairness to Relevent, it did concede that “uncertainty in Spain” was making a December date impossible. We'll wait to see what its next move is. All that can be said for sure is that La Liga and others pushing league matches in foreign climes have sorely underestimated the strength of feeling about their intentions. The postponement is a win for democratic process.

You'd be forgiven for thinking that Major League Soccer is a little predictable. Lionel Messi finished the regular season as leading goalscorer. Lionel Messi finished joint-top for assists. Lionel Messi, as Tom Bogert rightly says, will be named the league's MVP.

But away from he who will not grow old, MLS has enjoyed some healthy underdog spirit. Philadelphia Union's ride to the Supporters' Shield was unexpected. That's putting it mildly. San Diego's inaugural campaign could yet end with an MLS Cup. Vancouver Whitecaps' performance is their best on record, which is why Mr Bogert picked out Jesper Sorensen as his coach of the year.

What Tom found challenging was choosing a single MLS XI, given that a solitary line-up with positional limits makes it tough to paint the full story of the season. He thinks the league would do right by naming two or three line-ups. My own suggestion to MLS ahead of tonight's play-in round (and I've banged this drum before) would be to slim down the post-season. Eighteen participants are too many. A six-week schedule is too long. Let's up the jeopardy.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens breakdown the success of Morroco's new generation following their U20 final victory. (1:39)

Morocco played a near-perfect game to beat Argentina 2-0 in the final of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup. The result, of course, was a disappointment for Argentina, who have won this trophy more times than anyone else, but not since 2007. And it was a disappointment for South America, both because of home advantage -- the tournament took place in Chile -- and because this age level is seen on the continent as an important conveyor belt towards the senior side.

However, there is a silver lining. With the performances of Argentina and Colombia, South America finished second and third respectively. And there is a wider point: Perhaps the U20 World Cup is no longer fit for purpose. Changes in the game -- better pitches and more protection for talent -- have made it easier for teenage players to shine with even the biggest clubs, and those youngsters do not feature in the tournament because clubs are not obliged to release them.

- Dove: Did the U20 World Cup unearth the new Cristiano Ronaldo?
	- Di María shows Neymar that a triumphant return is possible
- Strong national team, strong league? Not in Argentina, Brazil

This World Cup, then, has become a relatively random collection of players, those whose services the federations have been able to secure, and quality suffers as a consequence. The Uruguay side that won the 2023 title are a case in point. Not one of that team has yet kicked on to play a significant part in Marcelo Bielsa's senior side.

For all these reservations, the U20 World Cup remains a fascinating watch and unquestioningly provides a platform and gives valuable experience to a fresh generation of talent. This is a look at the South Americans who caught the eye in Chile over the last few weeks. The big question, though: Is there anyone here who might be fast-tracked into next year's senior World Cup squad? And who would seem to have the brightest future?

Argentina's captain was the Bournemouth left back, who has already featured in the senior squad for World Cup qualification. He was called up for the last two rounds of the campaign, and in a position where Argentina does not have great strength in depth, he must have some chance of making the team at the senior level next year.

The U20 World Cup, however, did not make an especially powerful case for promotion. Plenty will probably depend on whether he can get a regular game over the next few months in the Premier League. Soler is undoubtedly neat, but seems sound and steady rather than inspirational.

An answer to Argentina's prayers would be a top-class young center back, which is the area of Lionel Scaloni's lineup that they have not been able to refresh since the Qatar World Cup, and the bad news from Chile was that there would not appear to be any solutions in this U20 side.

Argentina lost the title because the defensive unit was ambushed in the first half by Morocco's capacity to break at pace.

The attacking midfielder was a huge success. A youth prodigy and the product of a busy conveyor belt at Velez Sarsfield, he was a star at the Under-17 level, on the back of which he earned a move to Benfica.

However, his move to Portugal has not yet lived up to expectations -- hence his release for this tournament -- and he has yet to appear in the first team. Prestianni arrived in Chile as a reserve, but took advantage of injuries to become the team's leading creative force.

He did not get on the scoresheet, but with every passing game, he became more important to the team, thanks to his quick feet, an eye for a pass, and the ability to change rhythm when running with the ball, which is the hallmark of footballing speed.

Argentina will hope that this tournament will be able to help him regain momentum.

Chosen as the third-best player of the tournament was the holding midfielder from Boca Juniors. Despite being 5-foot-5, he has a big personality and plenty of talent. Delgado wins possession, takes responsibility, links the play and can provide some quality service to the strikers.

When Fernando Gago was Boca coach, Delgado was getting plenty of game time and he used it well. A change of command and the arrival of Leandro Paredes have since limited his opportunities, but now that he has shown his value on the global stage, he should soon be back in first-team contention.

Does he have a chance of making the 2026 World Cup squad? Probably not, although getting back in the Boca starting lineup would certainly give him a platform.

Colombia lost to Argentina in the semifinal and then beat France to finish in third place. Their star was the center forward Villarreal. Impressive at the start of the year in the qualifying tournament, he suddenly came to life in the knockout stages in Chile, scoring twice against South Africa and then getting all three in a thrilling 3-2 win over Spain.

He styles himself ""Ney"" in a tribute to Neymar, but he is a very different type of player: a straight guardsman, few frills, a strong and quick finisher off either foot. With Millonarios in Colombia, he seems on the verge of joining Cruzeiro in Brazil, although he is attracting interest from Europe.

But will he prove the latest Colombian to flatter to deceive? The question is pertinent. Villarreal had to sit out the semifinal after picking up a needless yellow card in the Spain match.

Colombia's resources at center forward lack depth, especially since Jhon Durán lost his way, and so it is not unthinkable that Villarreal could be part of a 26-strong squad next year. However, he would need to win the confidence of coach Nestor Lorenzo through some consistent displays at the club level, regardless of which club he finds himself at.

Paraguay senior coach Gustavo Alfaro has a reputation for throwing young players in at the deep end. He kept a close eye on the U20 team and could not fail to have been impressed by Quintana, the captain of the team.

The center back has been around the first team at Cerro Porteño -- one of the country's biggest clubs -- for more than two years, and his progress over the past few months has been impressive. He thrived under the coaching of former international center back Antolin Alcaraz, and looked like a more complete player than the one he played in the qualifying tournament at the start of the year.

In Chile, Quintana combined an unhurried air of class with the traditional resilience of a Paraguayan defender. He clearly has an interesting future and, if he can come up with some strong displays at club level and if Alfaro is characteristically looking to give youth a chance, he may even have an outside possibility of creeping into the World Cup squad.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Hayes is narrowing down the USWNT player pool, and will have matches against Portugal and New Zealand to further hone in

The composition of latest U.S. women's national team roster indicates everything you need to know about what Emma Hayes is thinking at this point in the cycle. Then, for good measure, Hayes said it, too.

“This is really the build towards qualification for next year,” Hayes said. “That's what the start of this cycle actually means.""

After a year of experimenting, changing, introducing and capping players, the USWNT arrives for three October friendlies at something of a turning point. These games - two against Portugal and one against New Zealand - are both an end and a beginning. The post-Olympic era is over, and the 2027 World Cup era is now underway.

It begins with Thursday's match against Portugal in outside of Philadelphia, a match in which many stars return to the fold. The roster Hayes selected is a mix of old and new. They all face a fight to stay involved, and now know what's at stake - and what's on the horizon.

Portugal, in truth, won't be the toughest team on the USWNT's schedule. They've been routinely battered by Europe's elite, with Spain thrashing them three times, scoring a combined 16 goals, and England settling for a February draw before a 6-0 beating in May.

For the USWNT players, this is an opportunity to show what you can do against opposition that can and should be beaten.

Unprecedented 69 Matches Airing Live on FOX, More Than Double FIFA World Cup 2022™

Over 340 Record Hours of Live First-Run Programming to Air Across FOX Sports Platforms for Next Summer's Global Event 

LOS ANGELES – FOX Sports, America's exclusive English-language home for FIFA World Cup 26™, revealed today the historic tournament taking place across the United States, Mexico and Canada will feature an unprecedented 69 matches live on FOX, the most ever in network television history, when the anticipated global sporting event kicks off next summer. The announcement was made by Eric Shanks, CEO & Executive Producer, FOX Sports.

From Thursday, June 11 through Sunday, July 19, 2026, FOX Sports presents its largest FIFA World Cup™ production and broadcast slate to date featuring all 104 matches live across FOX (69) and FS1 (35) with every match live streaming on FOX One and the FOX Sports App.

The 69-match presentation on FOX broadcast television more than doubles the tournament matches in 2022 (34) and accounts for approximately two-thirds of the matches on broadcast television (66%), up from 53% in 2022.

As part of the network's dedicated coverage, FOX Sports will offer over 340 hours of first-run programming around the monumental tournament – a 100-hour increase over FIFA World Cup 2022™. The 340 hours include pre- and post-match coverage with more matches airing in primetime on FOX next summer than any previous FIFA World Cup™ in history.

In celebrating the announcement Shanks said, “FOX Sports' presentation of FIFA World Cup 26™ is going to be the biggest production in our company's 32-year history, and we couldn't be more excited to showcase this once-in-a-lifetime event with more matches on broadcast television than ever before,” said Shanks. “The largest World Cup ever means this is going to be a television event unlike any other with more teams, superstars, storylines and moments that will captivate audiences everywhere.”

FOX Sports' robust coverage of FIFA World Cup 26™ will feature its signature innovative tech-forward approach to covering the tournament with best-in-class broadcast teams, prominent star analysts and soccer legends, digital programming and much more in the works that will be unveiled in the year ahead.

The complete broadcast schedule will be announced following the FIFA World Cup 26™ Final Draw on Friday, Dec. 5, which will air live on FOX and take place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.

FIFA World Cup 26™ marks FOX Sports' sixth all-time presentation of the celebrated tournament following its award-winning and record-breaking coverage for the Men's tournaments in 2022 (Qatar) and 2018 (Russia) and the Women's tournaments in 2023 (Australia & New Zealand), 2019 (France) and its inaugural presentation in 2015 (Canada). The network has won multiple prestigious awards over its 10 years of World Cup coverage including eight Sports Emmy Award wins and numerous nominations.

The biggest-ever edition of the global showcase, FIFA World Cup 26™ will be the first tournament hosted by three countries – United States, Mexico and Canada – with 48 teams playing 104 matches across 16 host cities. Eleven cities will be hosting the tournament in the U.S. including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Appearing in their 12th FIFA World Cup™, the United States Men's National Team Group Stage matches take place Friday, June 12 (Los Angeles), Friday, June 19 (Seattle) and Thursday, June 25 (Los Angeles).

Awful Announcing

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to North America, and Fox is planning for the “biggest production” in the network's history.

Fox announced Wednesday that it would air a record-setting 69 World Cup matches on its broadcast channel during the summer's event, up from just 34 matches during the 2022 World Cup. FS1 will broadcast an additional 35 matches, with all World Cup action also available digitally on the Fox One and Fox Sports apps.

Of course, FIFA is debuting an expanded World Cup format in 2026, increasing the total number of countries to 48 from 32. For Fox, that means more inventory across more match days. Even still, the network is airing a higher percentage of matches on its broadcast network than it did in 2022 (66% versus 53%).

In total, Fox will run 340 hours of programming across the entirety of the event, including pre- and post-match coverage. The 2026 World Cup will also feature the most primetime matches of any World Cup in history.

“Fox Sports' presentation of FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be the biggest production in our company's 32-year history, and we couldn't be more excited to showcase this once-in-a-lifetime event with more matches on broadcast television than ever before,” Fox Sports CEO Eric Shanks said in a press release. “The largest World Cup ever means this is going to be a television event unlike any other with more teams, superstars, storylines and moments that will captivate audiences everywhere.”

With the upcoming World Cup being hosted in North America, Fox will be able to take advantage of favorable television windows for the first time in its history broadcasting the men's tournament. Fox's prior World Cups, 2022 in Qatar and 2018 in Russia, featured match windows in odd hours for the American audience. The 2022 World Cup was also contested in the winter, when Fox was forced to fit matches into its prior football obligations. Neither time zones nor conflicting programming will be an issue for Fox this time around.

The 2026 World Cup is the last in which Fox owns broadcast rights in the United States. FIFA has yet to sell the 2030 tournament to an American broadcaster.

'Sustainability has to be at the heart of every decision at the 2026 World Cup'

In eight months' time the 2026 World Cup will make history as the biggest single sporting event. But not everyone is celebrating.

Amid the excitement, concerns are growing about the environmental cost of the vastly expanded tournament, drawing criticism from academics, players and fan groups.

BBC Sport looks at some of the key issues.

Dr Madeleine Orr is a leading sport and climate expert who believes the 2026 World Cup ""sends a dangerous message about the intentions of Fifa and other events to just get bigger and bigger"".

Next year's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will be the first to be held across an entire continent, feature 48 teams and have 104 matches - 40 more than before. Fifa is considering expanding the tournament to 64 teams for the 2030 edition.

""It's completely misaligned with the promises [Fifa] have made publicly to reduce emissions,"" says Dr Orr, assistant professor of sport ecology at the University of Toronto. ""At this point, it's damage control.""

In their original bid for the 2026 World Cup, the three prospective host nations hoped the event would ""establish new standards for environmental sustainability"" and deliver ""measurable environmental benefits"".

But Dr Orr is sceptical.

""If the new standard is the most carbon-intensive event ever, then yeah,"" she says with sarcasm. ""No, I don't think that's possible,"" she adds.

Recent research from the Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) calculated the expanded tournament will generate more than nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, making it the most ""climate damaging"" edition in the tournament's history.

It could also be one of the hottest. In total, 14 of the 16 host cities for the World Cup are expected to be vulnerable to extreme heat during the tournament. Dr Orr believes that from 12pm to 4pm, many of these venues would be ""virtually unplayable"".

Fifa has suggested adjusting kick-off times and relying on a handful of stadiums with roofs - their plans will become clearer after December's World Cup draw - but critics argue the risk extends beyond the pitch.

""I'm not worried about the athletes,"" Dr Orr explained. ""I worry about 45,000 to 85,000 fans, the 10,000 staff and media personnel who are on site for prolonged periods.

""It's going to be a challenge to figure out how to keep people safe. It is a conversation that's being had, but as of today there is no firm plan on that.""

Fifa declined to comment when approached by BBC Sport, and also declined to answer detailed questions about its sustainability strategy and contingency plans, external in the event extreme weather forces a change to the schedule.

However, speaking this month at the European Football Clubs (EFC) general assembly in Rome, Fifa president Gianni Infantino acknowledged that extreme heat in future summers might force a rethink of football's global calendar.

""We are discussing all the time, and I think it's not just about one World Cup - I think it's a general reflection,"" he said.

""Even to play in some European countries in July, it's very, very hot. So maybe we have to think.

""There are ways we can optimise the calendar. But we are discussing it, and we will see when we come to some conclusion. We just have to have an open mind.""

Cooling breaks were used at Club World Cup games this summer

The struggles of playing in high temperatures in the US have been talked about for some time. In 2017, England forward Rachel Daly was treated for heat exhaustion in hospital after collapsing during a match in Houston, while playing in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

The heat was a constant theme of this summer's Club World Cup. Record-breaking temperatures and violent storms wreaked havoc across the tournament. Lightning meant six games were delayed from 40 minutes to two hours.

Chelsea were one of the teams to struggle with the extreme heat. At their semi-final against Fluminense in New Jersey the temperature rose to more than 35C by kick-off, with midfielder Enzo Fernandez saying the conditions made him ""dizzy"" and were ""very dangerous"".

USA 1994, remembered for the 41C the Republic of Ireland played in against Mexico in Orlando, was the hottest World Cup so far.

BBC's senior weather forecaster Simon King said recently next year's tournament could surpass that.

""In June 2023, an extreme heatwave was seen in Texas, Florida and Mexico for weeks. In Monterrey, Mexico the heat index was close to 50C and in Miami it was as high as 44C.

""It is impossible to say a year ahead whether host cities like those will experience heatwave conditions - climate change has loaded the dice to an increasing chance of this happening. And if it does, it could feasibly be the hottest World Cup on record.""

Five US cities (Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey and San Francisco) which hosted games in 1994 are also hosting in 2026.

Data provided by Climate Central to BBC Sport showed that all those US cities (except San Francisco) experienced significantly more days above 32C, external in June 2025 than they did in 1994.

David Wheeler, former Wycombe Wanderers midfielder and one of football's most vocal environmental advocates, sees climate change increasingly affecting the game, saying it is ""becoming a lot more obvious to players and more of a topic of conversation"".

Wheeler, who is the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Sustainability Champion, believes the sport has a responsibility to do more.

""Unfortunately I don't think the major governing bodies and organisations are really taking that responsibility seriously at the moment,"" he says.

""These organisations don't deserve to profit from sport if they're not going to use their power for the betterment of sport.""

Wheeler also wants footballers to use their platform more to speak out on environmental issues.

""It could have a huge impact,"" he said. ""But it's also important that clubs and fans' groups also insulate the players because there's going to be that inevitable backlash that they're a hypocrite.

""The majority of us are hypocrites to some degree. We're not perfect and that's OK, just as long as we're trying to do as much as we can.""

One player who does not shy away from using his platform to champion environmental issues is Real Betis defender Hector Bellerin.

Speaking after he was named Global Champion at the recent BBC Green Sport Awards, he said it was not easy to promote sustainability in a sport increasingly defined by global expansion.

""It's hard,"" he said, referencing the 2026 World Cup. ""I don't make the decisions and I'm very aware of how the industry works. But I'm not going to stop doing what I love because of decisions made at the top.

""We players often feel like we're treated like numbers or marketable goods. There's more games, more travel, more difficult conditions. And we're just told to hydrate,"" the former Arsenal player added.

""Unless footballers around the world unite - whether that means stopping or taking bold decisions - the wheel's just going to keep turning,"" he said.

Six things Man Utd and Ruben Amorim MUST do to build momentum after massive Anfield win","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/springboard-false-dawn-man-utd-ruben-amorim-build-momentum-massive-anfield-win/blt310fbe0d307e04f1","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Now that the dust has settled on Manchester United's first victory at Anfield in almost a decade, attention turns to what the Red Devils have found the hardest thing to do in the last two years: build some momentum. As satisfying as Sunday's 2-1 win on Merseyside was, it was far from the only time United have overcome low expectations and pulled off a big result against a top team in recent times.

Last season, Ruben Amorim oversaw a 2-2 draw at Anfield, an FA Cup victory at Arsenal (albeit via a penalty shootout), a smash-and-grab win at Manchester City and a 7-1 aggregate win against a highly-fancied Athletic Club in the Europa League semi-finals. But each of those results, which were hailed as the platform on which United would kickstart the Amorim era, proved to be false dawns.

After their cup success at the Emirates, they had to come from behind late on to beat basement club Southampton and then lost three of their next four league games; the last-gasp victory at the Etihad was followed by four successive defeats in all competitions; the Athletic Club results were sandwiched by defeats to Brentford and West Ham, and ultimately only led to United losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.

Amorim is painfully aware of this, and during his Sky Sports interview following Harry Maguire's late winner he was already thinking about the next game, signing off by saying ""It was a good day and now I am concerned about Brighton."" It prompted a light-hearted telling off from interviewer Patrick Davison, but Amorim insisted: ""It means a lot today but tomorrow, it won't mean a lot.""

Having finally won back-to-back league matches for the first time since taking charge at United last November, Amorim's great challenge now is to build some momentum and put together a consistent run of results. To do so, there are a number of elements they must get right:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arne Slot's Liverpool tenure had been plain sailing until late September rolled around, with the Dutchman the picture of cool as he guided the Reds to the Premier League title in his first season at the helm, making the job look easy after stepping into the very large shoes vacated by Jurgen Klopp in 2024. The new campaign had started well enough, albeit while a number of late goals might have papered over the cracks, but things feel different now.

Off the back of consecutive defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea, Sunday's damaging home reverse at the hands of Manchester United - the Red Devils' first victory at Anfield in nine years - has seemingly pushed Slot closer to the end of his tether than we have seen him before.

Of course, no-one likes losing to a fierce rival - especially not at home - but Slot's reaction smacked of a head coach looking for excuses, rather than taking accountability; when he faced the cameras in the tunnel after full-time he had the opportunity to shoulder some blame and address what exactly is going wrong, but instead he aimed repeated digs at United and their tactics under Ruben Amorim.

While he maintained his composed exterior, speaking with a blank expression and without raising his voice, there was something undeniably Klopp-esque about Slot's quiet outburst, with his predecessor a notoriously sore loser during his time in the Anfield dugout. However, when the going got tough, the German tactician knew when to take responsibility - something Slot must learn as Liverpool look to avoid slipping into full-blown crisis mode.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Capaldi explains THAT grid walk on The Cooldown Room

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Nico Hulkenberg scored his first points since Silverstone on race day at the Circuit of The Americas.

Nico Hulkenberg conceded that Sauber's strong show of pace at the United States Grand Prix was “unexpected”.

Hulkenberg was the surprise story in Sprint Qualifying, as he positioned his Sauber in fourth place. But he was unable to translate this into points, after a collision with Oscar Piastri at Turn 1.

While Qualifying for the Grand Prix yielded a more familiar result, the German climbed to eighth place on Sunday, returning the shine to his weekend.

“It was a tough day on Saturday, kind of a low blow with that Turn 1 incident,” said Hulkenberg. “That was disappointing. So we were determined to bounce back in the race.”

Reflecting on two places gained through contact between Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli, he added: “Obviously, we had a bit of help from Carlos to get a little bit more than 10th, but we had good race pace.

“I think it was a clean race, clean execution, so I'm happy after all.”

Asked how much personal encouragement he takes from an overall strong weekend, he said: “I think it's always case-by-case, weekend-by-weekend case.

""It was a little bit unexpected to be so competitive here, so, to be honest, I'm not quite sure what to expect in Mexico. It's a very different track, very different challenges there, so I don't know.

“I don't want to make any predictions. I'll just let myself surprise myself with how it feels on Friday when we roll out.”

In the sister Sauber, Gabriel Bortoleto finished in 18th place after early contact with Alex Albon at the first corner on Lap 1.

“I was fighting with the car ahead and he touched my rear axle and he spun, so I don't really know what happened there,” said the Brazilian.

“The race was quite boring,"" he added: “When you are starting at the back, it's difficult to make your way up, especially when you are a bit stuck behind other cars and it's quite difficult to overtake. There's a lot of high speed sections here, and when you get to the straight line, you've already cooked your tyres.

“Unless you have a very big advantage – that I didn't have today – it's quite difficult to overtake.”

Capaldi explains THAT grid walk on The Cooldown Room

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Fred Vasseur watched his drivers come home third and fourth at the end of a mixed weekend in Austin, with Charles Leclerc able to grab Ferrari's first podium since Belgium.

Fred Vasseur watched his drivers come home third and fourth at the end of a mixed weekend in Austin, with Charles Leclerc scoring Ferrari's first podium since Belgium.

The Scuderia are embroiled in a tight fight with Red Bull and Mercedes for second in the Constructors' Championship, and Vasseur has vowed to “fight until the last minute” which was evidenced by the bold strategy calls the team made at the Circuit of The Americas.

Leclerc was the only driver in the top 10 to risk starting on the soft tyres on Sunday, and he put those to good use from third on the grid to overtake Lando Norris for P2 in the opening corners.

Although he ultimately lost out to the McLaren, Leclerc did more than enough to finish on the podium, and made life difficult for Norris by twice forcing him to pass on track to re-take P2.

“We [have] three teams in 10 points, something like this,” Vasseur said after the race, addressing the battle for P2 in the Constructors'.

“Max [Verstappen] is scoring big points each weekend, but the most important is the addition of the two cars. Let's be focused until the end. Let's try to get the best of what we have.

“I think it's a good feeling to be back on the podium, to be back with the two cars. We will fight until the last minute.”

On Leclerc's soft tyre start, Vasseur was quick to shut down any suggestions that the strategy had been a “gamble”. Instead, he highlighted that the decision was part of an aggressive Ferrari strategy to go all out for victory.

“It's a bet more than a gamble. I'm not sure if the others were going for medium-hard or medium-soft, but... it's also the best option for us to be P1 and up on P1. And we tried to do it. But... it's not a gamble,” he reiterated.

Leclerc drove a defensive masterclass in Austin to keep Norris at bay for lap after lap, eventually yielding only when his soft tyres were close to the end of their lifespan. He was ably backed up by Lewis Hamilton too, who came home fourth, to match his season's best Grand Prix finish.

“He had a very strong pace from the beginning of the weekend. Except Q3, perhaps SQ3, but the pace was there from the beginning. The pace was there the last couple of weekends also,” Vasseur added.

“It's the first time that we are doing a decent weekend, putting everything together without mistakes. It's been good from the beginning.”

Hamilton remains without a podium since joining the Scuderia, although he does have a Sprint victory from back in China. The combined points haul from the two drivers mean Ferrari are just seven points behind Mercedes now in the fight for P2 in the Teams' Championship.

But the thing that impressed Vasseur the most was how his team bounced back from a difficult start to the weekend, with Sprint Qualifying the lowlight when neither driver could extract much pace from the car.

To go from there to a rostrum and a P4 finish in the Grand Prix, beating a McLaren and both Mercedes cars was an encouraging performance as the F1 circus moves straight to Mexico for the next round of the Championship.

“It's really up and down,” he confessed. “Probably a bit more for us and probably a bit less visible for McLaren and Red Bull now. Because they have a kind of advantage in terms of pure performance.

“When they are not doing well, they are still P2, P3. When we are not doing well, we are P10. But it's true that it was a very good recovery from the team after Friday evening.”

Capaldi explains THAT grid walk on The Cooldown Room

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

From McLaren's need to bounce back, to a host of rookies making their FP1 debuts – here are the big stories ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix.

After a huge race weekend in Austin, another one awaits as the teams make the relatively short trip south to Mexico City. With 40 points covering the top three drivers in the championship and plenty of young drivers set to get track time, it's going to be another action-packed three days of track running at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Only a week ago, in the build-up to Austin, we pointed out how the Drivers' Championship picture could change quickly across the coming double header. The first part of that certainly delivered on that front, with the United States Grand Prix seeing Max Verstappen close the gap to Oscar Piastri to just 40 points.

It's a remarkable run of form over the past four races that has seen Verstappen take 64 points out of Piastri's lead, and with five rounds to go he's very much in the title mix. But having another race just one weekend later can work both ways.

Verstappen's recent form makes him a real threat, and Red Bull will hope to continue the momentum they have built up since Monza, but McLaren have still had a quick car in that time. Piastri struggled to match Lando Norris for pace at Circuit of The Americas, but the lead McLaren was very much on par with Verstappen's performance level when not fighting Charles Leclerc.

The pressure might be building on McLaren, but one strong weekend can alleviate some of that, while Verstappen says he has to be “perfect” every time to stay in the frame.

Drivers' standings after Austin

As we reach the business end of the season and the title fight hots up between not only the McLaren drivers but Verstappen as well, so too does the tension between the teams themselves.

In Austin, Red Bull were fined €50,000 – of which €25,000 is suspended until the end of the season – for a team member entering the area around an access gate in the pit wall after the formation lap had started.

Although the stewards' verdict didn't make any specific claims about why the team member entered the area, there were suggestions in the paddock that they were trying to remove a strip of tape on the pit wall that had been placed there by McLaren to try and help Lando Norris line up in the optimum position in his grid slot. McLaren adding that tape is not against the rules – but nor is removing it.

Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies was asked about the incident in his post-race media briefing in Austin, saying: “I think we were summoned because it was felt that sometime during the grid procedures, one of our guys had not followed the official instructions and we spoke with our people, they are very positive that they have followed our instructions at all times, so I think it's probably a misunderstanding there.”

Regardless, the rumours will likely ramp up the rivalry between the two teams entering the final five race weekends of the year. 

It has been a tough 2025 for Ferrari so far, with no race victory to their name after such a strong end to 2024 that saw them fighting for the Teams' Championship with McLaren.

As part of last year's title run-in, Ferrari had a particularly productive double header when they won both Austin and Mexico, as Charles Leclerc led home a 1-2 at Circuit of The Americas before Carlos Sainz triumphed at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

Although the level of performance has not been to quite the same level so far this season, there was still a strong showing in Austin as Leclerc finished third and Lewis Hamilton fourth, both qualifying well on Saturday after a tricky start to the weekend.

Leclerc was having to defend from Norris for much of the race, but despite losing out in that battle, he was still competitive compared to race winner Verstappen, and the recovery after a tough Friday was impressive.

If last year can be used as a barometer, then Ferrari could well be closer to the front once again this weekend – and if they can get their car working amid the unique characteristics of Mexico City, it could be an outside threat for victory.

Ever since the rules were made mandatory for teams to run a rookie driver in a select number of FP1 sessions each year, a few traditional venues have emerged when teams make use of their young talents.

One of those is Mexico City, due to the nature of the circuit – as in, not a street circuit such as Las Vegas, Singapore or Azerbaijan – and the fact it's not a Sprint weekend. Austin, Brazil and Qatar all see just one FP1 session held, so teams can't afford to take that away from one of their race drivers.

So this weekend in Mexico there will be plenty of rookies looking to make a good impression, including at Aston Martin where American Jak Crawford will make his FP1 debut, and at Williams where Crawford's F2 title rival Luke Browning also gets another outing.

There's a change at McLaren, too, where home hero Pato O'Ward will hope to impress while also trying to help the team's chances of getting back to winning ways.

One driver not taking part but also in the news this week is O'Ward's former IndyCar rival Colton Herta, who has now had his 2026 plans confirmed after signing with Hitech for a Formula 2 season.

The beauty of a 24-race Formula 1 calendar is the wide range of venues we race on during a year, with different characteristics and climates across the 21 countries that host a Grand Prix.

Yet some races stand out more than others as being particularly different, and Mexico City is one of them due to the altitude of the circuit. Located more than 2,200m above sea level – and some 1,400m higher than the next highest venue on the schedule – the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez provides a stern test.

The thinner air at such an altitude has a big impact on both the car's aerodynamics and power unit performance, with effectively less air hitting the car. That means even a high downforce set-up – akin to Monaco levels – will have a low-downforce feeling such as at Monza, with cars sliding around more.

The power unit also doesn't get as much air into it, potentially impacting reliability, while that air is also then less effective at cooling components on the car. Often drivers have to make a move quickly or drop back for a bit of clear space to keep the car cool, adding to the considerations during a race.

It all plays out in front of one of the most vocal and vibrant crowds of the year, with the huge numbers that surround the track in the Foro Sol section at the end of the lap a particular highlight.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

A number of junior, test and reserve drivers will be stepping up to participate in Free Practice 1 at the Mexico City Grand Prix.

A total of nine rookie drivers will be in action during Friday's first practice session at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with McLaren, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, Williams, Haas, Alpine and Aston Martin all making line-up changes for FP1.

Under F1's regulations, every full-time driver is required to make way for a rookie – viewed as someone who has started no more than two Grands Prix – in two practice sessions across the 2025 season, an increase on the one mandated last year.

The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez has previously been a popular choice for these outings, with five rookies participating in the opening practice hour at last year's event – including one who will make their return this time around...

McLaren reserve driver Pato O'Ward will again get behind the wheel at his home event for the second year running.

The Mexican – who finished the 2025 NTT INDYCAR SERIES as runner-up for Arrow McLaren at the end of the summer – was confirmed to drive one of the squad's MCL39 machines at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez back in May.

As well as gaining valuable track time during the weekend, 26-year-old O'Ward will provide set-up feedback and support for full-time drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Replacing George Russell at Mercedes during FP1 will be Fred Vesti, with the squad's test and reserve driver set to make his fourth practice appearance for the Silver Arrows.

Vesti previously made his F1 weekend debut in Mexico back in 2023, before another outing followed later that year in Abu Dhabi. While Kimi Antonelli fulfilled the team's rookie running in 2024, Vesti returned to action this season for FP1 in Bahrain.

Alongside his simulator duties for Mercedes, the 23-year-old Dane has been competing in the IMSA Sportscar series this year and recently claimed back-to-back victories in the category.

Over at Ferrari, Antonio Fuoco will be making his maiden practice outing in Mexico City. The Italian is set to replace Lewis Hamilton as he gets behind the wheel of the SF-25.

As well as acting as a development driver for the team, 29-year-old Fuoco races in the World Endurance Championship for Ferrari AF Corse and was previously part of the team to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024.

Fuoco has taken part in F1 testing sessions for the Scuderia in the past, including an appearance at last year's end-of-season test in Abu Dhabi.

F2 racer Arvid Lindblad will participate in his second FP1 session for Red Bull at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, having previously driven the RB21 during the British Grand Prix weekend in July.

While he replaced Yuki Tsunoda on that occasion, the British driver will step in for Max Verstappen this time around.

With two rounds remaining in the 2025 Formula 2 campaign, 18-year-old Lindblad currently sits in seventh place of the Drivers' Championship, with three podiums – including two wins – to his name so far.

Carlos Sainz is set to hand his Williams FW47 over to Luke Browning for the first practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend.

This will be 23-year-old Browning's third FP1 outing, the Briton having previously gotten behind the wheel in Bahrain earlier this year as well as at the 2024 season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Like Lindblad, Browning – a member of the Williams Racing Driver Academy – is currently racing in Formula 2, where he holds P3 in the Drivers' standings.

Aston Martin Young Driver Jak Crawford will be in action for the team during Free Practice 1, marking the 20-year-old's debut F1 weekend appearance.

Crawford is set to drive Lance Stroll's AMR25 for the session and arrives into the event with plenty of mileage for the squad under his belt, having logged more than 2,000km of testing in the AMR22, AMR23 and AMR24 cars.

The American racer has clinched four wins so far during the 2025 Formula 2 campaign, putting him in second place of the Drivers' Championship.

At Haas, Ollie Bearman is sitting out FP1 while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa makes his fourth practice outing of the season.

After starting the season as part of the Alpine stable – during which time he participated in first practice for the Enstone-based outfit at Suzuka – Hirakawa joined Haas in April, with the Japanese racer going on to make FP1 appearances for the American squad in Bahrain and Barcelona.

It will not be 31-year-old Hirakawa's final showing of the campaign, either, as he will also be in action during the opening practice hour at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Taking the place of Liam Lawson, Japanese driver Ayumu Iwasa will step in at Racing Bulls.

Iwasa will be marking his fourth Free Practice 1 appearance, having driven for Red Bull in Bahrain earlier this year – and twice for the Racing Bulls squad (in their RB guise) last year.

Iwasa is currently competing in Japan's Super Formula series, where he sits third in the standings.

And finally, Paul Aron will be driving the Alpine A525 in first practice in Mexico.

The Estonian, who was third in the F2 championship last year, will take Pierre Gasly's car for the session.

It will be 21-year-old Aron's fourth FP1 appearance of the year, after he drove for Sauber at Silverstone and the Hungaroring, and in Monza for Alpine.

This weekend's outing could be crucial for Aron who, according to team boss Flavio Briatore, is in contention to take the second race seat alongside Gasly for next year.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Racing Bulls endured one of it's more difficult weekends of the 2025 Formula 1 season at the Circuit of The Americas, with neither Liam Lawson nor Isack Hadjar scoring.

Liam Lawson was left frustrated after narrowly missing out on points to Fernando Alonso at the United States Grand Prix – and reckons one particular moment may have cost him his chance of scoring.

Lawson has scored points on just one occasion across the last five weekends, and came agonisingly close to adding to his tally on Sunday.

Battling with Alonso throughout, he was also forced to pay close attention to the second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, who recovered from 19th place, after a five-place grid penalty, to finish 12th. Lawson finished just one place ahead of Stroll in 11th.

“The start was not amazing,” reflected the Racing Bulls driver. “I just got boxed at Turn 1 and lost a place, which in the end is probably what has cost us a point. But overall, we weren't really quick enough, to be honest.

“It's very hard to overtake, and Aston had us basically one in front and one behind today; they basically had control of us, which was frustrating. I just couldn't overtake Fernando, and was having to defend from behind, so a frustrating race.”

Asked if it was a weekend of missed opportunities, Lawson added: “I think we had points available all weekend that we've missed out on, so it's pretty frustrating.”

It was a similar story for Isack Hadjar. After a crash in Qualifying saw him start from the back of the pack, the Frenchman started with hard tyres fitted, in a bid to gain positions should an early accident occur, as it had in the Sprint. But it didn't come together and Hadjar eventually finished in 16th, with the highlight of his race being a battle with Pierre Gasly in the final stages.

“This weekend, I haven't shown real pace, and my confidence in the car is not great, so we were not very competitive,” he said afterwards.

“Obviously, the strategy was betting on a long first stint and hoping for a Safety Car, but it was a very clean race, apparently. Just a very boring race. At least I had fun with Pierre at the end.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer gives his take on the Argentine ignoring the team call to hold station behind Pierre Gasly in Austin – and what it might mean for his chances of keeping the seat next year.

Franco Colapinto drew the ire from his Alpine team for ignoring their call for him to sit behind Pierre Gasly in the final stages of the United States Grand Prix, as Max Verstappen approached to put a lap on both Alpine cars.

It was a call that clearly frustrated the Argentinian driver who hasn't got a confirmed seat for 2026 yet – and with plenty to prove, he showed some fight on track.

Disobeying team orders is always risky business for a driver, particularly when you are eager for a new contract, but to be honest I didn't mind seeing it from Colapinto here. Personally I felt the team orders were overkill from Alpine.

	The company says that Mattel and Hasbro will be named global co-master toy licensees, giving each company exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and distribute products based on the animated film, beginning in 2026. 




	Mattel is developing products across multiple categories. including dolls, action figures, accessories, collectibles, playsets, and collaborations with co-brands, with Hasbro's categories spanning special feature plush, youth electronics and role play, among other categories, with a special KPop Demon Hunters edition of Monopoly Deal the first product to launch, shipping in January. Other products will roll out throughout the year and into the holidays.

	“KPop Demon Hunters unleashed a global fan frenzy — we're talking dancing, singing, and more screaming than anyone was emotionally prepared for,” said Marian Lee, Netflix's CMO. “HUNTR/X showed us that a truly great trio is more than the sum of its parts. Netflix, Mattel and Hasbro joining forces on this first-of-its-kind collaboration means fans can finally get their hands on the best dolls, games, and merchandise they've been not-so-subtly demanding on every social platform known to humanity. As Rumi, Mira and Zoey say — for the fans!”

KPop Demon Hunters was a surprise sensation for Netflix after it was released over the summer, ultimately becoming the most popular film in the history of the platform. The film was produced by Sony Pictures as part of a slate sold to Netflix, but outside of some music rights (the music is, in fairness, quite popular), Netflix holds the IP rights, including to consumer products, Sony Pictures CEO Ravi Ahuja said last month.


	Netflix has since brought the film to movie theaters (it will return later this month), and has held talks with Sony about producing a sequel.


	The unexpected nature of the hit means that the company has been playing catchup when it comes to consumer demand. The company worked with Spirit Halloween to deliver Halloween costumes in time for this year's holiday.


	Consumer products are a lucrative revenue stream for media companies, with their partners footing most of the bill for development, manufacturing and distribution. Not only are the margins strong, but products help with brand affinity. For Netflix, which is still more nascent in the space than its traditional competitors, the KPop Demon Hunter deals mark a major expansion.


	“We're thrilled to deepen our partnership with Netflix through the record-shattering, chart-topping KPop Demon Hunters,” said Roberto Stanichi, chief global brand officer for Mattel. “Celebrating the breakout characters at the heart of the film, Mattel will harness our world-class design, creative, and marketing expertise to introduce a broad range of products across major categories to the delight of fans around the world.”

	











	“KPop Demon Hunters is a powerful pop culture phenomenon with global resonance—one that aligns seamlessly with our portfolio of iconic brands and our commitment to innovation,” added Tim Kilpin, president of toy, licensing, and entertainment at Hasbro. “This collaboration with Netflix enables us to bring the film's dynamic universe to life beyond the screen, offering fans immersive new ways to engage through play. Together, we're building a product lineup that unites storytelling and fandom in a uniquely Hasbro way.”

Raúl Castillo and Martin Starr round out the cast of Michelle Garza Cervera's modern spin for Hulu on the hit 1992 Curtis Hanson thriller about a vengeful nanny.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Rewatching the juicy parental-nightmare thriller The Hand That Rocks the Cradle three decades after its release is a reminder of what a polished, versatile craftsman the late Curtis Hanson was. During the 10 years of his filmmaking career that followed, he directed the white-knuckle adventure thriller The River Wild; the hard-boiled noir L.A. Confidential, which won him an Oscar as co-writer; the bittersweet comedy-drama Wonder Boys; and the quasi-memoir Eminem hip-hop saga 8 Mile — all of which still hold up.


	It's no big surprise that Hulu's new take on The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, directed by Michelle Garza Cervera from a script by Micah Bloomberg, can be filed under “unnecessary remakes.” By those standards, it's far from the worst. Who remembers 2008's The Women, 1993's Born Yesterday or 2002's Swept Away, just to name three mangled classics? But atrocity is a low bar to clear.

The Bottom Line

	
	Innocuous but inessential.
	



Release date: Wednesday, Oct. 22Cast: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Maika Monroe, Raúl Castillo, Martin Starr, Mileiah Vega, Riki Lindhome, Shannon Cochran, Yvette LuDirector: Michelle Garza CerveraScreenwriter: Micah Bloomberg, based on the screenplay by Amanda Silver

									Rated R,
								1 hour 45 minutes			






	This modern twist on a screenplay that originated as Amanda Silver's film school thesis doubles down on traumatic history and victim-blaming and stirs in some undercooked female homoerotic tension. But it dilutes the original's lurid pleasures and destabilizes the central dynamic by putting the mother who has it all and the nanny hell-bent on destroying her life in a mental-instability contest. Maybe two damaged women for the price of one seemed a good idea on paper?

	It also makes an underwhelming tradeoff in the sharp-best-friend-who-discovers-the-truth department. For many of us, hard-edged luxury real estate broker Marlene Craven ranks among Julianne Moore's most delicious performances. In these joyless times in which constructive criticism can get you marched off to HR, hearing Marlene snap at her Harvard-educated male assistant is like good sex.


	Real estate attorney Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is expecting her second child when she meets Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe) while doing pro bono tenants' rights work for low-income people requiring housing assistance. Soon after the baby is born, they run into each other again at a farmers' market, where Caitlin is alarmed to hear that Polly is still struggling. But she offers her services as a babysitter.


	Despite Monroe playing the quietly intense Polly with the hollow-eyed stare of an Olsen twin and the warmth and social skills of Travis Bickle, Caitlin hires her after a cursory check of her childcare experience. Her architect husband Miguel (Raúl Castillo) agrees that Caitlin is stretched thin and could use some help. He worries that her struggles are a replay of the post-partum depression that followed the birth of their first child, Emma (Mileiah Vega), who's now 10 and prone to tantrums, usually directed at her controlling mother.


	While doing little to hide her creepy vibe, Polly starts in on small acts of sabotage — she messes with Caitlin's meds, putting her more on edge; spikes the cioppino at a dinner party, giving everyone upset stomachs; and ignores Caitlin's no-sugar veto for Emma and her baby sister Josie. Instead, she makes a secret pact with Emma over cupcakes and turns the infant off her mother's unsweetened breast milk.

	











	Somehow though, Polly makes herself indispensable, so when she starts talking about leaving unaffordable Los Angeles, Caitlin and Miguel move her into the guest quarters intended for his aging Mexican parents. (In a wry dig that's the closest the movie comes to a subversive vein, Caitlin reveals, “His Mom's no fan of the States.”)


	The airy house is a handsome contemporary construction in wood and floor-to-ceiling glass (we know someone will go through at least one pane). But what kind of family-in-peril thriller fails to take advantage of a swimming pool just begging for mayhem?


	Polly early on casually tells Caitlin she dates women, prompting her employer to volunteer that she was also queer before she met Miguel. But whatever sexual frisson this was intended to implant, it's too underdeveloped to add much, even after Polly catches Caitlin staring through her window while she gets into some erotic asphyxiation sex with her punky friend Amelia (Yvette Lu).


	Meanwhile, the nanny's behavior becomes more concerning to Caitlin, notably after she brings home fireworks for Emma to play with. But only Caitlin's friend and colleague Stuart (Martin Starr) takes her fears seriously enough to investigate, which is a bad decision. Duh.


	Miguel is more convinced that his wife is having another post-partum episode, overreacting even to Emma's abrupt declaration at the dinner table that she wants a wife, not a husband, when she grows up. Castillo, as always, is an appealing presence, but he can't do much with a role in which he shows all the signs of being a loving, sensitive partner and yet refuses to listen until it's almost too late.

	











	Polly's background is suggested through fragments of childhood hardship she shares with Emma and a horror-style prologue showing a young girl standing in front of a burning house. But unlike Hanson's film, where we knew from the start what was driving the vengeful widow going by “Peyton” (played with a vicious chill by Rebecca De Mornay), Bloomberg's script teases out the root of Polly's seething grudge for far too long.


	By the time questions are answered, not just regarding Polly but also the way in which her history intersects with Caitlin's, the glacial pacing and lack of suspense have dulled the thriller's hook. Mexican filmmaker Garza Cervera's debut was the well-received 2022 motherhood body horror Huesera. But her second feature, while quite slick, has the insipid feel of a Lifetime movie.


	Attempts to bulk up on dread with a whispery synth score and gloomy vocal tracks by Low and Nick Cave don't yield much in terms of atmosphere, and the jolts of ugly violence seem inorganic to the general tone. 


	The actors are fine, though Monroe has been more effective when subjected to menace (in movies like It Follows and Longlegs) rather than doling it out. Winstead (looking very Rosamund Pike) does what's required of her, to the extent of making Caitlin abrasive as well as disturbed. But this is a remake with few persuasive reasons to exist.


	What a sad testament to the state of the industry that while the original film topped the U.S. box office for four consecutive weeks and went on to turn a tidy profit with worldwide grosses of $140 million against a budget of less than $12 million, the redo will drop on Hulu and, like all but a handful of prestige streaming originals, be swiftly forgotten.

Each of the celebrities and their pro partners danced to tracks from the beloved musical-turned-film, including “Popular,” “The Wizard And I” and “Defying Gravity.”


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains spoilers from episode six of Dancing With the Stars season 34.]


	The Dancing With the Stars cast were quite literally dancing through life on Tuesday's Wicked Night.




	Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold were eliminated from the show at the end of the night. Their exit from the competition comes after last week's Dedication Night, where no couples were eliminated. 


	Contestants celebrated the forthcoming sequel to Jon M. Chu's Wicked with ballroom performances set to music from across the beloved musical-turned-film. And who better to serve as a guest judge for the night than Chu himself, joining mainstay judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli with a night full of dance to commemorate the upcoming Wicked: For Good.

	Heading into Wicked Night, the cast was intact with 10 contestants at the midway point of the competition. Remaining celebrities include Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin, comedian-actor Andy Richter and Pentatonix's Hoying, who was eliminated Tuesday night. 


	For the first time throughout season 34, Efron rose to the top of the leaderboard last week while performing a number set to his brother Zac's song “Rewrite the Stars.” He notably became the first contestant to earn four nines, marking the highest score of the competition at that point with a 35/40. 

	











	But he was quickly dethroned, as Leavitt earned the first set of 10s of the competition for her quickstep to “Popular.” All of the judges, except Hough, gave the reality star a 10, leaving her just one point away from earning a perfect 40/40. However, she didn't stay at the top of the leaderboard alone for long, as Chiles also earned a 39/40, tying her as the top scoring couple of week six.


	Wicked Night proved to be a highlight for many more of the celebrities, including Irwin, Hendrix and Fishel, who all scored a 36/40, each earning nines from all four of the judges. It's no surprise that contestants have begun earning their highest marks of season 34, as only five weeks of competition remain until the grand finale.


	At the end of each night of the competition, the couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final dance is completed.


	Because no one was eliminated from the competition last week, the results from Dedication Night were carried over and combined with the contestant's Wicked Night scores. 


	See the full list of scores for week six of DWTS season 34 (aka Wicked Night) below.


	Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 28/40 (ELIMINATED) Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 35/40Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 36/40Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 39/40Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 32/40Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 27/40Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 36/40Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 32/40Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 36/40Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 39/40












	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

It's pretty ridiculous.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	“Pursue peace of mind,” Eddie Murphy says in the trailer (below) for Netflix documentary Being Eddie. “If you've got that, then you've got it all.”


	It's great advice. But then again, it's coming from the guy who next says that Rob Dyrdek's MTV clip show Ridiculousness is “the best show on TV,” so weight it as you will.




	Pete Davidson, one of the many, many comics honored to be interviewed for Being Eddie and Murphy's co-star in Amazon heist comedy The Pickup, closes the trailer with this thought: “I love that [Murphy] is sitting around watching Ridiculousness. That's fucking hilarious.”

	It kind of is. The synopsis for Being Eddie is pretty funny itself.


	“It goes without saying that there is only one Eddie Murphy,” it begins. “No other teen comedian shared a stage with Jerry Seinfeld at 17, and joined the cast of Saturday Night Live right out of high school.”


	OK, that's all earnest, accurate and totally crazy when you think about it.


	“No actor has ever played a cop, a doctor and a donkey — and dominated every facet of Hollywood he's touched,” it continues, introducing some sort of entertainment trifecta that no one has ever considered before.


	“Fewer still have been an A-list celebrity for over four decades, and never succumbed to its darker side. Murphy's unusual combination of explosive charisma, focused ambition, raw talent and deep-set circumspection puts him in a league of his own,” the synopsis reads. “For the first time ever, Murphy invites the public into his home to revisit his breathtaking body of work, all the while revealing the dazzling interior life that has long driven — and grounded — this once-in-a-century star.”

	











Joining Murphy (and Davidson) in the doc are Seinfeld, Arsenio Hall, Brian Grazer, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Jamie Foxx, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jerry Bruckheimer, John Landis, Kenan Thompson, Kevin Hart, Michael Che, Ruth Carter, Tracee Ellis Ross and Tracy Morgan. Being Eddie is directed by Angus Wall and produced by John Davis, John Fox, Charisse Hewitt-Webster, Terry Leonard and Kent Kubena.


Being Eddie premieres on Netflix on Nov. 12.

From a first season of scrapped scripts and sparring producers to a hit crackling with chemistry: The cast and creator of ‘Nobody Wants This' reveal the backstory of fall's most anticipated return.


							By 

	Lacey Rose


Writer-At-Large


	There are the rare television shows that seem to sail through the various stages of production blissfully. They have writers rooms that are cohesive, producers who share a vision and distributors that are confident in what they're readying for release. On these shows, episodes typically come in on time and without significant issue, and the stars involved are primed for success.


Nobody Wants This was not one of these shows.




	The Jewish rom-com, starring Kristen Bell as an agnostic sex-and-relationship podcaster and Adam Brody as a laid-back rabbi, spent the better part of last year mired in chaos. Production on season one had fallen woefully behind schedule, as whole episodes were scrapped, scripts were written at the eleventh hour and producers, including Bell, began second-guessing the series' tone.

					Netflix Revenues Keep Surging as Streaming Giant Hits Key Wall Street Expectations		
			









	“There were a lot of different visions,” says Erin Foster, who, as a first-time creator and showrunner, found herself routinely fighting for hers. “I just kept saying, ‘Guys, please trust me.' “


	But on Sept. 26, 2024, the 10-episode first season dropped in its entirety on Netflix and any lingering concerns seemed to swiftly vanish. Outlets like The New York Times and New York magazine lavished it with praise — “Compulsively watchable!” “Instantly combustible chemistry!” — and the show spent six consecutive weeks on the streamer's Top 10 list. By the year's end, Nobody Wants This was viewed 57 million times and went on to pick up nominations at every major awards show, including the Emmys, Golden Globes, SAG Awards and Writers Guild Awards.

	











	“The fact that I saw pictures of Halloween costumes feels like the benchmark of cultural penetration,” says Brody, who was thrust back into the zeitgeist for the first time since The O.C. aired two decades earlier.


	Even Bell, whose résumé is lined with hits including Frozen, had never received this much attention for a role. “And now, if you ask me, I'd say, ‘I believe Erin Foster will become a reference point in TV and film meetings going forward,' ” says the actress, who, like many in the Nobody Wants This cast, was interviewed over the Jewish High Holy Days. “People will say, ‘Oh, it's Tim Burton-esque. It's Wes Anderson-esque. It's Erin Foster-esque.' I just wasn't adept enough in season one to realize it.”


	Ahead of season two, which drops Oct. 23, there was a sizable reshuffling behind the scenes. Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan, both veterans of HBO's Girls, were brought in to co-run the series — and, per Foster, “help get the train back on the tracks.” And by all accounts, they have. In fact, the second season seemed to sail through the various stages of production blissfully. They have a writers room that's cohesive, producers who share a vision and a distributor in Netflix that is confident in what it's readying for release.


	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.


	***


	Half a decade earlier, Foster had all but given up on Hollywood.

	











	For years, the daughter of music producer David Foster and former model Rebecca Dyer had tried to get a toehold, first as an actress, with largely forgettable guest roles on series including The O.C., then as a writer. There was reality TV parody Barely Famous with her sister Sara at VH1, but mild cult status couldn't stave off its cancellation. Then Foster sold a semi-autobiographical sitcom pilot to Fox in 2018 — in addition to writing and producing, she starred opposite Don Johnson as her playboy dad. It was over before it started. “They pull out the edge and specificity and they water it down, and then they don't pick it up because it's not saying anything,” says Foster. She walked away wondering, who needs it?


	But just as her professional life had seemingly stalled, her personal one took off. At 35, Foster met the love of her life, a Jewish music executive named Simon Tikhman, and agreed to convert. In fact, she was regaling her manager, Oly Obst, with stories of the Jewish conversion process when he suggested there was a TV show in her experience. Its title, he told her, should be Shiksa. Foster agreed to write a script for 20th Television, where she was still in a deal. If it was picked up, she'd star as a loosely fictionalized version of herself.


	The only catch: Tikhman didn't know about any of it and was somewhat horrified when he found out. Unlike Foster, who was raised in a very public Los Angeles family, he wasn't comfortable with his private life becoming public. So for years, Foster dragged her heels. “It was a real journey,” says Sara Foster, with whom Erin shares a podcast, a clothing line and a production company. “It took many forms: ‘I don't want to do it,' ‘Fuck it, let's not do it,' ‘Nobody even wants this show.' ” In 2021, Erin finally settled in and started writing.

	











	By then, Sara, the more business-minded of the sisters, had “full-on stalked” Steve Levitan and convinced the Modern Family co-creator to join her and her sister as an executive producer. “Erin's such a good writer, and she understands these characters better than anyone,” says Sara, “but we needed to bring someone on who could help us sell it.” In addition to early structural contributions, Levitan proposed a more dramatic hook: Rather than have Brody's character be your run-of-the-mill Jewish guy whose family doesn't want him marrying outside the religion, make him a rabbi, so his profession complicates it, too. It would give the rom-com real stakes — and by distancing it from Foster's real life, prevent a premature divorce.


	The completed script was sent all around town — and every outlet that read it passed. “The feedback was always, like, ‘This feels small,' ” says Foster. Then Tracey Pakosta at Netflix got her hands on it and instantly saw the value. “I didn't think there was anything small about it,” she says. “I felt like everybody would see a piece of themselves in these characters, not only in the big romance, but also in the relationship Joanne has with her sister, Morgan [played by Succession‘s Justine Lupe].”


	Netflix was in, but they'd require a bigger star at the center. If Foster's ego was bruised, she didn't let on. In fact, she told Bell, who was the streamer's first and only choice to play Joanne, that staying behind the scenes would allow her to move forward with the show and have a baby at the same time. So Bell signed on and promptly began studying Foster's mannerisms and tacking up images of her various looks to the walls. “It was full Single White Female,” jokes Bell.

	











	Foster will tell you they saw “every Jewish man in Hollywood” to play opposite Bell. The truth is, they approached comedian Nick Kroll first, but he passed. “This is like Matt Damon turning down Avatar,” Bell's husband, Dax Shepard, teased when he had Kroll on his podcast earlier this year. Foster was bummed at the time, though she concedes it would have been a very different show — certainly not the millennial fever dream of The O.C.'s Seth Cohen (Brody) and Veronica Mars (Bell). “There was just something validating to me about a comedian [like Kroll] as the lead that felt like, ‘Oh, I'm making a real comedy,' ” she explains. “It was a lot of my own insecurities as a writer.”


	All the while, Bell was insistent that Brody was perfect for the part. She even threw together a reel of their work in Showtime's House of Lies and the 2013 film Some Girls to showcase their chemistry. “I was like, ‘Guys, you're going to need an ice pack while you watch these scenes,' ” says Bell. “I just kept saying, like, ‘Trust me, Adam knows how to stare dopily at someone and so do I, and that's kind of all you need.' I mean, I'd love to tell you it's real. It's not. We both just know how to do it.”


	Foster warmed to the idea almost immediately. So they sent Brody the script, and he agreed to a Zoom. He had questions about where the show was headed, many of which Foster couldn't answer. Still, she was charming, and so was the script. “I was like, ‘Well, fuck it,' ” says Brody. “‘I really like her, I like this episode, and I love Kristen and it's Netflix and there are a lot of reasons to just roll the dice.' ”

	











	***


	The first of many battles was over the show's title. Foster was dead set on Shiksa, but Netflix executives balked. It would be hard to say, they reasoned, and even harder to spell — more importantly, a global audience likely wouldn't know what it means. (According to Brody's character, it's an old Yiddish term that now mostly refers to “a hot, blond non-Jew.”) A few dozen other titles were batted around; for a stretch, they'd settled on Heartburn, but it was already taken by a Nora Ephron book and film, so they pivoted to Nobody Wants This.


	“We were all like, ‘Man, I hope the reviewers like the show because if not, they're going to dog-fuck us into the ground with that title,' ” says Timothy Simons, who was cast as Noah's doofy brother, Sasha. “The headline writes its fucking self: ‘Nobody Wants This Show.' “


	They filmed the first two episodes, and then took a preplanned break to assess what was and wasn't working. In that time, the cast got to see a rough cut of episode one. For Brody, in particular, it was a massive relief. “I was blown away,” he says. “There was an energy to it, a sort of sexiness that I wasn't sure about as we were making it. With some of the banter, as I was doing it, I'd be like, ‘Is this going to make me want to gag or is this charming?' “


	Then came the table read for episodes three and four.

	











	As three was initially written, Joanne and Noah have just had, per the script, “the best kiss either of them have ever had,” and then his Jewish ex-girlfriend calls to say her mother has died. As her family's rabbi, Noah feels compelled to be there for his ex and her relatives as they sit shiva. Foster had wanted the conflict to be embedded in the Jewish grieving process, which is completely foreign to Joanne and leaves her spiraling over Noah's whereabouts.


	“But one person makes the next person panic and then the next person panic, and the panic was, ‘Is this funny enough?' And I just kept saying, ‘Guys, I don't think you have to worry,' ” says Foster. She didn't yet have the credibility with her fellow producers, the studio or the streamer to stave off their concerns, however. So, the script got tossed out, the shutdown extended and Levitan stepped in and wrote a notably lighter, shiva-free version. Foster resisted almost every change. “I was at a place where I thought, ‘This is my only chance to have a show,' ” she says, ” ‘and I'm not going to let everybody else convince me that I don't know what I'm doing.' “


	The actors, with the exception of Bell, who's also a producer, were left largely in the dark. “One day we were all collectively celebrating this kind of magic that we'd captured, then two days later the wheels came off,” recalls Brody, who adds of the whiplash: “I was like, ‘What the fuck? The show is so good. What is the problem?' ”

	











	From there, the scripts fell further behind, and concerns over structure and tone kept mounting. Several involved say they were genuinely fearful that the whole series would fall apart. At a certain point, even Brody felt like, as he puts it, “we were being noted to death.” Levitan is said to have tired of the dysfunction and walked away roughly halfway through the season, though contractually he'll remain an executive producer for the life of the series. Soon after, Jack Burditt, whose credits include 30 Rock and Last Man Standing, was brought in either “to calm the network” or “to do triage,” depending on who you ask. But before the first season had even dropped, both he and the original co-showrunner, Craig DiGregorio, were gone as well.


	The actors navigated the uncertainty as best they could, though some struggled more than others. “I like to have an idea of what the fuck is going on while we're shooting, and there's a difference between being like, ‘Where is this headed next season?' And ‘What's happening in this scene?' ” says Lupe, who spent much of the first season trying to understand the sexually charged relationship that her character has with Noah's married brother, Sasha. But Foster, who initially had the pair hooking up, only to scrap that plan during production, didn't have clear answers for her or her co-star.


	“I'd be like, ‘Am I seducing this person right now? Am I going to fuck him in the next episode?' Like, ‘Erin, I need to know,' ” says Lupe, who was also pregnant at the time. “Then, when I watched it, I was like, ‘Oh, OK, yeah, this gets parts of me tingling in a weird way, where I'm like, what is this?' Like, it's interesting and vague, and that's what made it fun. So, she was right, but as an actor, I was like, ‘What the fuck?' ”

	











	Meanwhile, Bell, or “KB” as her castmates call her, was having her own challenges. For the entire first season, she was convinced she didn't know what she was doing. There wasn't enough plot for her to make sense of, and the level of ambiguity in the scripts sent her spinning. “I pushed back with constant questioning because I didn't have the same hooks into the emotional math of my character that I'm used to having,” she says. “And now I see how much ambiguity there is in real life, and I see what Erin was doing — but there were times where I'd just roll my eyes at her and be like, ‘Ugh, you don't understand.'


	“Once I saw the show, and to be honest, once I saw people seeing the show, because proof is in the pudding, I was like, ‘Oh wow, this girl is writing about what happens to your neighbor or your girlfriend,' ” she continues. “So it wasn't just because of the success of the show that the second season got easier; it was because Erin and I finally saw each other.”


	***


	By the time season one had finished filming, nobody involved knew what to make of it. Then came whispers that Netflix had put the show on its internal server, and employees couldn't get enough of Bell and Brody's crackling chemistry.


	“We were hearing that they were sliding off their chairs, and I mean that in the way you think I mean that,” jokes Jackie Tohn, who credits Bell, “a real dirtbag,” for the lewd comment. Asked to defend herself, Bell says, “That's a high compliment when someone slides off their chair for you, we all know that.” She smiles. “Girls can be pervs, too.”

	











	Still, no one would have predicted the scale at which the series landed, making the streamer's Top 10 list in 89 countries around the world. Overnight, memes of Brody's character telling Joanne, “I can handle you,” or cupping her face in a passionate kiss, were racing around the internet. Audiences were eating up their refreshingly healthy love story and, for that matter, whatever was going on between Morgan and Sasha.


	“For Erin and me, it was so nice because I think people have always questioned us — they've questioned our talent, questioned our ability, questioned our place in the business,” says Sara Foster, who Lupe's Morgan is loosely based on. “But to be honest, you never know when to grab the champagne. It's like, ‘OK, great, season one was a hit, now we have to make season two a hit.' “


	Of course, by then, the season two room was well underway. In fact, the five leads — Tohn, who plays Sasha's wife, Esther, was upped to a series regular between seasons — had already been in to get a sense for where the story was headed. Bell, in particular, liked what she heard. “Erin said, ‘We're going to give the people what they want,' and I thought that was very cool,” says Bell. “She was like, ‘You don't want it to turn into, like, a murder mystery — you just want the bubblegum flavor to last forever, and we're going to do our best to do that.' “


	Konner and Kaplan had come in as self-proclaimed “superfans” of the show. “So, our intention was never to change anything,” says Konner, who, having worked with Lena Dunham for years, was well-versed in both protecting and shaping someone else's vision. The pair instituted structure and boundaries that didn't previously exist. By the time filming began, eight of 10 scripts had been turned in, in one form or another. Creatively, they embraced Foster's ideas, while pushing, successfully, for her to slow the story down. (Spoiler alert: By the end of season two, Joanne has not made the big life decisions Foster initially envisioned.)

	











	“It took a while for me to relax and trust, but Jenni knew that she was dealing with a traumatized bird,” says Foster, and Konner doesn't argue with her assessment. Instead, she says: “Having done this kind of role before, I felt very confident that I could help her navigate without trauma.”


	She was by Foster's side last fall as the show fielded its first bout of backlash. It centered on the show's treatment of Jewish women, who, according to one widely shared Time essay, “are portrayed as nags, harpies and the ultimate villains of this story.” Foster continues to find the criticism frustrating. “It's so rare to have a beautiful Jewish story on a mass commercial scale that to focus on something and decide it's problematic to Jews just felt very shortsighted to me,” she says. “Also, it's about a non-Jewish girl coming into a Jewish family, and if they all welcomed her with open arms, there's no show. But yes, these characters evolve in human ways because that's what you do in a second season.”


	Konner is keenly aware of the online narrative that her hiring, as a born-and-raised Jewish woman, was in response to that criticism, even if the timeline doesn't check out. “And it's insulting,” she says. “I didn't come in to be the Jewish police — I have a lot of other qualities, it turns out, as does Bruce Kaplan.” Kaplan is similarly dismissive. He acknowledges that they did discuss the backlash in the season two room but very quickly brushed it aside. “I view these characters as people, not as representations,” he says. “So I'm just like, ‘Well, what would Esther do?' I don't need to care what the internet is saying.”

	











	***


	Now, with season two about to be unleashed into the world, the writers are back in the room, blue-skying a not-yet-officially-ordered third season, and the cast is enjoying the success and one another. “I've spent a lot of time not in this position, so to have it happen at this point in my life is gratifying,” says Brody. “And as silly as awards may be, recognition is nice, respect is nice, opportunity is cool.”


	By all accounts, that's the outlook that permeates the Nobody Wants This set — it's a bunch of adults that value the opportunity, even if, occasionally, they still behave like children. There's no better or more hilarious example of the latter than the elaborate April Fools' prank Lupe played on Bell earlier this year. Over the course of nearly two months, Lupe convinced her co-star that she was drinking her own urine for its health benefits. She would walk around the set with mason jars full of colored liquid, and nearly everyone but Bell was in on it. Simons still can't believe Lupe attempted it, much less saw it through. “Pulling a prank on KB, that's like a witch's curse,” he says. “You're going to get that shit back tenfold.”


	Asked about her plans for retaliation, Bell offers only this: “I'm not going to Lindbergh her baby or anything, but it's going to be something and it's going to be great.”

	











	At any given time, there are multiple cast text chains going, including one titled “Shiksa Shegetz,” which regularly features the image of Noah and Joanne's famous, hands-on-face kiss, which Simons will superimpose in front of real-life scenes like Lupe in the delivery room with her newborn daughter. More recently, the core five have been active on a thread they've titled “Sack tap,” which, Simons acknowledges, “is a very bro-ey name for a group that isn't super bro-ey.”


	The actors frequently bring their kids to set (as they did to THR‘s cover shoot), and many of the significant others were involved to varying degrees in season two. Tohn's boyfriend, Joe Gillette, guests in episode five and eight as Gabe, the husband of an influencer played by Brody's real-life wife, Leighton Meester. Foster's hoping both will be back in future seasons. Meanwhile, Konner's husband directed the final two episodes, and Lupe's husband and his art appear briefly in episode four. Even Tikhman, who was once vehemently opposed to the very idea of the show, made the soundtrack for season two. “In success, it's fun for him,” says Foster, before Konner interjects: “Especially when Adam Brody's playing you as the sexiest rabbi on earth.”

The band plans to carry on with its planned South American tour in November and December following Saturday's passing of the group's co-founder.

	Just days after the death of Limp Bizkit co-founder bassist Sam Rivers at age 48 of undisclosed causes, TMZ is reporting that a spokesperson for St. Johns County, Florida Fire Rescue said they responded to a call on Saturday (Oct. 18) for a “nonresponsive person in cardiac arrest.”

	At press time no official cause of death had been announced and the gossip site added that a spokesperson for the St. Johns County Sheriff's office said that deputies responded to what is referred to as an “attended death” at Rivers' address, meaning a call in which the deceased was a patient under medical care for a serious or life-threatening illness likely to result in a near-term death.

Billboard reached out to the St. Johns Country Fire Rescue and Sheriff's offices — as well as Limp Bizkit's spokesperson — for comment, but had not heard back at press time.


	Rivers, 48, was diagnosed with liver disease in 2011 due to excessive drinking and received a liver transplant in 2017 after taking a temporary leave from the nu-metal band in 2015, before returning in 2018. 


	Singer Fred Durst posted an emotional tribute to Rivers on Monday saying, “it's so tragic he's not here now” and admitting that he'd gone through “gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday and I'm thinking, ‘my God, Sam's a legend,' you know? He did it. He lived it.” Earlier, the band — which also features guitarist Wes Borland, DJ Lethal and drummer John Otto — released a joint statement paying tribute to their beloved compatriot.

	











	“Sam Rivers wasn't just our bass player — he was pure magic,” the group said. “The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound. From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous.”


	At press time it appeared the band planned to carry on with its planned late 2025 Gringo Papi South American tour dates, which will resume on Nov. 29 at Explanada del Estadio Banorte in Mexico City before moving on to Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Argentina before winding down on Dec. 20 in Sao Paulo, Brazil; no replacement for Rivers has been announced yet.


	Billboard's Live Music Summit will be held in Los Angeles on Nov. 3. For tickets and more information click here.

""There's way bigger problems in the world than who is at the halftime show,"" the frequent Trump agitator said of the administration's latest obsession.

	Gil Kaufman



	The government has been shut down for more than three weeks, the president just took a wrecking ball to the White House and more than 40 million Americans are potentially a month away from losing their food assistance unless Congress acts soon. Those scenarios, and many more, are why frequent Donald Trump antagonist and punk prodder Ken Casey says we need to focus on the real problems in the country, not who is performing the halftime show at next year's Super Bowl.

	The Dropkick Murphys lead singer is the latest artist to fully back Bad Bunny‘s booking for what is traditionally one of the most-watched televised musical performances of the year, telling Rolling Stone that he hadn't really listened to the global superstar's music, but became a fan after watching Benito chew up the scenery in Happy Gilmore 2.

	











	“I will go to the mat for that guy,” Casey said of his support for Bad Bunny in the wake of his hilarious turn in the cameo-packed Adam Sandler sequel. “God bless his heart. He is a true, true American” he added of the Puerto Rican singer who is an American citizen. The latter comment was a pointed asterisk seemingly aimed at the many MAGA supporters and Trump administration figures who have bashed the Benito booking, including Sec. of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has threatened a heavy ICE presence at the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, Calif.




	“[This administration] just wants to control everything, every narrative,” Casey said of Trump 2.0. “There's way bigger problems in the world than who is at the halftime show at the Super Bowl,” warning that, “if you don't get involved now, you might lose your chance to get involved.” The latter comment came after an estimated seven million Americans turned out over the weekend for massive “No Kings” protests across the country decrying the authoritarian actions of the current administration.


	Casey was also speaking out to shine a light on his drive to mobilize the punk community to join him in supporting Home of the Brave, a nonprofit founded by former Republicans to speak out against the Trump administration and lend a voice to those whose lives have “been directly harmed” by its actions. 


	The singer will join the org's advisory board, taking his place alongside board members including frequent Trump antagonist George Conway, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn and D.C. Metro Police Dept. officer Michael Fanone (who was injured in the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters), former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former Trump 1.0 deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews.


	In a video announcing his board membership, Casey says, “I'm so outspoken about what Trump's doing to America because I have a platform, the band has a platform,” noting that the Murphys' message of support for worker's rights and social injustice has been consistent over 30 years. “If we've been outspoken even in times nowhere near as drastic as this, why would we not step up our level of activism as the stakes raise?”


	Casey admits that speaking out against Trump has probably cost the band fans, but expressed hope that maybe things will “come around” some day, adding that he's not afraid to call out the silence from other bands because if the Murphys can influence one band, or 10 fans, or 100 fans, to change their minds the movement could gain critical mass. 

	











	The Murphys have definitely not been shy about their feelings about their dislike for Trump, dedicating their single “First Class Loser” to the former reality star in July during a Warped Tour show in Long Beach, Calif. where they played videos tying the President to teen sex trafficker Jeffery Epstein. Earlier this year the singer also called out a fan for waving around a “true Nazi edition” MAGA hat at one of their St. Patrick's Day shows in Boston in March, then slamming “rat and a coward” Trump against just weeks later.


	The right-wing mediasphere and the Trump White House have been lashing out about the Bunny booking, with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski calling the pick “shameful,” and Trump dubbing it “absolutely ridiculous.” Amidst the ongoing government shutdown, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson took time to say that tapping Benito was a “terrible decision,” while claiming that the reggaeton megastar who is tied with Taylor Swift for having the most No. 1s on the Billboard Global 200 of any solo artist as lacking appeal to a “broader audience.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Robert Kirkman's Skybound Entertainment has teamed with Hasbro Entertainment to produce Energon Universe, an adult animated series based on the comics of the same name created by Kirkman. Joe Henderson (Lucifer) is attached to write the adaptation and serve as showrunner on the series, an epic crossover of G.I. Joe, Transformers and Void Rivals mythology, which is expected to be taken out to buyers shortly. 


	Despite featuring the family-friendly Hasbro characters G.I. Joe and Transformers, the Energon Universe series will be broad, with adult sensibility in the vein of Kirkman's gritty adult animated series Invincible, based on his comic, which has been a hit for Prime Video, renewed for Season 5 ahead of its Season 4 premiere next March.

He went on to create a cohesive shared universe in which Transformers and G.I. Joe co-exist together alongside original IP Void Rivals, which Kirkman co-created with Lorenzo De Felici.

	Two years in, Energon Universe has become one of Hasbro's bestselling comic book lines ever, with over 7 million combined units sold worldwide. It launched in June 2023 with Void Rivals which featured the surprise appearance of Transformers character Jetfire on the final page. That was followed by the October 2023 release of Transformers and four G.I. Joe character-focused miniseries, leading to a tentpole G.I. Joe series launch in November 2024, with Transformers #1, G.I. Joe #1 and Void Rivals #1 all setting sale records and Transformers winning two Edgar Awards in 2024.

	











	Comic book and TV writer Henderson previously served as showrunner on Lucifer, the successful Fox/Netflix TV series also adapted from comics. His TV credits also include White Collar and Almost Human.


	Hasbro Entertainment's slate includes film, scripted and unscripted Clue series with Sony; a live-action Dungeons & Dragons series Forgotten Realms at Netflix; a Monopoly film with LuckyChap and Lionsgate; an unscripted Monopoly series for Netflix; a Magic: The Gathering live-action film and TV universe in partnership with Legendary and an animated series at Netflix; a live-action Power Rangers TV series with 20th Century TV for Disney+; a My Little Pony live-action film at Amazon MGM Studios; and game shows based on Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble, recently renewed for second seasons by the CW.


	Co-founded by Kirkman and CEO David Alpert, Skybound's portfolio includes The Walking Dead, Invincible, whose most recent third season became Prime Video's most watched animated series installment, and audio drama Impact Winter. Coming up are series Dime Tu Nombre and Vaka, with Skybound's comic book series Stillwater by Chip Zdarsky and Ramon K. Perez adapted by Greg Berlanti and Carly Wray for Prime Video.

Associate Editor, TV


Rhea Seehorn introduces her character Carol in the first trailer for Apple TV‘s Pluribus, from writer and director Vince Gilligan. The nine-episode drama series premieres with two episodes November 7, followed by new episodes every Friday through December 26.


Pluribus has been a pretty top-secret project with little revealed about what the drama is about. Picked up in a two-season order, it follows the most miserable person on Earth, who must save the world from happiness.


	And Carol is really taking to the task, grumpy throughout the two-minute trailer, while the world tries and fails to turn her frown upside down. Anyone would be elated to find a fancy breakfast waiting outside their door on a silver platter, but not Carol. She throws the entire thing into her garbage bin. There's a point in the video when Carol reveals her desire to learn how to “reverse all this.”

	A voice over a speaker says, “Rest assured, Carol. We will figure out what makes you different.”

	Apple TV describes the show as “genre-bending,” and the trailer will keep most wondering which make up the series. This could be anything from comedy, sci-fi, thriller, fantasy or maybe even horror. Gilligan wants to keep viewers guessing, and this trailer definitely hits that mark.


Pluribus also stars Karolina Wydra and Carlos-Manuel Vesga, and guest stars Miriam Shor and Samba Schutte.


	Gilligan previously teased about Seehorn's character, “She plays someone who's trying very hard to be good. She's a bit of a damaged hero, but she's a hero nonetheless.”

	











	Seehorn added about Gilligan and what he brings to the series, “Some of the stuff that audiences have loved about his writing, where it's really rich characters but also him playing with the idea of tropes and genres and tone, and switching, like injected humor in a very dark moment — in this new show, he pushes that to a limit that was both very thought-provoking and upsetting sometimes, and other times, so, so funny. It really swings for the fences.”

EXCLUSIVE: Paramount and Comcast have invested at least $1B into SkyShowtime, but their joint-venture European streamer remains firmly in the red.


	SkyShowtime recently celebrated its third anniversary following its initial launch in 20 markets, including Spain and Poland, in September 2022. The streamer is stocked with content from both of its parents, including Sky Studios' glossy new series The Iris Affair and Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone, which has been a driver of subscriptions.


	A Deadline analysis of financial reports filed in the UK reveals that SkyShowtime has come at a hefty price tag, while its growth potential has left some analysts questioning its sustainability. SkyShowtime declined to comment, but the company's position is that it is trading in line with expectations.

	Sky UK Limited holds Comcast's 50% stake in SkyShowtime, and Companies House filings show that it has invested at least £573M ($767M) in the streamer over the past three years. Paramount Pictures International Limited owns the other half of SkyShowtime, with its 2023 accounts showing that it sunk $246M into the venture. Paramount's 2024 investment figure has not yet been disclosed.


	SkyShowtime made an operating loss of €543.7M ($630.5M) last year, which was 3% down on 2023, when its losses stood at €561.9M. Add in SkyShowtime's loss of €190M in its first year of trading, and the streamer has racked up a deficit of €1.3B. Its operating costs over this period, including employing 250 people last year, have totalled €1.9B.

	











	SkyShowtime has posted increases in sales over the past three years. Its total revenue was €275M last year (its first full year of operations across all territories), up 32% from €207.7M in 2023. In its first year of trading, SkyShowtime's sales stood at €133.2M.


	SkyShowtime does not disclose subscriber numbers, though analyst Omdia estimated that its user base was 6.2M at the end of 2024, up nearly 1M from 2023. 


	The big question is whether SkyShowtime's revenues are higher than the money Paramount and Comcast would have made from selling their content to other platforms in the European markets. SkyShowtime declined to answer this question.


	SkyShowtime's position is that the investment from its parent companies is in keeping with other streamer launches. The service was conceived in 2021 at the height of the global streaming wars, but growth in the market has slowed in recent years, and the likes of Netflix and YouTube have cemented their status as the dominant players. While these global companies are present and investing in many European markets, SkyShowtime believes it is putting down roots where others are not.


	At Iberseries in Spain earlier this month, SkyShowtime's Chief Content Officer Kai Finke described the strategy as “global content with local sprinkles.” This means teaming hits like Yellowstone and MobLand with originals such as upcoming Spanish series The Tribute that make it “more European and relatable,” Finke added. SkyShowtime is committed to screening 10 originals a year, with premieres including Polish hit crime series Śleboda and Schmeichel, a two-part documentary about Manchester United goalkeeping legend Peter Schmeichel.


	Sources said the streamer has enjoyed some success in Spain, where it has a deal with Telefónica's Movistar Plus+. François Godard, a media and telecoms analyst at Enders, said SkyShowtime is heavily reliant on these distribution deals in a crowded market. “It's like the fifth brand of Coca-Cola in the supermarket. It may be good, but you have to notice it to try it,” Godard argued.


	He added that industry consolidation will lead to uncertainty for SkyShowtime. Paramount has merged with Skydance since SkyShowtime launched, and David Ellison's studio is now tabling bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a significant rival to SkyShowtime in HBO Max. Comcast, meanwhile, recently sold Sky Deutschland to RTL, meaning there is “so much in the air” in terms of Sky's presence in Europe, said Godard. “It's difficult to think of SkyShowtime not being impacted by M&A in the future,” he added.

$1B is not particularly high in the streaming world. SkyShowtime is a bit of an odd contender but seems like it's still around and kicking while many thought it would be DOA. So if anything, looks good? It's going to be interesting to see what happens post-Skydance & Paramount. When you see when Netflix and other services started being profitable (or many still are not), nothing really shocking there.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: The Intelligence Unit of Chicago P.D.‘s 21st District will be down an officer for some time this season. Original cast member Patrick John Flueger is taking a leave of absence from the popular NBC police drama, where he plays Adam Ruzek, to deal with a personal matter, sources tell Deadline. He will return later in the season.


	The temporary departure was unexpected, and scripts are being reworked to reflect Ruzek's absence, we hear. According to sources, the time off comes as Flueger has been going through a difficult period personally, with an instance of alcohol use on set.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Since Chicago P.D.'s inception, Flueger's Ruzek has been an integral part of the Intelligence Unit led by Sergeant Hank Voight (Jason Beghe). After years of an on-and-off relationship between Ruzek and Detective Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati), the couple tied the knot in front of their friends and family in the Season 12 finale. They share a daughter, Makayla, whom they adopted in Season 8. Ruzek also looks after his father, Disco Bob (Jack Coleman), who last season was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is now living at a nursing home in Chicago.


	In the current Season 13, the team is dealing with the fallout of Deputy Chief Charlie Reid (Shawn Hatosy), which Voight orchestrated. As the intelligence team gets back to business after they were cleared, Ruzek and Burgess are focused on their marriage and family, and treading lightly on the streets of Chicago.

					By Armando Tinoco 

Staff Writer


James Gunn is addressing the Constantine sequel that Keanu Reeves has been wanting to do for quite some time.


	In a new interview, the DC Studios co-head is revealing what he knows about a possible follow-up to the 2005 film starring Reeves.


	“I've discussed it on and off. I've discussed it with Keanu,” Gunn said on the BobaTalks podcast. “But I have not read any script yet.”


	Earlier this year, Reeves said he “pitched” a treatment for the Constantine sequel, telling Inverse, “We've [along with director Francis Lawrence] been trying to make this film for over a decade, and we just recently put a story together and pitched it to DC Studios and they said, ‘OK.' So, we're going to try and write a script.”

	Reeves made the comments after Lawrence teased a sequel was “closer than ever.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the same interview with Collider, Lawrence revealed they had a “great idea” for the sequel, adding, “We have gone through a bunch of the comics over the years and looked at things.” The filmmaker said that the idea they have for the sequel stems from having the character “in the back of our minds for 20 years and just kind of percolating on ideas, and stories and characters we love, and ideas we love.”


Constantine is loosely based on the DC Comics/Vertigo Comics' Hellblazer. Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello wrote the script based on a story by Brodbin. Reeves gives life to John Constantine, a chain-smoking cynic with the ability to perceive the true visage of half-angels and half-demons.


	In 2023, Lawrence revealed that the sequel had suffered some setbacks due to the writer's strike, telling Gamespot, “And we had to jump through a bunch of hurdles to get control of the character again, because other people had control of the Vertigo stuff. We have control.”

It'll never happen. Gunn is going to want to reboot the character for his new DCU. And I don't blame him. It's been much too long since the Keanu one.

If they keep it in DC Elseworlds then they can have Keanu. If it does well and a sequel (3rd movie) comes quickly then great and if it just does okay and no sequel then they can always reboot the Constantine character in the DCU several years later and have Keanus be it's own thing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Modern motherhood leads to murderous mayhem in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle remake","https://www.avclub.com/the-hand-that-rocks-the-cradle-review","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 14:13:00 GMT","

Mexican filmmaker Michelle Garza Cervera is no stranger to depicting the madness of motherhood. Her 2022 feature debut, Huesera: The Bone Woman, centers on a pregnant woodworker who experiences increasingly disturbing visions of a faceless, mangled woman as her due date approaches. Convinced that she is simply cracking under the pressure of impending parenthood, the majority of her family and friends respond to her frantic pleas for help with a dismissive attitude. Aside from the supernatural slant and Spanish language, Cervera's sophomore feature has a similar premise, expanding on a story previously committed to screen in 1992. Cervera's take on The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, originally directed by Curtis Hanson from a screenplay by Amanda Silver, makes some much-needed amendments for our current cultural climate, but the core of the successful domestic thriller remains intact. 

While working at a tenants' rights event, “ready to pop” expectant mother Caitlyn (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) briefly encounters Polly (Maika Monroe), a young woman worried about an imminent rent hike being enforced by her landlord. Though the advice Caitlyn gives her is clinical and cursory, it's clear she makes quite the impression on Polly, who reintroduces herself when she sees Caitlyn and her family at a local Los Angeles farmers market several months later. In tow are Caitlyn's husband Miguel (Raúl Castillo), their 10-year-old daughter Emma (Mileiah Vega), and baby Josie (Lola and Nora Contreras). 

While this second encounter is even briefer than the first, Polly drops a hint about needing work; as fate would have it, Miguel has been suggesting that Caitlyn hire a nanny. So Polly enters the family home, immediately forming a connection with the precocious yet fickle Emma. The bulk of her nannying duties, however, lie in tending to Josie, whose daily regimen has been carefully calibrated to avoid ingesting microplastics, sugar, and other adverse yet omnipresent additives. 

Despite assurances that she will follow Caitlyn's strict guidelines, Polly immediately breaks every rule: She allows the girls to eat sickly sweet frosting, feeds Josie store-bought formula instead of her mother's steady supply of pre-pumped breastmilk, and even gives Emma a wildly irresponsible (and explosive) gift. Although Caitlyn is unsettled by Polly's deviation from her clearly articulated instructions, Miguel is quick to come to their nanny's defense, in part because Caitlyn previously suffered from postpartum psychosis after Emma's birth. Fearing that her mounting distrust of Polly (supported only by anecdotal “evidence”) is indicative of an imminent mental breakdown, Miguel encourages his wife to let her grievances go. Only Caitlyn's best friend and co-worker Stewart (Martin Starr in a small but potent supporting role) also senses something suspicious about Polly's general vibe, causing him to dig up some shocking revelations about both women's traumatic past. 

Working from a script by Micah Bloomberg (who previously wrote the 2022 erotic thriller Sanctuary), Cervera infuses her recurring thematic interests into this remake. For one, her Mexican background comes through in the film's mixed-race family dynamic. Miguel and his children look distinctly Latino and often communicate in Spanish, something that subtly creates a wedge between them and Caitlyn. While this ethnic background isn't overly focused on, Cervera does stitch in a truly excellent joke about Mexicans and their love of pyrotechnics, something that those who share this identity will undoubtedly chuckle over.

Another intriguing, equally subdued, yet strategic element concerns sapphic desire, something the filmmaker wove into the narrative fabric of Huesera. After Polly hints at her lesbian relationship, Caitlyn confides that she, too, has been with women before. “You have that vibe to you,” Polly winks. This becomes a topic of contention when Emma expresses a similar sentiment, something that Caitlyn worries has been spurred by Polly's influence as opposed to a natural development on her daughter's part. 

These issues of identity are less integral to The Hand That Rocks The Cradle‘s storyline than they are straightforward character traits, a decision that serves the film well. As a result, it doesn't merely feel like the product of a “woke” remake of a decidedly un-woke film, but instead a nuanced portrait of a modern American family—one infiltrated by an “outsider” in an unassuming sense. It would have been easy for Polly to resort to racist stereotypes in order to sow division between Caitlyn and her family; it would have been equally easy for her to weaponize the matriarch's queerness in order to cast her as untrustworthy or somehow perverted. Instead, the film's tension stems from truly unexpected adversity, complete with organic parental missteps as well as calculated sabotage from a third party. 

And yet, at times, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle feels like it could use a jolt of immediacy. The radical normalcy that Cervera presents doesn't necessarily speak to the moment, particularly in L.A. Is the wealthy nuclear family ever truly under attack in this country? The remake features riveting tension, assured performances, and hallmarks of an exciting new director's narrative fascinations, all while the politics of its central dynamic continue to cry out for examination.

[Editor's note: This piece contains spoilers for Only Murders In The Building.]  

Ever since Only Murders In The Building launched in 2021, it's been tough to ignore the Arconia's snarky yet sweet resident Howard Morris (Michael Cyril Creighton), largely because he refuses to take the backseat. In an ensemble that gets crowded with each passing year, Howard remains a reliable source of laughs and eccentricities. The show's ongoing fifth season, however, finds him in a downward spiral. Feeling isolated from his loved ones, he quickly grows attached to and possessive of the Arconia's new “doorman,” the AI robot L.E.S.T.R. And it isn't until this week's penultimate outing that Howard finally comes to terms with his surprisingly dispiriting journey. 

In the process, Howard not only reaffirms his connection with Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel (Selena Gomez), but also provides them with a necessary clue to solve the two crimes they're investigating. The character's emotional outburst lets Creighton (High Maintenance, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Spotlight) show off his dramatic chops, with the actor telling The A.V. Club that he relished the chance to depict Howard's “vulnerable side.” We spoke to Creighton about being OMITB‘s fourth musketeer, finding his footing with the role, and opening up in a scene with Steve Martin. 

The A.V. Club: Episode nine gives Howard a long-overdue moment of clarity when he confesses his loneliness to Charles. Did you and the writers sit down to talk about how to navigate this breakthrough for him? 

Michael Cyril Creighton: I never know what's coming in the show. I like to learn episode by episode, because I always trust the writers. But I was a little nervous this year about Howard's storyline, at least for the first few episodes, because of his new obsession with L.E.S.T.R.'s AI and technology. I was nervous that we've lost a bit of his humanity. Howard's always a little sweet and sour, but he was particularly sour in the first half of season five. That wasn't in my comfort zone. So when I got the script for episode nine, it was a surprise for me that Jonathan [Jason Veasey] had broken up with him. That was so sad. But then that big speech to Charles made everything make sense about him from season one to now. It made the deal with the pig in season four, and all the animals before, make sense. The show already deals with loneliness so beautifully, but I never thought that we would see Howard drop the facade and speak plainly and clearly about why he wants to be part of the group so badly. 

It was so moving to me to do that scene with Steve Martin, too. I don't think I've ever had a scene with just him. This was an emotional day onset. And I know we're in this big comedy, but it was meaningful that they got to the core of Howard's heart in this episode. I was initially only supposed to be in two episodes of the show, and the only thing we really knew about this character in the beginning was that he loved animals and he loved gossip. But the deeper we got into this world, we got to see his desires, and what he desperately wants is to be good at something when he doesn't seem to be good at anything. He's always trying and failing. I find that to be admirable. I don't know that I personally could do that. He's never one thing and can go from charming to furious. It doesn't always make sense to me, but the character shifts are always fun to play, and the writers have been good at never letting me down with that. 

AVC: You said Howard was initially meant to be in two episodes. Was there a moment when you realized he's an integral part of the show and a sort of fourth musketeer to this trio? 

MCC: It comes in waves. The moment I realized, “Oh, there's something special to explore about this character and we need to see more of him with them,” was in the season-two finale during the killer-reveal party. I feel like that's when Howard came to life, and we learned a lot more about him, like he's a bad actor who loves theater and is willing to put himself out there even if it's embarrassing. That moment was key to his longevity as part of the fabric of the show. And then, in this season's ninth episode, he also gets to kind of crack the case. Howard provides an important clue. I feel like that's all he's wanted. In that moment, he feels accepted and as part of the group, but he also can't believe that he got it right after spending so much time getting it wrong. All he's wanted is for Charles, Oliver, and Mabel to show him some respect. He's been sour this season, and so to see them come back together and have this nice win is awesome. I also have a ringside seat to the greatest showbiz friendship ever, Steve and Marty, and then I got to watch Selena just seamlessly enter that friendship. Their dynamic is very similar to what we see onscreen. They're always learning from each other, making fun of each other, and treating each other with tons of respect. So it's been nice to watch that friendship blossom and get to be a part of that [offscreen]. 

AVC: Season five also reveals the complicated relationship between Howard and his mother and her reaction to his coming out. What do you feel the value is of seeing that play out now?  

MCC: My initial thought of what his relationship with his mother was like was pretty far off because in season three, we get a line where he's talking about wanting to act and that his mother said to him, “Never use that voice again. It's matronly and shrill.” To me, that's such a harsh thing to say to a young gay guy that I assumed their relationship must have been awful. So the flashback to them in episode two was necessary to understand theirs was a story of acceptance and not judgment. It felt very important to have that storyline shown right now, especially as a queer character on a popular TV show, that his whole life isn't awful. This season, I was worried that Howard was going down a dark path, but I think that he's on his way to an even brighter, better future.

AVC: Talk about filming the part of episode nine when the Arconia's residents get together to celebrate their last day in the building. It feels like this year brought some focus back on that side of the show, too. 

MCC: Yeah, that's why I loved filming that [residents'] block party in the lobby and getting to spend an entire day with Nathan Lane. I have idolized him since I knew who he was. I did a production of Guys And Dolls in high school, and I mimicked his voice and his performance from the Broadway production to a T. I was basically playing Nathan Lane playing Nathan Detroit, so spending the day with him was a dream. Working with the robot was challenging. It just does not have any comic timing, you know? [Laughs] But I did love that day when all of us were having that party, including spending time with new additions like Beanie Feldstein and Jermaine Fowler, who was my buddy onset.

AVC: Did you ever tell Nathan Lane about your production? 

MCC: Yeah, I think I told him the first time I met him. I don't know if he was flattered or annoyed at the time. But I do think he's so funny in episode nine. He improvised that bit when I say something like I “broke up” with [L.E.S.T.R.] and Teddy goes, “Howard, are you fucking the robot?” or something. 

AVC: Do parts of your personality ever bleed into the characters you play, especially considering you've been in Howard's shoes for five seasons now?

MCC: I do think Howard is a very heightened version of me. I have emotional shifts, although certainly not as quickly as Howard does. I don't end up using improv as much, though. Maybe once we'll do a fun take at the end, but generally, what ends up in the final cut is what the writers have written. That doesn't mean I don't try it in different ways every time. I don't think of boundaries between myself and the character. I think that I started working more regularly when I started approaching characters from a personal place, as opposed to what I thought people wanted me to do. Once I got rid of that albatross around my neck, I started booking more work. For a long time, I thought that my specificity was a detriment, stopping me from getting work; and once I realized it's an attribute, that was the game-changer that got me the kind of work I wanted.  

AVC: What was the first job you booked that made you feel that way? 

MCC: I would say High Maintenance was one of the first times I got to show a vulnerable side of myself. For the first part of my career, I loved it, but I was mostly playing things like a nasty, snarky salesman or something. It was a lot of fun, but it didn't feel sustainable, at least for me. I need variety. So with High Maintenance and also Spotlight, being able to show a vulnerable side where comedy and sadness go together, those are the two roles that come to mind and the ones I'm really proud of.  And with Only Murders In The Building, I've evolved as an actor doing this job. I have never had a regular job of being in a TV show for five seasons, playing the same character. There's also no denying that I'm onset every day with the greats. If I weren't becoming a better actor, there would be a problem because there's so much to learn and absorb day to day. 

AVC: You created and starred in the web series Jack In The Box in 2009, which you ended after four seasons. Do you remember why you decided to wrap that up and pursue other acting gigs? 

MCC: It was just such a small team with me and my DP. There was no other crew. I created Jack In The Box while working in a box office, and I worked there for many more years after that, but I created it as a way to learn how to act on camera and to learn to write for other people and act with people that I wanted to act with. I ended it because it felt like the right time, and I was afraid I was running out of material. I didn't want it to go on longer than it was meant to, and I was curious what would happen next for me. I had won a WGA Award for it, and it felt like I should close that chapter to see what's next. I'm forever proud of it, but I wanted to open up my life a little bit and see if I could get other things going. It took a little while, but I did it. I do miss the feeling of being in charge of my own project and taking control of the producing and writing because I enjoy that aspect of the business. I get to do it now in the Only Murders podcast that I host and am an executive producer of. I've never wanted to host a podcast, but when they asked me, it made sense to do so because I love talking about the show. I love talking to the crew members and the cast. One of my favorites I've done so far is with the production assistants. That's a skill I learned now. I'm always trying to learn like Howard—and luckily, I haven't had as many failures as him. 

AVC: You've appeared on a ton of shows. Would you consider yourself a character actor? And what makes a good one? 

MCC: Oh, yes, I definitely think of myself as a character actor. A lot of times, those are people who are considered the B list, but all of my favorite actors are character actors, so it's a dream to be part of that group. I try to just not judge myself and be as playful as possible in the roles, which is easier said than done. But I try to get out of my head and out of my own way and not do what I think I'm supposed to do, but do what feels right. I watch my stuff but not obsessively. I used to not be able to watch before because I used to be very critical of how I looked or sounded. I'm over that now for the most part, which is a really great place to be, because there's worth in watching your own work if you can. I learn stuff from things I've done. There are performances that people love that I'm thinking, “Oh, if I just did it this way, it would be so much better.” But then again, we're usually our own worst critics.  

AVC: Circling back to Only Murders, Howard's emotional moment in episode nine could signal this being his last hurrah in a way. Can you tease anything about the finale next week, and do you ever worry that he'll be killed off? 

MCC: As an actor, I don't know that being the victim on Only Murders is the worst thing because then you get a whole other season where we learn more about you and see your humanity. I'm not saying whether that's the end of this season, but I will say that it's not the worst option. I can't say much more than that for now.

AVC: Finally, as someone who's part of the show, do you view Only Murders as a comfort watch? 

MCC: We are so lucky to have a core trio that's so lovable that people want to keep coming back to watch them. The fact is that the show isn't really about murder but about creating a community, which is a universal thing. We want a world in which you have other people to lift you and be there for you. That's all these people are trying to do in some bad circumstances and while trying to be the best versions of themselves that they can be. That's why it has the longevity. The show is about the connections we make in life, and we're always going to need to see that—no matter what's going on in the real world.

Veteran actor and director Govardhan Asrani, one of Hindi cinema's most beloved comedic icons, died at 84, as confirmed by the BBC. The actor, who appeared in over 350 Hindi and Gujarati films, passed away on Friday following a prolonged illness.

A statement shared by his family on his official social media account read, “The one who brought smiles to everyone's faces, Asrani ji, is no longer among us. His passing is an irreparable loss for both Hindi cinema and our hearts.”

The Daily Mail reported that his manager, Babubhai Thiba, confirmed the news: “Asrani passed away today at 3 PM at Arogya Nidhi Hospital, Juhu. He is survived by his wife, sister, and nephew.”

Fans and colleagues have posted tributes on social media. The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) wrote, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of veteran actor, teacher, and distinguished FTII alumnus Mr. Govardhan Asrani. Our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, and countless admirers. May his soul rest in peace.”

Popular and award-winning Actor Akshay Kumar, who worked with Asrani in multiple films, posted on X, “Speechless with grief at the passing of Asrani ji. We had just shared the warmest of hugs at the shoot of ‘Haiwaan.' He had the most legendary comic timing. God bless you Asrani Sir, for giving us a million reasons to laugh.”

A fan shared: “One more legend gone soon😢😢” Another comment read: “Rest in peace sir can't believe such a versatile actor no more with us 💔”

Another comment read: “Literally played so-so many iconic roles, making every frame brighter.”

Asrani's career spanned more than six decades, starting with his debut in the 1967 film “Hare Kaanch Ki Choodiyan”. He rose to fame in the 1970s and 1980s with standout comedic and supporting roles in classics like “Sholay” and “Amdavad No Rikshawalo.”

He became a household name for portraying the eccentric jailer in “Sholay” and for his Hindi voiceover work as Zazu in Disney's “The Lion King”, originally voiced by Rowan Atkinson.

In the 1980s alone, Asrani appeared in over 100 Hindi films, solidifying his place as one of the most prolific actors of his generation.

Asrani also directed several films, including “Salaam Memsaab” and “Chala Murari Hero Banne”, both of which he also starred in. In later years, he continued to work steadily, appearing in projects like “Dream Girl 2” and “Non Stop Dhamaal” in 2023. Two of his final films, “Haiwaan” and “Bhoot Bangla,” are set to be released posthumously in 2026.

In a past interview with BBC Hindi, Asrani humbly reflected on his work, saying he didn't see himself as just a comedian. “I am an artist who finds truth in every role,” he said (as reported by Metro).

Loved for his warmth, humor, and humanity, Govardhan Asrani's passing marks the end of an era in Indian cinema — but his laughter and legacy will continue to live on in the hearts of millions.

Robert Irwin nailed his “Wicked” jazz routine on “Dancing With the Stars” week 6, but he didn't win over the judges enough to grab a single 10. Fans shared their surprise that Irwin's dance with pro Witney Carson didn't receive higher scores.

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

On the October 21 episode of “Dancing With the Stars,” the pairs were tasked with performing to songs from “Wicked.”

Irwin and Carson performed a high energy jazz routine to “Dancing Through Life.” Judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli, Derek Hough, and guest judge Jon M. Chu had rave reviews following the performance, but none of them gave Irwin and Carson a 10.

Irwin did receive his best score yet, however, with 9s across the board for a total of 36/40.

Inaba noted that “Dancing Through Life” should be Irwin's “theme song,” adding, “That was so ambitious … You really took the challenge. You nailed it.”

Hough told him, “You were meant to be on stage. You were born to be a performer,” while Chu noted that watching Irwin dance in person was “even better” than watching him at home. 

Tonioli said the performance “was a joyful, theatrical treat.”

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Irwin later posted a video of his “DWTS” performance on Instagram. “Dancing through life! Tonight was unbelievable. I'm so grateful that I got to bring to life my favourite character from one of my favourite films, in the ballroom tonight,” he wrote in the caption.

He continued, “@witneycarson, THANK YOU for making this week fun, challenging, hilarious, exciting, and an absolute JOY … as always. I'm gonna miss practicing this routine every day.”

“I want to thank ALL of you for your support and having us back for another week, this experience is utterly unforgettable and life changing. See you next week! Love ya,” Irwin added.

Fans flooded the comments section with praise for his performance, with many wondering why it didn't earn a single 10 from the judges.

“What more does he need to do to get a 10?! He earned it weeks ago!” one fan wrote.

Another person commented, “I am shocked that there were no 10s from the judges!! This was soooo good and seeing the other contestants that got 10 (very deserved) I think Robert was robbed!!”

“Where are the 10s for this man?” another fan asked.

One fan noted, “You are SPREADING SO MUCH JOY, ROBERT! Dancing through life! Beautiful! And those 10s are coming! Because you & Witney deserve them so much! ❤️”

“I'm so flabbergasted, like Robert you and Witney deserved 10s! UGH YOU LITERALLY SPUN ON BOOKS!! I'm so glad you're still in. Can't wait for next week!” another fan noted.

“Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Bronwyn Newport responded to the “identity theft” and “fraud” allegations that began to circulate online during the sixth episode of Season 6.

“There's two separate things happening here,” Bronwyn said to a producer during one of her confessionals. “There are mistakes I made in college. We're talking 20 years ago. I think I had an eviction notice after I left BYU, and I had to pay it later.”

Bronwyn continued to explain, “and then they're saying that I allegedly committed crimes, current day, in the last year or so. Identity theft, grand theft, fraud, all of those are things listed under that penal code.”

The “RHOSLC” star was only legally allowed to share so much about the latter allegations, but she was able to clarify that, “what actually happened was almost 10 years ago, nothing recent,” Bronwyn said. “But it's been a case that was dismissed and then later sealed, and I really, legally, can't talk about what my involvement is in that.”

In the wake of all the rumors about her past legal troubles, Bronwyn and her husband Todd Bradley sat down to discuss how to best handle the “ridiculous headlines” that were going around.

“You know this lying…online in the press affects all of us, personally and professionally,” said Todd, referencing his career as a successful software and tech executive.

“I know this is gonna cause a problem for you at work, so I'm sorry about that 'cause I know it's gotta be a concern for you,” Bronwyn said. “I know that my name next to any of these words reflects poorly on you, and you need to be seen as someone who is trustworthy and beyond reproach.”

Since both Todd and Bronwyn suspect that fellow housewife Lisa Barlow was involved in the reports suddenly surfacing, he had sent her a text message suggesting that she back out of the upcoming “RHOSLC” cast charter aboard a yacht with Captain Jason Chambers and the “Below Deck Down Under” crew.

“It's unclear to me why you wanna go spend time with these people, why you wanna spend time with Lisa, why you wanna fly 18 hours to be in the same room with someone that continually lies about you, lies about me, lied about Gwen,” Todd said, referencing Bronwyn's young daughter. “I struggle to understand why you'd do that.”

“A tiger can't change its stripes. She's not gonna change. I don't know why you get in the gutter with her,” Todd said about Lisa. “You just get down in the gutter and muck around with slime.”

“If you decide to go, I got it; you're a big girl, grown woman, I understand,” Todd concluded. “But don't come home complaining that you and Lisa got into a fight, because I assume it's gonna happen. You're setting yourself up for that. It's on you.”

In a recent interview with Us Weekly that Bronwyn shared on her Instagram, she explained why Todd has taken a step back from being on camera.

A post shared by Us Weekly (@usweekly)

Someone should turn the tables on Lisa. Spread nasty rumors about her to tabloids see how she likes it! Her nasty rumor spreading needs to stop before she destroys someone's life. Not that she would care!

The ballroom might have turned into the Ozdust Ballroom for “Wicked Night,” but one key part of the Irwin family will be missing from the audience. Bindi Irwin and her 3-year-old daughter Grace are all set to cheer from home as Robert Irwin prepared for one of his most anticipated performances yet on “Dancing With the Stars.”

“We absolutely adore being in the audience to celebrate Uncle Robert on ‘Dancing With the Stars,'” Bindi shared on Instagram. “This week, Grace has a little cold so we're going to cheer from our living room.”

She also reminded fans to get their votes in, writing, “Be sure to vote for Robert and Witney on this Wicked night. Text ROBERT to 21523 or abc.com. Voting begins at 8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT / 5 p.m. PT.”

A post shared by Bindi Irwin (@bindisueirwin)

Bindi's post was quickly filled with supportive messages from fans. “Get well soon, Graceful Warrior,” one person wrote. Another added, “Wishing you a speedy recovery, little one!”

A post shared by Bindi Irwin (@bindisueirwin)

Their mom, Terri Irwin, also jumped into the comments, writing, “Sending healing hugs! 💕”

It's no surprise that Bindi knows how it feels to root for a sibling on the show — she herself won “Dancing With the Stars” in 2015 alongside partner Derek Hough, a season fans still remember fondly.

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

As for Robert, the wildlife conservationist and his partner Witney Carson are performing a Jazz routine to “Dancing Through Life,” sung by Jonathan Bailey in the upcoming “Wicked” movie. Ahead of the episode, Robert shared a playful Instagram clip teasing the performance.

“I'll say it once again. The responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me,” he lip-synched in rehearsal, referencing one of Bailey's lines. “Gonna bring the rizz to shiz. You ready to dance through life tomorrow?” he captioned.

Fans flooded the comments, urging him to channel “Prince Fiyero energy” and calling the number “epic.”

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

“Wicked Night” is one of the most anticipated themes of the season, celebrating the upcoming films “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” The episode also features special messages from the movie's stars — including Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Jonathan Bailey, and Michelle Yeoh — plus a medley of hit songs like “Defying Gravity,” “For Good,” and “Dancing Through Life.”

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Robert and Witney have consistently been near the top of the leaderboard since week one. With Bindi and Grace cheering from home and fans ready to vote, the “Team IrWINit” duo is set for another standout performance on “Dancing With the Stars,” airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+, and streaming the next day on Hulu.

It's officially ‘Wicked' Night on “Dancing with the Stars,” and let's be real; the anticipation for this routine is off the charts. Scott Hoying and pro-partner, Rylee Arnold, are about to take the ballroom by storm with a Contemporary routine to “The Wizard and I.” 

This number promises something deeper and more emotional. Scott's natural sense of storytelling paired with Rylee's fluid, expressive choreography feels like the perfect mix for a song this powerful. Fans are buzzing that this could be one of their standout performances yet. And honestly, it seems like they're ready to prove just how magical their partnership can be.

“The Wizard and I” carries a ton of emotional weight; and for a contemporary routine, that's gold. It seems like every week, Scott and Rylee are syncing up more and more, finding that balance between theatrical and authentic. Scott's always had the musical instincts. But this week gave him a chance to show just how far he's come as a dancer.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

Rylee continues to shine as a choreographer too. She's figured out how to play to Scott's strengths (using his natural rhythm and performance energy) while pushing him into new territory. It's a risk, sure, but it's one that's paying off.

And with “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” director Jon M. Chu sitting in as guest judge, this performance had a little extra meaning. He's someone who understands the heart of the story they're telling; and you could tell the pair wanted to do it justice.

A post shared by Dancing With The Stars #DWTS (@dancingwiththestars)

The judges gave Scott and Rylee a 28/40 for this week, and their reactions said it all… they were thrilled. Added to their 30/40 from last week, Scott and Rylee are sitting at a two-night total of 58/80.

Whether or not he makes it to the finals, Scott Hoying has proved he's got more than just a voice. He's got heart, grit, and the kind of stage presence that makes you want to root for him. It seems like each week, he's building momentum, and Rylee's right there matching him beat for beat.

UPDATE: Sadly, Scott Hoying & Rylee Arnold are OUT!Want all the details on tonight's episode? Check out our live recap.

And don't forget the “Wicked” sequel, “Wicked: For Good” is in theaters November 21, 2025.

Chip and Joanna Gaines are returning to HGTV with the show that put them on the map — “Fixer Upper.” The stars have a new twist on the old favorite, however. See what Chip and Joanna have planned for their new series, as they move beyond Waco, Texas.

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

On October 21, Chip and Joanna took to Instagram to give fans a sneak peek at their newest show, explaining how they've never done a series quite like this before.

“We are so excited to announce our new series, called ‘Fixer Upper: Mountain House,'” Chip said. 

In the clip, he asks, “We are not in Waco anymore, are we?”

Joanna adds, “We are finally taking ‘Fixer Upper' on the road … we can't wait for you to see the full story.”

Chip promises “lots of drama,” as well as “a side of Jo you may have never seen before.”

“Hopefully the project comes together in a way that you guys are going to be thrilled about,” Chip adds.

Joanna shares, “It's very near and dear to our hearts. We can't wait to share where we're at … we can't wait for you to see it.”

Fans flooded the comments section of their Instagram post with guesses about the mountain house's location, including Tennessee, Montana, and North Carolina.

According to the press release from Warner Bros. Discovery, “Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House” is “a brand-new three-part limited series debuting Tuesday, December 9, 2025 at 9pm ET/PT on Magnolia Network and HGTV. Streaming the same day on HBO Max and discovery+, the series marks Chip and Joanna Gaines' first-ever ‘Fixer Upper' project outside their home state of Texas.”

The release notes, “In ‘Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House,' Chip and Joanna take on a 1960s mountain property in Colorado, tackling unique design and construction hurdles that come with high-altitude living. Together, they blend original mid-century details with European-inspired finishes, transforming the home into their own timeless family retreat nestled in the Rockies.”

“Colorado has come to be a special place for our family,” Joanna shared. “And somewhere in-between ski trips and spring breaks over the last decade, a dream took root to one day carve out a place of our own. While taking ‘Fixer Upper' out of state meant we were in for a steep learning curve, our hope is that this home would far outlast us, and we can't wait to share it with you.”

The release shares, “Over three 60-minute episodes, viewers will watch the Gaineses navigate everything from creating spaces ideal for a multi-generational family gathering, to surprise visits from local wildlife, to uncovering unique architectural details. With plenty of surprises along the way, ‘Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House' captures the signature heart, humor, and design vision that fans have come to love, set against a brand-new backdrop.”

So it's a show all about them again.Not for us ,tired of shows that are all about the hosts. We don't  care about all the things they have. Pick people that really need work done for them that can't afford to do this for themselves.

I live in NC and immediately thought how great it would have been to go to our mountains and rebuild homes that were literally swept away by raging floods just over a year ago. There are still so many people without homes and so many businesses not yet open. Missed opportunity for sure!

Despite their recent rise in prevalence, prequels are often a bad fit for television. Serialized TV is built for lengthy, evolving stories; stories that can grow from season to season; that can begin as one thing and end as something else entirely. Even episodic programs (your sitcoms, your procedurals) are bewitching for their innate boundlessness. They can go on forever, and knowing as much is comforting, intimate, and fun.

Prequels, on the other hand, have a definitive endpoint by definition and don't allow much by way of transformation. Everyone knows where the story is going, and whatever growth takes place along the way needs to reach the predetermined maturity of what's already known. Sterling exceptions certainly exist, but our ongoing age of I.P. has produced more misguided prequels than groundbreaking ones.

Still, for modern viewers lured to the latest series-long prologue to what they really want to watch, there is one modern benefit: You don't have to stick around, waiting for it to get better. If a prequel's first episode doesn't live up to expectations, there's no reason to believe later episodes, let alone seasons, will improve enough to win you back. After all, improvements require changes, and changes aren't a luxury these pricey precursors can afford. 

 










Fans of the “It” franchise should know whether “Welcome to Derry” is right for them within the first hour, perhaps sooner. The opening sequence — involving a scared little boy whose fear only accelerates during a nightmarish car ride — is a decent bellwether for the first five episodes (which is all that were screened for critics, of the eight total). Cheesy frights rely on cartoonish CGI and spewing blood to provoke imagery that's memorable for the wrong reasons. The franchise's iconic clown is nowhere to be found, replaced by one of the many toothless iterations of “It” our shapeshifting antagonist assumes instead. By the time a glistening pacifier flies out the window in slow-motion, it's not awe or even curiosity that's evoked by our welcome to “Derry,” but confusion accompanied by an uninvited chuckle.

If this is how “It” begins and we already know how “It” ends, must we wait around to watch what happens in between? And shouldn't there be more to “It” than that?

Considering complaints about empty spectacle and improper Pennywise placement (Penny-unwise placement?) have dogged director Andy Muschietti since his first “It” feature terrorized theaters to the tune of $704 million in worldwide grosses, perhaps these red flags will only act as reassurance. If you liked “It” then, you'll like “It” now — or so HBO hopes. 

 










The network prioritizes franchise continuity by bringing back the director of both “It” chapters to develop, produce, and helm select episodes of “Welcome to Derry,” alongside his producing partner and sister Barbara Muschietti. Bill Skarsgård returns, too, reprising his role as the dancing clown while flexing his influence over all things “It” by snagging an executive producer credit, too. Co-showrunner Jason Fuchs is another movie import, having served as co-producer on “Chapter Two,” but balancing those filmic staples are a stable of TV veterans, including co-showrunner Brad Caleb Kane (“Tokyo Vice”), his writers' room, and — most intriguingly — Oscar- and Emmy-winner Cord Jefferson (“American Fiction,” “Watchmen”), who's officially on board as a consulting producer.

That last credit hints at the show's bigger thematic goals, most of which skew closer to broad gestures than fresh insights — at least, so far. Whereas the original “It” films double as allegories for removing fear as an obstacle to growing up (assuming the kids can survive their increasingly dangerous childhoods to begin with), “Welcome to Derry” positions its titular 1962 town as America in miniature. Despite white residents dismissing concerns over racial prejudice because “this isn't the South,” Black residents are presumed to be criminals, treated like pawns, and met with weary, skeptical glances wherever they go. Indigenous citizens don't fare much better, as their perspectives are ignored and rights get dismissed. Meanwhile, Cold War anxieties allow the military to do whatever it wants, no matter the danger it brings to civilians. When a character in Episode 2 growls, “This ain't America, this is Derry,” there's no doubting they are one in the same.

 










This generalized recognition of our nation's foundational sins is certainly welcome, it's just not geared toward a particular point. (That, and the discordant storytelling's oft-silly specifics tend to spoil the atmospheric dread tying “It's” past to our present.) Perhaps the final three episodes will pull together a cogent statement or two, something beyond the trope of ostensibly idyllic small towns hiding monstrous truths behind their white picket fences. But the “It” films were content to stick with broadly recognizable interpretations — growing up is hard! FDR was right! all clowns are evil! — so why bank on anything more from the series?

Speaking of generalities and a lack of specifics, you may have noticed this review has yet to offer much by way of plot points. That's because “Welcome to Derry” is shielded by spoiler embargoes, including much of the first episode (and, therefore, what happens after), which makes listing even the basic narrative a bit tricky. (HBO's own logline is just a single sentence filled with keyword gobbledygook.) But here we go:

“Welcome to Derry” largely pivots around the Hanlon family. Leroy (Jovan Adepo) is an Air Force major with lingering physical and emotional scars from the Korean War. Charlotte (Taylour Paige) is a housewife who used to be active in the civil rights movement before Leroy grew concerned that his partner's politics could cost him promotions. After moving to Derry, she looks after their son, Will (Blake Cameron James), while Leroy partakes in “special operations” with a uniquely talented (and uniquely trusted) soldier named Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk).

 










If any of those names sound familiar, congratulations: You're a Stephen King superfan. “Welcome to Derry” is well-stocked with Easter eggs, whether they tie directly to “It” (like, say, through the Hanlon family tree) or other stories with roots in the King of Horror's favorite state. Trailers have tipped associations with “The Shining” and “The Shawshank Redemption,” but there are plenty more winks and nods to lore for those of you who care.

I, for better or worse, do not. Everything doesn't have to connect to everything else, even in a prequel meant to evoke the satisfying snap of puzzle pieces coming together, and primary stories still need to be able to stand on their own. “Welcome to Derry,” very much for worse, does not. Despite being nicely fashioned by Oscar-winning production designer Paul D. Austerberry, the town's origins are valued more than what's going on within it — the former of which is trotted out in blunt stretches of exposition, and the latter of which is realized in clunky set-pieces that are meant to be scary but settle for icky. (Plus, “Castle Rock” already built a much better King-verse, and it still got axed.) 

As much as I want to invest in Muschetti's vision for a prequel series that moves backward through time — if greenlit, Season 2 would take place in 1935, while Season 3 would jump back another 27 years to 1908 — what's shown in the here and now isn't as apt or ambitious as the structural apparatus around “It.” Character inconsistencies, leaps in logic, foreseeable yet functional twists — these are forgivable flaws in a horror show that brings the horror, but “Welcome to Derry” can't deliver where it counts. 

 










What works about the movies — the believable kid behaviors, Skarsgård's performance, and a steady stream of scares — isn't what's driving the show. Episodes strain to touch on those fan-favorite aspects almost as often as they work to expand the Stephen King universe from within (even incorporating a missing kid plot reminiscent of “It: Chapter One”). But an engine fueled by filling in the blanks isn't built to last, and these dots, once connected, prove tacky and sour (especially without Pennywise, who's notably absent for most of the season).

It's almost as though the prequel isn't equipped to handle significant change. Or it doesn't want to. Either way, I wish I could say I was surprised — something in “Derry” should be.

“It: Welcome to Derry” premieres Sunday, October 26 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and HBO Max. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on December 14.

Woe be upon those who think it's Elvis singing “You'll Never Walk Alone” over the trailer for “Pluribus,” Vince Gilligan's new series for Apple TV, debuting November 7. It's the Righteous Brothers!

That's exactly the kind of petty nitpicking that would probably annoy the hell out of Rhea Seehorn‘s Carol in the new show, which appears to be Gilligan leaving the “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” universe behind and going fully into “Twilight Zone” territory. [Rod Serling voice]: Imagine a world where everyone is forced to be happy, and the one person who is not faces societal pressure to be “fixed.”

 










This is Gilligan going fully outside the box, with the official logline reading “the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness.” It'll unspool weekly on the streamer (don't call it Apple TV+!) through December 26. The nine-episode drama series also stars Karolina Wydra (“Sneaky Pete”) and Carlos-Manuel Vesga (“The Hijacking of Flight 601”), and guest stars Miriam Shor (“American Fiction”) and Samba Schutte (“Our Flag Means Death”).

“Pluribus” of course is the dative case Latin form meaning “of many” as in “E Pluribus Unum,” the traditional motto of the United States: “Out of many, one.” Carol, beware, you are not “of many” in this case.

As a then-untitled project, the show was first announced in 2022, and will be produced by Sony Pictures Television and executive produced by Emmy Award-winning Gilligan alongside WGA Award winner Gordon Smith, Alison Tatlock, Diane Mercer, Allyce Ozarski, and Jeff Frost. Jenn Carroll and Trina Siopy serve as co-executive producers.

This is not entirely unfamiliar territory for Gilligan, as, of course, he got his start with “The X-Files,” which certainly featured a healthy dose of social commentary of its own. (Ryan Coogler has said he's planning an “X-Files” reboot on his own, and it's unclear if Gilligan would at all be involved with that.) And he's explored quite a few genres throughout his career, even the superhero genre with his screenplay for 2008's “Hancock.”

“Pluribus” debuts on Apple TV on Friday, November 7, with new episodes dropping weekly through December 26 after that. Watch the trailer for “Pluribus” below.

A quintessential remake of the streaming era, Hulu's “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” takes a sturdy and flavorful library favorite (the kind of good movie that's still best remembered for its title, Curtis Hanson's 1992 thriller of the same name is a perfect candidate), strips it of any discernible style, modernizes its story in superficially progressive ways that seek to obfuscate its algorithmic conservatism (everyone's bisexual now, but only as a problematized reaction to childhood trauma), and otherwise leaves its promising young filmmaker — in this case, “Huesera: The Bone Woman” director Michelle Garza Cervera — with little chance of finding a soul inside the body of a project that was so clearly budgeted as content.

The plot is largely unchanged: A brunette with two kids is coerced into hiring a hard-eyed blonde as their nanny, only to discover that the help is there to harm. Landlines have been replaced by iPhones, but the call is still coming from inside the (guest) house. This time, however, the house belongs to a high-powered Los Angeles attorney rather than a beatific Seattle housewife named Caitlyn Morales (a tightly wound Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the Annabella Sciorra role), the reason why someone might want to mess with her is tabled until the third act, and the provocative exploration into the hidden sacrifices of Third Wave feminism has been replaced by a vague and unsatisfying story about how hurt women hurt women.

For too much of the movie, the only things we know about Polly Murphy (a shark-eyed Maika Monroe, enjoyably flipping her final girl screen image on its head) are that she likes girls, that she needs a place to live, and that she's harboring a dark secret of some kind. Micah Bloomberg's script doesn't start to unpack what that secret might be until well after Polly has insinuated herself into the Morales' home and become a fixture at their dinner table, but Cervera's lingering close-ups — in concert with the gasping breathiness of Ariel Marx's score — make it awful hard to forget the genre-accented fact of her ulterior motive. So does the Morales house itself, which is the kind of minimalist glass masterpiece that makes everyone inside of it look even more transparent than the walls; the kind of place that could make any family seem like a horror film waiting to happen.

And yet the Morales family appear to be maddeningly well put together at first, which of course makes it all the more palatable to watch the mom come undone. Until Polly begins to overstep with Caitlyn's children (she lets them eat sugar!) and entreat her wildly underwritten husband (Raúl Castillo) into some ADR-ed chatter about jerking off, Caitlyn's biggest problem in life is the lack of a stop sign on the street at the end of her driveway — it's Chekhov's intersection, and the ultimate payoff is very silly. She's rich, she's friends with Martin Starr and Riki Lindhome, and she hasn't had a violently depressive episode since her first child was born some eight or nine years ago, which is when Caitlyn's body formalized the choice to ditch her ex-girlfriend for a life of picture-perfect heteronormativity. But is that who Caitlyn really is, or is she just pretending to be someone she's not? 

 










Polly doesn't try all that hard to find out (the eroticism never really develops beyond a few leering glances and a post-swim neck massage), but “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” is easily at its best whenever it digs into the art of repression — repressed feelings, repressed desires, repressed pain. The film's more compelling moments reflect the rich uncertainty that Polly is able to mine from her new boss, whether that has to do with challenging her parental instincts, her lust for life, or even her sanity. 

The most unusual scene, in which Caitlyn's young daughter announces that she would prefer to marry a woman when she grows up (an idea that Polly may or may not have nurtured), is also the most interesting, if only for how viscerally Winstead cocoons her character's private anxieties and growing suspicions under an outer layer of liberal acceptance. Caitlyn is convinced that she “always fucks everything up,” and Polly knows that ambushing her with a chance to correct one of her own parents' biggest mistakes — with a sudden chance to be as loving towards her daughter's identity as Caitlyn's parents may not have been to her own — will help destabilize Caitlyn, make her second-guess her own reaction, and begin laying the groundwork for the nanny to be the better mom. 

 










In a small and plainly shot movie that spends most of its time on Gaslighting 101, sublimates its true premise into the stuff of a late reveal, and whose only sequence of genre-forward suspense is a predictable snooze, such rare moments of real texture stand out all too much. A few errant asides make it clear that Cervera had more thoughtful intentions for this remake (a stray comment about Caitlyn being married to a Mexican, clumsy in context, hints at just one of the several different ways that a 21st century “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” might have risked being even half as relevant as the original was to its own time 33 years ago), but it's oppressively clear from the start that Hulu's version was greenlit to go down easy — to be the kind of thing that anyone might get sucked into if it started auto-playing 10 seconds after another great episode of “Alien: Earth,” even if that required it to be the kind of thing that everyone would forget about just as fast. 

“The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” will be available to stream on Hulu starting Wednesday, October 22.

It is not news that your teenager may be obsessed with their phone. But a new study tries to understand just how teens and older adolescents in Gen-Z are consuming movies and series, and you may be surprised just how many of them say they're not watching stuff on an actual TV the way people have been doing for decades.

The Center for Scholars & Storytellers at UCLA's Department of Psychology as part of an annual media survey asked 1,500 kids and young adults between the ages 10-24 their opinions about popular culture and media. Among the questions, researchers asked, how often you watch TV shows and/or movies on YouTube or social media platforms like TikTok, even watching them in clips, rather than watching them on TV, on a streaming platform, or in movie theaters?

About two of every five said they watch stuff on social or online rather than watch in traditional ways. Just shy of 20 percent said they always watch things this way, and 23.3 percent said they watch things this way “most of the time.” Only 9.2 percent said “never,” and 12.4 percent said “occasionally.” Separately, nearly half said they do this almost exclusively on their phones, tablets, or laptops, rather than on a TV itself.

 










You may chalk that up to the idea that “young people just don't actually watch movies and TV,” that they're instead consumed with video games, YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and TikTok reels rather than anything you would find on Netflix. But 57 percent of adolescents believe they watch TV and movies more than older generations think they do, that they're actually very media savvy and spend most of their time on social talking about that stuff, but they're consuming it extremely differently. The UCLA study cites another data point via research from Quickplay that says 71 percent of Gen-Z gets recommendations on what to watch just by flipping through shorts on social. 

Complicating and arguably contradicting things further is that one survey question asked that if money was no object and you had a free weekend to hang out with friends, “go see a new movie in theaters” was the top ranked option ahead of (2) “play a new video game,” (3) “binge a new show,” (4) “stream a new movie on my own device,” (5) “go to a music concert,” and (6) “attend a live sporting event.” 

“The findings in this report paint a picture of adolescents who are both more engaged with traditional storytelling and more discerning about it than many adults realize. They haven't abandoned TV shows and movies — they've simply redefined how and where they watch them, and they treat shows and movies as a means for connection,” the survey's conclusion reads.

 










The study also asked teens about what sorts of stories they want to see on screen and what tropes they want to avoid moving forward. You may recall the discourse that dominated Film Twitter recently about backlash to sex and nudity in film. That was somewhat reflected in the study, in which just over half of people aged 14-24 said they're uninterested in romance in content, just about 60 percent said they want “friendships” to be the central relationship in a movie or show, and just over half also want friendships between different genders. 

“If it's [friendship between] two girls, I see that all the time. Classic. But friendship between a girl and a boy that doesn't end up evolving into a romantic relationship? Every single friendship I've seen between a girl and a boy, they end up getting together at the end or someone ends up having romantic feelings for the other person,” one 18-year-old female respondent said in the survey. 

Teens are also sick of storytelling tropes that include love triangles (sorry, Celine Song), toxic relationships framed as romantic, and relationships based mostly on physical attraction, per the survey. Instead, the top trait that all teens said they wanted to see depicted was “people with lives like mine.” That was followed by “Hopeful, uplifting stories with people beating the odds,” and “friendships with social groups.” For what it's worth, “Superheroes” was still the top trait desired by teens when filtering out just boys and young men, despite what some of our recent reporting would suggest.

 










Rather, the survey feels teens want “relatable fantasy,” (if that sounds like an “Itchy & Scratchy” focus group, you're not wrong), and that if supernatural things happen, they happen to grounded, “normal” people they can relate to. It comes as no surprise then when polled about what is teens' favorite movie or TV show, the top two choices were “Stranger Things” and “Wednesday.” 

Netflix is the best at identifying these sorts of fascinations and catering programming to a very specific algorithm, and the top 25 responses to the favorite movie or show question that the UCLA study shared had five different Netflix original properties included, specifically “KPop Demon Hunters,” “Ginny & Georgia,” and “Squid Game,” not to mention several older, licensed titles that are all available for streaming on Netflix like “Breaking Bad,” “The Vampire Diaries,” and “Supernatural.” 

“They're hungry for stories that reflect their actual lives more than fantasy or glamour,” the study reads. “They want to see people who look like them and face challenges like theirs. And perhaps most tellingly, they want to see the relationships that are often central to them: authentic friendships, and especially bonds between people of different genders that don't necessarily turn romantic. This isn't really a rejection of romance — it's a call for relatable stories that honor the full spectrum of human connection.”

If you're not a Colleen Hoover fan, we've got bad news for you: Film adaptations from the best-selling author's many, many novels are heading straight for the multiplex near you in the coming years and months. What started with Justin Baldoni's spectacularly ill-fated “It Ends with Us” last summer — well, not money-wise, that thing made over $350 million, even with those heinous vibes — shows zero signs of abating. Adaptations of “Verity” and “Reminders of Him” are on their way, and the second Hoover film adaptation, “Regretting You,” has now arrived.

 










Thankfully, this particular story trades the icky, criminal (in ways both literal and figurative) drama of “It Ends with Us” for something a bit soapier and silly.

Still, it is Hoover, so tragedy is inevitable (and, yes, still a bit icky). Sisters Morgan (Allison Williams) and Jenny (Willa Fitzgerald) couldn't be more different — Morgan is dependable and steady, Jenny's primary interest is having fun — and their partners only further reflect that divide. Morgan's husband Chris (Scott Eastwood) relished being Jenny's beer pong partner in high school, but Morgan's unexpected pregnancy when she was just 17 forced him to grow up fast. And Jonah (Dave Franco)? Jenny's serious, bespectacled fiancée didn't quite seem like the most obvious match when they were teens — and he sure seemed to like making sad puppy eyes at Morgan — but he's recently returned to town after a long absence, promptly getting Jenny pregnant. 

 










The film, directed by YA dramedy maestro Josh Boone (“Stuck in Love,” “The Fault in Our Stars”) somewhat disconcertingly opens with a high school-set flashback — with all of the aforementioned adult stars playing their teen selves, jarring — that lays out all these complications and more.

Seventeen years later, Morgan and Chris are the proud parents of budding actress Clara (Mckenna Grace), Jenny and Jonah just had an adorable baby and are preparing to get married, and everything feels … well, it feels fine enough, until a horrible tragedy upends all of this and so much more. The tragedy in question is no secret — Chris and Jenny are killed together in a horrific car accident, which inspires all sorts of awful questions — and the fallout is mostly predictable. 

As Morgan and Jonah navigate shifting alliances, Clara grapples with her grief, compounded by her confusion as to what in God's name is going on with her mom and uncle, plus a budding romance with local cool guy Miller (Mason Thames). Unimaginable tragedy! What a turn-on! And yet, within that messiness, there is occasional emotional truth here. Consider this: Chris and Jenny might be phenomenally bad partners, but in the brief moments we get to know them before the accident, we see they have other, very fine qualities. Chris is a good dad and Jenny is a dedicated aunt. Clara adores them, and rightly so. 

 










But that sort of texture and storytelling care isn't always on offer, and there's plenty of information we don't get here. Everything from the gory details about the affair to a wider exploration of the world around this troubled family are lacking. After Chris' funeral (another weird bit: we never see Jenny's funeral, despite Clara often talking about it), stacks of flowers and pre-made meals all but block Morgan and Clara's front door, yet we never see any of those well-wishing friends and neighbors. Grandparents? Nah. Friends from work? Nope. Pals from high school? Negative.

Grief is messy and fucked up, but it too often feels like we're getting through that stuff to get to the good (read: kissy!) stuff. The kissy stuff? Well, it lands, even if in the soapiest of ways. These people all live and love and work in the kind of bubble that exists in many of Hoover's tales of domestic woe. That might even be part of the problem for Morgan and Jonah, who seem to have long ago narrowed their entire social (and romantic) circle to just them and their departed partners.

The teenage romance opens things up a bit more. Much like grief, growing up is messy and fucked up, and Grace in particular takes on the many dimensions of Clara with ease. She's a complicated kid, but one worth rooting for, particularly as it applies to her budding romance and her fraught relationship with her well-meaning mom. 

 










Funny little details still reign here, like how Miller wants to be a filmmaker — the hilariously-placed Sidney Lumet book on his nightstand hammers that home — while the assortment of movie posters on his walls really seals the deal. We're not sure how many teens these days still revere both “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” and “Witness” (??) in equal measure, but good for Miller. (His movie obsession also adds a truly deranged amount of AMC product placement; during movie dates, Clara and Miller seem moments away from filming their own Nicole Kidman ads).

He's also just a nice kid, the last person Morgan should be worrying about being around Clara. Alas, who can blame her for freaking out that her daughter is in love at age 17? Look where that got Morgan. Tucked into the melodrama of “Regretting You,” there is a sweet story about a mother and daughter trying to figure things out, but the reliance on their outside romances often detracts from it. That's a shame.

Still, it's fun to watch “Regretting You” with a crowd who can appreciate and titter at its twists and revelations, people who can vibe with its melodramatic wackiness while also not necessarily making fun of it. During the film's opening flashback, when a young Chris whines to a tee-totaling Morgan “but drunk Morgan is my favorite Morgan!,” the man next to me laughed out an “oh, wow” that landed perfectly; he went on to literally slap his knee at two other points in the film. Now that's the energy a Colleen Hoover joint should inspire.

 










Paramount Pictures will release “Regretting You” in theaters on Friday, October 24.

Guillermo del Toro is a director associated with the dark and the horrifying: Ghosts, vampires, monsters, demons with eyeballs in their hands. And yet, at his heart, the beloved Mexican auteur is one of the most earnest and empathetic filmmakers alive, a director with a lot of love for his characters and particularly the twisted monsters he creates. Many horror influences can be found in his work, and yet few of his films — with perhaps the exception of his first three movies — can really be qualified as horror movies.

Instead, del Toro's movies are best understood as fairy tales drenched in a dark coat of paint, frequently operating with the narrative logic and sweep of an old fable. Sometimes, this approach really works, most famously with his beloved 2006 film “Pan's Labyrinth,” which sets a dark fantasy adventure against a domestic drama playing out in fascist Spain. Other times, his writing is so archetypical that it borders on thin, with gorgeously made setpieces and production design that struggle to prop up anemic storytelling.

All the same, it's hard not to like del Toro and very much root for his success. His films, even when they don't work, show real love and craft in every frame. Particularly endearing is del Toro's sincere love in crafting films about underdogs and outsiders, often casting stereotypical movie monsters in the role. Despite now being a popular Oscar-winning director, del Toro's films still have the same sense of coming from an upstart who lives and breathes cinema, and lives for bringing his passion onto the silver screen. And what form his films take on is always interesting, as he's indulged in all sorts of forms, from artsy Spanish-language offerings to less prestigious but wildly enjoyable action schlock.

With “Frankenstein,” del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of the seminal monster novel, out in select theaters now, IndieWire is taking the time to look at the director's career and determine which of his movies best works as the twisted fairy tale he's spent decades trying to perfect. This list only includes his feature films: TV work such as his Netflix anthology series “Cabinet of Curiosities,” FX thriller “The Strain,” or the children's animated series “Trollhunters” were not included. With that said, read on for every Guillermo del Toro movie, ranked from worst to best. 

Del Toro's highest-grossing film is also, by far, his worst. Normally, it's entertaining to watch the director go all-in on pulpy, cheeseball genre filmmaking, and a del Toro mecha movie feels like it should be a slam-dunk good time. But “Pacific Rim” isn't a good time at all, and has only aged more poorly by the year. Most of the blame falls to the writing — no, a movie about people piloting giant robots to fight a legion of sea kaiju does not need to be Shakespeare, but can it give us anything? The characters are warmed over and poorly developed clichés with little charm, and most of the cast feels adrift in their roles. But the cardinal sin of “Pacific Rim” is the mecha action people came to see; between unimaginative fight choreography and dark lighting that drowns out the action, the robot vs. kaiju showdowns are far more sluggish than they are epic.

Del Toro had a miserable experience making his first studio production, a creature feature about genetically modified insects introduced into the New York City subway system that rapidly evolve and begin hunting humans. Distributed by Miramax, the film was the subject of creative battles between studio heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Del Toro, who ultimately didn't get final cut on the project. The end result isn't totally without merit — like almost every Del Toro movie it at least looks pretty good. But its storytelling is bog standard and bland; you've seen about a thousand films like this, and a hundred of those were probably better than “Mimic.”

Del Toro adapting “Frankenstein” is one of the most obvious pairings of director and subject matter in recent Hollywood memory. And yet, “obvious” isn't always a good thing, and Del Toro's underwhelming and emotionally inert staging of Mary Shelley's foundational story of a monster created by man may be the most disappointing film of his entire career. One of the more faithful adaptations of the original novel in Hollywood history, down to including the long neglected frame story, Del Toro's “Frankenstein” nonetheless misses the mark in terms of the book's complexities, showing little interest in Victor Frankenstein as anything other than a self-absorbed prick with a God complex and the monster as anything other than his creator's misjudged, sympathetic victim. Their roles too obvious and pre-determined, these two men's relationship holds so little of the danger and uncertainty that made Shelley's work riveting. And while Jacob Elordi still manages to pull off a wonderfully sad and moving performance as the monster, Oscar Isaac is completely stranded, and his confused work as Victor leaves the film without a compelling center. 

Despite all the macabre creepiness he's associated with, del Toro at his heart is a softie: He cares about and loves his characters far too much to make a truly cynical movie. In other words, he's a very poor fit to direct a noir, which made his decision to remake the 1947 genre classic “Nightmare Alley” (itself based on a novel) a bit puzzling. The result is relatively faithful to the original bleak tale of a traveling sideshow mentalist (played here by a strong Bradley Cooper) in early '40s America who uses his charm to deceive and swindle the wealthy, but nonetheless lacks the grit and sense of danger that makes noir such an intoxicating genre. The whole thing feels a bit mannered and artificial, a gorgeously crafted study and imitation of the look and feel of classic noirs that lacks their beaten-down soul.

The film that won Del Toro his Oscar, “The Shape of Water” manages the dispiriting feat of being way less weird or interesting than a romance between a human woman and a fish monster should be. Overly chipper and uplifting, the sci-fi romance is totally weightless in its construction, too thinly conceived to give its metaphor for underdogs and outcasts coming together real emotional power. Sally Hawkins is wonderful in the main role as the mute Elisa, who frees and falls for a “Creature of the Black Lagoon”-esque creature, but — as exquisite as the special effects are — Doug Jones' seaman is more of an idea than an actual character. The real love affair in the film is the one between Del Toro and cinema history — from its construction as an old-fashioned Golden Age Hollywood romance to the frequent scenes of the characters in the movie theater, this is a film that nods toward classic cinema, rather than looking forward.

Mike Mignola's “Hellboy” series of comics has always been the most creatively interesting and inventive superhero universe ever put to ink, a saga of a half-demon fighting evil in a world that cribs liberally from Lovecraft and folklore. And del Toro's faithful, wonderfully entertaining film adaptation translates much of the appeal from Mignola's oldest “Hellboy” stories to live action, from the kinetic visuals and inventive action to the ambitious world-building that makes the movie feel like an old horror pulp novel come to life. Most importantly though, del Toro got Ron Perlman to cake on the red makeup to play the title character, and the actor's perfectly gruff, empathetic, and badass performance gives the movie enough gravitas to wade through a bit of origin story busywork weighing it down.  

Del Toro's debut film, “Cronos” would set the precedent for the rest of his career of digging into horror and fantasy with real intelligence and thought. The world-building behind this vampire tale is impressively thought-out and original, introducing a 400-year-old scarab that grants those who come in contact eternal life and a thirst for blood, and del Toro uses this setup to consider what lengths people will go to for immortality, as an elderly antiques dealer (Federico Luppi) battles with a thug (Ron Perlman) attempting to obtain the scarab for his rich uncle, while fighting his newfound vampiric instincts. At 28, del Toro was already an accomplished stylist, and he makes this dramatic and satisfying tale a starkly lit, gory treat for the eyes.

Del Toro's storytelling owes so much to fairy tales that his work can sometimes threaten to feel as thin as one. Unsurprisingly, when he adapts an actual fairy tale, his writing instincts are more a strength than they are a weakness. Taking the classic tale of Pinocchio, del Toro's film in its broad strokes follows the template of the 1883 Italian novel upon which it's based, and many of the same beats that the legendary Disney movie already covered. But it looks incredible, done in a textured stop-motion that makes the puppet's adventures look like an eerie fable, and it's smartly updated too, set against the backdrop of rising fascism in post World War I Italy, contrasting the hero's naive wonder with the harsh realities of the adult world. In this film's context, del Toro's earnestness and love for his characters proves most effective, with a moving coda that can reduce audiences to tears.

The only film del Toro directed without receiving a screenplay credit, “Blade II” is maybe the one time in the director's career where he was a journeyman paying his dues instead of bringing his own vision to life. But the sequel to the iconic 1998 vampire hunter action film is a total blast that outshines the original, and del Toro's direction is a huge part of what makes Wesley Snipes' second outing so exhilarating. David S. Goyer's script flips the plot of the original, following Snipes' Blade as he reluctantly teams up with a group of vampires to combat a new group of “Reapers,” mutants planning a genocide on both species. It's a film as stylish as Blade's long coat and as sharp as his knives, with inventive creature designs and set pieces that make it clear del Toro is having as much fun as the audience is.

Del Toro has always been heavily influenced by gothic horror in his works, but “Crimson Peak” is the only time he's really made a truly gothic film, paying homage to ghost tales like “The Haunting” or “The Innocents” telling the story of a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) swept away by her new husband (Tom Hiddleston) to a moody remote English mansion haunted by spirits and secrets of the past. There's stiff competition, but this might be del Toro's most visually stunning film, with ornate costuming and set design clocked in heavy fog and thick atmosphere. And the story it tells manages to be spookily compelling stuff, especially thanks to Jessica Chastain's marvelously sinister performance as the heroine's scheming sister-in-law, who takes center stage for the film's Grand Guignol finale.

After establishing the world of “Hellboy” in the first film, del Toro was allowed to go all out for the sequel, a superior in every way blast of excessive imagination that lets him go all out on the franchise's potential. Making a soft pivot into a brand of steampunk high fantasy that's utterly, delightfully nerdy, del Toro introduces Hellboy to his newest villains — a race of underworld elves rising up to attempt to take over the planet from humanity. Everything that made the original good, from the performances to the action to the visuals, are refined and improved upon in the sequel, which today feels like an anomaly in the superhero landscape — a second installment able to take risks and get creative instead of giving audiences what they've already seen before. 

Possibly del Toro's darkest and most serious work, “The Devil's Backbone” remains one of his absolute best, using its ghost story as a window into the scars of war. Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, the film takes place in a small orphanage in a remote corner of the country. And it shows us this place from the perspective of young Carlos (Fernando Tielve), who arrives at his new home following the death of his parents and uncovers the mystery of a childish ghost roaming the land. Tender and sad while also managing to be genuinely scary in a way del Toro doesn't always go for, “The Devil's Backbone” paints an evocative portrait of loss and childhood trauma.

“Pan's Labyrinth” is widely considered del Toro's masterpiece, and although it can be fun to go against the grain, why argue against something that's objectively true? This 2006 film made history at the Cannes Film Festival with a mind-boggling 22-minute standing ovation, and you can understand why audiences were so taken by it: A story of fascist Spain wrapped in a dark fairy tale, “Pan's Labyrinth” is both easily accessible and emotionally rich, finding real pathos and stakes in the story of a young girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) escaping into a fantasy labyrinth and away from her caged life with her Francoist stepfather. What makes the film work is the balance between both worlds — the normal drama Ofelia experiences is in many ways scarier than the unforgettable creatures she meets within the labyrinth, and yet the fantasy never detracts, only enriches the human experiences. Stunningly crafted on every level, it's a film that proves the power of the genre and its capability for evocative, poignant storytelling.

Genre:

Rock

Label:

ATO / Julia's War / Smoking Room

Reviewed:

October 22, 2025

Since 2017, They Are Gutting a Body of Water have evolved from Doug Dulgarian's shoegazey, slowcore-influenced solo project into a dense, maximalist quartet that can best be described as the soundtrack to a hypothetical Mario Kart Level of Hell. The band's fusion of drum 'n' bass and breakcore with harsh, dense layers of guitar and bass is often accompanied by rounded, N64-inspired tones, creating a world both playful and sinister in its embrace of the synthetic. Their sound feels massive yet insular in its precision: During live sets, they prefer to play facing each other in a tight circle. On Lotto, TAGABOW's fourth studio album, the band pulls the plug on hyperreality and abandons electronic elements in favor of a more straightforward, live approach: finally letting the screens go black, pulling the blinds up. It's their rawest album yet, both in subject matter and in sound.

Though Dulgarian has previously delved into themes of numbness and isolation, the lyrics have tended to be evasive, allowing his terse, imagistic motifs to slip quietly beneath the crashing riffs. Lotto strips his words bare from the jump. The album opens with “the chase,” a first-person account of suffering through fentanyl withdrawal. “Boosting Gillettes in a hopeful exchange for a sharp but tranqless synthetic isolate,” he mutters, “a substance that'll make me sob pathetic to my girlfriend up high in miracle's castle.” Even when the lyrics are fuzzier and sparser, Dulgarian's voice comes through clearer than ever. On “rl stine,” dedicated to an unhoused friend, he allows certain phrases to come to the forefront of speaker-busting guitar swells: “I know that hurts/Greet the day with a sweet reserve.” Lotto's vignettes become all the more gut-wrenching in their pointed swings toward clarity.

Still, Lotto is not a pessimistic album; it's the band's most hopeful work, in both its brutal honesty and its conscious pursuit of staying grounded. Dulgarian notes that the album is “rife with perceivable mistakes, ebbing and flowing with the most humanity [he] can place on one record.” This sentiment was always present in TAGABOW's music (“Evolve, or die,” he sang on 2022's “webmaster”), but it comes alive in these pared-back arrangements. On the instrumental standout “slo crostic,” Dulgarian, bassist Emily Lofing, and guitarist PJ Carroll each take turns riffing off Ben Opatut's walloping drums before coming together into a relatively simple yet undeniably hooky finish. It feels unrehearsed, or at least looser and more laid-back than ever. Closer “herpim” explores the band's new steadfast approach with lyrics that describe an airplane emergency over ambulance-like guitars and a looming, hoarse bassline. “We couldn't land where we intended ‘cause there's storms,” Dulgarian announces through loudspeaker fuzz, “but now we have to so I need you to buckle in.” The instruments fade out one by one, concluding the album with a few muted drums and the sound of a door opening.

It feels less like a happy ending than a steadfast commitment to finding new territory. That's not to say that TAGABOW have abandoned the sounds that first made them connect; the guitars on instrumental “chrises head” adopt the band's synth interlude skins for old time's sake, and “baeside k” evokes the classic scuzz of 2019's destiny XL. But for the most part, Lotto gambles on TAGABOW's ability to craft songs more compelling in their simplicity and vulnerability than their technical capabilities. By trading in their plastic sheen for a more ragged sense of real-life urgency, TAGABOW expose the tenderness at their music's core: a refusal to anesthetize, an avowal to meet the bone where it breaks.

Rap

Bruiser Wolf has a voice that could grab your attention from the other end of a carnival. It's part of the reason he's become one of the more arresting figures in the Detroit scene and a standout among the Danny Brown-led Bruiser Brigade universe. But the years following his 2021 breakout Dope Game Stupid have been a steady search for the right production style to complement his jaunting soliloquies, laced with drug dealing capers and trapdoor metaphors. It's a balancing act that you could hear throughout 2024's My Story Got Stories, where the more restrained sample loops and conventional structure threatened to tame his magnetic eccentricities.

Wolf's earlier 2025 release, Potluck, was an experimental exercise where he rapped like he was shooting the shit in the pool table from The Mack. He tested how his stories and delivery reacted to a range of beats from Harry Fraud, Knxwledge, Nicholas Craven, F1lthy, and Raphy (who produced much of Dope Game Stupid). It never quite established a uniform rhythm but it did inspire his next venture: a full-length collaboration with Fraud. A tempered course correction from Potluck's gleeful sprawl, the 11-track Made by Dope drills deeper into Bruiser Wolf's conversational writing style with production that's comfortably attuned to his quirks, even if it doesn't necessarily break new ground.

Fraud's production creates the sensation of hearing Bruiser yelping from a sky-blue lowrider Impala across the block. The vocal sample on “Layup Lines,” which is pleasantly reminiscent of a Voices of East Harlem cut, turns into an angelic, unrelenting chorus of background singers that helps lift Wolf's raps off the ground. The truncated jazz suite that opens “Against the Odds” could soundtrack the credits of Coffy before a rousing organ turns Bruiser's jokes about polygamy and flooding the block into a swirling gospel sermon. While Wolf's voice itself is an instrument, Fraud understands it works best alongside opulent compositions. That's partly why “Boss Up” drags near the end with its understated drums and tedious whirring: The production is structured to be repetitive but Bruiser's superpower is his spontaneity. The enthralling beat on “Eye Owe You,” meanwhile, allows Bruiser to crescendo from measured delivery—“The doors on the Porsche open up like a casket”—to paranoid, staccato squawks: “This ain't it!/The cannabis been tampered with.”

Bruiser has rarely played the straight man, especially over the past year with his stellar verses on billy woods' GOLLIWOG and Curren$y's Never Catch Us. That remains true on Made by Dope. “I don't do nothing but think of punchlines all day,” he told an interviewer this year. “I call my people like, ‘Man you think this punchline is stupid?'” He seems even more entrenched in this process throughout Made by Dope, as if he's just getting shots up in the gym. Lines like “She suckin' on the head like she eating a crawfish,” and “I had ‘em at the same time, spontaneous combustion!” manage to feel less crass and more playfully cartoonish when they come out of his mouth. His sports obsession continues to blend with his drug-dealing analogies, which seems to be his priority: He hugged the block so long that they called him for holding and shrugged off disloyal counterparts like Kevin Durant at the free throw line. The pensive interiority and heartbreaking reflection that made Dope Game Stupid so stunning have been largely pushed to the side, or at least sprinkled in like Easter eggs. The jokes still hit—finding different ways to refer to cocaine as various white celebrities will always have a long shelf life. But the peeks into his life have been traded for a bird's eye view.

Fraud's base-level of production and Wolf's commitment to finding new turns of phrase for his endless well of stories combine to elicit a sense of competency, which isn't necessarily a sign of getting stale. He keeps his sports references fresh by referencing Kylian Mbappe, flexes on you by calling your trophy wife a “participation,” and runs a thrilling alley-oop with fellow Bruiser Brigade member ZelooperZ on “The Spaniard.” In the closing “Heart Broke,” he sandwiches lines about cutting the “white girl” so it needs stitches and carrying the “eight” like Lamar Jackson with a brief spiral about the danger of complacency: “People test your pride three times a day/You gon' get aggressive, or shine away/Or get arrested, or you playing it safe/It's a lose, lose, because both a mistake,” he raps. The anxiety is either deep in the rear-view mirror or right around the corner, depending on your perspective.

Ekko Astral are back with the new song “Horseglue.” The single arrives with a black-and-white music video directed by John Lee and the band's Jael Holzman. Watch it below.

“‘Horseglue' is a screeching call for moral clarity,” Holzman explained in a statement. “Anything short of courage against the rise of the New Authoritaria is complicity. It is important to focus on how integral the Messengers really are, and that some of them are the 1%, too.

“Horseglue” follows Ekko Astral's 2024 debut, Pink Balloons, and its companion EP, Pink Balloons: Popped.

	Massachusetts has a rich history of giving the middle finger to tyrants and bloated politicians, and the Dropkick Murphys have been providing the backing track to Boston's antiauthoritarianism since the 1990s. Already an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, frontman Ken Casey is calling for the punk artists and musicians to “never take shit from a bully,” and to “stand up and push back” against the president and his agenda. 


	“I by no means think that punk should be uniformly one thing,” Casey tells Rolling Stone in an exclusive interview. “But the punk that I was raised to listen to, it should be speaking up against abuses in the government.” 


	“Obviously something that's near and dear to our heart is workers' rights,” he adds. “At every level, Trump will turn his back on working people in favor of the elite and the wealthy.… So, on behalf of punk rock, on behalf of regular people, on behalf of America as a whole, we feel like it's our duty to speak out.” 

	











	Casey's public campaign to mobilize punk artists is being launched in partnership with Home of the Brave, a nonprofit founded by former Republicans with a focus on highlighting the negative impact of Trump's agenda on Americans. Casey will join the organization as a member of its advisory board, beginning his tenure with a set of videos centered around his activism and call to action.


	“If we've been outspoken even in times that were nowhere near as drastic as this, why would we not step up our level of activism as the stakes are raised?” Casey says in a recorded interview released Wednesday by Home of the Brave.

	











	“I just like that it's a platform to give people a voice, to be able to tell the story about how things have affected them,” Casey says of his work with the organization. “Too many people in America have to rely on social media or news that might have a certain narrative or agenda, and nothing tells the story of what's going on better than real Americans just talking about what happened to them.”

	Over the past year, Casey and the Dropkick Murphys have become increasingly vocal about their disdain for the president. In July, they dedicated their new single “First Class Loser” to Trump during their appearance at Warped Tour in Long Beach, California, and lambasted the president for his alleged connections to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. In March, they berated a fan waving around a MAGA hat, telling him to “shut the fuck up” for a few minutes while they “a play a song about our grandparents and people who fought Nazis.” 


	“This is America, there's no kings here,” Casey told the man. 


	Casey says their activism is nothing new, he and the band are “doing what we've done for 30 years, playing music for the people.” 


	“I think Donald Trump's done a great job of being divisive. I'd love to see America get away from him and his hateful rhetoric and find our common ground again … but at the same time, you've got to speak truth to power.” 


	While the president has yet to respond directly to the Dropkick Murphy's, other musicians who've criticized the president have found themselves in the crosshairs of his thirst for retribution. Trump threatened to investigate legendary singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen after he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 race. The president also called for Beyoncé to be prosecuted over baseless conspiracies that she was paid to endorse Harris. 


	The administration is currently having a meltdown over the selection of Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny to perform at the Superbowl Halftime Show, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said there will be a heavy ICE presence at the event.

	“[The administration] just wants to control everything, every narrative. There's way bigger problems in the world than who is at the halftime show at the Super Bowl,” he adds, noting his appreciation for how the reggaeton artist had handled the backlash to his activism. 

	











	“If you don't get involved now, you might lose your chance to get involved later, Casey says. “Maybe if you keep your mouth shut and you just go along and get along, it might not affect you yet, but it's going to affect you eventually.”

	The idea of being unstoppable seems to power both of their careers these days: Thanks to propulsive bangers like “Nasty” and the Disco Lines collaboration “No Broke Boys,” Tinashe is enjoying a thrilling second act more than a decade after her breakthrough hit “2 On.” Meanwhile, Amaarae made it big with her acclaimed 2023 album, Fountain Baby, which came after the runaway success of 2020's “Sad Girlz Luv Money.” She's been bringing in more global audiences with her latest LP, Black Star, where she explores the deep roots of electronic music.  

	











	As Tinashe and Amaarae talk, they swap production secrets, parse out what pop even means, and weigh label pressure against the thrill of going indie. In other words, they meet — and match — each other's freaks. 

	











Amaarae: “Is somebody going to match my freak?” was my mantra for two months straight. And it actually led me to the love of my life.


Tinashe: Really?


Amaarae: I swear to God, I found somebody who matched my freak. I wanted to know how personal your songwriting is for you. Is it a cathartic release, or do you use it as a method to get yourself into a headspace or to shed an old phase? What is that for you?


Tinashe: I feel like it's both. I think that's the amazing thing about art and about songwriting. I'm not naturally the most outspoken when it comes to confrontation. I feel like music and art are the easiest way for me to get my emotions across and get things out. In a lot of ways, it is a cathartic release. But then, on the other hand, I also sometimes use music as a manifestation or to project an energy that I want to embody.


Amaarae: So did somebody match your freak?

Tinashe: No one matched my freak. But as long as I can bring freaks together, then the song is doing what it needs to do.


Amaarae: I was introduced to your music when I was 17, 18: Reverie, Blackwater, In Case We Die. Out of the three, Blackwater is my favorite. I think that you set the tone for what became trap soul. I think the production of Blackwater set the tone for what became the PARTYNEXTDOOR sound, the Bryson Tiller sound.


Tinashe: I made all these songs in my bedroom. I was producing some of the tracks, and then I was collaborating with people that I met on Twitter. Those projects were really special in that way. 


Amaarae: What are some things that you apply in your process now that you did then that kind of help you connect with that version of yourself?

Tinashe: It's about reclaiming that spontaneousness, of being able to just make stuff from your soul and from your heart, and not really be so confined to what's going to pop.


Amaarae: If there's anyone in the music industry who knows what it's like to have independent thought, and then have a bunch of people come in and start to tweak and tell you what to do, I feel like it's you. I watched your Complex interview, where you spoke about Aquarius and Joyride, and you were like, “When you're working with the Diplos and the Timbalands and the Max Martins, everyone has an idea of what you should do and be.” I'm curious about that process.


Tinashe: When I was initially creating music, it was “I don't care. It's whatever I want to do.” Finding the discernment to be able to know “OK, this is what I need to do.” I felt the pigeonholing in terms of genre. I felt that really held me back. They didn't leave room for nuance. I'm happy to see that it is improving. Especially as a Black woman, a lot of times they see you and place you in certain areas.… When I went independent, and just started making my own art, that's really when I was able to reclaim that for myself and get back to making things from an instinctual perspective. Do you ever feel like the genres placed on you sometimes either hold you back or help you? 


Amaarae: I just want to take all of the things that made me feel something as a child and reimagine them. No one was telling me what to do because I started off funding my own music. “Sad Girlz” went crazy independent. So after that, I had the cards. I think the first thing that I said to the label I ended up signing to was “I don't want my music touched.” I came in with Fountain Baby finished.


Tinashe: Honestly, for me, it wasn't an in-your-face denial of what I wanted to do. It was sneaky in a way. “OK, well these are the types of records that you can make. But if you want the money, funding, and platform, these records aren't going to get you there.” 


Amaarae: What is a pop platform? There's recognizability, which there are artists who have far more recognizability than me. I believe I will get to that with more sharpening. You don't know pop until it slaps you in the face.


Tinashe: I agree. My music went through a period where it was challenged to be simpler and less complex. There were a lot of times where people were like, “Oh, we really don't understand you. You're very confusing.” How do you think your fans feel in terms of the shift in direction? 


Amaarae: Some found it very jarring. But either y'all are going to get it now or eventually, but that's something that I'm willing to wait on. Some people just said it flat-out sucked. I was like, “That's cap.” But I've seen the tide turn.

	











Tinashe: When I first listened to [Black Star], I noticed the commitment to the style and the feeling of the album.


Amaarae: I don't like to be perceived as someone who doesn't know what they're doing. 


Tinashe: How early on in the process did you know that this was the direction that you wanted?


Amaarae: I was making stuff like this for Fountain Baby. I went to Miami, and I worked with El Guincho. And I brought him samples. I was like, “All right, this is what we about to do.” “Starkilla,” that's a song I heard when I was 13.

“Going to the strip club is like going to church.”


Tinashe: You just had a vision?


Amaarae: It started with the sample, and then we took the sample out and rewrote it for Bree Runway to redo it. It was a lot with the drum patterns.


Tinashe: As a dancer, and as someone of African descent, I feel like I'm very drawn in by the drums and how they make me feel. Black Star feels like almost basically every single track is a song that you could dance to. Is that intentional?


Amaarae: Absolutely. You know why? Because I be onstage bored.


Tinashe: You have to put songs in that you have fun performing.


Amaarae: This is the most fun I've ever had performing an album, because it's so bouncy and so upbeat, and it never stalls. 


Tinashe: I think the drums really drive the song. A lot of times, they're really the heartbeat of what the record is. 


Amaarae: I will either start with a concept, or I'll start with the melody. I have a song on Black Star called “B2B.” I went to my co-writer, and I was like, “You know how the DJs be going B2B [back-to-back], right? There's the meme on Twitter where the girl is masturbating, but she's DJ'ing.” And I was like, “It would be so fire to make a song about two girls going B2B, and the B2B is the sex, but can we write it as if it's DJ'ing.”


Tinashe: Do you just sit in your room and think about it? What's your process for coming up with concepts?


Amaarae: The strip club. I'm not even joking. So many songs for Black Star were born in the strip club or in the midst of baddies.

	











Tinashe: Where's your favorite strip club? Let's get into the good stuff. 


Amaarae: The two best strip clubs in life that I've gone to? Hole-in-the-walls. One is Macombos in D.C. Shout-out to Pink. She got the pineapple tattoo. 


Tinashe: Where's the second one?


Amaarae: Austin, Texas. I went to Austin City Limits. I don't even remember the name of this joint. But let me tell you something. Do you know why I like those two? The hosting was crazy. So Macombos, they all line up and come and shake the hand of every single patron and say, “Thank you.”


Tinashe: That's so kind, so thoughtful, polite. Five stars on Yelp.

“I have so much respect for the artist that I was when I first got in the game, because nobody could tell me anything. I was so determined.”


Amaarae: And shout-out to Lil T in Austin, Texas. Lil T is maybe slightly shorter than you, tatted-up white girl, no ass. But she shook that motherfucker…. Oh, man, she shook that motherfucker.


Tinashe: I feel like every time I'm at the strip club, I always bond with them on a personal level.


Amaarae: Going to the strip club is like going to church. That's my tithe for the year. I go to the strip club to tithe. Yes, ma'am. And as you can see, the ideas are free-flowing, by the grace of God. Seriously, the strip club is a very big influence for me, but also just being in the midst of beautiful women. 


Tinashe: Are you more locked in when you're in love or when it's toxic?


Amaarae: Fountain Baby was toxic. Black Star, I was just in a cleaner, much more reciprocal love. I don't think that people really stop to think about how GOAT'd you are. Songs for You was 2019. That was your first independent release?


Tinashe: Mm-hmm. I've been focused in the past five years on just following an instinctual part of me and not really considering what was holding me back. I think that I really achieved that. I think on a spiritual level, people can feel when the music is coming from a genuine place. I have so much respect for the artist that I was when I first got in the game, because nobody could tell me anything. I was so determined. I had this unwavering sense of what I wanted to achieve, and that's something that's been tested over the years, but it's never something that I've lost. I think that is the sole reason why I'm still in the game.


Amaarae: Do you like touring?


Tinashe: I love touring. But I have a really hard time doing both at once. Some people can make a project and be on tour at the same time. I feel like I have to give all my energy to the project, and then all my energy to promoting it, and then all my energy to the tour. Do you like touring? 


Amaarae: I love to perform. I hate to tour. I'm a real homebody. I don't really go out even.


Tinashe: I mean, your music sounds like you go out.


Amaarae: I have a shell personality, and that's who Amaarae is. All the music that you guys hear is just my imagination of a personality.


Tinashe: Really?

	











Amaarae: Twenty percent is the persona within. It's not something that I just made up, but it's something that's within. But 80 percent of who I am, I'm very quiet. Touring completely just discombobulates me. 


Tinashe: I can definitely relate to having different personalities. There's your true self, and then there's also your artist self. My artist self isn't any less of my true self. It's just a different part of my true self.


Amaarae: You know Severance? That's my artist self when I get into that split. When I'm done, I don't even remember 500 percent of what happened because when I come back to myself, I really have to be just Ama. How have you been able to navigate changes in the industry as time goes on?


Tinashe: It's always maintaining a sense of who you are, your own identity. At the end of the day, trends come and go. If you're too tied to what's popular, you can easily lose yourself.


Amaarae: What do you think is down the line for you?


Tinashe: Five years down the line, I think I'll still be creating music. I still have a lot that I want to share and give and create, and achieve. I'm definitely still writing this story. Ten years from now? I can't predict. I think it could go so many different directions. I just love creating things. I don't have a very rigid plan. Do you?


Amaarae: I have zero plans, but what I do know is that my body can't tour forever, so we're going to have to call it quits at some point. I really want to get into executive production for other artists. I love having a vision and deconstructing it just to put it back together. Are there any other businesses that you're into that are helping to keep your music career going?


Tinashe: I've got some things that I'm working on. They're still secret. 


Amaarae: Are any parts of your body insured? Are your vocal cords insured?


Tinashe: No. Oh, my God. Are you insured?


Amaarae: Oh, yeah. But you know what? My mom owns an insurance company with my brother. Do you have life insurance?


Tinashe: Yeah. The whole me is insured, but not specific things.


Amaarae: Your legs, because you're a dancer. Wow. You got to get on that.

	











Tinashe: You're not wrong!


Amaarae: You can call us. GGMB Insurance! We got you. Car, house, anything. [Both laugh.]

	In 1981, Bruce Springsteen found himself at a crossroads. He'd just finished his tour for The River, which had brought his marathon-length, rock & roll-revivalist shows to a record number of audiences. The E Street Band was hitting on all cylinders. “Hungry Heart” was his first single to crack the Top Five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His record label's commitment to nurturing his career and breaking him into the big leagues had finally paid off. Springsteen was now poised to be a superstar — not the new Dylan or the next Elvis, but fulfilling his destiny to become the long-awaited messiah known as “Bruuuuuce.” And the man who would be the Boss was truly, madly, deeply confused about what to do next.


	Fame did not become him. Nor did hearing his own voice blasting out of the radio, preaching about how you lay down your money and you play your part. So Bruce retreated to a rental in Colts Neck, New Jersey. He sat in with local bar bands at the Stone Pony, happy to be just another working musician cranking out Little Richard covers. He read the short stories of Flannery O'Connor. He brought in a newfangled home-recording device called the TEAC 144, in case he felt like cutting demos for the boys. He thought about his childhood, how dancing with his mother in their old living room gave him such joy, and how his father inspired such fear and dread in him as a kid.

	











	And late one night, Bruce happened to catch Badlands, Terrence Malick's 1973 movie that dramatized the killing spree of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate, on TV. A rabbit hole appeared before him. Soon, he picked up his guitar and began singing: “He saw her standing/On her front porch/Just a-twirlin'/Her baton.” A few days later, after working out more of the song he initially called “Starkweather,” Bruce changed that “he” in the first line to “I” — the stark, old-weird-America death trip made personal. Then our hero went wandering down a path that would eventually cause the record company to lose their shit, force his manager Jon Landau to defend his friend's artistic integrity, risk alienating his fan base, and produce the bleakest and arguably best front-to-back masterpiece of his discography to date.

	Even casual students of Springsteenology 101 know the when, why, and how behind this outlier of a record, not to mention what lay just beyond the horizon. Which doesn't keep Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere from laying out all of the details about the making of Nebraska, his 1982 album that gave a voice to unrepentant murderers, tortured highway patrolmen, wannabe mobsters, car thieves, and Bruce's own conflicted memories about his childhood. (Nor does it stop Disney, the company releasing the movie, from asking folks to “refrain from revealing spoilers, cameos, character developments, and detailed story points” — easily the biggest laugh we've had in the year of our Lord 2025.) Based on Warren Zanes' invaluable book of the same name, writer-director Scott Cooper's thinly sliced biopic-in-miniature boils everything down to a pivotal year in Bruce's life, right before the Boss is about to go stratospheric. First, however, the rock star has to come perilously close to hitting rock bottom.


	And who better to play a moody, mercurial Bruce than Jeremy Allen White? Never mind The Bear — meet the Boss, fighting the same demons and nagging feelings of self-doubt that would cause Carmy Berzatto to stoically nod in recognition. Thankfully, White does not try to mount an impersonation of Springsteen; other than some onstage jumps and a brief, raspy post-concert exchange, there's no real attempt to “do” Bruce. (Though the idea of releasing a soundtrack of the actor singing Nebraska tracks is certainly … a choice.) White smartly leans into an overall loner vibe that suggests someone lost in the wilderness of his own isolation. Springsteen was famous enough to get recognized by a car salesman and passersby, yet still local enough to sit in every Sunday night with your basic around-the-way rockers. He's fighting what's coming and figuring out where he fits in. “I know who you are,” that salesman admits. “That makes one of us,” Springsteen replies.

Deliver Me From Nowhere actually works best when you forget you're watching a biopic — an irony, considering the title and marketing — and focus on one of the other half dozen genres that Cooper and Co. are serving up. It's a process movie keen on showing you how Springsteen recorded a handful of spare, sketch-like takes of “Atlantic City,” “Mansion on the Hill,” and “Nebraska” in his bedroom, as well as the way he and his cohort fought to preserve the crude vibe of those four-track demos, modern sound mixes be damned. It's a character study about a small-town guy trying to hold on to where he came from so he can stay grounded about where he's going. It's a Greek tragedy given a serious Gothic makeover, with black-and-white flashbacks depicting a young Bruce (Matthew Anthony Pellicano Jr.) living in the shadow of an imposing, menacing father (Stephen Graham, great as always) and a protective mother (Gaby Hoffmann). Family ties and Working Class USA environments are a Cooper specialty — see Out of the Furnace, Black Mass, Crazy Heart — and these scenes both stick out from the rest of the storytelling and bring out the best in the filmmaker.

	











	And it's a love story, though not between Bruce and his girlfriend Faye Romano (Odessa Young), a composite of, per his memoir, “the perfectly fine women” he “roughly failed … over and over again.” Deliver is, at its core, a tribute to the bond between Springsteen and Jon Landau, played here by Jeremy Strong with big hang-dog energy. A manager, a consigliere, a confidant, a guardian angel, and a brick wall separating Bruce from the Columbia Records brass, Landau is the best friend a self-sabotaging rock star could ask for. Even when he hears the future, in the form of the E Street Band's first stab at recording “Born in the U.S.A.,” this loyal advocate stands by his man. You'll get your blockbuster, company suits, but this is the next album. Yes, this is what it sounds like. No, there won't be press, or tours, or sex-symbol poses on the cover. Landau is not in the music business. He's in the Bruce Springsteen business, and what the Boss wants, the Boss is gonna get.


	You wonder if something similar didn't transpire with film executives as well, who thought they were getting the next cradle-to-grave musical-superhero extravaganza here — a Boss-hemian Rhapsody. After seeing an early re-creation of that final River tour concert, with the final minutes of “Born to Run” getting the full Queen-at-Live-Aid treatment, they were probably levitating out of their seats. By the time they get to tiny, monochromatic Bruce cowering next to his pops while watching Night of the Hunter, their response could have been an encore from '82: “So this is the biopic, and it's going to be a trauma drama that looks and sounds like this?” It's probably the only movie about a rock star in which the payoff isn't gold records but going to therapy and seeing a grown man sit on his elderly dad's lap. The money shot isn't a fist held high in the sold-out arena air. It is a moment in which, to paraphrase the Bible: Bruce wept.

	There is also, of course, the 100 million-dollar question: What will Springsteen fans think of this? Some will find it dour to a fault. We don't blame them. Others will wish it had more sequences like the one in the Power Station, where Bruce and the band tear into “Born in the U.S.A.” and heed Landau's corny demand to “burn it down.” We don't blame them either, though despite the movie's flaws, what Cooper has given audiences here is way more compelling than a live-action greatest-hits compilation.

	











	Many, however, will likely appreciate how well the film reflects not the early-1980s Bruce but the one circa the 2020s, who's become remarkably reflective and honest about himself in his autumn years. Deliver Me From Nowhere is a story about an artist following his muse off a cliff. The fact that you know he parachutes to safety and produces an enduring work sans compromise gives it a default happy ending. But what it's really doing is presenting a portrait of a slow-motion nervous breakdown that's narrowly avoided, and only because the subject was willing to finally reckon with his past. The song that comes to mind at the end of this isn't from Nebraska. It's from the title track of an album he'd put out 40 years later, one in which the hero is “wearing a cross of my calling/On wheels of fire I come rolling down here.” Poised to became the savior of rock & roll, Bruce fell into a hole. Then he exorcised something via these dark dirges from the edge of his psyche, and you realize you've spent two hours watching him come on up for the rising.

Depeche Mode will include four previously unreleased tracks from their most recent album, Memento Mori, on a new live album set to arrive Dec. 5. 


Memento Mori: Mexico City primarily features performances from Depeche Mode's three-night run at Mexico City's Foro Sol Stadium in 2023. But the four unreleased tracks — “In the End,” “Survive,” “Life 2.0,” and “Give Yourself to Me” — all come from the studio sessions for Memento Mori, which was recorded back in 2022. 


	The first of these four songs, “In the End,” will be released to streaming services on Oct. 24. Some fans were able to hear it early, though, when “In the End” played during the end credits of Depeche Mode: M, a new film that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival back in June.


Depeche Mode: M was directed by Mexican filmmaker Fernando Frias and it will get a limited theatrical release starting Oct. 28. M is not a concert film in the strict sense, with Frias pairing performances from Depeche Mode's Memento Mori tour with an exploration of the role mortality plays in Mexican culture. The film features narration from actor Daniel Giménez Cacho, as well as interviews with fans, artists, and other cultural commentators.

	Death was, of course, also a potent subject for Depeche Mode, as the title, Mento Mori, suggests. The album was recorded in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also the unexpected death of keyboardist and founding member, Andy Fletcher, in February 2022. 

	











	Following its theatrical release, Depeche Mode: M will get a physical release on Dec. 5. A box set will contain a DVD/Blu-Ray of M, as well as a second disc with the more traditional concert film, Memento Mori: Mexico City, which Frias also directed. A double-disc live album for Memento Mori: Mexico City will also be included in the box set, though the LP will have its own release on CD and vinyl, too.

The acronym UFO simply means – UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. This term when used explains exactly what it means and the implied sightings. For decades, there has been and still is, a very high interest for those things flying around our skies that look odd and defy explanation. Certainly, today the use of “drones” and their images in the sky get our attention as well.

However, push the 2025 button and we now have a brand new acronym – UAP. This relatively new governmental acronym came about in 2022 and translates to: UNIDENTIFIED ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA.

In essence, it's a catch-all term used while detecting objects in air, sea or space that cannot be identified. 

Historically, there was an incident on July, 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico that spawned infatuation with the unknown. A report was filed that stated an “object” had crashed in the area and was allegedly an extraterrestrial spacecraft and alien occupants were inside and were captured.

The rumors spread quickly that the military had engaged in a cover up of it all.

The decade of the 40's continued with a spoof of a new American hero arriving on earth traveling inside a comet type spacecraft and he would be here for us to fight for truth, justice and the American way. He would become our super hero from outer space -Superman!

1948 even brought about the filming of a serial entitled “Superman” to theaters across the country. Yeah, everyone came to know and respect Clark Kent. Superman became the alien from a planet called Krypton with super powers and became a hero American came to love. This creation fell right in line with the UFO sightings of the era.

By 1951 through 1958, the “Adventures of Superman” (George Reeves) a new TV series showcased our friendly alien hero. To this day here in 2025, even now three is a new Superman movie which it the screens arriving last summer. This time, Superman is 6'8 270 lbs.

In 1955 the very small town of Rachel, Nevada became the sight to be known as “AREA 51”; a highly classified Air Force facility about 80 miles from Las Vegas. The intense secrecy surrounding the base led to the public opinion that UFO's were involved. So much so, the town of Rachel became a tourist attraction and the town's main road was called – “Extraterrestrial Highway.”

The decade of the 60's kept it all going with a new TV series -“THE INVADERS” which ran from 1967 through 1968. Another series with aliens from another planet in spacecrafts to take Earth for their own starring Roy Thinnes.

Today there are millions who truly believe that aliens and/or their spacecrafts cruise our skies. Others, in contrast strongly reject any thoughts or beliefs that there are UFO's or UAP's.

However, Luis Elizondo a former military intelligence officer, author, media personality and UFO activist, claims that UFO's are of extraterrestrial or interdimensional origin.

2017 brought about his resignation from the military in order to protest what he characterized as excessive secrecy and internal opposition.

He then became very active in promoting his beliefs publicly via the media and through his book – “Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFO's.”

In November of 2024, Elizondo appeared before a joint hearing of the United States House Oversight Subcommittee on National security while exposing the truth as he believed it in regard to UFO's and UAP.

One of the most intriguing UFO incidents occurred on January 7, 1948 when Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a Kentucky National Guard pilot, died when his P-51 Mustang fighter plane he was piloting crashed near Franklin, Kentucky.

It all began with a call to the Kentucky Highway Patrol (became Kentucky State Police July 1, 1948) reporting an unusual aerial object near Maysville, Kentucky. It was described as “circular” and 300 feet in diameter. It was determined it was neither an aircraft or weather balloon.

Four planes were dispatched to approach the object. One of those pilots was Captain Mantell who began chase of the UFO climbing to 22,000 feet. This was dangerous due to the lack of sufficient oxygen on board and later determined that Mantell passed out at 25,000 feet and crashed near the Kentucky-Tennessee border.

Some say that Mantell stated: “It looks metallic and is tremendous in size.”
 
However, former U. S, Air Force Captain Edward Ruppelt stated that no one at the tower could recall his description of the object.

The Mantell incident was reported nationwide via the media with many claims and some that the object was even a soviet missile. Many more became just rumors. No evidence has ever surfaced to substantiate any of the claims.

However, a video is available at YOUTUBE entitled – “MANTELL UFO INCIDENT – MILITARY CASE FILES” giving more specifics in depth and several military statements including those from Ohio as well. 

Actually, later the same day of January 7, 1948 there were sightings in Ohio at the Clinton County airbase in Wilmington and Lockbourne Airbase in Columbus that occurred from 7 p.m.-8 p.m.

With the mention of the state of Ohio, there is MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) located in Cincinnati.



This non-profit organization is composed of civilian volunteers who study reported UFO sightings. It is one of the oldest and largest organizations of its kind with more than 4,000 members that cover more than 43 countries and all 50 states in America. Located currently in Cincinnati, it holds annual international symposiums and publishes the monthly MUFON UFO JOURNAL. The network claims more than 500 non paid field investigators and specialized teams to investigate possible physical evidence or extraterrestrial craft. Investigators must pass both an exam based on a 265 page manual and background check.

Its website is located at: www.mufon.com and its offices at 4212 Airport Road, Suite 100 Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, 513-871-8367

So, be it 1947 or 2025, the magnetic interest in UFO's and UAP's continues even today. Don't let a skyborne craft get by you, keep an eye on the skies.

One thing for sure, it's not SUPERMAN!

The discovery of a mysterious interstellar object called ""3I/ATLAS"" and its transit through our solar system has set off all kinds of speculation about whether the fairly massive visitor could be some kind of alien probe. But now one NASA scientist has suggested that extraterrestrials might not be able to visit our little corner of the galaxy because, well, their technology may be just as crummy as ours.

In a research paper titled ""A Less Terrifying Universe? Mundanity as an Explanation for the Fermi Paradox,"" NASA and University of Maryland astrophysicist Robin Corbet argues that the reason we haven't closely encountered any aliens is because they actually lack warp drives or access to wormholes. In fact, Corbet says, they likely don't possess any tech that's significantly more advanced that what humans have:

Applying a principle of ""radical mundanity,"" this paper examines explanations for the lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy.... With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so.

The paper's ""Less Terrifying"" reference is in relation to a comment from sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke, who is said to have once postulated that we are either alone in the universe or we aren't, and that both possibilities are equally scary.

Physicist Enrico Fermi reportedly proposed the paradox named for him in the 1950s, sometimes expressed as the question ""Where is everybody?"" At root, Fermi wondered why, if life should be bountiful in a vast universe, we haven't yet encountered any other civilizations. Various explanations have arisen over the years, ranging from humanity being the only evolved, intelligent life that's smart enough to ask the question, to the likelihood that aliens are so far beyond us in intelligence that we're effectively irrelevant to them. (My personal favorite is that the most intelligent life in the universe is actually aquatic — life on Earth started in the oceans, after all — and so we live in a galaxy of whales who have no interest in leaving their happy watery homes.)

Corbet acknowledges that we have spent decades talking about UFOs and have developed a massive subculture around them, but the NASA researcher notes that no one has found any definitive evidence that sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena can be traced to objects not from this planet. That said, controversial Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has been responsible for all manner of interesting theories about why 3I/ATLAS could be a fragment of incredibly sophisticated ET engineering. (Loeb has also been doing real science, of course, undercutting some of the more outrageous speculation about what is probably just a big comet.)

The radical mundanity idea is a bit of a turn on Occam's razor: If we haven't seen any aliens yet, it's because they're either a lot like us, maybe just a little bit better, or possibly worse. The simplest explanation is best. ""The idea is that they're more advanced, but not much more advanced,"" Corbet told the Guardian. ""It's like having an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17,""

He also suggests that even relatively advanced civilizations might send out a bunch of probes, find nothing at all — or nothing remarkable — and give up on exploration. After all, civilizations may all be too far away from each other in space, and too technologically limited, to ever interfere with each others' destinies.

In his paper, Corbet also entertains a variety of refutations of the mundanity theory. Obviously, if the aliens show up, the theory is disproven, as they would need very advanced tech to get to Earth. But even if we did detect a distant extraterrestrial civilization, it could turn out to be just slightly more impressive than our own. We wouldn't get that much out of the encounter, scientifically, and might have to conclude that mundanity is the rule in the Milky Way. Sorry, UFO obsessives. It really could be that boring.

The UFO was seen traveling down the Misssissppi river

POLICE officers chased after a mysterious six-ringed UFO which nearly collided with a helicopter. 

The officers observed the object from a parking garage using binoculars, according to a report filed with Americans for Safe Aerospace.

The anonymous report to Americans for Safe Aerospace, led by former US Navy pilot and whistleblower Ryan Graves, recounts the incident in full detail.

According to the report, three Minneapolis police officers saw the unidentified aerial phenomena, also known as a UAP, about 10,000 feet above them.

The UAP reportedly had six interlocking rings of changing colored lights.

Officers observed the object “moving with both slow and with rapid acceleration, and exhibiting positive lift without noise.”

The UAP continued its bizarre movements for 25 minutes until a civilian helicopter approached it. 

Within five seconds of the aircraft arriving, the UAP moved about 40 miles north.

After moving, the UAP remained in the same general location.

The report, which happened in February, described the mysterious object as being “lethargic.”

One of the officers kept an eye on the object, while the other two observed it from the parking garage.

On July 7, in Anoka, Minnesota, approximately 21 miles outside Minneapolis, a similar object was observed.

A witness observed the UAP approximately one mile away. 

The object then began to travel along the Mississippi River at around 460mph, according to the report.

It then abruptly descended behind nearby trees.

Witnesses of the UAP took photos and videos, which are also shared in the report.


						Here's what you need to know...					

Although believers of the unknown took this as a sign of otherworldly interactions, scientists have a different explanation.

An expert at Enigma Labs, which dissects UAP sightings, said it may have been the International Space Station controlled by NASA.

“The ISS has flown over the area for the last few days and was very bright. What we see in the video could be the ISS, but we will need more details to rule it out,” Enigma advisor Alenjandro Rojas told The Daily Mail.

“The video also doesn't look like ‘six interlocking rings of colored lights.' A small point of light in the distance can appear to be multiple colors when it is not, due to the atmosphere between the witness and the object. 

“This is called scintillation and is the same thing that makes stars twinkle.”

The This Country creators and stars are back on screen together, spending the night in notorious and reportedly haunted buildings across the UK

Daisy May & Charlie's NightWatch sees This Country creators and stars Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie reunite on screen to spend the night together in notorious and reportedly haunted buildings across the UK, discovering long hidden secrets about the buildings – and each other.

Since childhood, Charlie and Daisy have been fascinated by the paranormal. They think it was fuelled by the creepy movies they were allowed to watch as kids and it's a passion they both have followed fervently ever since.

In NightWatch, they seize the opportunity to prove any existence of spooks, spirits and ghouls. To give themselves the best chance, they visit some of the UK's most reputedly haunted locations and challenge themselves to stay overnight.

This is also a chance for the siblings to spend some much-needed time together, to reconnect and once again enjoy their shared sense of humour – whatever the circumstances.

CQ

Tell us about what led you to doing this new series together?

Daisy: Ever since we were kids, we've really been into the paranormal or supernatural, so that always fascinates me. We've also just not had the time to spend together since doing This Country. We've both had kids since and we just don't get to do creative things or spend time with each other without the family around. So this idea came from both of those things really.

Charlie: We've both been into this stuff for so long and it's something we've always shared. Like you say, with work and family life at home making it difficult to spend time together, this was a brilliant way of hanging out again, doing what we love – but obviously in a bit of a bizarre and weird environment!

What encounters have you had in your life with the paranormal?

Daisy: I've spoken about quite a few different times where I've come across the unexplained or had actual encounters with ghosts – like something pulling my duvet up from my bed, and the legs of the little boy running in a bedroom of mine a few years ago. But recently, our nanny was staying the night in our house and she got jabbed in the back and then my dad was staying over and he had a bath in the en-suite there and got jabbed in the neck.

And then my mum was in there two days ago and she heard a man's voice in the bathroom, saying ‘honey'. Which is the name of my mum's dead dog, which is just really weird. I heard knocking also in the morning again at home recently. Weirdly, it always happens in the morning, so never at night-time when you'd think it'd be scary. It's just so wild.

Charlie: I personally haven't had any encounters with the paranormal, but that's the reason why I wanted to do the show so much, because I would really love to have an experience. Having said that, it surprised me how spooked I got when we were filming, so I might have to rethink that.

But our grandad saw a ghost years ago and I remember vividly him telling us what happened and the way he described it was so captivating. It had me hooked on the paranormal ever since. He lived in this old cottage and there was an alleyway than ran alongside the house into a dead end and he saw a peasant figure with a pickaxe on the shoulder walking down the alley and then disappear into the end wall. He mentioned it to his neighbour, and they had seen the same ghostly figure a few times over the years, which is pretty mad. I had no reason to doubt my grandad – he was a GP and really straightforward reliable guy. So I suppose I started believing in ghosts from then on.

What were the locations like? Did you look forward to staying there?

Charlie: It was pretty amazing. To have access to these incredible places like that – and be left alone in a building that's known for being haunted... you can't get better than that. We've both been so into all the YouTube shows and groups who are into it, but we've dreamed about this kind of thing since we were kids.

Daisy: You'll see in the first episode at Gloucester prison – you'd just never ever go there if you weren't a little bit obsessed. It's totally empty and so bleak! Meeting Clive the custodian, who showed us around and talked us through the history, was creepy enough it itself. Clive wasn't creepy at all! But he really painted a picture of what used to happen there and all the executions and hangings. Honestly, I did think then, what the hell are we doing getting left in a cell here overnight?

Charlie: Yeah, it was like silence and echoes and you could hear any small sound. We didn't really know what we were in for. Knowing all the stuff that went on and the people who died there. I think we were both relieved to be sharing a bunk bed in the end!

Daisy: And at Chillingham Castle in Northumberland, they had an actual torture dungeon there! They say there's a 17th century Spanish witch who haunts the place as she loves it so, so much. You see loads of letters from people who've been there and might have taken something from the castle or annoyed the witch. And those people have had really awful luck since, and they want to return what they took and leave a letter for the witch. It's crazy and there are so, so many letters that they can't all be wrong, can they?

Where do you think your interest in ghosts and the supernatural stuff come from?

Charlie: I guess being allowed to watch anything as a kid, probably sort of terrified us. Our parents let us watch whatever we wanted and obviously one of the things we had to do growing up in the countryside was going to the video shop to rent out whatever we could. I swear we watched the entire collection of horror films they had. Not sure it was a great thing ,but we loved it so much.

Daisy: We'd stay up late and watch this stuff. We were so young I realise now! I tell you where mine started – Casper - we loved that VHS! And Ghostbusters we used to love. We had the record of Ghostbusters and you used to march around the dining room to it.

Charlie: Ha ha, yes, and Nightmare Before Christmas was another one. We've always just been drawn to the supernatural and ghosts, haven't we? There was always like, the Ouija board lying around and mum would have friends who'd be spiritual mediums.

Daisy: We'd want to play Operation the board game and she'd say 'no, why don't you get the Ouija board out and go have a go on this?'

Charlie: It's probably not a good thing, and we weren't cleansing ourselves before we did the game.

Daisy: No, absolutely not and we'd just play on the Sega Mega Drive straight after.

What can you give away about any spooky encounters or what you discovered? Has it changed the way you think about haunted spaces or the paranormal?

Charlie: Well, we can't give away too much obviously. Part of what we enjoy with this stuff is the suspense! But I tell you what was weird. The spookiest thing that wasn't caught on camera was in the pub in York, you know, on the bar they had all beer glasses on the hooks. One was just swinging and the others were totally still – I had no idea why - but it wasn't on camera.

Daisy: You're also forgetting that insane telepathy test we did – that blew my mind. It was so weird seeing how we matched. I was like, surely we're not that similar?! And both of us are still so obsessed with paranormal activity and it's spurred me on to keep looking for evidence. I do it in my life anyway, but even more so now!

Charlie: Oh, I'll never stop looking for ghosts.

Daisy: If I was a ghost, I'd hate all those people that do the tours or like me asking them how they died and all that. I bet they're like, oh god, are you bringing this up again?

Have you learned anything about yourselves or each other?

Charlie: Sharing room together again was funny.

Daisy: What I like about you is you're very sort of long and thin and you take up very little space. You don't snore either.

Charlie: Yeah, I didn't snore because I wasn't sleeping! Did you know you vaped in your sleep?

Daisy: Yeah, I know that. That is terrifying. And I'm not the only person who vapes like that.

Charlie: You're clutching the vape as you sleep so tightly, it's mad. It's like, no one can prize it out of your hands! But sharing a room was like a throwback to being kids.

Daisy: Yeah, and you getting the bunk that you want! I learned that you've not really changed at all, really. It's funny that, when you're just an adult version of a kid.

Charlie: I don't think anyone really changes, do they? You put on a front to other people you don't know, how you want someone to perceive you, but fundamentally in your core person, you don't change from when you're a child. But seriously, it has made me realised that after This Country came out, we've kind of been separated again. Working so closely with each other and then nothing near that, is weird. We were so lucky to get the show we'd worked so, so hard to get but after, we had so much else going on. So with this, it's been really good to reconnect and with actual proper time. I've missed you a lot and family and work and get in the way.

Daisy: Same for me. I remembered you're a really lovely brother. Plus we did go off on so many tangents digging up our past and our childhoods – finding out some ridiculous truths from when we were kids about what really happened to my toys. And also we found out we're distant relatives of a very notorious historical figure, which does explain a lot!

How do you think audiences will react to the show? Is it important to be a believer in the paranormal to enjoy it?

Daisy: I mean, I hope they enjoy it – even if it's just us being awful to each other. But honestly you don't have to be as obsessed with the paranormal to enjoy the show – we're just exploring and I think I'm more of a believer than Charlie and he loves it all anyway.

Charlie: Yeah – I've gone into this completely open and whether you've had an encounter yourself or not, these places are fascinating, they're creepy. We do have some really eye-opening experiences there and there's a lot that we don't know or understand.

Daisy: There are loads of unanswered questions and I won't spoil it but you'll know when you see it, that there's some really crazy stuff in there. Anyway, look, if you like it, say you do and l like it on social media. Help us out and be loud with your praise. And if you don't like it, just don't say anything.

Charlie: Don't say it.

Daisy: But if you like us, and you're going out for the day, put just put it on while you're out, because it will still clock it up on iPlayer, and it keeps dogs company.

Charlie: It does keep dogs company.

Specialty themed pop-up bars

For those with the ZDI All Access, specialty themed pop-up bars offer immersive experiences like a forgotten video store, a secret sci-fi facility, an Aztec underworld, and a mad scientist's mansion. These spots are not age restricted, and serve both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. One complementary drink is included with this experience.

The four themes are:

• Be Kind, Rewind … Or Die: Step into a forgotten video store where the '80s never died.

Sip themed cocktails and snack on cosmic finger foods in an immersive sci-fi station featuring retro-future tech, alien autopsies, and the eerie hum of a station that should have stayed sealed.

• 9 Niveles: Descend into the forgotten depths of Mictlán, the Aztec underworld, in 9 Niveles — a secret pop-up where each level reveals a darker layer of the afterlife. Inspired by ancient mythology and steeped in horror, this immersive experience blends ritual, shadow, and story with themed cocktails and ritual-inspired snacks. ​

• The Cadaver Club: The secret parlor of a deranged doctor whose own blood fuels a terrifying undead serum. Step inside his decaying mansion, where failed experiments roam and the line between science and madness is long gone. Enjoy twisted drinks, and snack on foods served straight from the morgue.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","UFO Obsessives Will Be Disappointed By New Theory That Says Aliens Probably Don't Have Wildly Advanced Technology","https://www.jalopnik.com/2003736/aliens-arent-so-smart-either-nasa-scientist-argues/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 04:25:00 GMT","

The discovery of a mysterious interstellar object called ""3I/ATLAS"" and its transit through our solar system has set off all kinds of speculation about whether the fairly massive visitor could be some kind of alien probe. But now one NASA scientist has suggested that extraterrestrials might not be able to visit our little corner of the galaxy because, well, their technology may be just as crummy as ours.

In a research paper titled ""A Less Terrifying Universe? Mundanity as an Explanation for the Fermi Paradox,"" NASA and University of Maryland astrophysicist Robin Corbet argues that the reason we haven't closely encountered any aliens is because they actually lack warp drives or access to wormholes. In fact, Corbet says, they likely don't possess any tech that's significantly more advanced that what humans have:

Applying a principle of ""radical mundanity,"" this paper examines explanations for the lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy.... With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so.

The paper's ""Less Terrifying"" reference is in relation to a comment from sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke, who is said to have once postulated that we are either alone in the universe or we aren't, and that both possibilities are equally scary.

Physicist Enrico Fermi reportedly proposed the paradox named for him in the 1950s, sometimes expressed as the question ""Where is everybody?"" At root, Fermi wondered why, if life should be bountiful in a vast universe, we haven't yet encountered any other civilizations. Various explanations have arisen over the years, ranging from humanity being the only evolved, intelligent life that's smart enough to ask the question, to the likelihood that aliens are so far beyond us in intelligence that we're effectively irrelevant to them. (My personal favorite is that the most intelligent life in the universe is actually aquatic — life on Earth started in the oceans, after all — and so we live in a galaxy of whales who have no interest in leaving their happy watery homes.)

Corbet acknowledges that we have spent decades talking about UFOs and have developed a massive subculture around them, but the NASA researcher notes that no one has found any definitive evidence that sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena can be traced to objects not from this planet. That said, controversial Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has been responsible for all manner of interesting theories about why 3I/ATLAS could be a fragment of incredibly sophisticated ET engineering. (Loeb has also been doing real science, of course, undercutting some of the more outrageous speculation about what is probably just a big comet.)

The radical mundanity idea is a bit of a turn on Occam's razor: If we haven't seen any aliens yet, it's because they're either a lot like us, maybe just a little bit better, or possibly worse. The simplest explanation is best. ""The idea is that they're more advanced, but not much more advanced,"" Corbet told the Guardian. ""It's like having an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17,"" 

He also suggests that even relatively advanced civilizations might send out a bunch of probes, find nothing at all — or nothing remarkable — and give up on exploration. After all, civilizations may all be too far away from each other in space, and too technologically limited, to ever interfere with each others' destinies. 

In his paper, Corbet also entertains a variety of refutations of the mundanity theory. Obviously, if the aliens show up, the theory is disproven, as they would need very advanced tech to get to Earth. But even if we did detect a distant extraterrestrial civilization, it could turn out to be just slightly more impressive than our own. We wouldn't get that much out of the encounter, scientifically, and might have to conclude that mundanity is the rule in the Milky Way. Sorry, UFO obsessives. It really could be that boring.","{'href': 'https://www.jalopnik.com', 'title': 'Jalopnik'}","other"

NEW YORK — As Halloween casts its long shadow over October, a new study reveals that many NFL fans believe they aren't just watching the game — they're sharing the stands with spirits, while sensing the divine.   

Touchdowns may be scored on the field, but what goes on off it? Fans can often be seen praying, warding off evil, consulting mediums and even wondering if angels or aliens are silently shaping the fate of their favorite teams, according to a new study.  

The survey, conducted last month by Free Bets, surveyed over 2,000 fans across all 32 NFL teams to uncover just how many of them believe in the supernatural — and whether the mysterious forces they invoke on game days extends far beyond lucky socks.

READ: For Some, Witchcraft Has Its Connections To Religion And Spirituality 

Pro football fans are notorious for their rituals — laying out jerseys like holy vestments, never moving from their blessed seat during a winning streak and making the sign of the cross before a field goal. But these superstitions may only scratch the surface.

The survey reveals a deep belief in ghosts and demons, angels and aliens, in sacred signs and unholy forces — all potentially influencing the final score. 

For example, over half of Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys fans confess a belief in ghosts. Overall, 57.7% of NFL fans believe in angels, while 48.3% acknowledge the existence of demons. 

More obscure beliefs got less traction. Only 27.3% said they believe in witches or warlocks, 22.5% in Bigfoot and 14.7% think werewolves are real. 

But the survey also uncovered an intriguing paradox: Belief in all these things may be high, but spiritual action is low. 

While nearly one in three fans believe supernatural forces are at work — though only 10% said they have tried to engage them. For instance, only 10.3% have ever had a psychic reading, while just 6.7% claimed to have ever used a Ouija board. 

Some fans polled said they believe what happens on the field is more than human. Could angels protect a quarterback from injury? Could demons cause a kicker's sudden collapse? 

The belief in ghosts is highest with Vikings fans (57.8%), followed by those who root for the Falcons (55.4%). Cowboys, Browns, Broncos and all hover near 53%, perhaps sensing long-dead legends lingering in the end zone.

Mariska Hargitay might be known for her dramatic acting today — but at the beginning of her career, she was set on doing comedy. In a new interview with Amy Poehler on Good Hang, the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit star shared a story about a visit to a psychic that she thinks led her to playing the iconic Olivia Benson.


	“I did a lot of comedy auditions,” Hargitay told Poehler. “I did Seinfeld and I did Single Guy, and I tested for Friends so many times. I think for Monica. I always thought I would end up being on a sitcom or doing comedy.” (The role of Monica ended up going to Courteney Cox.)


	Hargitay shared that even when she auditioned for dramatic parts, she always figured she'd end up doing something funny because: “I'm going to be a comedian because I'm funny and I'm pretty.”

	Instead, Hargitay found her career-defining role on SVU, playing Benson — who she has played for more than 25 years and is the longest-running character in live-action TV history. She said getting that gig may or may not have to do with the help she got from a psychic.

	











	“I met with this psychic. Everyone said to me, ‘Oh my gosh, Mariska, you have to meet with this psychic. He's amazing.' … I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man, and I went there and he started saying all this amazing stuff to me,” she said. “I was listening to him really intently like this. He said to me… ‘You see that face you're doing right now? You see that face?' I said, ‘Yeah.' He goes, ‘You're going to be famous for that face. You're moving to New York and you're gonna be famous for that face.'”

	Hargitay recalls responding, “Uh, no. I Live in L.A. and I'm going to be a comedian.” She continued: “He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's ass what you say. You're going to be famous for that face.'”


	 Call it fate or the psychic's look into the future, but Hargitay concluded: “Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going [imitating Benson interrogating a suspect], ‘Where were you Tuesday night?'”

Mariska Hargitay never set out to play a character like Olivia Benson, the street-smart NYPD captain with a heart of gold on “Law & Order: Special Victim Units.”

In fact, Hargitay, a former member of the famed Groundlings improv and sketch comedy troupe, had her hopes set on a being a sitcom star until a psychic told her she was destined for drama. She shared the story during the Oct. 21 episode of Amy Poehler's “Good Hang” podcast.

“How did I end up as America's sweetheart sex cop? I should have been you!"" Harigtay joked to the former “Saturday Night Live” star as both women laughed.

Early in her career, Hargitay recalled auditioning for roles on sitcoms, landing small parts on “Seinfeld” and “The Single Guy.” She also recalled repeatedly testing for a role on “Friends.”

“I think it's Monica. I think, it was so long ago,” she said.

After her recurring role as the incompetent desk clerk Cynthia Hooper on Season 4 of “ER” wrapped, Hargitay found herself in a development deal to star in an “Ally McBeal”-style dramedy series.

“That's what I wanted to do. I was like, I want to do drama, but it has to be funny,” she recalled. “That's what I felt like my gifts were.”

Hargitay, who lived in Los Angeles at the time, recalled how her professional plans changed shortly after she consulted a psychic on a trip to New York.

“I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man and I went there,” the Emmy winner recalled. “He started staying all this amazing stuff to me. Stuff about my mom. Stuff about a ring. My grandmother had just died and he said there was going to be an issue with the ring, which there was.”

Hargitay said she was listening “really intently” to the psychic with a serious look on her face.

“And he said to me ... ‘You see that face you're doing right now? You see that face?'” Hargitay recalled, imitating the psychic's Southern twang. “‘You're going to be famous for that face. You're moving to New York and you're gonna be famous for that face.'”

When Hargitay protested, telling the psychic she was intent on being a “comedian” in LA, the psychic wouldn't hear it.

“He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's a-- what you say. You're going to be famous for that face,'” Hargitay recalled.

Not long afterward, Hargitay landed the part of Benson on “SVU.”

“Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going (imitating Benson interrogating a suspect), ‘Where were you Tuesday night?'” she joked.

	In Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film “Bugonia,” Emma Stone plays a powerful CEO who's abducted by two conspiracy-obsessed men, portrayed by Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis.But when it comes to conspiracy theories off-screen, one in particular has captured Plemons' imagination.


	“Well, Jesse has one that he's really been harping on,” Stone told Variety on Tuesday night at the New York premiere inside the MoMa. “Did he tell you already?”When asked to share his favorite conspiracy theory, Plemons didn't hesitate: “Birds aren't real. Which is true. It's not real.”

	“Yeah, the birds,” Stone laughed. “The birds aren't real. I mean, I believe birds are real. But it is interesting walking around New York now with so many birds and thinking, ‘What if all of pigeons — right here, right now — were little drones?'”

	Comedian Stavros Halkias, who delivers a scene-stealing turn as a small-town police officer, said he's drawn to another enduring internet myth.


	“I don't think they're actually lizard people, but effectively, the people that are ruling the world aren't human,” Halkias explained, referring to the reptilian conspiracy theory. “They're more worried about getting rich than anything else. It's an interesting metaphor trying to explain the evil that's ruining everybody's life by saying, ‘Oh, there must be a different species.' It's like, ‘Nah, they're just kind of shitty people.'”


	One warm-blooded creative who continues to rise above the chaos is Lanthimos himself, who's built a reputation as a true actors' director. His creative partnership with Stone, in particular, has become one of the most formidable collaborations in Hollywood. 


	“Yorgos is someone I'm so inspired by,” said Alicia Silverstone, who reunites with Lanthimos on “Bugonia” for the first time since 2017's “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.” “He's so prolific and talented. I love being able to freefall with him. I'll do anything — maybe not anything, but when he calls, I don't even need to read [the script].”


	Some of Lanthimos' past heavy-hitters include “The Lobster,” “The Favourite” and “Poor Things,” which earned Stone her second Oscar. All of his films share a quirky, R-rated sensibility — but will Lanthimos ever expand his horizons and make something more family-friendly?“I have done one, it's called ‘Dogtooth,'” Lanthimos laughed. “It's a family-friendly movie.” “Dogtooth,” the Greek filmmaker's breakout 2009 feature, is a psychological drama about a father who keeps his adult children locked inside an isolated compound, manipulating their reality through control, deprivation and deceit.

	











	“I don't really think about it in those terms,” Lanthimos explained. “I just make the films I want to make, and you know, they come out the way they come out. So, who knows?”


	“Bugonia” opens in select theaters on Oct. 24 before expanding nationwide Oct. 31.

Trends Reporter, HuffPost

Tucker Carlson is being ripped on social media after he hosted a conversation about a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 was manufactured to make Jewish people immune to it. 

The bizarre chat kicked off during Tuesday's episode of “The Tucker Carlson Show,” after the disgraced former Fox News host mentioned Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s erroneous claims that COVID could be “tailored” and had “disparate effects on [different] populations.” 

The podcaster appeared to be referring to a 2023 report by the New York Post titled “RFK Jr. says COVID was ‘ethnically targeted' to spare Jews.” 

Kennedy denied making the comments in an X post. 

“The @nypost story is mistaken. I have never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews,” Kennedy wrote.

Carlson's guest during the episode, author Dr. Andrew Huff, then controversially alleged that a scientific publication, which he did not name, found that one population of people of Jewish ancestry was affected by COVID more than others. 

Calling RFK Jr.'s unfounded claims “scientifically true,” Huff told Carlson: “There was a finding in a scientific publication that two different populations of people of Jewish ancestry — depending [on] which line they're from — one was more heavily impacted than the others.” 

Interjecting, Carlson then clarified that Huff was referring to “Sephardic/Ashkenazi” Jewish people. 

Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, has a history of spreading misinformation about health, and has repeatedly made false claims about topics such as vaccines and autism.

Carlson, a conservative political commentator, has also peddled conspiracy theories and far-right extremist ideology on social media. 

Social media users on X called out Carlson for not condemning Huff's assertion and for promoting an “anti-semitic lie.”

“Nothing to see here just Tucker Carlson pushing the anti semitic lie that Covid was designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews (who were actually affected MORE than other groups in the real world),” one person wrote on X.

The user went on to call Carlson and RFK Jr. “two conspiracy cranks.”

Someone else slammed Carlson as a “raging antisemite” while questioning why Vice President JD Vance, an ally of his, has not yet “denounced his bigoted views.”

Joel ‘Deano' Valdez, a Marine veteran, has been missing for a month, prompting his family to search for answers in Santa Fe.

Valdez's cousin, Monique Garcia, said Sept. 18 started as a normal day for him. Valdez had finished a job in Silver City and stopped in Santa Fe on his way home to Coyote, visiting an ATM and Allsup's.

After not hearing from him the rest of that day, the family grew concerned. The next few days, charges were made on his debit card. The family said the amount used at another gas station was out of character for him and was enough to fill up a few cars.

March 6, 1939. Fingringhoe, England. After purchasing some cigarettes at a local pub, 67-year old Ada Constance Kent seems to disappear and over the course of the next decade, numerous searches are performed of her empty cottage and they fail to turn up any trace of her. Ten years later, a human skeleton is discovered beneath some rubble in the cottage's bedroom alongside an empty bottle of poison, and after a forensic examination is performed, there is some uncertainty about who the remains actually belong to. When an inquest is held, a coroner's jury does eventually conclude that the skeleton is likely Ada Constance Kent, but since they are unable to determine her exact cause of death, they return an open verdict. Did Ada Constance Kent die inside her cottage and remain undiscovered for an entire decade? If not, then what actually happened to her?

In this episode, Harvard primatologist Christine Webb challenges one of our deepest beliefs: that humans stand apart from the rest of nature. She traces the roots of human exceptionalism from Aristotle and Descartes to modern science, and explains why we still cling to hierarchies of intelligence.

While most critiques of human exceptionalism focus on our moral obligation toward other species, Webb argues that they overlook what humanity stands to gain by letting go of its illusions of uniqueness and superiority.

Christine Webb is a primatologist at Harvard's Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, with expertise in social behavior, cognition, and emotion. Her new book is The Arrogant Ape: The Myth of Human Exceptionalism and Why it Matters.

Hochul, Schumer and the three mayoral candidates express outrage over federal operation in Chinatown

Local and state officials in New York are expressing outrage after dozens of federal agents carried out a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Manhattan's Chinatown on Tuesday.

Eyewitnesses accounts and video footage captured the chaotic scenes in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, where masked and armed federal agents were seen detaining several individuals near Canal Street, while crowds of New Yorkers gathered, protesting against the action. Military-style vehicles were also seen driving through the area.

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.

The raid drew swift condemnation from local and state leaders.

The New York police department (NYPD) quickly distanced itself from the operation, stating that the department had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Eric Adams, the mayor, reposted the NYPD's statement and added: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, condemned the operation and hit out at Donald Trump.

Trump, she said, “claims he's targeting the ‘worst of the worst'” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.

“You don't make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” she said.

Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, called the raid “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive” and said that federal immigration agencies “should target criminals for arrest and deportation – not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city”.

“This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer,” he added.

Jumaane Williams, the city's public advocate, said that federal agents deprived “vendors of due process and ripping them from their families – all because they tried to earn a living”. The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, described the raid on Tuesday as a “horrifying display of federal overreach and authoritarian tactics”, adding that “our communities deserve safety, dignity and due process – not fear and violence that tear families apart”.

He also told reporters that a few people were taken into custody for protesting and blocking ICE's efforts.

A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that people in the crowd “were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties” and said that at least one protester was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal officer.

The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.

The Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, condemned the operation as a “aggressive and reckless raid on immigrant street vendors”, adding: “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop.”

Andrew Cuomo, the independent candidate and former New York governor, called the raid an “abuse of federal power by the Trump administration: more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety.

“This is not who we are, and it will never be NYC when I am mayor,” Cuomo said. “The Statue of Liberty stands in our harbor, not as a decoration, but as a declaration of our values and the promise of America.”

And in a statement to the Gothamist, a spokesperson for the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, said that the federal government should prioritize the deportation of “gang members, sex traffickers, and those involved in major crimes.

“[Sliwa] has also been clear that the backs of restaurants and other service industries should not be the focus of immigration enforcement, and that resources should target dangerous offenders, not working people,” the spokesperson added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jeff Merkley of Oregon gives address to make case that president is ‘violating the law' through authoritarianism

US politics live – latest updates

Jeff Merkley, Oregon's Democratic senator, is giving a marathon speech on the Senate floor that will soon enter its 19th hour to make the case that Donald Trump is acting as an authoritarian, including by deploying the military into his home town of Portland.

The 68-year-old senator began speaking around 6.20pm on Tuesday evening and continued with few interruptions into Wednesday morning. Standing continuously on the Senate floor alongside placards that read “authoritarianism is here now!” and “Trump is violating the law”, Merkley has paused only to take questions from fellow Democratic senators.

“I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the civil war. President Trump is shredding our constitution,” Merkley said as he began his speech.

Merkley spoke a day after a federal appeals court had allowed the president to send the national guard into Portland over the objections of local leaders, who say there is no merit to the president's claim that the city is a “war zone”. Trump has also ordered a similar deployment of troops into Chicago, where federal agents are carrying out an aggressive crackdown targeting people they believe to be undocumented immigrants. The supreme court is poised to consider a legal challenge to that move.

The senator touched on those deployments to cities that are overwhelmingly Democratic, as well as other instances where the president is seen as retaliating against his political enemies, including the charges a handpicked US attorney has filed against the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, and former FBI director James Comey.

“Equal justice under law – that's the vision here in America. Not unequal injustice, which is what the president is pursuing by taking the power of the government and going after individuals that he does not like or perceives to be political opponents,” Merkley said.

“That's what you read about in authoritarian governments far away, and you go, that would never happen in the United States of America, but it is happening right here, right now.”

A spokesman for the senator says he is planning to speak “as long as he can”.

Merkley's address is the second instance this year in which a Democratic senator has staged a lengthy floor speech to condemn Trump's policies. About two months after Trump's inauguration, Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke for 25 hours and five minutes, setting a new record for the longest speech ever by a solo senator.

On Wednesday morning, the Oregon senator stood speaking from a lectern where he had placed a small glass of water and a copy of How Democracies Die, a 2018 book by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt detailing how representative governments around the world have been dismantled.

As Wednesday went on, Democratic senators trooped to the floor to ask Merkley – who has remained standing throughout – questions that doubled as opportunities to air their own grievances against the administration.

“We are seeing a time now that if we do not ring the alarm bells, more and more Americans will be hurt by a president who is acting more like an authoritarian leader than a democratically elected executive,” Booker said.

Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal likened Trump's partial demolition of the White House East Wing to layoffs and funding cuts he has ordered across the government.

“This destruction that Donald Trump is doing to the White House is emblematic of the wrecking ball he is taking to our democracy. Put aside the waste of money that could be used to improve our education system, solve food insecurity, guarantee the election integrity of this nation – the damage that he's doing to this iconic symbol of America is so costly to our image and esteem around the world,” Blumenthal said.

Ron Wyden, Oregon's senior senator, said in an interview that his counterpart was “making some particularly, relevant and important points about the threat”.

Asked if other Senate Democrats were planning such lengthy speeches, Wyden said: “You take them one at a time, but I think what Senator Merkley is doing is very important.”

The speech comes on the 22nd day of the government shutdown that began at the start of the month, when Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on legislation to extend funding beyond the end of September.

The Senate has held 11 unsuccessful votes on a Republican-backed bill to extend funding through 21 November, which Democrats have blocked because it does not including healthcare funding that they are demanding, as well as curbs on Trump's use of rescissions to slash funding approved by Congress.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A Paris prosecutor said jewels stolen from the Louvre are worth an estimated €88 million, as police intensified the hunt for four thieves to recover the treasures.

France's Louvre Museum and its culture minister, Rachida Dati, both hit back at criticisms of the security setup at what is considered as the world's most famous museum, two days after thieves stole eight ""priceless"" pieces of jewelry in a morning raid. 

""Have the Louvre's security precautions failed? No, they have not failed. That is a fact. The security measures worked,"" Dati said during a question-and-answer session in parliament on Tuesday. 

Dati's comments didn't quite dismiss those doubts that had been raised about the alarm systems, however, as their complete failure was not in question. 

Paris' prosecution service had only said on Tuesday that ""the checks on the functionality of the alarm systems are continuing."" 

What was at issue was not whether the alarms sounded at all, but whether they sounded immediately when the thieves entered, or just one minute before they made their escape. A slow alert for police could have proven harmful to efforts to reach the museum on time. 

The museum, meanwhile, defended the state of the display cases from which the thieves took items from the Apollo Gallery on Sunday.

""The Louvre Museum asserts that the display cases installed in December 2019 represented considerable progress in terms of security, given the degree of obsolescence of the old equipment, which would have led, without replacement, to the works being removed from public view,"" the museum said in a statement on Tuesday.

In the heist, thieves parked a truck outside and used an extendable movers' ladder to access the Apollo Gallery shortly before opening. They climbed up, cut the jewels free from display cases, and fled in a matter of minutes. 

They made off with eight pieces deemed priceless, including an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave to his wife, Empress Marie-Louise, and a diadem dotted with nearly 2,000 diamonds that once belonged to Empress Eugenie. 

The jewels stolen from the Louvre are worth an estimated €88 million ($102 million), the Paris prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, told French outlet RTL in an interview. However, she noted that the loss for France was better measured in their historic significance.

""The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,"" said Beccuau, whose office is leading the investigation. 

""We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason,"" she added.

The museum remained shut on Tuesday following the heist, as experts warned the chances of recovering the stolen jewels appeared slim and were deteriorating by the hour. 

Tim Carpenter, head of the art protection organization Argus Cultural Property Consultancy, and long the head of the FBI's art crimes division, warned that it was much easier to melt down jewels and sell them as precious metals than it was, say, to monetize a stolen famous painting or artwork.

The heist has put security at French cultural sites under sudden and increased scrutiny, amid allegations of budget shortfalls and corner-cutting in recent years. 

Also on Tuesday, in separate but related news, charges were laid against a Chinese-born woman accused of stealing gold nuggets worth more than $1.5 million from Paris' Museum of Natural History last month. The 24-year-old was arrested in Barcelona while trying to dispose of nearly 1 kilogram of melted gold pieces.

Two other institutions were hit in September, and in January of this year, Louvre President Laurence des Cars had warned Culture Minister Daichi of a ""worrying level of obsolescence"" in the museum's security capabilities, including the partial absence of basics like video surveillance.

The specialist Paris police unit known as the BRB, which has more than a dozen agents specialized in museum thefts in its ranks of around 100 investigators, has taken over the Louvre case.

Critics say Kyle Walsh is unqualified to head an institute that is focused on environmental chemicals and disease.

Employees at the National Institutes of Health learned in an email on Friday, in the midst of a hiring freeze, that their prestigious environmental health sciences research center has a new director. 

There was no job announcement, no search committee to identify top candidates, no interviews or reference checks. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The position to lead the nation's premier environmental health research institute wasn't even open.

Yet Jay Bhattacharya, a political appointee who oversees the 27 institutes and centers under NIH, named Kyle Walsh, an associate professor in neurosurgery at Duke University, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). 

In an email dated Oct. 17, Bhattacharya informed NIH employees, who were told they may periodically check their emails for updates about the shutdown, that Walsh's appointment was effective Oct. 10. The email called Walsh a leader in neuro-epidemiology whose research bridges laboratory and population-based science to understand how genetics and environment interact to shape brain health, cancer risk and aging. 

Bhattacharya said that the previous director, Richard Woychik, had accepted a senior appointment within the NIH Office of the Director, where he will focus on advancing the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiatives.

The NIH director — who President Donald Trump said would work with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to restore the agency to “a Gold Standard of Medical Research” — did not mention that Walsh calls Vice President JD Vance “one of his closest friends” or that Vance officiated at his wedding.

Walsh has never led a major research institute, though he has won scientific awards and honors after earning his doctorate in 2011. 

Woychik had overseen the research and management of NIEHS as deputy director for nearly a decade before he was tapped to run it. His predecessor, world-renowned toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, had spent nearly 20 years in top leadership roles at the largest division of environmental health research at EPA before she was picked to lead NIEHS in 2009.

It is unprecedented to appoint someone at such an early stage of their career who lacks the type of leadership experience required to manage a major research institution, current and former federal scientists say. And all directors of NIH institutes, except for the director of the National Cancer Institute, who is a political appointee, go through a rigorous screening and vetting process after an open search. 

If there had been an open search in this case, several scientists told Inside Climate News, Walsh wouldn't have made the first cut. Scientists fear this is the start of a trend.

“This is entirely cronyism,” said biochemist Jeremy Berg, former director of the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) and previous editor-in-chief of Science magazine. 

Woychik had just been reappointed to another five-year term, Berg said, so Walsh's hire didn't have anything to do with the sitting director's performance. “The fact that he was appointed without any sort of search is worrisome,” he said, adding that “his main credentials seem to be his connections with JD Vance.”Vance has been buddies with Walsh since they attended Yale University, and he stayed at Walsh's house when he was finishing up his book, Hillbilly Elegy. 

Walsh said Vance is “one of my closest friends” in an interview with a charity that supported his brain cancer research.

Birnbaum, now a scholar in residence at Duke, heard rumors before Trump's inauguration in January that Walsh was going to be picked to head NIEHS, she said. “Many people at Duke and elsewhere seemed to know about it.”

Walsh has been telling his colleagues and others at Duke for almost a year that he would be getting this job, a scientist at NIEHS, who requested not to be named for fear of retaliation, told Inside Climate News. 

While the appointment was a surprise to the scientific community, the scientist said, “this was apparently a pre-planned thing.”

Neither Walsh nor the Duke press office responded to requests for comment. 

HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said Walsh brings broad experience in environmental and neuro-epidemiologic research from his leadership roles at Duke University. 

Hilliard did not respond to questions about Walsh's experience leading a major research institute with hundreds of employees, or charges that he was hired due to his political connections.

The vice president's office did not respond to a request for comment.

The NIEHS director oversees a $900-million-plus annual budget, funding scientists within and outside the agency who study the health effects of exposures to environmental chemicals.

Studies funded by the agency have formed the basis of landmark environmental protections. Research by NIEHS-funded scientists, for example, laid the groundwork for EPA's air pollution rules and showed that the pesticide chlorpyrifos poses unacceptable neurodevelopmental risks to children, prompting EPA to conclude that the insecticide is not safe for use on food. 

But now the Trump administration is reconsidering the chlorpyrifos decision. And scientists have seen highly competitive applications denied funding due to their focus on climate and environmental justice. 

The person who had been hired to lead an NIEHS program on climate change and health, Birnbaum said, “was fired immediately” after Trump returned to office.

And anything that had to do with equity was cut from NIEHS programs and research grants, she said, even though disadvantaged populations are most impacted by environmental hazards.

While it's unclear “what Walsh's marching orders are,” Birnbaum said, she hopes they include maintaining the agency's strengths as the largest funder of environmental health research in the world.

Even though Walsh's appointment is “out of the normal,” Birnbaum said, “hopefully the environmental health community will be able to work with Dr. Walsh to continue to conduct the top research that they're so well-known for.”

Some scientists fear that's unlikely.

As a scientist who focuses on the genetics of brain cancer, Walsh has “no scientific qualification to head an institute that is focused on environmental chemicals and disease,” said Jerry Heindel, who spent decades at NIEHS, where he led the agency's Division of Extramural Research and Training until he retired in 2016. 

Heindel reviewed the scientific research Walsh published and could find no papers on environmental chemicals.

NIEHS is unique among the National Institutes of Health, in that it is the only one that's focused on environmental chemicals, said Heindel, who now directs the nonprofit Healthy Environment and Endocrine Disruptor Strategies. “To bring in somebody who has no experience and likely no interest in environmental chemicals as the director is just a slap in the face.”

The primary NIH center that best aligns with Walsh's background focuses on cancer and genetics, but it is based in Maryland. The main campus of NIEHS is in Durham, North Carolina, not far from Walsh's previous position at Duke. Several scientists told Inside Climate News they suspect Walsh did not want to move.

“If you're buddy-buddy with JD Vance, you get to pick whatever you want,” said the NIEHS scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity.

For Berg, the former NIGMS director, it's not just Walsh's lack of qualifications that are worrisome. 

“The administration has certainly been pretty direct about their feelings about climate change and its potential consequences, and the reality of it occurring at all,” Berg said. “If you don't study potential environmental hazards, then you can't do anything about them.”

With at least 11 NIH agencies currently being led by interim directors, some scientists worry the positions, once occupied by the nation's most accomplished scientists, will go to unqualified political appointees.

That means that decisions about what the United States funds in biomedicine will be made by political appointees, not scientists, they fear.

“Everybody's worried they're going to come down and close us, because this administration seems very hostile to environmental health and environmental issues,” said the NIEHS scientist. “Anything having to do with the environment and environmental health has been absolutely obliterated by this administration.”

If people care about making America healthy again, the words and actions of this administration are not matching that goal, the scientist said. “They've gutted the EPA, they've gutted the CDC, they've gutted the FDA. Are they going to gut us next?”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Trump has stated that he is opposed to Israeli annexation of the West Bank.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The Israeli legislature advanced a bill calling for Israel to annex the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, amid U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel.

The Knesset approved legislation for Israel to apply “sovereignty” over the Palestinian territory in a preliminary vote, narrowly passing with 25 members for and 24 against. The move is the first in a series of votes required for a bill to become law in the state.

Israeli media reports that members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party, Likud, were opposed to the legislation, viewing it as a way to snub Netanyahu as his government already takes moves to annex the West Bank. 

Indeed, the vote was timed to coincide with a visit by Vance and members of Trump's top Middle East advisers, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who does not officially hold a position but has been conducting business in the region on behalf of the administration. 

The Likud party dismissed the vote as an attempt at “trolling” and “aimed at damaging our relations with the U.S. and Israel's great achievements in the campaign.”

“We strengthen settlements every day with actions, budgets, construction, industry, and not with words,” the party said, adding that “true sovereignty will be achieved not with a show-off law for the protocol, but by working properly on the ground and creating the political conditions appropriate for the recognition of our sovereignty, as was done in the Golan Heights and in Jerusalem.”

The Trump administration has previously expressed its opposition to Israeli annexation of the West Bank. 

“ I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope. I will not allow. It's not gonna happen,” Trump said late last month, ahead of Netanyahu's address at the UN General Assembly in New York City. 

Notably, however, Trump has been providing Israel with ample military resources and diplomatic cover allowing Israel to carry on with its current illegal de facto annexation of the West Bank. Further, in his first term, Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that significantly advanced Israel's quest for annexation.

On Tuesday, nearly every Senate Democrat signed a letter, led by Sen. Adam Schiff (California), urging Trump to recommit to his pledge to oppose annexation of the West Bank. 

“Since your plan for Gaza does not address the West Bank, it is imperative that your Administration reinforce your comments and emphasize its opposition to annexation,” the lawmakers said. 

“As longstanding supporters of Israel's security and Palestinian aspirations for statehood, we are unified in our opposition to unilateral measures by either party that undermine the prospect of lasting peace through negotiations to achieve a two-state solution. That includes any steps by Israel to annex territory or expand settlements that prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state,” they went on.

The only Senate Democrat to not sign the letter was John Fetterman (Pennsylvania).

Though Trump has spoken out against formal annexation, his administration has demurred on recognizing a Palestinian state. In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Kushner claimed that Gaza and the West Bank are too different culturally to link as a state — without acknowledging Israel and the U.S.'s role in separating the two territories. “You need both places to be functioning — in a good way, where they can thrive before you can connect them,” he said. 

However, the idea is vastly popular among the American public. A Reuters/Ipsos poll out Wednesday conducted following the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal found that 6 in 10 Americans say the U.S. should recognize a Palestinian state, including 80 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents, and 41 percent of Republicans.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

            The president keeps claiming a major American city is burning down. Even though that is not even close to true.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “I looked at Portland over the weekend. The place is burning down, just burning down.” Trump noted that an appeals court on Monday overturned one of the two rulings that have temporarily blocked his attempt to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, then added: “You look at a place like Portland, it's just — it's ridiculous, when they say that there's no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend.”
    


            But Portland was nothing remotely resembling “burning down” over the weekend. It still wasn't when Trump made these comments on Tuesday. And it wasn't when Trump made such claims on previous occasions over the last month.
    


Photos of Portland over the weekend — including shots of an anti-Trump “No Kings” protest that was peacefully attended Saturday by tens of thousands of people — show a city very much intact and not ablaze. Portland city spokesperson Cody Bowman said the fire department was never even dispatched over the weekend to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building that has been the center of protest activity in recent months.
    


            It's possible that Trump saw images of small fires that started near the ICE building on Saturday after federal agents deployed tear gas and smoke devices to disperse protesters there. The Oregonian newspaper reported Tuesday in a debunking of Trump's latest “burning down” claims: “Federal agents used tear gas against the crowd and sparks from canisters set several small fires, but rain and a lack of fuel quickly extinguished them.”
    


            Leaving aside the matter of why these fires started, the president's categorical declaration that a city of 145 square miles and more than 630,000 residents is “burning down” is clearly not substantiated by the brief existence of small fires on one block.
    


            Bowman said the Portland fire department responded to just one building fire over the weekend. He said the department responded to about nine total fires a day from Friday to Monday, “significantly fewer” than during the same period last year, and that about half of them were trash fires. The Oregonian reported that a business was damaged by an “explosive” Friday afternoon fire in an RV that had been parked beside it.
    


            A single fire engine was dispatched to handle that incident, the fire department told the newspaper; this was a minor local story, nothing close to the citywide inferno of the president's suggestion. You can check out live video shots of Portland yourself to see how far from the truth the president's claims were as of this article's publication on Wednesday.
    


            Trump has made similarly baseless assertions about Portland on multiple occasions in September and October. He has falsely said that “Portland is burning to the ground” and that “Portland's been on fire for years”; falsely said the city doesn't “even have stores anymore” and that people “don't even put glass up” on windows, only plywood; and groundlessly referred to “War ravaged Portland.”
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump's comments on October 6 by encouraging reporters “to go on the ground and to take a look at for yourself.” The next day, CNN correspondent Shimon Prokupecz made clear from the ground in Portland that the president's descriptions are detached from reality.
    


            “Keep in mind, this is all happening on less than a single block, not even in the city center,” Prokupecz said of the protest clashes around the ICE building, which have included occasional flag-burning by protesters. “The rest of Portland is not in chaos. The streetcars are running, guitarists play outside the famed Powell's bookstore, and there's a guided tour in Pioneer Courthouse Square. If you weren't looking for it, you'd never know anything was happening on that one city block outside the ICE building.”
    


Portland residents and government officials in the city and the state of Oregon, from the police chief to the mayor to the governor, have all attempted for weeks to correct Trump's narrative.

Live Updates


            • A dizzying lineup of legal disputes is unfolding today in President Donald Trump's push to deploy US troops to Democratic-led cities. At this moment, a panel of judges is hearing arguments related to Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.
    


            • While Trump leans on a new federal appeals court ruling backing his deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, he's urging the US Supreme Court to allow a similar effort in Chicago. The latter case is one of the most significant emergency requests to reach the high court lately and almost certain to spill over as litigation plays out elsewhere, including Memphis.
    


            • Immigration raids, meanwhile, keep flaring up across the country. In New York, bystanders stepped in Tuesday during a raid along Manhattan's Canal Street, while in Los Angeles, a US marshal and a TikTok streamer who is undocumented were hurt in a shooting at an ICE stop.
    


            Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh, who said federal agents pulled a gun on him during an encounter Tuesday in Chicago, wants Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release its own video of the incident.
    


            “I think what they said is an absolute lie,” Huynh, a Democrat, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Wednesday. “If they were being truthful, they should release the body cameras of these ICE agents and what they actually did.”
    


Video posted on social media by Huynh shows multiple agents in fatigues and wearing face coverings surrounding a car he was traveling in. The agents appear to be carrying body cameras, although it is not clear whether they were in operation. Another agent was seen pointing a cell phone camera into the vehicle.
    


            Huynh said an agent approached the passenger's window and “pointed a gun to my face without any warning whatsoever, and then told us to identify ourselves.”  The agent's gun was not seen in his video, the lawmaker said, because the agent withdrew it once he saw the driver had pulled out a camera.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has not commented on whether a gun was drawn, but spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Huynh, who has not been charged with a crime, was “stalking law enforcement and attempting to interfere with operations.”
    


            Huynh denies that claim, saying he is part of a “rapid response” group that goes to communities where ICE is operating in order to inform residents of their legal rights.
    


            “We are within our rights to tell our neighbors about their rights,” said Huynh.
    


            A panel of three judges with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California is hearing arguments related to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles now.
    


            In June, US District Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, handed California Gov. Newsom an early victory in the case when he ordered control of National Guard troops back to the state of California.
    


            But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel allowed the troops to remain in federal hands while the lawsuit unfolds. The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Judge Breyer's June order.
    

ICE agents arrested street vendors in New York's Chinatown. 


            The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that nine people in the country illegally were arrested during a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown's Canal Street in Manhattan Tuesday. The popular and highly trafficked area is well-known for its street vendors who sell counterfeit designer goods.
    


            In a social media post, DHS said those arrested had “violent rap sheets” including “robbery, burglary, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, drug possession and forgery.”
    


            The nine men arrested were originally from Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania, according to DHS.
    


            In video obtained by CNN, people could be seen protesting the arrest of the street vendors, and trying to intervene by stopping traffic.
    


            DHS said five additional people were arrested: four for assaulting law enforcement and another for obstruction.
    


            Many of the ICE officers were masked and armed, video shows.
    


            The NYPD posted on X that it was not not involved in the operation
    


            City and state leaders have condemned the operation, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said, “You don't make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers.”
    


            Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at gunpoint while he was patrolling the community on Tuesday.
    


            “Today I was stopped by ICE at gunpoint,” Huynh wrote on X.
    


            “They tried to bash in our car's windows while we were doing ICE patrol in the community. We might fight back against this regime that has no place in America,” Huynh added.
    


            The Democratic lawmaker shared a video of the incident to X where he can be seen on the passenger seat as agents approach the driver's window.
    


            “I'm State Representative Hoan Huynh,” he said multiple times in the video. At one point, an agent appears to take a photo of the vehicle and the driver of the vehicle through the front window.
    


            Huynh and the driver explained in the video they were following an ICE vehicle as another one appeared to follow them behind. The video doesn't show what happened when they were initially stopped, and later they are heard talking about seeing a weapon.
    


            CNN asked Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin about Huynh's claim that he was held at gunpoint, but she did not immediately comment on that allegation.
    


            In a statement McLaughlin said Huynh was stopped twice “for stalking law enforcement and attempting to interfere with operations.”
    


            “He was given a warning the first time he was stopped, and he ignored that warning, forcing agents to get out of their car a second time to assess if he was a threat. This behavior is unbecoming of a public servant and is just another example of sanctuary politicians putting our officers at risk,” McLaughlin said.
    


            The video was taken while Huynh and the driver were in an area about seven miles north of downtown Chicago.
    


            As President Trump's plan to deploy members of the National Guard to Chicago remains hung up in court challenges, a former mayor of the city says having military troops on city streets would not help law enforcement.
    


                    “‘Defunding the police' was a bad idea. Sending the National Guard is even dumber than dumb,” Rahm Emanuel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday.
                





            Although guardsmen are primarily slated to provide security for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in suburban Chicago that has been the site of regular protests, President Trump has cited crime in Chicago more broadly as a reason for deployment, calling the city a “hellhole” last month.
    


            Military intervention – even if constitutional – would be an ineffective stopgap, Emanuel said.
    


                    “From putting more police on the beat and getting kids, guns and gangs off the street, the federal government can be a major partner,” said Emanuel. “The National Guard here for a month or two months – when they leave, the problems are still there.”
                





            The American Civil Liberties Union Wednesday called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing.
    


            ﻿The nonprofit and its partner organizations said they have met with more than 12 women held in ICE processing centers in Basile, Louisiana, and Lumpkin, Georgia, including some of whom were pregnant, or who had recent miscarriages while in detention.
    


            In a letter to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons an﻿d other agency officials, the ACLU described what the woman said they have experienced.
    


            “These women reported gravely troubling experiences of shackling, use of restraints, and solitary confinement; delayed and substandard prenatal care; denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food and water; medical care provided without informed consent; lack of interpretation and translation in medical encounters; and medical neglect leading to dangerous infection after miscarriage,” the letter said.
    


            “Our interviews indicate that ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” the ACLU and other organizations said.
    


For context:﻿ A 2021 ICE policy states “individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing” should not be detained, arrested or taken into custody for violating immigration laws, except in “exceptional circumstances.”
    


            CNN has reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for comment about the ACLU's letter.
    


            In August, DHS responded to allegations about the treatment of pregnant women in immigration detention, saying they “receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care.”
    


            Lawmakers called for the release of a Chicago father who was detained by ICE at a Home Depot in the area over the weekend, while working to support his family – including 16-year-old daughter Ofelia who is fighting Stage 4 cancer, according to US Rep. Mike Quigley and the family's attorney.
    


            Ruben Torres Maldonado's partner shared that she now has to care for the couple's 4-year-old son as well as act as the main caretaker for Ofelia, which includes draining her abdomen to relieve fluid at least twice a day.
    


            “Ruben is a strong, loving father, a family man, a hard-working, tax-paying Chicagoan with nothing worse on his record than a traffic ticket, and they broke into his car and they snatched him away from his daughter, who is fighting cancer,” State Rep. Will Guzzardi said. “We are going to do everything in our power to fight back.”
    


            DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Torres Maldonado has “a criminal history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding.”
    


            “During his arrest he did not comply with instructions from the officers and attempted to flee in his vehicle and backed into a government vehicle. He will remain in ICE custody pending removal,” she said in a statement.
    


            Torres Maldonado has a hearing tomorrow where he will seek an order to be released by ICE on his own recognizance or to be provided with a bond hearing before an immigration judge, family attorney Kalman Resnick said.
    


            Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, speaking with FOX news today, said the public will see “an increase in ICE arrests,” in New York City, “because there are so many criminal illegal aliens that have been released in New York.”
    


            The arrests, including those of street vendors on Canal Street yesterday, are intelligence driven and “not random,” Lyons said.
    


                    “We're just not pulling people off the street. There was a specific reason, based on criminal intelligence and criminal activity, that we showed up on Canal Street,” Lyons said.
                





            “You will see us making those criminal arrests to make New York safe again,” he added.
    


            US District Judge April Perry told the plaintiffs and defendants there are “three options” at today's hearing over deploying the National Guard to Chicago.
    


            Those options are: converting the temporary restraining order to a more permanent preliminary injunction; a hearing on the preliminary injunction; or a full trial on the issue “on merit,” Perry said.
    


                    “Obviously the TRO expires tomorrow,” the judge said. “And we can only extend it once.”
                





            Perry gave all sides until 3 p.m. CT to talk among themselves to figure out what the best option is.
    


            The hearing will resume today at 3 p.m. CT.
    


            US District Court Judge April Perry is holding a hearing on whether to extend an order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago.
    


            Perry temporarily blocked the deployment in Illinois earlier this month.
    


            Her decision could be moot depending on the Supreme Court, which the Trump administration has asked to intervene and allow Guard troops to be deployed.
    


            The Supreme Court could rule quickly, possibly within days.
    


            A CNN producer is in the courtroom and will provide updates.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom will deploy the California National Guard under his command on a “humanitarian mission” to support food banks amid food benefits delays during the federal government shutdown, his office announced on Wednesday.
    


            “The California National Guard will not be acting as law enforcement,” the governor's office pointedly noted.
    


            The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena is set to hear arguments Wednesday morning related to President Trump's own deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.
    


            “Millions of Americans rely on food benefits to feed their families, and while Republicans in Washington drag their feet, California is stepping up once again to fill in the gaps. I'm expediting state funds for food banks and directing the California National Guard and California Volunteers to help distribute this food to families,” Newsom said.
    


            A chaotic scene unfolded on Tuesday afternoon when ICE agents began arresting illegal street vendors on Canal Street in downtown Manhattan, a law enforcement official told CNN.
    


            After the arrests, a small crowd moved to 26 Federal Plaza, a New York City location that has become a frequent gathering place for protests.
    


Here's a look at the scene yesterday:



            An “emergency protest” has been organized for tonight at Manhattan's Foley Square.
    


            Officials will provide an update Wednesday afternoon on the lawsuit to block the Tennessee National Guard's deployment to Memphis.
    


            Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris will address the latest developments in the lawsuit filed last week against the governor and the state's attorney general for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.
    


            “Governor (Bill) Lee's deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion — and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” a statement published by the National Immigration Law Center reads.
    


            “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”
    


            Lee's office responded Monday to the lawsuit, saying the governor has the authority to deploy the state's guard troops under Tennessee law, CNN affiliate WATN reported.
    


            On Monday, a judge in Tennessee district court denied Harris' and other plaintiffs' request to temporarily prevent the National Guard deployment before the hearing, according to CNN affiliate WMC, but set a hearing for November 3 in Nashville.
    


            Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10, The Associated Press reported, including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, a landmark in the city.
    


            The deployment comes as the city has grappled with violent crime, including persistently high rates of homicides and carjackings, in recent years. Even so, both Democratic and Republican officials have pointed to declines in some crime categories this year.
    


            A panel of three judges with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee, is set to hear arguments Wednesday morning related to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.
    


            In June, US District Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee, handed California Gov. Newsom an early victory in the case when he ordered control of National Guard troops back to the state of California.
    


            Breyer found that the Guard deployment was illegal, and both violated the 10th Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded Trump's statutory authority, The Associated Press reported.



            But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel allowed the troops to remain in federal hands while the lawsuit unfolds. Today the appeals court will weigh whether to vacate Judge Breyer's June order.
    


            Attorneys for the city of Chicago will speak to a federal judge this morning, urging her to extend the temporary restraining order that prevents National Guard troops from being deployed in Chicago.
    


            The Trump administration opposes an extension which would keep guardsmen from Illinois and Texas from patrolling the streets of the Windy City.
    


            Judge April Perry – a Biden appointee – blocked the deployment two weeks ago, just as Texas guardsmen arrived at the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview that has been the focal point of protests.
    


            Today's telephone hearing comes as the US Supreme Court is reviewing the administration's request to undo Perry's temporary restraining order. A panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld Perry's decision, but the federal government filed an emergency appeal to the high court. The Supreme Court has not given a deadline for making its decision.
    


            Speaking from the White House yesterday, President Trump said he feels empowered to send the National Guard into any city he sees fit, on the heels of a ruling by an appeals court  that endorsed his deployment into Portland, Oregon.
    


            “That was the decision. I can send the National Guard if I see problems,” Trump told reporters after a Diwali event in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump called the ruling a “very strong opinion that we have the right to use the National Guard,” and one that he could apply to other cities moving forward.
    


                    “You would think that would be common sense: We have the right to use the National Guard to put out trouble. Well, that's how I got elected – one of the reasons I got elected,” he said.
                





            The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to allow a similar move to Portland to be carried out in Chicago. The justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of National Guard members to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city's suburbs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A Democratic senator is delivering a marathon floor speech to protest Trump","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jeff-merkley-senate-floor-speech","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:04:51 GMT","


            Sen. Jeff Merkley has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than 18 hours after announcing he would protest what he called President Donald Trump's “grave threats to democracy.”
    


            “I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.
    


            Bending his legs at times, highlighting the physical strain that comes with committing to standing for so long, Merkley had delivered the sixth longest floor speech in modern history as he continued speaking into the afternoon. Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.
    


            Merkley's marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.
    


            Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 11 times until their demands are met. There is expected to be another procedural vote on the Republican proposal once Merkley finishes speaking.
    


            The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration's previous halting of research grants for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the recent indictments of several of the president's political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.
    


            “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion. And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.
    


            Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.
    


            His comments on the situation in Oregon come after an appeals court on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.
    


            “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court's permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”
    


            Earlier this year, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.
    


            This was also not Merkley's first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017 against Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.
    


            In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris Murphy on gun control in 2016; Rand Paul over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and Ted Cruz against the Affordable Care Act 2013.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner revealed Tuesday that he was tattooed years ago with an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol, but he dismissed the connotation and chalked it up to a drunken Marine's attempt at fearsomeness. He said he plans to have the tattoo removed. 

Platner is the latest Democratic candidate to shrug off dark revelations about their past, reflecting a new era in politics and an example set by President Donald Trump, who has forged ahead undaunted by controversies that would have been campaign-ending discoveries only a decade ago. 

The new revelation about Platner comes close behind the discovery of a series of controversial online statements, including one in which he dismissed sexual assault in the military. It also follows a pattern set by Jay Jones, this year's Democratic nominee for attorney general of Virginia, who has refused to drop out of the race even after text messages surfaced in which he suggested in 2022 that a prominent state Republican should get “two bullets to the head.”

Jones apologized for the comments, which also included the suggestion that his then-Republican opponent's children face the same fate. Jones has stayed in the race for the Nov. 4 Virginia election, saying it's up to voters to judge his qualifications for the office. The scandal over them has spilled over into the governor's race, where Democrat Abigail Spanberger has had to address it repeatedly. 




Platner, a Democrat and oyster farmer, had sparked buzz among progressives in Maine, notably since two-term Gov. Janet Mills last week entered the Democratic race for U.S. Senate. The two Democrats are vying for the chance to challenge 30-year incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins.

Platner attempted to explain his past online comments in a video posted to social media last week. In it, he addressed not only his previous comments dismissing military sexual assaults, but also his questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.

“I see someone I don't recognize,” he said in the five-minute apology video.

Platner sought to further distance himself from the comments, posted online between 2013 and 2021, during an interview on the Democratic podcast Pod Save America that was posted Tuesday, describing them as the ramblings of a recent military veteran. 

“That was a moment in time when I had not yet been exposed to things, and I had an opinion or I had thoughts that were colored by my experience in the service,” he said during the podcast. 

But Platner himself brought up the tattoo, which he says he received in 2007, when he was in his 20s. He said he got it in Kosovo while on leave with the Marines during a night of drinking. A video aired during the podcast shows Platner dancing shirtless with the tattoo visible on his upper chest. 

He said he and his fellow Marines chose “a terrifying looking skull and crossbones off the wall because we were Marines and, you know, skulls and crossbones are a pretty standard military thing,” Platner said. 

The prominent antisemitism advocacy group, the Anti-Defamation League, reviewed the video and recognized the image in the tattoo as a specific symbol of Hitler's paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II.

“This appears to be a Nazi Totenkopf tattoo, and if true, it is troubling that a candidate for high office would have one,” Oren Segal, the Anti-Defamation League's senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence, said in an email response to an Associated Press inquiry. “We do understand that sometimes people get tattoos without understanding their hateful association. In those cases, the bearer should be asked whether they repudiate its hateful meaning.”

In a statement to The Associated Press late Tuesday, Platner said: “It was not until I started hearing from reporters and DC insiders that I realized this tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol. I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that – and to insinuate that I did is disgusting. I am already planning to get this removed.”

Platner added that in the 20 years since he got the tattoo, he enlisted in the Army, “which involved a full physical that examines tattoos for hate symbols. I also passed a full background check to receive a security clearance to join the Ambassador to Afghanistan's security detail.” The notion of his tattoo as a Nazi symbol never came up, he said.

But a former top Platner staffer said he should have known. 

“Maybe he didn't know it when he got it, but he got it years ago and he should have had it covered up because he knows damn well what it means,” Platner's former political director Genevieve L. McDonald, who quit the campaign last week, said in a Facebook post Tuesday. 

Platner is running against Mills in next year's primary. 

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has endorsed Platner, was sticking with the candidate, telling reporters on Tuesday that Platner is “an excellent candidate.”

“I'm going to support him,” Sanders added.

The episodes, including Jones' explosive revelations in Virginia, follow a decade of Trump rewriting the standard for what can derail a campaign.

Trump won the 2016 presidential election even after recordings surfaced that had been made 11 years earlier of him speaking to an “Access Hollywood” reporter in which he boasted in lewd terms about making sexual advances toward women who were not his wife. Trump also referred to “very fine people, on both sides” of a 2017 episode in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a woman who was protesting against a white nationalist demonstration was run down and killed by a white supremacist in his car. 

More recently, Trump was elected to a second, non-consecutive term in 2024 after being twice impeached during his first term and later being convicted on 34 criminal counts in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump denied the allegation.

“I think there's a sense among Democrats that if Republicans can ignore calls to bow out, why can't we?” said Todd Belt, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University.

During an attorney general campaign debate last week, Jones raised the very issue, referring to Trump's speech urging his supporters to contest the 2020 presidential election, which he lost, before many of them stormed the U.S. Capitol in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. 

“What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones said.

NEW YORK (AP) — An immigration enforcement operation that sparked spontaneous protests on Manhattan's Canal Street led to the arrests of 14 people, federal authorities said Wednesday, including several demonstrators accused of assaulting or obstructing agents. 

Droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded a group of federal agents Tuesday afternoon after they began questioning and detaining street vendors on the busy commercial strip, known for its sidewalk bazaars and shops selling knock-off designer goods.

Law enforcement raids aimed at combating counterfeiting are relatively frequent on Canal Street, but the sight of dozens of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents making arrests drew instant protests.

Activists who rushed to the scene joined with bystanders, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, and shouted at the agents, at one point blocking their vehicle. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with stun guns or pepper spray before detaining them.

Nine people were arrested in the initial immigration sweep, according to Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. Four more people were arrested for allegedly assaulting federal law enforcement officers, she said. A fifth was arrested on an accusation that they had obstructed law enforcement by blocking a driveway, McLaughlin said.

McLaughlin called the initial sweep “a targeted, intelligence-driven” operation “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.” She said some of the people arrested by authorities had previously been accused of crimes, including “robbery, burglary, domestic violence, assaulting law enforcement, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, drug possession, and forgery.”

The sweep came after at last two conservative influencers shared video on X of men selling bags on Canal Street's sidewalks.




The enforcement operation drew condemnation from the two Democrats in New York City's mayoral race.

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop,” said state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, 

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, similarly, said it was “more about fear than justice.”

Canal Street is famous globally as a place to buy counterfeit designer and bootlegged goods, and federal authorities often partner with the city's police department and luxury brands on crackdowns aimed at shutting down the illicit trade. 

Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said the police department had no involvement in Tuesday's sweep.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said.

Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the U.S. carried out a strike against alleged drug vessel on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025, in the Eastern Pacific. (X.com/SecWar)

The U.S. military carried out another strike on a suspected drug vessel, this time in the Eastern Pacific, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday.

The strike Tuesday against a boat allegedly carrying drugs is the eighth conducted by the Trump administration. The previous seven happened in the Caribbean.  

""Yesterday, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics,"" Hegseth said.

""There were two narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. Both terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike,"" he added.

Earlier this week, Hegseth announced that three alleged narco-terrorists were killed in a U.S. strike on a drug smuggling vessel affiliated with Colombia's National Liberation Army.

That ""lethal kinetic strike"" happened Friday in international waters at the direction of President Donald Trump, Hegseth wrote in a post on X.

""The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics,"" Hegseth wrote. ""There were three male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike—which was conducted in international waters.""

""All three terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike,"" he added.

Colombia's Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) is a designated terrorist organization. Hegseth likened the Colombian rebel group to the al Qaeda terror group founded by Usama bin Laden in Afghanistan.

The death toll from the Trump administration's military campaign against suspected drug-smuggling vessels is at least 34. The operations began last month and are part of Trump's broader effort to dismantle transnational cartels by force.

Last Thursday, the U.S. military carried out a strike on what Trump later called a ""very large drug-carrying submarine"" in the Caribbean, killing two suspected narco-terrorists and capturing two others alive.

Former California Democratic state Senate leader Gloria Romero reacts to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's decision to withhold federal funding from California over the state's failure to enforce English-language requirements for truck drivers.

Republicans in California are launching an effort to require voters to show ID before casting their ballots.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio is raising funds for the initiative through his grassroots organization Reform California. The campaign requires 875,000 signatures in order to show up on the ballot in 2026.

""Voter ID is about restoring not only internal controls to improve the process but restoring public trust and confidence in our democracy,"" DeMaio told NBC Bay Area.

""People are harboring concerns about how our elections are being conducted, and it's hard to show and prove voter fraud because you don't know how many votes are being fraudulently cast because there are no internal controls or checks,"" he said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESURRECTS ‘NEIGHBORHOOD CHECKS' FOR CITIZENSHIP APPLICANTS LAST USED IN FIRST BUSH-ERA

As of Wednesday, the petition has collected over 300,000 signatures. The petition has 129 days to collect the remaining 575,000 signees.

Across the U.S., 36 states have laws that require voters to present some form of identification to cast a ballot on Election Day. Of those, 24 require photo IDs, according to Ballotpedia.

President Donald Trump signed an election integrity executive order earlier this year that, among other things, required voters to provide proof of citizenship. The effort failed in the courts, however.

CITIZENSHIP VOTER REGISTRATION BILL IS ‘COMMON SENSE,' GOP LAWMAKER ARGUES

In April, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down the portions of that order that related to voter identification requirements.

Kollar-Kotelly maintained that Trump did not have the authority to issue such an order, as the Constitution delegates control of election regulations to Congress and states.

""Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would affect many of the changes the President purports to order,"" Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee, wrote in her order. ""No statutory delegation of authority to the Executive Branch permits the President to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.""

A poll from Gallup taken just before the 2024 elections found that 84% of U.S. adults were in favor of requiring voters to show identification and 83% supported requiring proof of citizenship when registering for the first time.

President Donald Trump said the Justice Department ""probably"" owes him ""a lot of money"" over previous prosecutions.

President Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) owes him money for past prosecutions against him. 

In the Oval Office, a reporter asked Trump if he was seeking compensation from the DOJ over past federal investigations into him and, if so, how much he was seeking. 

""Well, I guess they probably owe me a lot of money for that,"" Trump said in response. ""No, I get no salary. I gave up my salary. It's a good salary. Not as much as these guys make, but that's OK. It's a lot of money, and I don't, as you know, I didn't take it in the first four years. I didn't take it these four years either.""

""But as far as all of the litigation, everything that's been involved, yeah, they probably owe me a lot of money,"" the president added. ""But if I get money from our country, I'll do something nice with it. Like, give it to charity or give it to the White House while we restore the White House, and we're doing a great job with the White House, as you know, the ballroom is under construction.""

The New York Times reported sources as saying Trump is seeking approximately $230 million in compensation from the Justice Department for investigations into him. 

Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was ""not looking for money,"" but that they ""would have to ask the lawyers about that."" 

""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said. ""We have numerous cases having to do with the fraud of the election, the 2020 election, and because of everything that we found out, I guess they owe me a lot of money. But I'm not looking for money. I'm looking for — really, I think it's got to be, it's got to be handled in a proper way… We don't want it to happen again. We can never let what happened in the 2020 election happen again. We just can't let that happen."" 

He was later pressed again about the exact dollar amount in the request and said, ""I don't know what the number is. I don't even talk to them about it.""

Trump then remarked that the decision would have to come across his desk, saying that it would be ""awfully strange to make a decision where I'm paying myself.""

""In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you're paying yourself in damages?"" Trump said. ""But I was damaged very greatly. And any money that I would get, I would give to charity.""

The Times noted that the DOJ's rules state that settlement claims against the department that exceed $4 million ""must be approved by the Deputy Attorney General, or Associate Attorney General, as appropriate.""

It is unclear where the claims or negotiations with the DOJ stand. However, The Associated Press noted that the ties between Trump and those authorized to make a decision on the settlement could present problems. 

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche served as one of Trump's attorneys in the Mar-a-Lago case. Additionally, Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward represented Trump's co-defendant, Walt Nauta, in the Mar-a-Lago case.

""In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials,"" DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The investigations include the FBI's 2022 raid of Mar-a-Lago as part of the classified documents case and another probe looking into possible ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. According to the Times, the first claim was filed in late 2023 and was in relation to the Russia probe, while the second — which focused on the Mar-a-Lago raid — was filed in the summer of 2024.

The Times reported Tuesday that Trump had submitted complaints through an administrative claim process, noting that it is something that often precedes lawsuits.

Despite the president saying that he would donate the funds, some Democrats painted the report as an example of Trump trying to enrich himself. 

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said on Wednesday morning that the president was looking ""to line his own pockets, or he says now to give to a charity of his choice."" The senator added to the accusation, saying Trump was ""focusing on getting $230 million that he doesn't deserve back into his pocket instead of helping the American people get healthcare.""

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who was in the middle of an hours-long speech, slammed Trump for ""suing the government, then instructing his Department of Justice to settle the suit, thereby translating money into the president's pocket out of the government.""

Merkley then remarked that ""there is no limit to the self-serving"" and called for his colleagues, particularly Republicans, to speak out against the president.

The Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Josh Simmons was selected in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft and was figured to be a main piece of the team's offense moving forward.

The former Ohio State standout has played in five games this season, but has missed the last two under mysterious circumstances. Simmons was listed on the injury report last week as missing practice due to personal reasons. He was not on the injury report ahead of the team's game against the Detroit Lions.

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told reporters he didn't have any updates on Simmons. He said general manager Brett Veach was handling things in Simmons' regard and ""we'll just move on with that.""

Team owner Clark Hunt was asked about Simmons during the NFL fall meeting.

""I really can't comment,"" he told ESPN.

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suggested Simmons was dealing with a serious problem. A separate report indicated that he returned home to deal with a family matter.

""I'll keep conversations kind of between us,"" Mahomes said, via the New York Post. ""But I'm always praying for him. I'm praying for all my teammates, so I'm always praying for him. I'll just keep everything else kind of private to us.""

The Chiefs seemed to be more cohesive on offense in the last two weeks with major victories over the Lions and Las Vegas Raiders.

Michigan State men's basketball coach Tom Izzo ripped the NCAA's recent decision to allow former NBA G League players to play college ball.

Thierry Darlan, 21, committed to Santa Clara last month after spending parts of two seasons in the G League, while London Johnson, who spent three seasons in the league, will attend Louisville.

Izzo said today's college basketball has ""no rules,"" and ""kids aren't the problem, we're the problem.""

""I am going to get myself in trouble. … I'm not real excited about the NCAA or whoever is making these decisions, without talking to us, just letting it go. They're afraid they're going to get sued,"" Izzo told reporters on Tuesday, via ESPN.

""Someone is going to say, 'Well, if they go pro and it doesn't work out, they should be able to come back.' Well, what about the freshmen you recruited there? That's somebody's son and he thinks he's got himself a good place, and all of a sudden, shazam, they pull out of their hat and bring a 21- or 22-year-old in (from the G League). To me, it's ridiculous. It's embarrassing.""

Izzo said that the NCAA has ""got to regroup"" and again absolve the players themselves of any blame.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The trends in New Jersey and Virginia","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3859597/new-jersey-virginia-political-trends-2025-elections/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:09:04 GMT","

No two states voted more alike and closer to the national average in last year's presidential election than the two states that have gubernatorial elections in this odd-numbered year: New Jersey and Virginia. New Jersey voted 51.8% for Kamala Harris and 45.9% for Donald Trump. Virginia voted 51.8% for Harris and 46.1% for Trump. Aside from the seven target states and Democratic underperformance in New Hampshire and Minnesota, these were the two closest states in the country.

They have other similarities. Large percentages of their voters live in metropolitan areas centered on cities outside the state, such as New York City and Washington, D.C. Both of those metro areas have populations far above the national average in education credentials and income. 

LIST: THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE WHO HAVE SAID THEY WON'T SEEK REELECTION

That has tilted them toward the Democratic Party in this era when upscale voters, in line with their liberal stands on cultural issues, trend that way. It's a time when million-plus metro areas, evenly divided in the 1980s, have become heavily Democratic, while the half of Americans living outside those big metro areas have, often despite historical Democratic allegiances, been delivering increasing margins for Trump's Republicans.

It comes as second nature to political writers to seek omens in the results and trends of off-year elections. Virginia has provided plenty of grist for their mills, having elected governors of the party that lost the presidential election the year before in 11 of the last 12 contests starting in 1977. 

That would seem to give an advantage to Democrats in two states carried by Harris. It helps that Democrats have managed to nominate candidates with attractive biographies and reputations, despite their generally party-line voting records, as centrists. Both are women with national security experience who were first elected to the House of Representatives in the Democratic year of 2018. 

Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) was a Navy helicopter pilot and later worked as a lawyer. After her military service, she went to graduate school, earning a law degree and an Arabic language certificate. She captured an exurban, traditionally Republican New Jersey district when the incumbent retired. She won her first primary easily and has won general elections with 53% to 59% of the vote. 

Abigail Spanberger also earned a graduate degree, taught at northern Virginia's Islamic Saudi Academy, and was an intelligence officer in the CIA for six years. She won her suburban House seat, stretching from Richmond to Fairfax County, against an incumbent Republican by 2 points and then won reelection by 3 and 5 points and stepped down in 2024, with the governor's race in mind.

Current RealClearPolitics polling averages have Sherrill ahead of 2021 nominee Jack Ciattarelli by a 48% to 44% margin and Spanberger leading Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by 50% to 44% — margins not that far from the virtually identical margins by which Harris carried both states.

Republicans hold out some hope in both races. Ciattarelli lost by only 51% to 48% against incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy in 2021, campaigning against the high taxes that have helped Republicans win four of eight New Jersey elections starting in 1993, despite the state's Democratic lean in presidential politics. And Sherrill, Republicans say, is on the defensive for having been required not to appear at her graduation from the Naval Academy, apparently for not having reported another cadet's violation of the honor code.

In Virginia, Spanberger was set back by the revelation on Oct. 3 that Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones sent messages in 2022 expressing a desire to shoot the then-Republican House speaker and see his children murdered in their mother's arms. Spanberger expressed abhorrence but refused to call on him to step aside and announced her early vote for him. October polling shows Jones trailing incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, 47% to 43%. 

Despite their identical responses in 2024, these two states have different traditions. In assessing the chances for an upset in either race, it may be useful to look at the different surges of migration, immigrant and internal, that have populated these two states over the years.

In New Jersey, one can find traces of Dutch settlers from Nieuw Amsterdam and Quakers in the Delaware River Valley from colonial days. But the big surge of migration came from the descendants of the Ellis Island migration of 1892 to 1924, Italians, Jews, and Poles spilling over from the big cities across the Hudson and Delaware rivers. 

Their offspring responded favorably to the appeals of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as the anti-tax constituency was reduced by migrants to Florida. But inflation and illegal immigration in the Biden years have pushed them toward Trump, who raised Republicans' presidential percentages from 41% in 2012 to 2020 to 46% in 2024.

That move was accentuated by Trumpward moves among Hispanics. The 1940 to 1965 northward migration of black people has ebbed in New Jersey, leaving only two municipalities (East Orange and Lawnside) with black majorities. In contrast, the post-1982 Hispanic migration has produced 29 municipalities with Hispanic majorities.

In those two-thirds or more Hispanic, Trump made major gains in 2024, reducing their average Democratic margins from 40% in 2020 to 12%. NBC analyst Steve Kornacki pointed out that if Ciattarelli in 2021 had won Trump 2024 percentages in majority nonwhite municipalities, he would have lost by only 0.3%. 

Virginia is a different story. The demographic surge has been an influx of affluent, highly educated Americans plus relatively high-skill immigrants, with significant numbers of Asians and Hispanics, over the past 30 years. Northern Virginia's share of the statewide vote has increased from 25% in 1980 to 36% in 2024. 

THE FRIENDS OF ZOHRAN MAMDANI

In the three Trump elections, northern Virginia has voted 60%, 65%, and 61% Democratic, putting a state safely in the Democratic column that, with just one exception, had voted comfortably Republican from 1952 to 2004. That's notwithstanding Trump's 50%, 50%, and 52% wins in the rest of Virginia, similar to his showings in next-door North Carolina.

In that setting, Spanberger's cold-blooded refusal to renounce Jones and her stubborn refusal to oppose girls in boys sports look like efforts to avoid disenchanting Democratic voters in one of the strongest anti-Trump constituencies in America. Trends may be working for Trump's party in New Jersey, but less so in Virginia.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Pete Hegseth Is the Pentagon's Holy Warrior","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/archive/2025/10/pete-hegseth-christianity-pentagon/684645/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:13:00 GMT","

Pete Hegseth is bringing his fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity into the Pentagon.

Sign up for our newsletter about national security here.

Doug Wilson has a white beard and a round belly, and is therefore somewhat Santa-like in appearance. He does not seem at all like someone who delivers denunciations of homosexuality and women's suffrage, and who takes an ambivalent position on the subject of pre–Civil War slavery.



On a recent Sunday morning, Wilson preached from the lectern at a conference center near Washington, D.C. The Idaho pastor's sermon was mostly an academic examination of Ephesians 3:1–6 and its offering of God's salvation. In this setting, at least, he skipped the hellfire rhetoric for which he's known, making no reference to his theocratic vision of America's future or his belief that the apocalypse described in the Book of Revelation already took place—and is enabling a project of global Christian conquest. Throughout the service, I couldn't help glancing from my spot in the back at a familiar figure seated with his family near the front, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.



Although Wilson's Christ-or-chaos approach to spirituality is interesting enough, the reason I'd come that morning is that I had wanted to better understand what Hegseth saw in him. Like Wilson, Hegseth—the “secretary of war,” according to a recent declaration by Trump—has called for restoring a Christian ethos to American life, reversing the secularization of state institutions, and barring women from certain combat roles. But unlike the 72-year-old preacher, Hegseth heads a force of 3 million service members and civilians whose mission—a secular mission—is to keep the nation secure.



When the liturgy ended, Pentagon security officers flanked the room, and church officials politely but firmly steered me and the handful of other reporters out of the building so that we couldn't see whether Hegseth and Wilson spoke. (Wilson wrote on his blog that they did.) When I asked Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, whether Hegseth shares the pastor's beliefs, she was dismissive. “Despite the Left's efforts to remove our Christian heritage from our great nation,” she replied in an email, “Secretary Hegseth is among those who embrace it.” Hegseth wouldn't speak with me to elaborate.



Eliot A. Cohen: Pete Hegseth is living the dream



In an administration that is already heavy-handed in invoking Christian ideas and imagery in government work, Hegseth has gone further than anyone else. The belief that God has picked a political side is widely shared within Trump's circle of advisers. Mass deportations, the expansion of presidential power, and, especially after Charlie Kirk's murder, a desire for vengeance against perceived enemies are all, in their telling, divinely ordained. “I was saved by God to make America great again,” the thrice-married, non-churchgoing president has said.



All of this is a departure from how previous U.S. presidents and military leaders have understood the intersection of faith and duty for generations. Although America's armed forces have always made space for religion, going back to the Battle of Bunker Hill, that place is a circumscribed one, entrusted primarily to several thousand chaplains responsible for attending to troops of their own faith and facilitating observance by those of other traditions. Prayers may be abundant in foxholes, but commanders typically do not dictate matters of spirituality.



Hegseth has swerved dramatically from that precedent. In addition to being the highest-profile member of the administration who belongs to the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, or CREC, an Idaho-based denomination that identifies as Christian nationalist, he has made Christianity a conspicuous part of his official duties. He leads regular Pentagon prayer sessions, posts often on social media about his faith (he posted a verse from Psalm 27—“The Lord is the stronghold of my life, whom shall I fear?”—in September), and describes the military's mission in explicitly biblical terms. In one recent podcast appearance, he identified “spiritual readiness” as a core part of the military mission. “That's why wherever we can, we invoke the name of God; we invoke the name of Jesus Christ,” he said. “We want that spoken and talked about inside our formations.” In the hours after the killing of Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder, Hegseth asked a group of troops in Washington to recite the Lord's Prayer with him. Later, Hegseth posted a video setting that recitation to imagery of missiles streaking across the sky, warships streaming in formation, and troops advancing on unseen enemies.



The men and women who have volunteered to serve are noticing the difference. In conversations with roughly 20 people, including current and former service members and people who know Hegseth, I heard again and again about the defense secretary's sharp deviation from Pentagon tradition when it comes to matters of faith. They noticed, for example, when he reposted a CNN segment in August that showed Doug Wilson, along with other church leaders, calling for women to be stripped of the right to vote and affirming his belief that some master-slave relationships were characterized by affection. (Later, when reporters asked about the segment, Hegseth's press secretary said that “of course” Hegseth believes women should be able to vote. She described Hegseth as a proud CREC member and said he “very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson's writings and teachings.”)



Former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, a churchgoing Episcopalian, told me that when he served as President Barack Obama's defense secretary, he was careful not to talk publicly about his own beliefs. His maxim was that Defense Department personnel—from riflemen to top brass—cannot advocate for their own political or religious views as part of their official duties without risking corrosive divisions in the force. There is too much at stake in the military, including the freedoms that service members swear oaths to protect. “It is very dangerous, very wrong, to start down that road,” Hagel told me, “because that road leads you to a lot of places you don't want to go.”



Growing up in Minnesota, Hegseth attended First Baptist Church on Sunday mornings and Bible study on Wednesday nights. His father was a public-school teacher. His mother, Penny, lobbied Hegseth's school when she disagreed with what Hegseth has since described as a “values-free” curriculum, leading to young Pete being put in study hall when certain lessons were taught. Hegseth has repeatedly talked about a religion class during his senior year at Princeton when, by his recollection, a professor informed students that Jesus had been buried in a shallow grave and eaten by dogs, an idea that horrified and offended him. (The instructor, Elaine Pagels, a historian of religion, told me that she may have mentioned this idea in the class, but only as a notion put forward by another scholar. “That particular theory is not mine, nor do I agree with it, as I would have made abundantly clear,” Pagels said. “Mr. Hegseth is wrong to attribute it to me.”)



Hegseth, in his later telling, retained a “Christian veneer but a secular core” into adulthood. Multiple people who knew Hegseth in his 20s and 30s said he was not outwardly religious in any noteworthy way. “He clearly had religious beliefs and was serious about them, but it was not a central part of his life,” one person who knew him for many years told me.



That changed after 2017, during a period in which his second marriage ended—like his first marriage, the relationship collapsed after his infidelity—and he had a child with his now-wife, Jennifer, a colleague at Fox News. Early that year, he had been stung when Trump passed him over to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was drinking heavily and had been accused of sexual assault by a woman with whom he had a sexual encounter shortly after the birth of his child with Jennifer. (Hegseth has said the encounter was consensual, and a prosecutor declined to press charges, but Hegseth paid the accuser a $50,000 settlement.) Ties with his family were strained; his mother berated him as a man who “belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego” in a 2018 email. “His life was falling apart at the seams,” said one person who knows Hegseth and, like others who spoke candidly with me about their recollections of Hegseth's life, requested anonymity. The same year, he and Jennifer became involved in Colts Neck Community Church in New Jersey. This was the place where, as Hegseth later put it in an interview with the magazine Nashville Christian Family, “the message of Christ really went the 12 inches from head to heart.” Hegseth has credited two people, Jennifer and Jesus Christ, for pulling him out of his tumult. “Without those two J's, I wouldn't be sitting here right now,” he told a podcaster last year. He soon came to believe that he was on a specific spiritual and civic mission.



That mission is articulated in his 2020 book, American Crusade. In it, Hegseth decries what he sees as a left-wing plot to eradicate faith, and especially Christianity, from American life. He leans on references to God by the Founding Fathers as a way to argue that the separation of Church and state is merely “leftist folklore that, after years of indoctrination, has become orthodoxy.” And he blames secularists for being on a “seek-and-destroy mission” against America's Christians.



Like others in the MAGAverse, Hegesth has embraced a war-on-Christmas-style narrative in which Christians are persecuted by mainstream society; he often pins blame on state or educational institutions. In a 2022 segment on Fox News, Hegseth used a Sharpie to write return to sender on his Harvard Kennedy School master's diploma, in response to Harvard's appointment of a self-described atheist and humanist as its chief chaplain.



Read: The war on Christmas is winning



The Ivy League made for an easy target, but Hegseth has been even more preoccupied with America's public elementary and secondary schools, and their part in what he's described as the “16,000-hour war,” a reference to the amount of time kids spend in the classroom from kindergarten through 12th grade. Hegseth has repeatedly complained of secular brainwashing, what he sees as a progressive plot to undermine Western civilization. By 2020, at least one of Hegseth's school-age children was enrolled in a classical Christian school, part of a network of institutions closely affiliated with the CREC. The schools instruct students using a biblical lens, teaching Latin and ancient Greek and emphasizing virtue and manners. Rather than the school encouraging self-expression in art classes, children reproduce classic works from Western history; instead of evolution, students learn biblical creationism. As one school leader in the network said in a promotional video: “Every moment of every day is structured around the one simple concept: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.” In his 2022 book, Battle for the American Mind, Hegseth describes the growing network of schools as part of an insurgent, countercultural movement: “We are outnumbered, and outgunned, but we are not yet defeated.”



Hegseth calls on Christians to embrace the “radical reorientation” of their lives around their children's education, urging parents to get a second job or forgo vacations so they can put their kids in Classical Christian Education schools or, as a fallback, homeschool. As he put it in a podcast appearance last year: “Why would you roll the dice on the souls of your own kids?”



Resolved not to make that gamble, Hegseth and his wife relocated their family during the Biden administration from New Jersey to a town near Nashville so their children could attend a nearby classical academy. It was there that Hegseth got to know the pastor of a local CREC church, Brooks Potteiger. After Hegseth became defense secretary, he asked Potteiger to preside at the first of the monthly prayer services Hegseth now leads at the Pentagon. Potteiger, square-jawed and bearded, reminded the troops and staff assembled in the Pentagon auditorium that Jesus has “final say” over all worldly matters—including nuclear-armed missiles. In that setting, he made no mention of his more controversial positions, including the idea that men ought to exercise “headship” over their wives as part of a “glorious and inevitable” return to biblical-style patriarchy. Outside of the Pentagon, Potteiger has advocated for men-only gyms (the sight of women exercising being too tempting) and says that women shouldn't be allowed to preach, both because they are prone to gossip and because they don't possess the same theological heft as men. Women just don't have that “certain gravitas” that men do, he has said on his podcast. Potteiger gave the example of a female drill sergeant: “I don't know if there's a more against-nature picture you can have than a woman screaming into the face of a man to try to bring down and bring him into submission.”

People who have worked with Hegseth told me that, for all of the bluster in his social-media posts, books, and podcast appearances, religion seldom came up behind closed doors in his early months at the Pentagon; one former official described a “frat boy” atmosphere more than anything else. But his faith wasn't absent either: Several people told me that he's talked about having prayed over personnel decisions and once called for a group prayer before an air strike. They also said that Hegseth has more frequently turned to God when he is around his colleagues at the Pentagon as he has faced greater criticism of his performance. This was particularly the case, they said, after he inadvertently shared highly sensitive plans for bombing Yemen with a group chat that included the editor in chief of this magazine. That episode intensified doubt about his judgment and triggered a probe by the Pentagon's inspector general. (One person who knows Hegseth told me he thought the defense secretary would be happy that I was writing this story, because it would play into a narrative that he is being persecuted for his convictions, not derided for his performance: “He can then turn around and say, ‘All this stuff happening to me is because I'm an out and proud Protestant Christian.'”)



Peter Wehner: Fully MAGA-fied Christianity



Hegseth has invoked George Washington as a kindred spirit, citing the possibly apocryphal story of a man coming upon him praying alone in the forest at Valley Forge. “That guy right there said a few prayers before he set out to try to establish a new nation,” Hegseth told a podcaster this month, signaling to a portrait of Washington that hangs in his office overlooking the Potomac. But Washington was famously private in his faith, and rather than infusing the American government in its infancy with his beliefs, he stood for religious freedom.



Hegseth, meanwhile, has found many ways to trumpet his faith. His challenge coin, a memento that military and defense leaders pass out to many subordinates or other people they meet, features a Jerusalem, or Crusader's, cross—the same one Hegseth has tattooed on his chest. In 15 years of covering the military, I've never seen any other challenge coin that features religious iconography. At least one person who knows Hegseth says his shows of religiosity are notable for another reason, too: “For me, there's a major contradiction in observing what he preaches or tweets and what he actually practices,” this person said, pointing to Hegseth's abrupt dismissals of experienced officers as an example. “You can't be a God-fearing Christian man and treat people the way he does in the DOD.”



One man who heartily approves of Hegseth's approach is Doug Wilson, whose Church espouses a “dominionist” theology, meaning that Jesus should exert dominion over all aspects of humanity, including government and public spaces. When I interviewed Wilson recently by Zoom, he described a central complaint: “Too many Christians think that their faith is to be this privatized event, behind their eyeballs and between their ears,” Wilson told me. Not so the CREC. Wilson describes a 250-year timeframe to achieve the Church's ideal Christian state, one that would turn back the clock on the legalization of homosexuality, gay marriage, abortion, and everything else he considers the “clown world” of modern American life.



Wilson, a former submariner who grew up in a minister's family near the Naval Academy in Annapolis, eventually wound up in Moscow, Idaho. It was there, in the 1970s, that he built the church that would become the CREC empire. Today, his model is South Carolina in the early days of America, a society whose constructs he admires for reasons including its requirement that officeholders be Protestant Christian men. Wilson believes that America should be a kind of theocracy, not a secular democracy. If he had his way, clerics would not control the government, he says, but Christianity would infuse everything: law, architecture, even dentistry. Immigration by non-Christians would be limited to protect America's biblical character, and only Christians would hold office. Non-Christians would be permitted to practice their faiths but with diminished rights, and never in the public sphere. Or, as he's previously put it: “yes to church bells, no to minarets.”



And mostly no to women in positions of power—though Wilson says that he would have made an exception for Margaret Thatcher. In his ideal America, divorce would be rare, permitted only under a handful of circumstances—such as infidelity or abandonment—and sodomy and same-sex marriage would be recriminalized. Although Wilson told me that women's right to vote isn't at the top of his list of concerns, the CREC calls for “household voting” in which only the man at the head of each family casts a ballot. (Other Church elders explicitly call for repealing the Nineteenth Amendment.)



Wilson's movement remains small—the CREC counts roughly 150 churches nationally; the Catholic Church has nearly 20,000—but it isn't just a network of churches. The CREC's profile has been supercharged by its publishing house, its affiliated federation of schools, and now its connection to the man leading the most fearsome military on the planet. Wilson delights in his role as a provocateur, and on social media he shares videos that show him using a flamethrower to incinerate giant cutouts of princesses from Disney (whose executives “have an evil agenda”) or wearing a Mr. Rogers–esque cardigan before setting fire to a model town like the one tended by the children's-TV star. (“Burn whatever bridges you need to burn,” he says before setting fire to a miniature railroad trestle.) Hegseth, too, has singled out Disney in the culture wars; last year he said he had barred his family from watching the company's programming, which he has lambasted for references to climate change and for “gender-bending heroism.”



On many military-related matters, Wilson's views track those of Hegseth: In Wilson's telling, women have no place on submarines or in other close-quarters combat roles. “A nation which defends herself with women in combat no longer deserves to be defended,” he said in one address. In certain areas, however, Wilson sees things differently than Hegseth does: Wilson insists, for instance, that the Uniform Code of Military Justice must be upheld. Hegseth, meanwhile, has boasted about telling subordinates to ignore rules of engagement and has derided military JAG Corps lawyers as “jagoffs.” During Trump's first term, Hegseth used his perch at Fox to lobby the president to show leniency toward troops accused of war crimes.



But any differences seem small compared with the mission that both Hegseth and Wilson say they are on: advancing an expansive, sometimes militant version of Christianity that is evident across all aspects of public life. Unlike the majority of evangelical denominations, the CREC is what's known as a post-millennial church. Rather than awaiting an end-of-days cataclysm that could arrive at any moment, to be followed by Jesus's triumphant return, CREC faithful believe that the traumatic events cited in the Book of Revelation already occurred (in 70 C.E., when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem). They anticipate instead Christianity's eventual global triumph, ushering in a new “golden era” for humanity and, sometime later, Jesus's return. It's a notion that provides plenty of time to advance an earthly project that looks a lot like the one advocated by Trump and his MAGA adherents.



Last summer the CREC opened a new church in Washington, D.C., blocks from the U.S. Capitol, in a rowhouse owned by the MAGA-run political nonprofit Conservative Partnership Initiative. I visited on a recent Sunday and found a handful of protesters outside of the building in red robes and hoods reminiscent of The Handmaid's Tale. Upstairs, families in Sunday best bustled between rows of folding chairs as the service got started. The children present were remarkably well behaved during the 90-minute liturgy. On one back wall, someone had tacked up the Appeal to Heaven flag—the Revolutionary War–era flag that MAGA's “Stop the Steal” crowd embraced following Trump's 2020 defeat. As someone who has attended more Catholic masses than I can count, the service felt mostly familiar—with some glaring exceptions. Throughout the proceedings, I heard the occasional political reference, the sort of thing that would sound more natural coming from Fox News than from a pulpit. One minister referred to “plotting globalists” and called for the “restoration and reformation of the nation's capital.”



As I was reporting this story, I listened to dozens of interviews, speeches, podcast appearances, and Fox segments from Hegseth over the past decade. In those remarks and in his books, Hegseth espouses many of the CREC beliefs about the centrality of religion, the ills of secularism, and how America has lost its way. I have never heard him publicly embrace the church's most radical teachings on diminishing women's legal rights, outlawing homosexuality, or advocating for an antebellum ideal.



From the January/February 2024 issue: My father, my faith, and Donald Trump



But Hegseth's agenda at the Pentagon maps neatly onto some of those broader CREC positions. Since taking office in January, Hegseth has overseen efforts to erase tens of thousands of references to the heroism of service members who are not white men and attempted to force out transgender troops. He has also fired numerous senior officers who are either women or people of color without explaining why. And although Hegseth has walked back his past assertions that women shouldn't be in the military, he has simultaneously initiated a process that many see as a backdoor attempt to get women out of certain jobs. As one senior female officer put it to me, Hegseth is “sending a very clear message: ‘I don't want women to serve.'” At the very least, he is changing the culture. Several women in the military told me that they've noticed more looseness among their male colleagues in recent months, and in particular a willingness to disparage the idea of women serving in certain roles. Some service members who aren't Christian have similarly felt out of place under Hegseth's leadership.

 Rabbi Harold Robinson, a retired rear admiral and Jewish chaplain who also served as chairman of the National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces, told me that he's deeply worried that Hegseth is chipping away at the sense of cohesion among service members, which has up until now been one of the U.S. military's greatest strengths. During his 36 years of service, Robinson said, he never paused to wonder about the political or religious affiliation of the men and women who served with him. “All I had to worry about was, ‘Does he have my back? And do I have his back?'” Robinson told me. “When I can't do that anymore, then the institution is weaker.”

A deepfake president molds perception to serve his own interests.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Donald Trump's rise tracks the decline of that thing we once agreed to call reality. He cemented his place in the popular imagination with the advent of reality television, a genre that promised authenticity, even as the supposedly unscripted scenes were carefully manipulated by producers. On The Apprentice, which debuted in 2004, Trump was the embodiment of a culture just beginning to blur the line between what was real and what merely looked like it was.

In his second term as president, Trump—now with the help of artificial intelligence—is completing the revolution that made him. Over the weekend, he posted a video of himself piloting a fighter jet that dumps excrement on protesters. The clip was cartoonish, meant to amuse his followers and outrage his adversaries. This might seem like an ephemeral bit of trollish fun, but it is an example of an alarming pattern. Trump is provoking an epistemic collapse—cultivating the sense that every shard of once-dependable evidence is suspect. He is ushering in an era of distrust and confusion, in which the president molds perception to serve his own interests.

The deepfake is the most disconcerting frontier of the AI revolution. Fabricated clips are rendered with such precision that they can make anyone appear to say or do anything. This technology stands to upend a basic assumption of modern life. For more than a century, humans have treated film as the ultimate proof of reality, the mechanical witness that doesn't lie. Deepfakes exploit the instinct to trust what we see, counterfeits capable of warping emotion and implanting lies.

Fueled by his own delusions of grandeur—and the dark fantasies of revenge that animate him—Trump delights in doctored videos. During his first term, he tweeted footage spliced to exaggerate Nancy Pelosi's verbal stumbles. In his 2024 campaign, he shared an AI-generated image that suggested that Taylor Swift had endorsed him. And last month, he posted a fake clip of Chuck Schumer declaring, “Nobody likes Democrats anymore. We have no voters left because of all of our woke, trans bullshit.”

The president of the United States has legitimized deepfakes as a tool of political communication. His followers have taken the cue. Last week, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans released an AI-produced ad depicting Schumer speaking words that had appeared in a press report—not in any actual footage.

As deepfakes become the common currency of social media, citizens will justifiably begin to harbor doubts about any piece of video they encounter. But those doubts won't yield discernment. They will simply provide another justification for the confirmation of ideological bias. Partisans will accept video footage when it upholds their preconceptions; when it does not, dismissing it as potentially manipulated will become standard practice.

Jessica Yellin: The awkward adolescence of a media revolution

Members of Trump's administration are already deploying this tactic. Earlier this week, Politico revealed text messages attributed to Paul Ingrassia, the president's choice to lead the Office of Special Counsel, in which the nominee admitted to having a “Nazi streak” and unleashed a torrent of racist vituperation. (Ingrassia ultimately withdrew his nomination.) When confronted with the messages, his lawyer didn't deny their authenticity outright but instead implied that they might have been fabricated by AI.

That claim is baseless, but the strategy isn't. The public has largely lost faith in traditional arbiters of truth—mainstream media, religion, academia—and many citizens have cocooned themselves in the comfort of filter bubbles. Now they've begun to disagree about the most basic facts of shared existence, including the outcomes of an election.

At the beginning of the century, when The New York Times reported the scandalous behavior of a politician, leadership of both political parties would assume the allegation's truth, even if Republicans might have grouched about the paper's liberal bias. When the government released an employment report, the nation roundly regarded it as an objective reading of the economic weather.

But Trump is attempting to dismantle those institutional underpinnings of reality. In the 20th century, the federal government became the nation's most trusted producer of facts. It tracked the economy, the spread of disease, and countless other indicators that allowed businesses to plan and citizens to make informed choices. Trump is shattering that tradition of disinterested empiricism, bending even the information generated by the government to his will. That's why he has fired officials—such as the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics—who are in charge of producing objective data, and moved to replace them with loyalists. Agencies once meant to measure reality now risk becoming instruments that manufacture it.

Nancy A. Youssef: The last days of the Pentagon Press Corps

Trump is also taking steps to stifle the traditional media, which, however imperfectly, still strives to offer an objective account of events. Leveraging the government's power to reject mergers, he pressured Paramount, CBS's parent company, into settling a spurious lawsuit over an episode of 60 Minutes. His administration has sent a message to corporate media that an adversarial stance toward the president will carry financial risk. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has imposed such onerous restrictions on the press corps that reporters have effectively been expelled from the building, an effort to prevent them from producing the kind of independent reporting that might puncture the administration's self-serving version of events.

Years ago, Trump's most prominent ally in Silicon Valley offered a prophetic vision of this world. Elon Musk has entertained the idea that human existence is really just a computer simulation—a virtual realm so convincingly rendered that everything becomes malleable, that reshaping the world is merely a matter of rewriting a few lines of code. To adherents, this vision is not a nightmare but a kind of liberation. Truth can always be revised. Manipulation is the most basic fact of life. And Trump has assumed the role of the master programmer.

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Electric bills were already rising. AI data centers are making it worse.

If you've noticed your electricity bill is higher than normal recently, you're not alone. Power is getting more expensive everywhere, outpacing inflation. One major culprit? The flurry of new data centers being built to meet demand from the AI sector.

To find out more, I asked my colleague Umair Irfan, who covers energy policy, for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

What's been going on with energy prices lately?

Electricity prices have been going up pretty dramatically over the past year. In some places, they're rising by double-digit percentages, and they're projected to rise even further. We're talking about prices that are paid by consumers, so this is actually showing up on people's power bills, which is why it's getting a lot of attention.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

There's a couple reasons behind this. One is that electricity prices were kept artificially low during the Covid-19 pandemic, because the electricity industry is heavily regulated. A lot of regulators were under public pressure to prevent the utilities from raising prices because we were already dealing with inflation and other cost-of-living issues. Now some of those restrictions have become uncorked, and we're seeing a rebound.

On top of that, all of the inputs for electricity have gotten a lot more expensive. Materials costs are rising in general, and then the Trump administration's tariffs on things like steel and aluminum are making it harder to get the hardware to do things like build power lines or even replace existing power lines. Fuel prices for coal and natural gas are pretty volatile, and there's been a rise in natural gas prices. Natural gas is the number one way we produce electricity here in the US.

We're also seeing a pretty big increase in overall energy demand for the first time in a very long time. For the past 20-odd years, we've been seeing efficiency counteract energy demand increases, and so our overall energy demand has held fairly flat. Just in the past couple of years, we've seen a big increase in electricity usage, and that's driven by this proliferation of data centers, particularly those there to power the AI industry.

You have a big story out about how these data centers are contributing to the price spike, in some cases even when they're not built. What's happening there?

Just last week, the public advocate for the state of Maryland sent a letter to the grid operator for the region, telling them that they really need to rein in energy speculation, because it's starting to raise people's prices.

The way that works is that in order to build a data center, you have to procure a certain amount of power in order to make sure that you can actually keep it running. And so what you're seeing is, these tech companies are going to different utilities and shopping around and asking them, What price can you give me for this quantity of electricity? And how soon?

It turns out that in some cases, these tech companies are shopping to multiple utilities, and those utilities, in turn, are telling the grid operator, Hey, we're going to need this much electricity in the next few years. The concern is that they're double counting, because these tech companies are going to multiple utilities and multiple jurisdictions telling them that they're going to need this much electricity, and they're just window-shopping at the moment, but utilities are treating these as real bids.

The other thing is that we're not entirely sure that a lot of these data centers are going to be built. There are some pretty wild estimates for how many more data centers we're going to need. It's not clear that the current trends we're seeing are going to continue.

All that means is that you're going to be building a lot of infrastructure to support data centers whose demand may not be there to actually pay for that infrastructure. And what that means, ultimately, is that normal customers will end up holding the bag.

This is in Maryland, but the grid operator covers much of the East Coast. We've got two big gubernatorial races coming up in Virginia and New Jersey. Is that coming up on the campaign trail?

It has definitely become a big issue in the New Jersey governor's race. Both sides are blaming policies from the other party for raising energy prices. The Republican in the race is blaming renewable energy for driving up electricity costs, and the Democrat is blaming the Trump administration for canceling a lot of incentives for more renewable energy to be on the grid, as well as the infrastructure to support it. Renewable energy is right now the cheapest and fastest way to add electricity to the power grid, and by taking that off the table, you're taking out one of the cheapest and easiest ways to bring more electricity onto the market.

In Virginia, the added complication is that it's home to one of the largest concentrations of data centers in the world. Loudoun County, just outside of DC, has what's called Datacenter Alley, where a huge chunk of internet traffic goes through; it's also home to the largest concentration of hyperscale data centers for powering AI technologies. This is a very big, energy-hungry sector, and it's a contributor to the local economy, but it also requires a lot of water, a lot of electricity, and now there's been pushback. Many customers in Virginia and in neighboring states like West Virginia have started to protest against data centers because they're concerned about electricity prices and other environmental costs being imposed by them.

What can consumers expect to happen with electricity prices going forward?

In the near term, electricity prices are likely to continue to go up. There doesn't seem to be an easy out, because all the same factors that are driving up electricity prices continue to be in place.

But the thing to remember is that electricity is a subset of energy spending. If you look at the overall energy picture, consumers are actually likely to end up saving money on household energy over time, and that's because we're switching from fossil fuels to electricity. The biggest share of this is switching from gasoline cars to electric cars: As we connect more electric cars to the power grid, they are going to use more electricity, but electric cars are more efficient than gasoline cars, so the overall energy we use per household will eventually start to decline. We'll see that with other appliances, like stoves and furnaces, as we switch to electricity. Electricity usage will increase, but the overall energy footprint will decrease. And we can expect over the middle and long term for people to actually start to save money, provided that these trends continue.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Struan, a 36-year-old consultant and résumé writer based in Scotland. Struan went viral when he worked at an Apple store in Vancouver, using his birth name, Sam Sung. He left the job due to a career switch. His words have been edited for length and clarity.

Growing up, I received a few silly comments or playground chants about my name, Sam Sung, but nothing like what happened in my early 20s.

During that time, I worked at an Apple store in Glasgow, Scotland. There were friendly jokes about Sam Sung working for Apple, but it wasn't a big deal. Then I moved to Vancouver and started working at an Apple retail store there.

I'll never forget the moment I went viral. I was working at my other part-time job, and my phone started ringing like crazy. I thought a family member had died. I peeked and saw a text from someone saying I'd gone viral on Reddit, and they sent me a link.

It was 2012, and I had never heard of Reddit. I wasn't on social media, apart from LinkedIn, so I thought the link was a scam and ignored it.

A few hours later, I received several missed calls from the Apple store. Someone had posted a picture of my Apple business card online, and it actually went viral. I was terrified.

When I called Apple back, they asked if I knew about the post.

I had just moved to a new country. I was early in my career, and my first thought was that someone had posted online about me, involving work, and I was going to get fired. Looking back, it's funny because I probably had the most job security I've ever had. If Apple had fired me, it would've caused even more commotion.

On my first shift back, a reporter came in to talk to me, and after that, Apple pulled me off the shop floor for a little while. Colleagues were told not to identify me when people came in and asked. Soon after, I lost access to my business cards.

People came in and called asking if Sam Sung worked at the store, and I just pretended it wasn't me. I have a Scottish accent, and assumptions about what I would sound like based on my appearance meant that they didn't recognize me on the phone.

It only lasted a few months, and then the commotion died down, but I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed.

I left Apple in 2013. I was ready to move on from retail and start a new career in recruitment.

In 2014, I auctioned off one of my old business cards and other pieces of my old uniform for charity. There was a lot of excitement. Children's Wish, the charity I was supporting, received an uptick in donations around the auction. It wasn't major by any means, but we ultimately auctioned the card off for over $2,500. That was the best part of this experience.

I was pretty involved in the charity, which was why I did it. It was nice to take a moment that felt so personally terrifying, even though it was just a silly joke, and do something good with it. I did two smaller auctions later, after I adopted a new name.

I hadn't considered adopting a new name before I went viral, but that moment changed everything. It's not like being known for doing great work or being a philanthropist; it was just an online joke.

Also, Samsung, the Big Tech company, has its own brand. I was early in my career, trying to establish myself, and from a social media and email perspective, all the handles were taken. This was especially true once I moved into recruitment, where an online presence and professional brand matter. As I thought about it more, it made sense to adopt a new name.

I had already moved on from working at Apple and begun a new job search. I wanted to put this behind me. After some consideration, I chose to adopt the last name Struan because it's the name of one of my favorite places in Scotland — a village on the Isle of Skye.

Even though it's been over 10 years, people still call me Sam Sung in their phones. They just refuse to change it, including my sister. To be honest, my parents don't care too much.

The only people who use Struan are those who only know me by that name. Many of my friends, who I knew before I adopted a different professional surname, pay no attention to it.

Make no mistake: No one really recognizes me, and that's exactly how I want it. But sometimes, if it comes up in conversation that I worked at Apple, the moment arrives, and they'll be like, ""Oh my god, are you that guy?""

The reality is that I adopted a new name because I didn't want my name to be a joke, which it had already been. But I also changed my name because I was afraid of discrimination, having a non-anglicized last name.

Studies have shown that your name can influence the number of opportunities you have and the likelihood of receiving interviews. I don't have a before-and-after data point on the opportunities I received once I started using a new name, but I know the rules: having a certain name means better career opportunities.

I'm glad I adopted a new professional name, and I'm not sure if I would have if the viral moment hadn't happened, but I wish I could tell my younger self to see it as a funny thing. Not to stress out about my job because it was fine, and maybe even go on LinkedIn and thank people for reaching out instead of deactivating my account.

I wish I'd just chilled out a bit about it and been less worried about job security and potential work opportunities, and enjoyed it for what it was.

Just a few years ago, housing markets in the warm, sunny parts of the US looked, well … warm and sunny. In the halcyon days of 2021 and 2022, cities like Austin, Tampa, Phoenix, and Atlanta attracted swarms of movers. Home listings reliably drew multiple offers above the asking price, and buyers plunked down all-cash offers to fast-track their purchases.

Flash forward to today, and the big ""winners"" of the work-from-home reshuffle — metros that drew hordes of footloose workers and disaffected coastal dwellers — have turned into losers. Fewer people are moving to so-called Zoomtowns. Home listings are piling up on the market. Prices are dropping. The anxiety has shifted from buyers trying to elbow their way in to sellers just trying to offload their properties. A new report by the real estate analytics firm Parcl Labs, shared exclusively with Business Insider, shows that home sellers in the lower half of the US, also known as the Sun Belt, are the most desperate in the country.

Housing markets in the Midwest and Northeast, on the other hand, are going strong. Inventory in those parts of the country remains tight, and prices are up. Homes are selling at a brisker pace than in the rest of the US. These cities didn't garner much attention during the pandemic (how many glowing headlines did you see about Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee, or Detroit?), but sellers there have quietly held onto their bargaining power. By practically any measure, the country's real estate leaderboard has flipped.

""We are in a two-tiered housing market,"" Mike Simonsen, the chief economist at the brokerage firm Compass and the cofounder of Altos Research, tells me. ""It's really stark.""

At first glance, this might seem like a simple tale of supply: Builders flocked to the Sun Belt and put lots of shovels in the ground, setting the stage for an inevitable drop in prices when all those new houses hit the market. Sure, that's part of it. But this is also a story about even bigger shifts in the labor market, migration trends, and affordability — why people are (or aren't) moving, and where they're choosing to put down stakes. The Sun Belt isn't drawing movers like it used to, while the Midwest and Northeast are holding onto more people than they did during those peak pandemic years. Even more troubling, many Americans aren't moving at all. They're stuck in place, scared to quit their jobs or trade their cheap mortgage rates for more expensive ones. With no signs of a reversal on the horizon, the new housing-market winners could stay on top for years to come.

Americans move in predictable patterns. Over the past few decades, the Northeast and Midwest hemorrhaged people to the Sun Belt, where jobs were plentiful, the weather balmier, and homes cheaper. Between mid-2018 and mid-2019, the last full year of Census data before the pandemic set in, the Northeast lost a net 294,000 residents to other parts of the country, while the Midwest lost nearly 162,000. The South, on the other hand, gained almost 408,000 people, and the West saw an uptick of 48,000.

""We've been moving from the North to the South for many years,"" Simonsen tells me. ""We build the houses in the South. We sell our homes in the North.""

Housing demand surged early in the pandemic — the country's homeowning ranks swelled by a whopping 2.2 million people between the first quarter of 2020 and the same point in 2022, an analysis by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies shows. But for all the talk of upheaval, movers more or less stuck to those pre-pandemic flight patterns — just at warp speed. People kept migrating from big-city centers to the suburbs and from the North to the South. Sun Belt states, including Florida, Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina, experienced the largest population gains from domestic migration between mid-2020 and mid-2021, per a Harvard analysis of Census data. The Dallas metro, for example, gained around 63,000 people from other parts of the country that year, a huge jump from just 19,000 the year prior. Phoenix, Tampa, Austin, and Charlotte recorded similar increases. Expensive states with large urban areas, including California, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts, saw the biggest losses.

While migration may follow long-held trends, the idea of a ""national"" housing market is really a myth — every city, town, even ZIP code, has its own quirks. The chaotic reshuffle of the pandemic's early days, however, resulted in the closest thing we've seen to local markets around the country moving in the same direction: Prices went up, and inventory went down. Even if some states saw far more new arrivals than others, buyers all over the place jumped into the market in search of cheap mortgage rates, more space, and the promise of generational wealth, even if the move was just down the street. This led to higher prices practically across the board (with the exception of big cities that lost a ton of people, like San Francisco). Now, though, the country is splitting into two distinct markets. If someone's looking to sell a home these days, their prospects look a lot different depending on whether they're in Boise or Buffalo.

In the Sun Belt and Mountain West, homebuilders saw the demand signals from the national moving moment and got busy. ""There's a herd mentality, for sure,"" says Ryan McKeveny, a managing director at the housing research firm Zelman, a Walker & Dunlop company. Homebuilders, he tells me, ""all gravitate to the same exact markets."" The Census estimates that the housing stock in the South region surged by almost 3.3 million between 2020 and 2024, compared to just 750,000 in the Midwest and a measly 483,000 in the Northeast. Despite the rush to break ground, those homes didn't materialize all at once. It usually takes a couple of years for new homes to crop up. In the meantime, prices in the Sun Belt spiked.

Take Austin. The Texas capital was the fastest-growing large metropolitan area from 2020 to 2022, Census data shows, adding a net 120,000 people for a population increase of 5.3%. Even with a surge in homebuilding, supply simply could not keep up: The typical home price in Austin jumped by more than 60% in that same time period, Zillow found. Eventually, though, the builders made up some ground. By last fall, Austin's for-sale housing stock had climbed by more than 76,000 units, or 8.34%, since 2020, Parcl Labs found, a monumental feat for a city that large. At the same time these new units came onto the market, however, the flow of people to Austin started to abate. Net domestic migration totaled less than 14,000 from mid-2023 to mid-2024, still positive but well below the high of 44,000 in 2021. Buyers were also pulling back in the face of higher mortgage rates, which translate into vastly more expensive monthly payments. Fewer buyers, more homes up for sale — you can imagine what happens next. Austin home values have dropped more than 23% from their peak in the summer of 2022, Zillow data shows.

A recent Zelman analysis shows that pandemic-era hot spots like Denver, Austin, Memphis, Tampa, and Dallas have seen big upticks in active inventory, or the number of homes available for sale, while median prices are down year over year. In Denver, for example, inventory is up almost 50% from the same point in 2019, while the median price is down slightly from a year ago. Dallas prices are down almost 2% year-over-year, while inventory is up more than 20% from 2019. Net migration to Florida and Texas remains positive, according to a Zelman analysis, but is lower than in 2019. The Dallas metro added just 25,000 people via domestic migration in the 12-month period ending June 2024, down from 91,000 a couple of years prior. Tampa's increase of 11,000 was a fraction of its 54,000-person gain during the height of the relocation bonanza.

A comedown from the pandemic-era frenzy may not come as a surprise. More interesting are the markets where sellers undeniably have the upper hand. These metros in the Northeast and Midwest mostly weren't subject to the huge price run-ups that were commonplace in the Sun Belt, but they didn't get a ton of new supply from homebuilders, either — those guys were focused on carving out new home communities down south. Inventory levels in places like Buffalo, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Cleveland are still below their 2019 watermarks, per Zelman's analysis, while prices have increased by anywhere from 4% to 8% compared to a year ago. People aren't exactly rushing to move to these areas — it's just that the decades of migration losses have seriously slowed. The Cleveland metro lost just 3,500 people on net in 2024, compared to nearly 10,000 in 2021. Same story in Milwaukee. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metro notched a slight increase last year after bleeding a whopping 14,000 residents via net domestic migration in 2021.

The North-to-South movement still holds, but the North is losing fewer people, and the South isn't gaining like it once was. The most recent numbers, for the yearlong period ending in mid-2024, show net domestic migration to the South was down almost 38% compared to the first year of the pandemic. Domestic migration to the Midwest, on the other hand, is up about 60% in that same period, though it's still negative in absolute terms. The Northeast's net loss was down to 192,000 in the latest tally, compared to a loss of 390,000 at the height of the pandemic. With the migration tide receding, sellers in once-hot metros are getting real. In Denver, Charlotte, Jacksonville, and a smattering of other Sun Belt markets, more than half of single-family homes for sale have seen a price cut, Parcl Labs data shows. In the Boston, Philadelphia, and Buffalo metros, the share of listings in that bucket drops to fewer than a third.

That's just one metric. To gauge sellers' desperation these days, Parcl Labs created what it calls the Motivated Sellers Index, which combines four factors: the number of price cuts on home listings, the time in between those cuts, the size of the price decreases, and the length of time homes are spending on the market. The higher the score, the greater the homeowners' urgency to sell. The lower half of the US, with the exception of much of California, is awash in high scores, indicating sellers are ceding negotiating power to buyers. Same goes for much of the West. The Midwest and Northeast, on the other hand, registered some of the lowest scores in the nation: Sellers there are sitting pretty by comparison.

""We have declining home prices in many of these pandemic-winning housing markets,"" Jason Lewris, a cofounder of Parcl Labs, tells me. ""The sellers in many of those markets are very motivated to get out.""

That index, Lewris says, is a ""pretty good proxy for where home prices may go."" In other words, an abundance of motivated sellers today likely spells more price drops in the future. If homeowners are dropping their prices to meet the market, it shows they're not just testing the waters and hoping to get their dream amount.

In the summer of 2024, sellers appeared content to hold out for top dollar. This past summer, though, marked a notable uptick in seller motivation, says Lucy Ferguson, another executive at Parcl Labs.

""Not only is there more stuff on the market, but there's a lot more price cutting,"" Ferguson tells me. ""It's kind of like sellers meeting reality. That's the big theme.""

With mortgage rates still well above their pandemic-era lows, millions of households are playing the waiting game. Existing homeowners are unwilling (or unable) to give up their plum mortgage rates, so they're delaying moves that they'd otherwise be making. Renters are hanging tight until the affordability math tilts in their favor. This helps explain why the relative level of demand is so much higher across the Midwest than somewhere like Texas or Florida. When people are stuck in place, the typical migration patterns break down. The South adds fewer new buyers, and the North holds onto more of them. The result is weaker price growth — or even falling prices — in places that were once dependable strongholds of rising home values.

""If I'm a young family in suburban Chicago or upstate New York, I would have bought my house from the guy who moved to Orlando,"" Simonsen tells me. ""But they didn't sell, and I still need to buy.""

The labor market also points to a stuck-in-place economy. Unemployment is low, but hiring is way down. The ""quits rate,"" or percentage of workers voluntarily walking away from their jobs, is lagging. People are wary of making big life moves that could leave them in the lurch if things go wrong. To look for signs of thawing in the housing market, Simonsen tells me he'll be watching for a pickup in the quits rate — if people are confident that they can leave their job and find a new one, it's a good sign that they're up for other major changes like a cross-country move. Until then, expect this reversal of the Covid-era winners and losers to hold.

""In a lot of these markets where home prices are kind of flat to lower, I don't exactly see a reason why all of a sudden home prices are going to reaccelerate meaningfully,"" McKeveny, the researcher at Zelman, tells me.

The Sun Belt is still a long way from ""market crash"" territory — even places like Austin are still adding people on a net basis, albeit at a much slower pace. But the price cuts represent a serious reality check. With the rise of Zoomtowns now a distant memory, buyers across the South and Mountain West benefit from more bargaining power than they've had in years. Their counterparts up north, on the other hand, still face stiff competition and rising prices. You can count on the pendulum to swing in the other direction once people start moving again. In the meantime, places like Cleveland and Buffalo will continue to enjoy prime position atop the housing-market heap.

The National Football League on Wednesday approved the purchase of a 10% stake in the New York Giants by Julia Koch in a transaction that values the team at $10.3 billion, according to two people who are close to the deal but not authorized to speak publicly. The deal marks the highest valuation placed on an NFL team for a team sale.

The Giants are currently owned by the Mara and Tisch families. CNBC broke the news in May that Koch was looking to buy a limited partnership piece of the Giants.

The league also approved the sale of two other limited partner stakes, according to a person who is close to the approvals but does not have permission from the NFL to speak about them publicly. The person confirmed that Dean Metropoulos and private equity firm Sixth Street Partners bought an 8% stake in the New England Patriots in a deal that values the team at $9 billion, and that Fortress Investment Group Executive Chairman Pete Briger Jr. picked up a 3.2% stake in the San Francisco 49ers in a deal that values the team at about $8.6 billion.

All three limited partner sales had to be approved by at least three-quarters of the NFL's owners.

As CNBC reported last month, the proceeds from the limited partner sale of the Patriots will go on the team's balance sheet. A person who is familiar with the deal but not authorized to speak about it publicly said the post-money valuation for the Patriots is $9.5 billion. The York family, which owns the 49ers, also sold a 6.2% stake in the team in May at an $8.6 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with that deal.

Last month, a small piece of the Chicago Bears was sold at an $8.9 billion valuation; that deal set the previous record for a valuation in the sale of a minority stake in an NFL team.

In CNBC's NFL valuations published Sept. 4, the Giants were valued at $10.5 billion, Patriots at $9.25 billion, Bears at $8.9 billion and 49ers at $8.6 billion. The last control purchase of an NFL team was when Josh Harris paid $6.05 billion to buy the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder in 2023.

One reason NFL team values have been going up sharply is the expectation of much higher media rights. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC's Alex Sherman last month that the league could begin renegotiating its 11-year, $111 billion media rights deals as soon as next year.  The league's current media rights are significantly undervalued in the context of the NFL's dominant television ratings, according to Nielsen, and the new media rights deals for the NBA and NHL. According to the NFL, the league is averaging 18.5 million viewers, television and digital, per game this year, the highest average through week five since 2010 and the second-highest average on record.

Another reason values are escalating is the introduction of private equity investors a year ago. Private equity firms are showing a great interest in buying into the NFL — the biggest and most profitable sports league in the world — and are boosting values by setting a floor on valuations and erasing concerns other limited partners may have had over liquidity, CNBC reported.

Bitcoin may dominate the crypto headlines, but the real growth story of the next five years will be stablecoins, the digital dollars that are modernizing the way money moves around the globe.

Yes, the original cryptocurrency is rapidly becoming an ideal non-sovereign global store of value, with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion, but stablecoins serve a transactional purpose and thus have already vastly surpassed bitcoin in daily transactions. On October 6, bitcoin's 24-hour volume was $63.8 billion, compared to stablecoins' $146 billion — more than double the transaction volume.

There's a simple reason for this. Stablecoins aren't just an investible asset to hold, they have real-world utility. Stablecoins are powering a lot more than just DeFi. They are increasingly being used as a global currency powering payments and cross-border money flows. Moreover, with artificial intelligence integrating into everyday life and soon into commerce, stablecoins are likely to be the currency of machine-to-machine transactions by AI agents.

Bitcoin's uses are growing as wrapped BTC and emerging Bitcoin Layer 2 networks seek to integrate it into DeFi and enable dApps to be built on top of it — but fundamentally, bitcoin will remain a store of value. Other blockchains do a much better job of providing a decentralized, smart-contract-programmable platform on which to build the future of finance. Stablecoins are purpose-built to offer a better solution for global payments than the traditional, centralized status quo (SWIFT, ACH and credit card payments). As mainstream adoption grows, stablecoins will then capture the bulk of day-to-day payment use.

Look at Venezuela, where USDT has become the backbone of daily economic activity. With rampant inflation — the IMF puts it at 180% — and a short supply of physical dollars, this certainly is an extreme example, but it provides a direct use case showing how easy it is to pay for groceries or a haircut in stablecoins.

Stablecoins are rapidly gaining traction because they do what bitcoin never could at scale — facilitate instant, peer‐to‐peer payments. Bitcoin's ten‐minute block times, network fees and volatility make it ill-suited for everyday transactions, while stablecoins settle in seconds, cost pennies (in some cases under a cent), and preserve value stability.

The success of stablecoins isn't about speculation but about efficient utility — they are quietly becoming the most-used form of digital currency around the world. Stablecoins are quickly disrupting the global remittance market, a sector worth around $780 billion annually, by offering faster, lower-cost cross-border transfers.

They are also starting to disrupt the payments market, as giants like Stripe, Visa, PayPal and other fintechs incorporate stablecoin payments that are faster, cheaper, usable 24/7 and globally accessible. And as stablecoins are incorporated by fintechs and payments processors, most people will have no idea that behind the scenes, they are using blockchain rails.

The current U.S. administration has made very clear that it sees stablecoins as a financial innovation, vital to keeping the dollar as the world's reserve currency. It has put its weight behind them, evidenced by the passage of the GENIUS Act as the first step in this process.

While agencies draft the regulatory ‘rules of the road' for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act, the devil will be in the details; how reserve assets are defined, which entities are permitted to issue dollar-backed tokens, what redemption rights users are guaranteed and whether these digital dollars can move freely across public and private blockchains. These choices will determine whether U.S.-regulated stablecoins can compete globally or be buried under conflicting oversight. This administration must ensure it enables dollar-backed stablecoins to dominate on the world stage, or risk losing control of the future of money.

I think that in the short-term, for all the reasons listed above, the total minted value of stablecoins could exceed the market cap of bitcoin.

Oops, something went wrong

Gold (GC=F) prices extended declines on Wednesday following the worst intraday drop in more than 12 years, putting a pause on one of this year's hottest rallies.

Futures for the yellow metal fell more than 1% to hover near $4,060 per troy ounce after dropping 5.5% in the prior session as investors locked in profits and the US dollar strengthened.

Prior to the sell-off, gold had climbed a whopping 65% year to date on strong global central bank demand and investor flight to the safe-haven asset as a hedge against the decline of fiat currencies in the so-called debasement trade. Wall Street strategists had warned of overbought conditions.

""We have highlighted the potential for volatility given the scale and speed of the rally, but we believe precious metals should remain supported by a combination of macroeconomic, fundamental, and momentum-driven factors,"" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for the Americas region at UBS, wrote on Wednesday.

More expected rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, along with increasing demand for precious metals and ongoing political uncertainty, should remain a tailwind for the commodity going into the first quarter of 2026, the strategist said. She noted that real interest rates in the US could fall below zero, given sticky inflation, and that could make the US dollar less appealing to investors, thereby boosting flows into precious metals.

""We continue to view gold as an effective portfolio diversifier, with further gains toward our upside case of USD 4,700/oz still possible should adverse macro and political developments emerge,"" Hoffmann-Burchardi wrote.

The decline in gold could signal rotational opportunities for bitcoin (BTC-USD), which has been trying to stabilize after a volatile two-week stretch, Fundstrat digital asset strategist Sean Farrell said Wednesday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency declined more than 3% on Wednesday to hover near $108,000 per token, reversing a three-day recovery.

""I don't think it's a coincidence that the second we saw gold roll over, we saw bitcoin bounce pretty violently,"" Farrell said on Tuesday evening.

Bitcoin rallied from around $107,000 last Friday to a session high of $113,000 on Tuesday, giving renewed optimism that the recent cryptocurrency rout may be in the rearview.

The strategist noted that over the past several years, both assets have had a lead-lag relationship.

""Gold generally leads, it peaks, rolls over, consolidates. Bitcoin follows,"" Farrell said. ""We'll see if this is the early sign of a rotational trade. If this is not the start, I still think it's going to happen at some point.""

Bitcoin has risen roughly 15% year to date while gold futures have climbed 55% over the same period.

                            Nigel Farage has become a frequent speaker on the crypto confeerence circuit, in a bid to position Reform as the U.K.'s pro-crypto party. | Credit: Pexels                         


Key Takeaways

Taking a leaf out of Donald Trump's playbook, Nigel Farage is making crypto a central component of his pitch to voters.

Speaking in London on Tuesday, Oct. 22, the Reform UK leader said his party is “the only hope” for the U.K. crypto sector.

Farage's affinity for crypto is well established, and he has become a frequent speaker on the digital asset conference circuit, appearing twice in London in the past week.

During his most recent address at Zebu Live, the Reform leader was critical of the approach taken by the current government and their Tory predecessors.

“We are the only hope [for] this industry,” he claimed.

Many of Farage's talking points were familiar. He appealed to industry gripes about the state of U.K. crypto policy. He was critical of the Bank of England's proposal to limit stablecoin holdings, and he called on the FCA to pursue a more light-touch approach to regulation that doesn't hamper innovation.

Touching on another industry favorite, Farage urged the U.K. government to use BTC seized by law enforcement “as the beginning of a Bitcoin reserve.”

In another echo of Trump's crypto strategy, the Reform leader was also fiercely critical of central bank digital currencies, which he positioned as part of a creeping digital surveillance regime tied to the government's mandatory Digital ID plans.

Farage's views on Bitcoin and CBDCs are partly ideological, rooted in Reform's broader advocacy for free market policies in the Thatcherite tradition. But speaking on Tuesday, he also reflected on his personal experience of being debanked by Coutts in 2023.

For Farage, the incident highlighted the true value of a digital currency that exists outside of the traditional financial system

“I realized after being debanked that [crypto] is the ultimately freedom,” he said.

Making a direct appeal to Bitcoin's libertarian ethos, Farage emphasized “being in control of your own money” and “making your own decisions.”","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

 The $19 billion market crash may be a buying opportunity as dust settles in the coming weeks, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview. 

Bitcoin may still be on track to reach $200,000 by the end of the year, even after a record $19 billion market liquidation and renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, according to Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick.

The crypto market experienced a record $19 billion liquidation event on the weekend of Oct. 10, which caused Bitcoin's (BTC) price to dip to a four-month low of $104,000 by Friday, Cointelegraph reported at the time.

As the dust settles after the massive liquidation event, investors may see it as a buying opportunity. This dynamic may fuel a Bitcoin rally to $200,000 by the end of 2025, Kendrick said. Despite the volatility, he remains confident that Bitcoin will rebound as markets stabilize.

“My official forecast is $200,000 by the end of the year,” he told Cointelegraph during an exclusive interview at the 2025 European Blockchain Convention in Barcelona. 

Despite the “Trump noise around tariffs,” Kendrick said he still sees a price rise “well north of $150,000” in the bear case for the end of the year, assuming the US Federal Reserve continues cutting interest rates to meet market expectations.

Bitcoin fell 6% over the past month and traded at about $108,260 at the time of writing, Cointelegraph data shows.

Kendrick said the aftermath of the liquidation event may take several weeks to settle, but investors may soon view the sell-off as another accumulation phase.

This could ultimately become the next significant “buying opportunity” for investors, he said.

Kendrick predicted continued inflows to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the primary driver of Bitcoin's price momentum for the rest of the year.

The current dip will prepare us for another leg up, “mostly on the back of the ETF inflows,” Kendrick said, adding:

Gold's recent all-time highs will also translate into more momentum for Bitcoin, as its safe-haven asset narrative reemerges, he added.

Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sharp rebound in flows this week after several days of politically driven outflows. On Tuesday, the funds saw $477 million in net positive inflows, according to Farside Investors, breaking a four-day losing streak.

In a February interview, Kendrick predicted that Bitcoin could surge to $500,000 by the time Trump concludes his second term in 2028, Cointelegraph reported.

 Consumers deserve the choice to earn yield on stablecoins, not be boxed into earning interest only through banks, Kraken co-CEO Dave Ripley said. 

Kraken boss David Ripley has fired back against a senior executive of the American Bankers Association, who argued that stablecoins yield is a “detriment” to banks' abilities to support their community. 

ABA's senior vice president of innovation and strategy, Brooke Ybarra, said if major crypto exchanges such as Kraken or Coinbase were allowed to pay interest on payment stablecoins, it would “fly in the face” of the idea that stablecoins should be used for payments and not as a store of value.

“A detriment to who?” Ripley said. “Consumers should have the freedom to choose where they hold value and the most efficient way to send that value.” 

Ripley argued that banks have been earning fees on customers' assets without passing on benefits back to them, adding:

Others in the crypto industry echoed Ripley's criticism. Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Blockchain Association, said, “Big Banks are ruthlessly targeting our friends at @Coinbase and @KrakenFX to protect their turf.”

“Translation: competition's winning,” Spuller said. 

Some stablecoins offer up to 5% on deposits on certain crypto platforms, a far more attractive rate than the US national average savings rate of just 0.6% and still above the best offered high-interest rate of 4%, according to Bankrate data.

Solana developer Voss said, “Bring on the competition, it's a capitalist world anyway.”

The comments come just months after US President Donald Trump signed off on the long-awaited GENIUS Act, a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins that signals their potential move toward mainstream adoption.

Stablecoins may potentially be safer than deposits held at commercial banks, according to Haun Ventures, general partner Diogo Monica, who said in June that many stablecoins are backed by reserves held at globally systemically important banks or in short-term US Treasury bills, which he says are more secure than commercial bank deposits.

Outside the US, tensions between the crypto industry and traditional banks have also risen recently.

According to a recent survey from Binance Australia, crypto users in Australia are still facing banking barriers when engaging with exchanges and other crypto businesses.

Matt Poblocki, general manager of Binance's Australian and New Zealand operations, told Cointelegraph that seamless access to financial services directly affects participation, confidence and trust in the market, introducing barriers that can slow adoption and limit growth.

 Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong credited the company's acquisition of Iron Fish in March to drive the effort, though there are questions about how private the transactions really will be. 

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said his team is moving closer toward making private stablecoin transactions possible on the Ethereum layer-2 Base, which could bring a much-needed boost to privacy on public blockchains.

“Base is building private transactions,” Armstrong said in a post to X on Tuesday, noting that Coinbase acquired crypto privacy platform Iron Fish in March to deliver on that mission.

Many respondents asked whether the privacy solution would mandate Know Your Client checks; however, Armstrong didn't address those concerns, stating that more details would be shared soon.

Some seek privacy-shielded crypto transactions as they protect users' financial data, shield transactions from public scrutiny, and lower the risk of being targeted by hackers or scammers. 

However, some of the crypto industry's leading privacy innovators have been fiercely prosecuted, including Tornado Cash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, as well as the Samourai Wallet founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill.

However, Base's transactions may not be fully private if they are based on Iron Fish's current implementation. 

According to Iron Fish's website, the platform uses zero-knowledge proofs and “view keys” to keep transactions private, while still allowing data to be disclosed if a tax authority or other enforcement agency requests information.

Users receive these view keys when they create an account with Iron Fish, allowing them to pass on “read-only access” information to authorities should they come knocking on their door.

Iron Fish's ZK-proofs assist this effort by letting users prove something without revealing all of the information, just the necessary elements.

Related: Privacy is ‘constant battle' between blockchain stakeholders and state

Iron Fish's crypto privacy solution leverages crosschain bridge ChainPort, which also employs a real-time threat detection system to ensure that “only clean funds” enter the Iron Fish network.

Iron Fish already offers privacy solutions on over 20 blockchains, including Base, which enables a privacy version of wrapped USDC (USDC) through ChainPort.

Google Explores Quantum Chaos on Its Most Powerful Quantum Computer Chip

“Quantum echoes” rippling through Google's quantum computer chip Willow could lead to advances in molecular chemistry and the physics of black holes

By Dan Garisto edited by Lee Billings

Google's Willow quantum computer chip.

Google Quantum AI

Quantum computers are still in their infancy. Presently limited to 100 or so error-prone qubits, the quantum equivalents to classical bits, they are far from supreme calculating machines that are capable of exactly simulating chemical reactions and more. Quantum theorists and experimenters are working within these constraints to find feasible tasks for their devices to show an advantage over the performance of classical computers.

Researchers at Google have spent years developing one such task: measuring how quantum information gets jumbled up over time. Quantum information—such as the state of a qubit—can become spread out and disordered, a little like how a shouted word becomes indistinct as it travels over long distances.

“Different systems scramble things in different ways,” says Shenglong Xu, a quantum information theorist at Texas A&M University, who was not involved with the Google research. “How the information gets processed tells us about the nature of the system.” Insight from scrambling could even provide details that would allow quantum technologists to achieve precise molecular simulations with their machines.

In a preprint paper, posted online in June, the Google team reported the most in-depth measurement of information scrambling to date, which was achieved with their 105-qubit Willow chip. They repeatedly scrambled the information, made a small adjustment and reversed the process, unscrambling the information. (Google dubbed the protocol “Quantum Echoes,” a reference to the echo of the repetitive unscrambling process.) The team's measurement was so complex, in fact, that using current algorithms a classical supercomputer would be far slower than Willow. The results were published today in the journal Nature.

The Nature paper's three referees were broadly positive about the technical accomplishment in anonymized peer review reports that Google shared with Scientific American. One of these reviewers praised the work as “truly impressive” for “experimentally accessing such subtle quantum interference effects.” But the referees split over the degree to which Google had demonstrated bona fide quantum advantage.

Previous demonstrations of quantum advantage have been surpassed as classical algorithms have improved, so onlookers are cautious. The Google team's achievement “seems like it is beyond what we can do right now using classical methods,” Xu says. “It's a very interesting contribution to the field.”

Chaos is common to the classical world because classical systems can be highly sensitive to small changes in their initial conditions. In the canonical metaphorical example, a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil, and the cascading sequence of atmospheric perturbations leads to a tornado in Texas.

So what happens to the proverbial butterfly in a quantum system? “There's always going to be small [quantum] fluctuations,” says Pieter Claeys, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, who was not involved with the new study. Like the classical butterfly, these fluctuations can also have downstream effects on the scrambling of information in a quantum system.

To study how quantum information gets scrambled, researchers use an unscrambling trick called an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). The OTOC protocol goes something like this: take a solved Rubik's cube and scramble it with a set sequence of twists. Then add an additional twist and perform the first sequence in reverse. The first and last processes—the scrambling and unscrambling—effectively cancel out letting you examine the effects of the twist in the middle, appropriately called the “butterfly operator.” (This is sometimes misleadingly referred to as “time reversal.” Time does not really reverse itself in this process any more than it does when you say the alphabet backward.)

In 2021 Google demonstrated the OTOC protocol on its Sycamore chip—a more error-prone, 53-qubit predecessor to Willow. In a press call discussing the new Willow results, Hartmut Neven, head of Google's quantum computing effort, described OTOCs as a “measure of how quickly information travels in a highly entangled system.” In their 2021 work, the Google researchers were able to observe in detail how information spread across Sycamore's grid of qubits, rippling outward from an initial state. While intriguing, the result was well within the reach of classical supercomputers.

To test the limits of Willow, with its doubled number of qubits and roughly doubled qubit fidelity, the Google researchers ran it through a doubled OTOC protocol: scramble, butterfly, unscramble, scramble, butterfly, unscramble. In the Rubik's cube analogy, these doubled steps made the measurement's complexity much higher. At the same time, as it reduced the overall detectability of the butterfly in the scrambled system, the complexity made the measurement far more difficult for classical computers to simulate. Google researchers estimate it would take three years for a classical supercomputer to do what Willow did in two hours. Some peer reviewers urged caution. As noted, numerous claims of quantum advantage—including one from Google in 2019—have fallen apart as classical algorithms have improved.

At the end of the Nature paper, the Google researchers teased that the “exciting real-world application” of using OTOC for molecular simulations would appear in future work.

Today the Google team began fulfilling that promise, releasing the first steps of its process in another preprint. The researchers applied an OTOC protocol to Willow to estimate a key property of a system of organic molecules: the distance between two hydrogen atoms. Though the simulation technique is still nascent and not faster than classical approaches, it does seem to agree with experimental results.

The practical applications of quantum mechanically precise chemistry are not the only intriguing aspects of the latest result. Physicists such as Xu are curious about what doubled or tripled OTOC protocols can say about information scrambling.

OTOCs might even be a clue to a mystery at the heart of physics: What happens to information inside a black hole? “People have started thinking about information scrambling and information dynamics in the context of black hole physics,” says Laura Cui, a Ph.D. student researching quantum information at the California Institute of Technology. “We're very much on the way to resolving it using these tools from information theory.”

Zoo Lunch Mishap Reveals Lizards' Hidden Fire Detector

Australian “sleepy” lizards are not so sleepy when it comes to fire

By Clarissa Brincat edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

A burned lunch at Audubon Zoo in New Orleans did more than just disappoint a hungry staffer. As soon as a smoke plume from the mishap drifted into their enclosure, Australian sleepy lizards suddenly stopped whatever they were doing—heads up, tongues flicking, bodies tense—and began pacing their enclosure's edges and digging in the substrate, frantic to escape. Other reptile species in the same room didn't flinch.

The incident sparked a scientific hunch: perhaps the lizards, which happen to be residents of particularly fire-prone regions, had evolved to recognize a blaze's chemical cues.

To test this hypothesis, Chris Jolly, a conservation biologist at Macquarie University and Charles Darwin University in Australia, and his colleagues exposed 10 adult female sleepy lizards to individual puffs of smoke and water vapor and separately to recordings of crackling wildfires and white noise. The lizards fled in response to smoke but were unphased by water vapor, wildfire sounds or white noise. The findings, published in Biology Letters, suggest these lizards rely on smell—not hearing—to detect fire at long range, unlike some other lizards, frogs and bats.

This aligns with Australian sleepy lizards' known use of scent to recognize partners, with whom they form pair-bonds for life, and to find food and detect predators. “Smoke also tends to travel ahead of the flames and cuts through background noise,” Jolly says, “making smell a more reliable early warning than sound in open, windy, noisy environments.”

Many of the lizards tested had likely never experienced wildfire; their capture site hadn't burned in more than 50 years. Yet they still bolted when they sensed smoke, suggesting an innate adaptation. (The strong response was particularly notable given the animals' typical slow, deliberate movements, which Jolly assumes inspired the “sleepy lizard” designator: “They're rarely in a rush to do anything, except, apparently, to escape from fire!”)

Juli Pausas, a research scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, who was not involved in the study, says that while the sleepy lizards' reaction to smoke could indeed represent adaptation to fire—something also seen in some bat species, pygmy possums and Mediterranean lizards—future studies will have to rule out other explanations, such as a general aversion to smoke toxins.

“Nevertheless, the paper contributes to the emerging recognition that certain animal behaviors may represent fire adaptations, a topic that has been underexplored until recently,” Pausas says. As fires intensify amid climate change, the paper authors say, these sensory skills could mean the difference between survival and death.

The dynamics of quantum many-body systems is characterized by quantum observables that are reconstructed from correlation functions at separate points in space and time1,2,3. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, however, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. To circumvent this limitation and enable access to relevant dynamics in experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented4. Here we experimentally measure the second-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC(2))5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 on a superconducting quantum processor and find that they remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long timescales. Furthermore, OTOC(2) manifests quantum correlations in a highly entangled quantum many-body system that are inaccessible without time-reversal techniques. This is demonstrated through an experimental protocol that randomizes the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution. The measured values of OTOC(2) are substantially changed by the protocol, thereby revealing constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in the configuration space. The observed interference mechanism also endows OTOC(2) with high degrees of classical simulation complexity. These results, combined with the capability of OTOC(2) in unravelling useful details of quantum dynamics, as shown through an example of Hamiltonian learning, indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.

Identifying complex correlations between the many-body degrees of freedom in a quantum system is a central goal for the simulation of quantum dynamics. Even spectroscopic questions can be formulated in terms of few-point dynamical correlations. As entanglement grows with system size or evolution time, the resulting dynamics are often ergodic. Consequently, the sensitivities to the details of the quantum dynamics decay exponentially for most quantum observables, limiting their utility in revealing many-body correlations. Numerical or analytical studies of correlations are also hindered by the difficulty of identifying subtle contributing processes, which undermine common simplifying assumptions. Moreover, the linearity of the Schrödinger equation precludes the use of classical techniques based on sensitivity to initial conditions, methods that have proven effective in detecting the butterfly effect and characterizing classical chaos.

As a solution to the above challenge, experimental protocols that use refocusing to echo out nearly all evolution have become essential for probing highly entangled dynamics. These protocols have proven indispensable in quantum metrology and sensing19,20 as well as in studies of chaos, black holes and thermalization6,8,21,22,23. Dynamical sequences that include time reversal are most naturally described in the Heisenberg picture of operator evolution (Fig. 1). The sequence can be conceptualized as an interference problem, where correlations reflect coherent interference across many-body trajectories. Computing an observable can, thus, be expressed as a sum over distinct trajectories. In this conceptual framework, each time reversal corresponds to the addition of two interference arms and also other cross-terms contributing to experimental observables, which are formally known as out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs)5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.

a, When dynamical protocols involve echoing, the Heisenberg picture of the operator evolution is the natural framework for studying dynamics. b, OTOC and OTOC(2) can be viewed as time interferometers, which highlights their capability of refocusing on desired details and echoing out unwanted dynamics. See text for the definition of parameters.

In our work, we perform a family of OTOC experiments and leverage the interference framework to understand how different paths and their combinations reveal quantum correlations inaccessible without time reversal or with numerical methods. More specifically, we use the unique programmability of a digital quantum processor to change the number of interference arms (Fig. 2) and insert either noisy (Fig. 3) or coherent (Fig. 5) phase shifters into each arm. In response, we find that OTOCs are more sensitive to these perturbations compared with observables in the absence of time reversal. Furthermore, we discover that this sensitivity is enhanced as the order k of OTOC(k) (the number of interference arms) increases. In particular, OTOC(2) reveals constructive interference between Pauli strings that is invisible in lower-order observables.

To understand how repeated time-reversal restores the sensitivity to quantum dynamics, we first consider measuring the Pauli operator M ∈ {X, Y, Z} of a qubit qm in a square lattice of qubits and initialized in an eigenstate of M. The measurement at a time t is equivalent to the time-ordered correlator (TOC), ⟨M(t)M⟩, where M(t) = U†(t)MU(t) denotes the time-evolved M in the Heisenberg picture, U is a many-body unitary, and ⟨…⟩ denotes the expectation value over a particular initial state. As observed in previous experiments24,25,26,27, ⟨M(t)M⟩ decays exponentially over time when U is ergodic. This stems from the scrambling of quantum information from the initial state of qm into the exponentially large Hilbert space of the system.

The above decay can, however, be partially refocused through the evolution outlined in Fig. 2a. Here, the dynamics U is replaced with the nested echo sequence Uk(t) = B(t)[MB(t)]k−1, where B(t) = U†(t)BU(t) is the time-evolved operator of another Pauli B acting on qubit(s) qb some distance away from qm and k ≥ 1 is an integer. The action of Uk may be understood as dispersing the information injected by M, modifying it by B, reversing it back to M and repeating this process k − 1 times. As \({U}_{k}^{\dagger }(t)={U}_{k}(t)\), the expectation value (denoted as \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) in this case) may be written as:

The quantity \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) coincides with the well-known out-of-time-order correlator5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,28, OTOC. We, therefore, refer to \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) as OTOC(k) or kth-order OTOC. Equation (1) yields two key insights. First, if the information originating from qm has not yet reached qb, B(t) commutes with M and the information coming back to qm is identical to its initial value. We, therefore, expect the existence of a wavefront across which \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) decays. By increasing the separation between qm and qb, this front may be pushed later in time, thus allowing large signals to be measured where TOCs are approximately 0. Second, provided U is not a Clifford sequence, information starting from M and returning to M can take several different paths in configuration space. Correlations between Pauli strings within B(t) may, therefore, manifest through constructive interference between different paths for \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) with k ≥ 2.

We begin by characterizing the sensitivity of OTOC(2) to the microscopic details of quantum dynamics. Figure 2a schematically shows our quantum circuits, which are composed of random single-qubit and fixed two-qubit gates. The experiment is done by first fixing the choices of qm and qb. A circuit instance i is then generated by varying the random parameters of the single-qubit gates that interleave the deterministic set of two-qubit gates. For a fixed number of circuit cycles t within U, the quantity \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}(t,{q}_{{\rm{m}}},{q}_{{\rm{b}}},i)\) is repeatedly measured until the statistical noise of the measurement is less than  10% of its average value. This protocol is then repeated by varying t, qm and qb, as well as the circuit instance i, which is sampled 50 to 250 times. Last, all experimental \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) or \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) values are normalized by a global rescaling factor obtained through error-mitigation strategies (Supplementary Information sections II.E.1 and II.F.1).

The top row of Fig. 2b displays the values of \({\overline{{\mathcal{C}}}}^{(4)}(t,{q}_{{\rm{b}}})\) for different circuit cycles and choices of qb, where the overline denotes averaging over circuit instances. The location of qm is fixed throughout these measurements. The information front introduced above is clearly visible in the experimental data. For each t, there is a boundary for qb beyond which \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) is  approximately 1. This boundary defines the light cone of qm, which corresponds to the set of qubits that have been entangled with qm. Moreover, we find that the circuit-to-circuit fluctuation of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}(t,{q}_{{\rm{b}}})\), defined as the standard deviation σ of its value over circuit instances, is of the same order of magnitude as the average value near the information front (bottom row of Fig. 2b). This observation indicates that \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) is, indeed, highly sensitive to the details of the underlying evolution U, an effect that we will later use to demonstrate its application in Hamiltonian learning.

To study more systematically the decay of OTOC sensitivity over time, we measure the standard deviations of various OTOCs as functions of t (Fig. 2c). We observe that the standard deviations of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\), \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) and the off-diagonal part of OTOC(2) (\({{\mathcal{C}}}_{{\rm{off-diag}}}^{(4)}\), see ‘Large-loop interference in OTOC(2)' for a definition) decay algebraically and remain over 0.01 beyond t = 20. The standard deviation of a TOC, which does not have the echo-like structure of OTOCs, decays exponentially over time and becomes less than 0.01 at t = 9. The stark contrast between TOC and OTOCs indicates that the interferometric nature of the latter is crucial for enhancing sensitivities to quantum dynamics. In Supplementary Information section IV, we provide further studies of OTOC(k) fluctuations using one-dimensional Haar random circuits, finding that these observables decay as a power law consistent with the two-dimensional experimental data.

The experiments performed in the preceding section, which change all details of U between OTOC measurements, is analogous to shifting the arms of an interferometer entirely (Fig. 1b). In this section, we demonstrate that higher-order OTOCs also become increasingly more sensitive to the phases of the interferometer arms, a hallmark of interference phenomena. Conceptually, many-body interference may be understood by first noting that equation (1) can, in the ergodic limit, be expressed as:

For a given circuit instance, B(t) can be decomposed in the basis of the 4N Pauli strings {Pn} of our N-qubit system:

where {bn} is a set of real-valued time-dependent coefficients. The time evolution of B is visualized in the bottom left panel of Fig. 3a, where B is seen to branch out in Pauli space over time due to the action of non-Clifford gates in our circuits, creating the so-called operator entanglement18,29,30. In the schematic, the trajectories of some Pauli strings (shaded areas) are also seen to recombine during the time evolution. This mechanism, which affects both \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) and \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\), will be referred to as small-loop interference.

The mechanism of large-loop interference is related to how Pauli strings at the end of the time evolution contribute to the experimental observable. It is present only in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\), as schematically shown in the upper panels of Fig. 3a. As MPnM = ±Pn, equation (2) can be written for \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) as:

Here each cαβγδ is also a real-valued coefficient. Each Pauli string in this expression is represented as a coloured segment in the diagrams within the top panels of Fig. 3a. The length of this segment qualitatively represents the Hamming distance between the Pauli string and the identity. Multiplying two Pauli strings joins them at one end and forms a new Pauli string connecting the two new terminal points.

For the trace in equation (4) to be non-zero, the product of the four Pauli strings must be the identity, that is, the diagram must form a loop. This condition is satisfied through two distinct means. If α = β and γ = δ, we obtain the so-called diagonal contribution \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{diag}}^{(4)}\) to \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) in which the loops enclose zero area. If α ≠ β ≠ γ ≠ δ, we obtain the off-diagonal contribution \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\), named because each term may be thought of as an off-diagonal element in the 44N × 44N density matrix formed by the Paulis. Diagrammatically, \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) consists of a superposition of operator loops, each of which contains three unconstrained Pauli strings and, therefore, encloses an arbitrarily large area. For comparison, large-loop interference is absent in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\), as only Pauli strings with α = β contribute, like \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{diag}}^{(4)}\).

To characterize the effects of quantum interference, we insert random Pauli operators at different cycles within each application of U and U† (Fig. 3b). The inserted Paulis randomize the signs of the coefficients cαβγδ in equation (4) without changing their amplitudes. This is analogous to shifting the phase around an ordinary interference loop without changing its intensity. By ensemble-averaging over random Paulis and probing the changes in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) or \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\), the contribution of quantum interference to each observable can then be quantified. Figure 3c shows the experimentally measured 1 − ρ, where ρ is the Pearson correlation between circuits with and without inserted Paulis. The inserted Paulis produce substantial changes in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\), indicating that the large-loop interference effects (\({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\)) are a dominant contribution to \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\). By contrast, the signal change for \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) is much weaker overall, owing to the presence of only small-loop interference. The larger residual effect of Pauli insertion near the edges of U is attributed to the fact that quantum gates closer to the B and M operators have more weight in the resulting signals. We also note that 1 − ρ is slightly reduced at later insertion cycles for \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\), which may arise from external decoherence processes that tend to reduce the visibility of quantum interference. Last, by subtracting the \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) of each circuit after Pauli insertion from its original value, the off-diagonal contribution \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) can be experimentally extracted.

We find that the observed interference effects in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) and \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) are closely connected to their complexities with respect to approximate classical simulation algorithms, as the degree of quantum interference sets the level of allowed classical approximation. For OTOC, we find that it is sometimes approximated well by combining exact wavefunction evolution with a Monte Carlo simulation that ignores the effects of small interference loops. Two such algorithms, cached Monte Carlo (CMC) and tensor networks Monte Carlo, are described in Supplementary Information section III.B. Figure 3d shows experimental \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) values from a set of circuits comprising 40 qubits, along with values of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) computed using CMC. To quantify the accuracy of each dataset, we define a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; Methods) against exactly simulated \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) values shown in the same figure. The SNR achieved by CMC (5.3) is close to the experimental SNR of 5.4. For the off-diagonal OTOC(2) (\({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\)), classical algorithms are far less accurate and achieve a much lower SNR (1.1) compared with the experiment (3.9), as shown in Fig. 3e. In Supplementary Information section III.C, we review all classical simulation algorithms attempted as part of this work and show that none succeeds in approximating \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\).

The combination of large sensitivity and high classical simulation complexity makes higher-order OTOCs such as OTOC(2) a prime candidate for achieving the long-standing goal of practical quantum advantage. To illustrate this potential, we perform two more experiments, which show: (1) OTOC(2) can be accurately resolved in regimes that are, at present, intractable with classical supercomputers. (2) A specific example wherein OTOC(2) is used to accomplish a practical task.

We begin by demonstrating (1). Figure 4a shows a set of \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) measurements performed with a 65-qubit geometry with B applied simultaneously to three different qubits, chosen to maximize the effective quantum volume (corresponding to the number of two-qubit gates falling within the light cones of the B and M operators31). To estimate the accuracy of these measurements, we next characterize the experimental error (SNR) across six different system sizes of up to 40 qubits (Fig. 4b). Here we observe that the SNR degrades only weakly as the system size increases and is also captured by the confidence interval of an empirical error model detailed in Supplementary Information sections II.F.3 and II.F.4. Based on the same error model, the SNR of the 65-qubit dataset is projected to range from 2 to 3. Given that classical heuristic algorithms are unable to achieve this accuracy (Supplementary Information section III.C), tensor-network contraction is the most effective approach toward classically simulating the same circuits. Figure 4c shows the estimated cost of simulating \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{diag}}^{(4)}\) through tensor-network contraction on the Frontier supercomputer, which converges to approximately 3.2 years. This is a factor of approximately 13,000 longer than the experimental data collection time of 2.1 h per circuit, indicating that this experiment is, at present, in the beyond-classical regime of quantum computation.

Estimates using a publicly available library cotengra47 lead to costs that are ten times higher after the same optimization time. TNCO, tensor-network contraction.

To apply OTOCs in real-world applications, we consider a physical system of interest characterized by a Hamiltonian with a set of unknown parameters. The physical system supplies a collection of OTOC(2) data, which is compared against a quantum simulation of the same Hamiltonian. The unknown parameters are then optimized until the quantum-simulated data match the real-world experimental data (Fig. 5a). The slowly decaying signal size and sensitivity of OTOC(2), as demonstrated in Figs. 2 and  3, make it a particularly suitable candidate for accomplishing this task, which is known as Hamiltonian learning32,33,34,35.

a, Scheme for applying OTOC(2) in Hamiltonian learning. OTOC(2) measured in a physical system of interest is compared with a quantum simulation of OTOC(2) using a parameterized Hamiltonian of the same system. Hamiltonian parameters are then optimized to minimize the difference between the two datasets. b, Demonstrating a one-parameter learning experiment. A collection of classically simulated \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) values from 20 circuit instances having a 34-qubit geometry (bottom left panel) are treated as data from a physical system of interest. The goal is to learn a particular phase ξ/π = 0.6 of the two-qubit gate unitary U2Q belonging to one pair of qubits (green bar in the top and bottom left panels). c, Experimentally measured \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) (quantum processor data) as a function of ξ for three different circuit instances. Blue lines indicate the ideal values of \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) from a classical simulation. These lines intersect all three datasets close to the target value of ξ (vertical dashed line). d, An optimization cost function, corresponding to the root-mean-square difference between the quantum processor data and the classical simulation data of all 20 circuit instances as a function of ξ. The cost function is minimized at the target value of ξ.

To demonstrate the proposed scheme in practice, we construct a one-parameter learning example, as shown in Fig. 5b. A set of \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) values from 20 random circuit instances, produced by a classical simulation to mimic the role of the ‘physical system' in Fig. 5a, are provided. All details of U, except the phase ξ of one two-qubit gate located along the passage between qm and qb, are also given. To learn the unknown parameter ξ, we measure \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) on the quantum processor while varying ξ. Results for three circuit instances are shown in Fig. 5c, where we see smooth oscillations of experimental signals that are distinct between different instances. Importantly, all oscillations intersect the classically simulated values of \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) at the target value of ξ. This is further reflected in Fig. 5d, where we have constructed a cost function between the classically simulated and experimentally measured values of \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\). The cost function has a global minimum at the target ξ value.

In this work, we have shown that OTOCs have quantum interference effects that endow them with a high sensitivity to details of the quantum dynamics and, for OTOC(2), also high levels of classical simulation complexity. As such, OTOCs are viable candidates for realizing practical quantum advantage, a chief milestone sought by recent experiments36,37,38. Generally, practical quantum advantage can be formulated as the task of measuring the expectation values of low-rank observables, for example, energy or correlations3,39, such that:

The observable can be experimentally measured with the proper accuracy, in our case with an SNR above unity. More formally, the observable is in the bounded-error quantum polynomial-time (BQP) class40.

The observable lies beyond the reach of both exact classical simulation and heuristic methods that trade accuracy for efficiency31,41,42,43,44.

Satisfying both defines a ‘Goldilocks zone' for quantum advantage. To demonstrate practical quantum advantage, one more criterion is required:

The observable should yield practically relevant information about the quantum system.

Here, by measuring a many-body observable with SNR > 2 and showing that it is beyond the reach of currently known classical simulation algorithms, we have made progress towards (1) and (2). Moreover, a proof-of-principle for (3) is demonstrated with a dynamic learning problem. Although the random circuits used in the dynamic learning demonstration remain a toy model for Hamiltonians that are of practical relevance, the scheme is readily applicable to real physical systems. One such example is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance systems, where dipolar couplings between spin pairs can be inverted without complete knowledge of their strength45. Comparing experimental data from such systems with quantum simulation outcomes may allow more accurate estimates of these couplings. We leave this exciting real-world application for future work.

The quantum processor originally comprised 105 frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits connected by tunable couplers. On cooling down, we found that two qubits were inoperable due to broken coupler bias lines. They were, therefore, excluded from the experiment. Details of the processor, including gate and read-out errors, qubit coherence times, anharmonicities and frequencies, can be found in Supplementary Information section II.A. Owing to improved single-qubit relaxation times T1 (median of 106 μs) compared with our earlier quantum processors, a median two-qubit gate (iSWAP-like) error of 0.15% was achieved for this device. As a system-wide benchmark, we performed a random circuit sampling experiment and estimated the overall fidelity to be 0.001 at 40 circuit cycles, which doubles the circuit volume compared with previous records and corresponds to approximately 1025 years of simulation run-time on the Frontier supercomputer using tensor-network contraction algorithms (Supplementary Information section II.B).

The SNR is defined as follows. For the set of circuit-specific \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) (or \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\)) values, the mean is subtracted, and they are then rescaled by their variance, \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(s)}=({\mathcal{C}}-\overline{{\mathcal{C}}})/\sigma ({\mathcal{C}})\) where \({\mathcal{C}}\) represents either \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) or \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{{\rm{off-diag}}}^{(4)}\). This is done to both the set of experimentally measured (\(\{{{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{exp}}\}\)) and the set of numerically simulated quantities (\(\{{{\mathcal{C}}}_{{\rm{sim}}}\}\)). The SNR is then \(1/\sqrt{\overline{{({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{exp}}^{(s)}-{{\mathcal{C}}}_{{\rm{sim}}}^{(s)})}^{2}}}\), where the overline denotes averaging over all circuit instances. This definition of SNR is directly related to the Pearson correlation coefficient ρ as SNR \(=1/\sqrt{2(1-\rho )}\).

For measurements of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) with respect to a single initial state, an auxiliary qubit may be entangled with qm after preparing the system in the desired initial state and then read out at the end. In our present work, we simplify this scheme by initializing qm in the \(| 0\rangle \) state, which is an eigenstate of the measurement operator M = Z. Measuring qm in the Z basis directly yields \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\).

It is also possible to measure \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) of an infinite-temperature initial state, that is a maximally mixed state with the density matrix I/2N, where I is the identity matrix and N is the number of qubits. This is done by averaging over different initial states. In Supplementary Information section II.E.4, we show measurements of infinite-temperature \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) after averaging over initial states in a set of 66-qubit circuits. A sizeable circuit-to-circuit fluctuation is still found in this case, indicating that the signal size of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\) remains large even for infinite-temperature states.

The various circuit geometries studied throughout this work were chosen with the following considerations: (1) For each system size, we placed qb and qm close to the opposing edges of a lattice. (2) The total number of circuit cycles for each system size was adjusted to be the maximum beyond which the average signal size for \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{{\rm{off-diag}}}^{(4)}\) was reduced below 0.01. These two considerations were implemented such that each small-scale geometry (for example, the six different geometries used in Fig. 4c) mimic the geometry and overall signal size of the 65-qubit circuits in Fig. 4a.

Each 40-qubit circuit instance in Fig. 3d,e required 3 h to simulate exactly on a Google Cloud virtual machine with 11.5 Tb of RAM and 416 CPUs. Matching the accuracy (SNR ≈ 5) of the quantum experiment in Fig. 3d using a CMC simulation required a cache size of 1 billion (see Supplementary Information section III.B.2 for a definition) and 6 days of simulation time (per circuit) on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU to gather sufficient statistics.

In Supplementary Information section IV we analyse the moments of \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\) and \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) theoretically and numerically for the one-dimensional bricklayer circuit of two-qubit Haar random gates. For \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2)}\), we used a combination of perturbation theory and large-scale matrix product state simulations to relate the power-law circuit-to-circuit fluctuations to the small interference loops introduced in the main text. For \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) and \({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\), a similar analysis is challenging and, instead, we verified the polynomial scaling of fluctuations with exact numerics. We also demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the operator MB(t) (equation (2)). The properties of this transition were captured in an analytically tractable random matrix model, which allowed us to compute moments k ≥ 1. This quantum criticality is consistent with the classically intractable power-law correlations in \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(2k)}\).

In ‘Large-loop interference in OTOC(2)', we demonstrated a significant independent contribution in equation (4) from non-paired trajectories in the space of Pauli strings (\({{\mathcal{C}}}_{\text{off-diag}}^{(4)}\) in Fig. 3a), which have coefficients with random signs. In Supplementary Information section III.C.3, we further argue theoretically that this interference is not an artefact of the Pauli representation but is intrinsic to \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\). We accomplished this for the circuit-averaged \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\), which is strictly easier to compute classically. We used a mapping between the average \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\) and a model of a magnet that has the structure of the symmetric group of order 4, which reflects universal symmetries of the random circuit ensemble. We showed numerically that the sign problem in this model is severe. We, therefore, argue that the severe sign problem is an inevitable feature that presents a barrier for classical sampling algorithms when computing \({{\mathcal{C}}}^{(4)}\).

Understanding the chemical environment of pristine interfaces is a long-sought goal in electrochemistry, materials science and surface science. A substantial understanding of one such interface, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium anodes, originates from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1,2. However, room temperature (RT) combined with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) can induce major SEI evolution from reactions and volatilization during XPS1,2. Thus, a technique is necessary for SEI stabilization. Here we develop cryogenic (cryo)-XPS with immediate plunge freezing and demonstrate SEI preservation. We discover substantially different SEI speciation and a thicker pristine SEI with cryo-XPS, free from RT-associated thickness reduction and alterations to important species, including LiF and Li2O, in UHV. This new access to pristine SEI composition enables performance correlations across diverse electrolyte chemistries. Primarily, we highlight the necessity of studying sensitive interfaces under cryogenic conditions.

The measurements are carried out in 1 M LiFSI/DME (1 M) electrolyte. Global normalization of all the peaks is performed with respect to the C-F/SOxFy peak in F 1 s high-resolution spectra in (a). The measurements are performed on one analysis spot to capture the SEI evolution decoupled from spatial heterogeneities in the SEI.

The measurements are carried out in 1 M LiFSI/DME (1 M) electrolyte. Global normalization of all the peaks is performed with respect to the C-F peak in F 1 s high-resolution spectra in (a). The measurements are performed on one analysis spot to capture the SEI evolution decoupled from spatial heterogeneities in the SEI. The analysis spot is the same as the one shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.

The intensities of F 1 s spectra shown in (a) and (b) are normalized with respect to the SOxFy/ C-F peak. The measurements are performed on one analysis spot to capture the SEI evolution decoupled from spatial heterogeneities in the SEI.

High-resolution F 1 s spectra for with cryo-XPS (blue, top), cryo-heated to RT-XPS (pink, middle), cryo-heated to RT, and then re-cooled to cryo-XPS (black, bottom), respectively. The measurements are performed on one analysis spot to capture the SEI evolution decoupled from spatial heterogeneities in the SEI. The measurements are carried out in 1 M LiPF6/EC-DEC (LP) electrolyte. An unwashed SEI sample is used as the composition is found to be more sensitive to temperature change in Extended Data Fig. 3.

High-resolution spectra for F 1 s peaks of SEI formed on Cu in 1 M LiPF6/EC-DEC (LP) electrolyte using a protocol of holding the Cu current collector at 10 mV above Li electrodeposition potential for 30 min using cryo-XPS and RT-XPS. This protocol ensures no Li is electrodeposited on Cu so that only electrolyte decomposition prior to Li plating can be studied.

We identify the peak near ~52 eV with cryo-XPS as Li3N (not Li0 metal) because it appears and disappears in conjunction with the same species peak in N 1 s region. Besides, Li is highly electropositive, so it is more favorable for Li to exist in its compound forms.

Average % atomic concentration change with sputtering for cryo-XPS and cryo heated to RT-XPS. The measurements are carried out in residual SEI from 4 M LiFSI/DME (4 M) electrolyte after 5 cycles. The error bars of XPS results are calculated from the analysis of three different spots of the same sample. Ar+ ion sputtering is destructive toward surface chemical composition1,2,58. So, the degree of composition change before and after Ar+ ion sputtering is used to understand the relative amount of stable species in the SEI.

A sprawling Amazon Web Services cloud outage that began early Monday morning illustrated the fragile interdependencies of the internet as major communication, financial, health care, education, and government platforms around the world suffered disruptions. As the day wore on, AWS diagnosed and began working to correct the issue, which stemmed from the company's critical US-EAST-1 region based in northern Virginia. But the cascade of impacts took time to fully resolve.

Researchers reflecting on the incident particularly highlighted the length of the outage, which started around 3 am ET on Monday, October 20. AWS said in status updates that by 6:01 pm ET on Monday “all AWS services returned to normal operations.” The outage directly stemmed from Amazon's DynamoDB database application programming interfaces and, according to the company, “impacted” 141 other AWS services. Multiple network engineers and infrastructure specialists emphasized to WIRED that errors are understandable and inevitable for so-called “hyperscalers” like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, given their complexity and sheer size. But they noted, too, that this reality shouldn't simply absolve cloud providers when they have prolonged downtime.

“The word hindsight is key. It's easy to find out what went wrong after the fact, but the overall reliability of AWS shows how difficult it is to prevent every failure,” says Ira Winkler, chief information security officer of the reliability and cybersecurity firm CYE. “Ideally, this will be a lesson learned, and Amazon will implement more redundancies that would prevent a disaster like this from happening in the future—or at least prevent them staying down as long as they did.”

AWS did not respond to questions from WIRED about the long tail of the recovery for customers. An AWS spokesperson says the company plans to publish one of its “post-event summaries” about the incident.

“I don't think this was just a ‘stuff happens' outage. I would have expected a full remediation much faster,” says Jake Williams, vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “To give them their due, cascading failures aren't something that they get a lot of experience working with because they don't have outages very often. So that's to their credit. But it's really easy to get into the mindset of giving these companies a pass, and we shouldn't forget that they create this situation by actively trying to attract ever more customers to their infrastructure. Clients don't control whether they are overextending themselves or what they may have going on financially.”

The incident was caused by a familiar culprit in web outages—“domain name system” resolution issues. DNS is essentially the internet's phonebook mechanism to direct web browsers to the right servers. As a result, DNS issues are a common source of outages, because they can cause requests to fail and keep content from loading.

“Cloud computing is a marvel, but the heart of it is a never-ending list of complex services and dependencies that are always one configuration away from failure,"" says Mark St. John, chief operating officer and cofounder of the systems security startup Neon Cyber.

Speaking generally about hyperscalers, St. John echoed Williams' point that in exchange for the mature architecture and secure baseline of cloud platforms, customers cede control of their underlying digital infrastructure and the extent to which their cloud provider is or isn't investing in resilience and contingency planning at a given time. “At a certain scale, operational validation for service providers can't be a casualty of cost-cutting,” St. John says.

Thinking specifically about Monday's outage, one senior network architect at a major tech company, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, also emphasized that the time it took for AWS to diagnose and remediate the issues was notable.

“It's extraordinary that they don't have more failures,” the source said, “but in this case it was weird that what was basically a core service—DynamoDB and the DNS around that—took so long to detect and get to a root cause.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Open Source Robot Brain Thinks in 3D","https://www.wired.com/story/this-open-source-robot-brain-thinks-in-3d/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

European roboticists today released a powerful open-source artificial intelligence model that acts as a brain for industrial robots—helping them grasp and manipulate things with new dexterity.

The new model, SPEAR-1, was developed by researchers at the Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT) in Bulgaria. It may help other researchers and startups build and experiment with smarter hardware for factories and warehouses.

Just as open source language models have made it possible for researchers and companies to experiment with generative AI, Martin Vechev, a computer scientist at INSIAT and ETH Zurich, says SPEAR-1 should help roboticists to experiment and iterate rapidly. “Open-weight models are crucial for advancing embodied AI,” Vechev told WIRED ahead of the release.

SPEAR-1 differs from existing robot foundation models in that it incorporates 3D data into its training mix. This gives the model an enhanced understanding of the physical world, making it easier to understand how objects move through physical space.

Robot foundation models are generally built on top of vision language models (VLMs) which have a broad but limited grasp of the physical world because training tends to come from labeled 2D images. “Our approach tackles the mismatch between the 3D space the robot operates in and the knowledge of the VLM that forms the core of the robotic foundation model,” Vechev says.

SPEAR-1 is roughly as capable as commercial foundation models designed to operate robots, when measured on RoboArena, a benchmark that tests a model's ability to get a robot to do things like squeeze a ketchup bottle, close a drawer, and staple pieces of paper together.

The race to make robots smarter already has billions of dollars riding on it. The commercial potential of generally capable robots has spawned well-funded startups including Skild and Generalist besides Physical Intelligence. SPEAR-1 is almost as good as Pi-0.5 from Physical Intelligence, a billion-dollar startup founded by an all-star team of robotics researchers.

SPEAR-1 suggests that the quest to build more intelligent robots may involve both closed models like those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as open source variants like Llama, DeepSeek, and Qwen.

Robot intelligence is still in its infancy, though. It is possible to train an AI model to operate a robot arm so that it can reliably pick certain objects from a table. In practice, however, the model will need to be retrained from scratch if a different kind of robot arm is used or if the object or the environment are altered.

Robotics researchers hope that the same recipe that produced large language models—huge amounts of training data and compute—will eventually yield robot models with similarly general capabilities. This would mean robots capable of adapting very quickly to new situations or new tasks. Eventually such models might enable humanoids to operate in messy and unfamiliar environments, thanks to a general understanding of how the world works.

Karl Pertsch, a researcher at the company Physical Intelligence, says it is too soon to know how important 3D training data will be for robotic foundation models. He adds, however, that SPEAR-1 shows how rapidly more general robotic models are advancing. “It's really cool to see academic groups building quite general policies that can actually be evaluated across a diverse set of environments out-of-the-box, and [can] achieve non-trivial performance,” Pertsch says. “This was not possible even a year ago.”

General Motors is overhauling the electrical and computational guts of its future vehicles in a bid to deliver faster software, more capable automated driving features, and a custom, conversational AI assistant.

The result of this overhaul will debut in 2027 in the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The U.S. automaker, which unveiled its plans at an event Wednesday in New York City, said a new electric architecture and centralized computing platform will be the foundation for all of its future gas-powered and electric vehicles, starting in 2028. The next-generation supercomputer, Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, will power the compute unit — the result of an expanded partnership between GM and Nvidia that was announced in March.

This under-the-hood renovation is a required step if the company wants to introduce more services and features, like a conversational AI assistant or a system that allows a car to safely navigate highways while the driver watches a movie — two products that GM said it is working on and will bring to future vehicles. It would also allow GM to improve the performance of its vehicles, fix problems, or add new features to its infotainment systems via software updates — all of which would make it more competitive with Tesla and the rising threat of Chinese automakers.

GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson said he's been focused on accelerating the rollout of this new architecture since joining the company in May because it “brings a lot of goodness,” like bandwidth and a “dramatic increase in the compute.” It's part of Anderson's broader goal of getting technologically advanced products into consumers' hands faster.

“Going forward, on the core business, my focus has really been around speed, user experience of the product, and profitability,” Anderson told TechCrunch. “We're looking across the business to find opportunities to dramatically reduce the development time for our vehicle platforms. Today, it's on the order of four to five years. I'd like to get it closer to two.”

Inside most modern vehicles, including GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC, are dozens of small computers that handle everything from the infotainment and safety systems to propulsion, steering, and braking. The number of these computers, called electronic control units or ECUs, has risen over the past decade as automakers have added more services and features. Tesla, which took a ground-up, software-first approach, was able to outpace established brands with more computing power and the ability to roll out new features and improve performance through wireless software updates, similar to iPhones or Android-based smartphones.

Legacy automakers have spent years, and billions of dollars, trying to catch up.

The industry widely agrees that part of the solution is to change the underlying hardware architecture to handle the growing computational appetites of infotainment features, safety systems, and automated driving.

GM is taking a similar, although not identical, approach to the zonal architectures used by Tesla and Rivian. GM said it will consolidate dozens of ECUs into a unified computer core that will coordinate every subsystem in the vehicle in real time. That core will be connected to three aggregators — hubs that will convert signals from hundreds of sensors in the vehicle into a unified digital language and then route commands back to the correct hardware.

The upshot: The central computing platform will connect every system in the car, including propulsion, steering, braking, infotainment, and safety, through a high-speed Ethernet backbone.

GM calls the plan a “full reimagining” of how its vehicles are designed, updated, and improved over time. The end result, GM claims, will be vehicles with 10 times more over-the-air software update capacity, 1,000 times more bandwidth, and up to 35 times more AI performance for autonomy and advanced features. 

GM has been on this software-centric, reimagining-the-vehicle road for several years. In 2020, GM rolled out an updated hardware architecture called Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP) to allow for greater data processing power and over-the-air software updates. The following year, GM unveiled a cloud-based, end-to-end software platform called Ultifi that executives promised would make vehicles more capable and give drivers access to in-car subscriptions and new apps and services through over-the-air updates. The Ultifi branding has since been dropped, but it exists in GM's newest models and is the software that operates on top of the VIP architecture. GM continued its bid for a more software-centric vehicle in 2022 when it consolidated dozens of computers used to operate the infotainment system into a single computing platform.

GM says this latest move builds on all of this.

I don't know you could go as far to say he was born better at chess, but he certainly seemed to be smart early on, and with his father's influence and with a supporting environment that smarts got aimed at chess.

Carlsen is that once-per-generation exception, someone who has a talent that somehow allows him to see a little further down the game tree than others. I grew up next to someone who was nearly that good, but there are so many people in that bracket that outside of NL he's not very well known. The distribution of skill at the high end of chess is highly non-linear.

Imagine if you will that chess engines don't exist but apps do. A chess game company might employ a small army of excellent chess players to play games against their customers. You load up your app, request a medium difficulty game, and get connected with James, who's playing 10 games at once for $20/hour. It's a decent gig. Customers pay a fee for the experience but it's worth it to them.But now let's say Google publishes a groundbreaking paper that lays out the foundation of an automated chess engine. Should James be worried about his job? Carlsen's going to be fine. I'm not so sure about James.

If people wanted to see ""perfect"" chess they would be watching chess engine championships. These feature some of the deepest and most thought out moves ever performed in chess. They also get a few hundred live viewers.Magnus is objectively an inferior player to top chess engines. If there was a technological problem that requires the best chess abilities, nobody would be paying Magnus to solve that problem, they would be using a chess engine.The analogy does not work at all, because Magnus is not paid to be a good chess player in absolute terms, but a good chess player relative to other human top chess players.

Not everything that draws a crowd is a performance. I suspect Magnus Carlsen would play chess even if nobody watched. Just look at Mikhail Tal, Max Euwe, Garry Kasparov and all those others. None of them did it because of the crowds. They did it because the game itself fascinated them.

A big part of the Chromium ""moat"" as it exists right now is the ability to bring disproportionate resources to bear on browser engine modernization. I would be impressed if AI tools were being used to demonstrably close the gap, because it conceivably could have important implications for getting us away from the browser monopoly problem.

My leadership is currently promoting ""better to ask forgiveness"", or put another way: ""a bias towards action"".  There are definitely limits on this, but it's been helpful when dealing with various internal negotiations.  I don't spend as much time looking to ""align with stakeholders"", I just go ahead and do things my decades of experience have taught me are the right paths (while also using my experience to know when I can't just push things through).

reply

Isn't that ""move fast and break things"" by another name?

reply

It's often possible to get promoted by leading ""large efforts"" where large is defined more or less by headcount. So if a hot new org has unlimited HC budget all the incentives push managers to complicate things as much as possible to create justification for more heads. Good for savvy mangers, bad for the company and overall effort. My impression is this is what happened at Meta's AI org, and VR/AR before that.

Self preservation takes over at that point, and the bureaucratic org starts prioritizing its own survival over anything else. Product works instead becomes defensive operations, decision making slows, and innovation starts being perceived as a risk instead of a benefit.

The science of poop has yielded some fascinating results, but the latest installment in this beat may be the most astounding yet. After decades of noticing but generally not understanding why reptiles “pee” crystals, researchers finally believe they have the answer.

In a Journal of the American Chemical Society paper published today, a team of organic chemists and herpetologists describes their investigation of pee crystals from more than 20 reptile species. Simply, reptiles package up excess nitrogen into tiny, textured spheres consisting of even smaller microcrystals. These microscopic processes offer an evolutionary advantage for snakes, in addition to hinting at some broader implications for human health, according to the researchers.

The project began with an odd inquiry that Jennifer Swift, a crystallographer at Georgetown University, received from herpetologist Gordon Schuett. Specifically, Schuett wanted to know why, despite feeding the reptiles under his care the same food and water, there was such a weird variety in their pee crystals.

“What he observed was that among all of the critters that he had in his museum, some of them would excrete urates that dry to a rock-hard mass, and some of them would dry to something that looked like dust,” Swift, the study's senior author, told Gizmodo in a phone call. “He asked if I knew what was going on, and I said, ‘I have no idea. Why don't you send me some samples?'”

Swift's focus thus far had been the accumulation of uric acid crystals in humans, which leads to serious health issues such as gout or kidney stones. Uric acid is one of three main forms produced by animals while breaking down excess nitrogen in their bodies. We mammals pass excess nitrogen as urea, which, along with lots of water, becomes urine.

On the other hand, reptiles and avians (both descended from dinosaurs) excrete nitrogen as solid uric acid, which researchers believe could have allowed the animals to preserve water in dry climates.

Given the pesky implications of solid uric acid in humans, researchers did clock the potential benefits in learning how reptiles appeared to pass these crystals without too much trouble. But the few attempts to properly describe the molecular mechanisms in play weren't very successful, according to Swift.

“Because we didn't know what we were dealing with, either, we cobbled together literally every analytical method we could under the Sun, and studied it in every direction that we could,” she said.

This included X-ray diffraction studies and high-resolution microscopy analysis of urates, or solid uric acid, from around 20 different reptile species, primarily snakes.

Their findings revealed the reptiles' remarkably complex mechanism for passing nitrogen. First, they produce tiny spheres of uric acid nanocrystals. Some species directly dispose of these microspheres, whereas others were “recycling” the crystals to react with liquid ammonia, a deadly neurotoxin.

This enables the snakes to transform ammonia into something solid—particles that are much less toxic that, once excreted, would be “dust that would blow away in the wind,” Swift explained. What this potentially means is that uric acid could play a protective role for the snakes.

Of course, it's still quite a leap to suggest that the same could apply for humans, Swift admitted. Still, it suggests that there's more to be learned about the role of uric acid in biology, she said, adding, “Too much is a problem. Eliminating it completely is not an option.”

Either way, the new findings demonstrate the “value in taking biomimetic approaches to complex problems,” Swift added. “Millions of years of evolutionary history have allowed things to thrive in ways that we might not normally think of. Nature has a lot of remarkable processes that we just don't understand, because we haven't taken the time to look at them.”

How to make sure that you are the most competitive residency applicant you could possibly be. 

Unfortunately, because Step 1 has now transitioned to pass/fail, Step 2 really is a big factor in determining how competitive you are. That score is super important because there are some programs that will eliminate or rank you based on that number.

The good news is there are other ways to really shine and be a strong applicant. What has worked for me personally, and what I've seen for many others as well, is making sure that you show the program why you want to go into that field specifically. 

Whether it's a personal anecdote, a personal connection to the field, or experience, make sure that shines through in your personal statements and your interviews because it will show that you are a doctor who wants to really give back to this field for that reason.

A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on October 6, 2025, titled ""A peculiar case of primary lymphoma of pancreas: A rare presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma.""

In this report led by first author Osama Mohiuddin from Ascension At Agnes Healthcare, with corresponding author Rafi Aibani from Charleston Area Medical Center, researchers describe a rare medical case in which Hodgkin lymphoma is presented as a pancreatic mass. The findings emphasize how easily this type of cancer can be misdiagnosed, potentially delaying effective treatment.

Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that typically affects the lymphatic system and usually appears in lymph nodes. Its appearance in the pancreas is exceptionally rare. This case involved a 50-year-old man who experienced low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and significant unintentional weight loss, symptoms frequently linked to pancreatic cancer. Imaging showed a sizable mass in the pancreas, initially raising concern for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer.

""Primary pancreatic Hodgkin lymphoma (PPL) is an exceptionally rare condition often misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pseudocyst.""

A lymph node biopsy revealed that the patient had a nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma. This result was confirmed through staining techniques. The diagnosis shifted the treatment plan from potential surgery or radiation toward chemotherapy specifically designed for Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient began a targeted regimen known as A+AVD.

This rare presentation highlights the challenges clinicians face when diagnosing pancreatic tumors. Primary pancreatic lymphoma accounts for less than 1% of all pancreatic cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma is even more uncommon in this location. Because the clinical signs and imaging findings often resemble pancreatic cancer, a biopsy is essential to ensure the correct diagnosis.

The case also illustrates the limitations of imaging alone. Unlike pancreatic adenocarcinomas, lymphomas typically do not cause tissue death, calcification, or obstruction of pancreatic ducts. These differences, when combined with biopsy results, can guide toward more accurate diagnoses.

As treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma continue to improve, especially with drugs like brentuximab vedotin, early diagnosis becomes critical. This case report is a reminder that not all pancreatic tumors are what they appear to be. In rare cases, they may reflect a treatable cancer that responds well to targeted therapy if diagnosed in time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Understanding the neural mechanisms behind food choices","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251022/Understanding-the-neural-mechanisms-behind-food-choices.aspx","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 17:59:00 GMT","

Feeding in mammals is controlled by a complex neural system. Although several key neural pathways related to total calorie intake have been extensively studied, it is still unclear how food choices are regulated and how they influence overall feeding behavior. Food selection among different types, such as an HCD and an HFD, is affected by various internal conditions. For example, mice usually consume only an HFD, but they will eat both an HCD and an HFD when glucoprivation occurs after 2DG administration. However, the neural mechanisms behind this remain unknown. 

The research team examined the neural mechanisms influencing food choice between an HCD and an HFD in mice after administering 2DG. They found that the consumption of HCD and HFD after 2DG is independently controlled by AMP kinase (AMPK)-regulated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)  neurons and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)-expressing neurons in the PVH, respectively. The researchers also discovered that neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM) activate both AMPK-regulated CRH neurons and MC4R neurons in the PVH, promoting HCD and HFD intake following 2DG treatment. Conversely, NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) inhibit MC4R neurons in the PVH, resulting in increased HFD intake alone. 

These findings first demonstrated that HCD and HFD intake are controlled by two separate neural pathways in the brain. This could offer new insights into understanding the neural mechanisms behind food choices among foods with different nutrient compositions.

Heather O'Reilly and Jeff Kassouf react to Trinity Rodman's knee injury ahead of the USWNT camp. (2:17)

CHESTER, Pa. -- United States women's national team head coach Emma Hayes said she is ""absolutely bummed"" that forward Trinity Rodman is absent from the team's training camp due to injury, but she is hopeful that Rodman will be back on the field in the coming weeks.

Last week, Rodman was named to her first USWNT roster in six months due to ongoing back injuries and the long break in international play. Hayes said at the time that she was ""super excited"" to have Rodman back, but hours later, Rodman sprained her right MCL in a match with the Washington Spirit.

- USWNT's Rodman has MCL sprain; timeline TBD
- Ranking the 10 greatest NWSL teams of all time: Who's No. 1?
- U.S. announces co-hosts for 2031 World Cup bid

""While she understands these setbacks happen, she's equally disappointed because she desperately wanted to be here,"" Hayes said on Wednesday at Subaru Park ahead of the USWNT's game there against Portugal on Thursday.

""Fortunately, it's not too far, and I hope that she's back in playoff contention and she'll be back for the next camp.""

Hayes said she is optimistic that Rodman's injury is ""not too bad"" and deferred to the Washington Spirit for an official timeline. The NWSL playoffs begin on Nov. 7; Washington has clinched the No. 2 seed.

Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez said last week that Rodman's MCL sprain is a ""best [case] scenario"" after Rodman left her team's game on Oct. 14 in tears and was seen on crutches and in a full leg brace after the match.

Rodman has only played for the USWNT once since starring in the squad's 2024 Olympic gold medal run. She scored six minutes into the April win over Brazil. Her playing time this year for club and country has been severely limited by recurring back pain.

""When she came in in April, she really felt she was in a good place, but the reality was, I think so much adrenaline got her through that game in LA, but afterward that reality hit home that there were some issues in her back that were unresolved,"" Hayes said last week.

Rodman posted a video to her TikTok account earlier this week making light of her frustration with missing another USWNT camp due to injury. She had just returned to 90-minute form for the Spirit following the NWSL's summer break.

After the USWNT's practice on Wednesday, Hayes walked across the parking lot at the Philadelphia Union's training grounds to watch the U.S. U23 team practice. She said that she would select a player from that group to replace Rodman on the senior team roster for the camp.

A U.S. Soccer spokesperson said the player would not be announced until Friday and would not be available for Thursday's match.

The U23s are training in Chester this week, which Hayes pointed to as another example of the program adding layers of development.

Rodman will be in attendance for the USWNT's game against Portugal on Thursday, Hayes said.

Thursday's game will also feature a ceremony honoring the career of Alex Morgan, who retired last year as a two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist. She ranks fifth in USWNT history with 123 goals scored.

""There was nothing she didn't achieve,"" Hayes said. ""She was a player that epitomized everything that this program is about. She's an unbelievable credit to her family, because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none.

""You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that, because it's important for our players to be recognizable. She is, without question, in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport.""

USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson, now 20 years old, said she has ""looked up to [Morgan] since I started playing.""

Thompson made a splash transfer from Angel City FC to Chelsea in September in one of the costliest deals in global history. That is the type of world that Morgan and her peers helped create.

""She has meant so much to me and the game,"" Thompson said on Wednesday before practice at Subaru Park. ""She's made the game better. I feel like I wouldn't be in the position I'm in right now if it weren't for the players that came before me -- especially Alex -- and them fighting for equality and equal pay.

""I just want to continue her legacy, but thinking about what she did on the field is something that can't be replicated, which is really cool.""

The USWNT will also honor goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who is active professionally but retired from international duty last year, on Sunday ahead of their game in East Hartford, Connecticut. The federation made Morgan and Naeher bobbleheads to distribute to fans at each game.

""I love this tradition when we honor our players in retirement,"" Hayes said. ""I know the fans will all be coming out not just to support us but also to acknowledge what a wonderful career she had. She's got so many telling moments that were difference-making moments in her career, and the impact she's had on this team is immeasurable.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Fox Sports will show 69 World Cup games on linear television. Luke Hales/Getty Images

A record 69 matches from the 2026 World Cup will be broadcast live on Fox, the most in American network television history, Fox Sports announced Wednesday.

“FOX Sports' presentation of FIFA World Cup 26 is going to be the biggest production in our company's 32-year history, and we couldn't be more excited to showcase this once-in-a-lifetime event with more matches on broadcast television than ever before,” said Eric Shanks, CEO and executive producer of Fox Sports.

Nearly two-thirds of the 104 total World Cup contests will be shown on broadcast television. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, just 34 matches were broadcast on Fox. That is less than half of the planned output for the tournament this summer.

In the 2026 tournament, all remaining 35 matches will be shown on Fox Sports 1 (FS1), which showed 60 World Cup matches in 2022. Every game will also be available on the streaming service Fox One and the Fox Sports app.

Fox Sports' complete broadcast schedule will be revealed following the FIFA World Cup draw, which will take place on Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. This will be the third consecutive men's World Cup broadcast on Fox Sports properties, following the 2022 and 2018 tournaments.

The upcoming edition of the World Cup will be the first to host games in the United States since 1994, when the country hosted the entire tournament. In 2026, there are 16 host cities spread across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The tournament gets underway with its opening match on June 28, with the World Cup final scheduled for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.

After failing to get an injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing its short-term rental ban in district and appellate court, the city of Dallas is now asking the Texas Supreme Court to rule in its favor before the FIFA World Cup next summer.

More than two years ago, the city began looking at ways to regulate short-term rentals, like Airbnb and VRBO, after some STR owners were not as diligent as others in ensuring their guests did not disturb the neighborhood. The loud parties and other nuisance behaviors became social media fodder and later news headlines. The City Council approved a two-pronged ban in 2023 on almost all short-term rentals in the city. That ban sought to limit where short-term rentals could legally operate within the city, zoning out STRs in nearly all but a handful of areas. A new ordinance also placed some guardrails on whatever properties remain after the zoning went into effect.

Short-term rental operators said the city was essentially penalizing a majority of law-abiding and conscientious business owners for the actions of a small number of bad actors. They sued the city and won a temporary injunction to keep Dallas from enforcing the ordinances. That injunction made it through the court system, where it landed at the Fifth District Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel ruled in February that the injunction would stand while the lawsuit made its way through the courts. In July, the three-judge panel took a second look and still found for the STR operators. In August, the court declined the city's request to hear the matter en banc, citing the opinion of the three-judge panel in July.

Which brings us to last week, when the city's attorneys asked the state's highest court to review the case, insisting that the district and appellate courts got it wrong, and that the city should be allowed to enforce its ban while the lawsuit continues.

Dallas' latest filing, which clocks in at 4,490 words, says that the previous courts “abused their discretion” in ruling for the injunction and later upholding that ruling. It also asserts that it prevents the city from regulating STRs—the second prong of its response—at a time when the city is expecting an influx of visitors looking for places to stay during FIFA World Cup matches next summer.

“Such error should not be allowed to stand on the eve of Dallas taking center stage for a worldwide sporting event—a time when STR regulation will be of utmost importance,” the filing says. 

Lisa Sievers with the Dallas Short-term Rental Alliance says the group of operators the organization represents had hoped to “move past” the lawsuits and work with the city on a “fair and reasonable” ordinance. DSTRA may have formed as a response to the city's actions, but in the intervening years, it's also become a hub for owner education. Sievers said that the members are now preparing for the World Cup by offering a series of classes for first-time hosts.

“Our goal has always been to work with the City on the serious business of putting a reasonable ordinance in place that represents the interests of our membership as well as the neighborhoods in which we live and we look forward to the time when this process can begin,” she says. 

As for the suit itself, it's not entirely clear how that will pan out. Those against STRs have maintained that they are a lodging use, which are prohibited by city code from operating in single-family neighborhoods. Operators and owners of STRs insist the opposite and argue that the courts have set precedents that block bans by way of zoning. There is a hodgepodge of case law in response to how local governments have sought to regulate the industry.  Barring some kind of compromise, it looks like Dallas' new ordinance is destined to be sorted out in court, which may or may not happen before the World Cup begins on June 11.

AT&T Stadium will host nine games over the World Cup's 56-day tournament. Dallas' Kay Bailey Convention Center will be the site of the tournament's International Broadcast Center, and teams will also be able to choose from four base-camp sites: Dallas Baptist University, Toyota Stadium in Frisco, University of Dallas, and TCU. They will train at Cotton Bowl Stadium or SMU. All of this means that the city is expecting thousands to descend on Dallas-Fort Worth, not including the 5,000 broadcasters that will make Dallas their home for the entirety of the tournament.

Twelve months later, the image still holds: Coco Gauff lying flat on the court, spent after a three-hour fight that delivered her the WTA Finals title.

Supremely gifted wunderkinds, they first met in Plantation, Florida at the end of the 2018 season.

American Coco Gauff was only 14 years old, and China's Zheng Qinwen a savvy 16. Gauff came from behind to win the Orange Bowl girls' 18s singles title in three sets. In a tournament that showcases the world's best juniors, Gauff was the youngest champion in 15 years.

At the 2024 WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the two youngest players in the dazzling field reached the final. Their combined age (42) made them the youngest finalists in the year-end championship, two decades after Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

“Six years later,” Gauff said, “here we are.”

Road to the final

Those WTA Finals were essentially the 2024 All-Star Game, featuring the eight best singles players over the course of the demanding season.

Gauff was a champion in Auckland and Beijing, but the year after breaking through with a title at the US Open, she failed to defend her title. And yet, the 20-year-old came alive in China, winning nine of 10 matches in Beijing and Wuhan. In Riyadh, Gauff defeated the No. 1-and No. 2-ranked players, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, in a span of three days, both times in straight sets. 

Going into the match against Swiatek, Gauff had lost 11 of 12 matches to the then-five-time major champion. The 7-6 (4), 6-3 win over Sabalenka sent her into the final.

Zheng also had won two titles on the Hologic WTA Tour, and picked up a singles gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The 22-year-old arrived in Riyadh on a tear, winning 12 of 15 matches at the US Open, Beijing and Wuhan. The momentum carried her to group wins over Elena Rybakina and Jasmine Paolini before a loss to Sabalenka. In the semifinal, Zheng handed Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova a straight-sets defeat, vaulting her to the final in her first year-end appearance.

After 55 Hologic WTA Tour tournaments across 25 countries -- with 35 different champions -- the season came down to a single match.

An epic climax

The crowd at the King Saud University Indoor Arena was already buzzing when the players were announced, but when they stepped on court it got loud -- and, at the end of a long year, that energy clearly carried the players.

Zheng was the aggressor out of the box, leaning on her flat forehand and booming serve. She took the first set, saving all five break points, in just under an hour and was up 3-1 in the second when Gauff crept back into the match. Reading Zheng's serve increasingly better, Gauff broke her in the sixth (at love) and eighth games to take the frame.

Twice in the third, Zheng was up a break and actually served for the match at 5-4. But the immense pressure led to four unforced errors, allowing Gauff to draw even. The American finished with a flourish, playing a dominant tiebreak and winning the match 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2).

Match time: An exhausting, exhilarating 3 hours and 4 minutes. Six years after the Orange Bowl, Gauff was again the winner in a deciding set -- and took home the Billie Jean King Trophy and nearly $5 million.

In the end, Gauff outserved Zheng, hitting more aces (6) and unreturned serves (29) and winning 70 percent of her first-serve points.

“Just staying resilient, fighting for every point,” Gauff said afterward. “I know I was like a couple points away from losing, but I just tried to stay in the moment, honestly, and I'm really proud of myself.

“I never gave up.”

Epilogue

This ultimate match made all kinds of history. Gauff:

Zheng had become only the second Chinese player to reach the WTA Finals final, after Li Na in 2013.

“This match is very [much about] endurance, instead of explosive tennis,” Zheng said. “Yes, a lot of physical, but I would say sometimes, maybe in this match, I wasn't that patient.”

When the last shot dropped, so, too, did Gauff.

“At the end of the match, when I fell on the floor, I didn't think I was going to do that,” Gauff said. “The way the match went, I was like, ‘I'm just tired. I just want to lay on the ground.'”

After all that running, the brief moment of stillness felt earned.

""I took three weeks off, rested, regained freshness, and that brought me the victory in Genoa,"" the 30-year-old doubles specialist reflects.ByFlorian HeerPublished Oct 22, 2025 copy_link

Published Oct 22, 2025

At 30 years old, Szymon Walków has built a reputation as one of Poland's most accomplished doubles players on the ATP Challenger Tour.Currently ranked world No. 145 with a career-high ranking of No. 86 in June 2022, Walków already holds 12 ATP Challenger doubles titles, his most recent coming in early September in Genoa alongside Mick Veldheer. From there, he traveled straight to his home tournament in Szczecin, eager to improve on his runner-up finish at last year's Invest in Szczecin Open.

Currently ranked world No. 145 with a career-high ranking of No. 86 in June 2022, Walków already holds 12 ATP Challenger doubles titles, his most recent coming in early September in Genoa alongside Mick Veldheer. From there, he traveled straight to his home tournament in Szczecin, eager to improve on his runner-up finish at last year's Invest in Szczecin Open.

A post shared by ESTESS Tennis Academy (@estesstennisacademy)

“The season has been up and down—some good moments, some weaker. After the Kozerki Open, I felt I needed a break and a new perspective. I took three weeks off, rested, regained freshness, and that brought me the victory in Genoa,” Walków said in Szczecin.During that break he mixed light training with quality time at home. “I played a padel tournament with Karol Drzewiecki, but mostly I spent time with family. My wife and a friend and I went to the seaside, relaxed, trained a bit with friends, then went home and worked hard again. That freshness gave me more fire.”

During that break he mixed light training with quality time at home. “I played a padel tournament with Karol Drzewiecki, but mostly I spent time with family. My wife and a friend and I went to the seaside, relaxed, trained a bit with friends, then went home and worked hard again. That freshness gave me more fire.”

In doubles the margin is minimal—one ball, one lapse of concentration, one tiebreak. The best teams maintain a high level all year, but that doesn't mean a lower-ranked team can't beat the top.

Since dropping out of the Top 100, the main challenge has been finding a consistent partner. “It's something a lot of players face, especially around rankings 130 to 150,” Walków explained. “I entered the Top 100 with Jan Zieliński. We had a good year, caught momentum and moved up as a team. Stability is important: you plan tournaments together, improve what's not working, win and lose as a pair.”Zieliński has since become a fixture on the ATP Tour. Walków points to timing and circumstances. “Janek had a great run with Hubert [Hurkacz], won an ATP 250 in Metz, then teamed with Hugo Nys, got into the Grand Slams, and they made it work. There was some luck, but also quality tennis. That's why he went higher.”Walków himself has played Grand Slams and big events and insists the gap between players ranked 100 to 150 and the elite is small. “In doubles the margin is minimal—one ball, one lapse of concentration, one tiebreak. The best teams maintain a high level all year, but that doesn't mean a lower-ranked team can't beat the top. At the US Open, Hubert and I beat a seeded pair, I think No. 4 in the world. We served well, got one or two breaks—that was enough.”Still, the format can be frustrating. “You can lose several matches in a row on match tiebreaks. With advantage scoring and a full third set, maybe the better team would win more often. But the rules are set by others, and our job is to adapt.”He also feels doubles deserves more respect. “Sometimes at the Grand Slams, it feels like doubles is treated second-class. From the organizers' point of view, big names like Świątek, Sabalenka, Sinner or Alcaraz draw crowds. That's what sells. But should it come at the expense of doubles and the history of the tournament? Doubles play is dynamic, spectacular, and full of twists. Recreational fans love to watch it. Maybe it could be promoted better—but that's for the federations to decide.”

Zieliński has since become a fixture on the ATP Tour. Walków points to timing and circumstances. “Janek had a great run with Hubert [Hurkacz], won an ATP 250 in Metz, then teamed with Hugo Nys, got into the Grand Slams, and they made it work. There was some luck, but also quality tennis. That's why he went higher.”Walków himself has played Grand Slams and big events and insists the gap between players ranked 100 to 150 and the elite is small. “In doubles the margin is minimal—one ball, one lapse of concentration, one tiebreak. The best teams maintain a high level all year, but that doesn't mean a lower-ranked team can't beat the top. At the US Open, Hubert and I beat a seeded pair, I think No. 4 in the world. We served well, got one or two breaks—that was enough.”Still, the format can be frustrating. “You can lose several matches in a row on match tiebreaks. With advantage scoring and a full third set, maybe the better team would win more often. But the rules are set by others, and our job is to adapt.”He also feels doubles deserves more respect. “Sometimes at the Grand Slams, it feels like doubles is treated second-class.

Away from tennis, Walków's big sporting love is basketball. He follows both the Polish league and the NBA closely, especially his local team Śląsk Wrocław. “I'm a real fan. I go to games, follow transfers, know the league,” he says. He even runs an NBA fantasy league with fellow tennis players.Walków has attended two NBA games: the first more than a decade ago, when he was a hitting partner for CoCo Vandeweghe. “She comes from a family deeply connected to the NBA—her uncle played for the New York Knicks and later was a vice-commissioner. We had any tickets we wanted. I went to a Clippers game at Staples Center. The second time was last year after tournaments in the U.S. I visited my friend Bartek Witke in Stamford and we went to a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden.”His love of basketball goes back to childhood. “My dad played as a youth and later at university. He taught my brother and me to play, so basketball was always with us. It's one of my favorite sports, if not the favorite.” Ultimately both brothers chose tennis. “My older brother started playing when a tennis hall opened near my dad's workplace. Dad became passionate about tennis too and helped at the club. We spent whole days there and that's how we went into tennis.”Does he regret not choosing basketball? “It's hard to say. I love basketball, but physically I don't have a huge advantage there. I'm curious how life in a team sport would look—the locker room, shared trips, team atmosphere. That's something I'd enjoy.”Walków even tried to take his father, brother and basketball-playing nephew to EuroBasket to watch Poland face Luka Dončić's Slovenia. “It would have been a great gift, but organizational issues got in the way. Hopefully there will be more chances, though I'm not sure Dončić will come to Poland again. Maybe someday I can arrange my tournaments to take the family to a basketball game.”For now, Szymon Walków continues to chase success on the doubles court, refreshed after his Genoa triumph and motivated to go one step further.

A former world No. 2, Ruud looked like an early favorite to secure a fourth trip to the ATP Finals when he won his first career Masters 1000 title at the Mutua Madrid Open, but injuries and inconsistency stunted his progress throughout the summer, causing him to drop outside of the Top 10.After showing solid form at Laver Cup, the Norwegian pushed Carlos Alcaraz to three sets at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo and dropped just one set en route to the title in Stockholm. In need of another deep run in Basel, the No. 4 seed navigated a close second set to oust Halys and book an intriguing second round against Stan Wawrinka. At 40 years old, the three-time Grand Slam champion pulled off an impressive win over Miomir Kecmanovic for his first ATP win since this summer in Umag. Wawrinka won his only previous match with Ruud at this very tournament in 2022.After Ruud came Auger-Aliassme, who is in the hunt for his first ATP Finals berth since 2022. The Canadian has enjoyed a solid surge back up the ATP rankings after reaching the US Open semifinals and a pair of Masters 1000 quarterfinals in Canada and Shanghai. Like Ruud, Auger-Aliassime arrived to Basel fresh off a title run, lifting the trophy at the BNP Paribas Fortis European Open and, like Ruud, booked a second round against a former US Open champion in Marin Cilic. Cilic leads their head-to-head, 3-2, but Auger-Aliassime has won their last two meetings, including one in Dubai earlier this year.

Finally, Daniil Medvedev took the court in Vienna in the hopes of reaching a seventh straight ATP Finals. The 2021 US Open champion looked out of the hunt for Turin after enduring a third consecutive Grand Slam first-round loss in Flushing Meadows, but Medvedev has showed massive improvements since shaking up his coaching team. Medvedev parted ways with longtime coach Gilles Cervara and took on former Australian Open Tomas Johansson; from there, he reached back-to-back semifinals in Beijing and Shanghai and won his first title in 882 days at the Almaty Open.Medvedev appeared on course for another solid win over Borges when the Portuguese 28-year-old edged through a second-set tiebreaker. Undaunted, Medvedev raced ahead two breaks to kick off the deciding set and never looked back, serving out the win to book a second-round clash with Frenchman Corentin Moutet. Medvedev and Moutet just faced off last week in the Almaty final, with Medvedev earning a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win. To maximize his chances to make Turin, he'll likely need to beat him again.

Capaldi explains THAT grid walk on The Cooldown Room

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Fernando Alonso may have scored a point at the United States Grand Prix, but he was left wanting answers after the weekend saw another gradual decline in pace from Aston Martin.

Fernando Alonso joked about his relief that the United States Grand Prix weekend lasted only three days, after Aston Martin slid gradually down the order across each day of running.

Alonso was fourth quickest in first practice, and then sixth in Sprint Qualifying. He was unable to show his pace in the Saturday Sprint after involved in a collision at the first corner, and was then 10th in Qualifying for the Grand Prix itself – which is also where he finished on race day.

“In Qualifying, we were stronger for sure than in race pace,” the Spaniard said after the Grand Prix. “It has happened a few times already this year that on Friday we are very fast, on Saturday we half fast, and then on Sunday, we are struggling more. It's good that it is only three days, the weekend. If not, on Monday we would be even worse!

“We need to understand why and we need to build the momentum in the last five races step-by-step and arrive in a strong position for Sunday.”

He added: “It was good to score one point, obviously, but I don't know... we didn't have the pace. We were slow in the race. We held the position, and even with two DNFs in front of us with the Williams and the Mercedes [Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli], we still only finished 10th, starting 10th.

“We need to find a little pace for Mexico.""

Neither Aston Martin driver saw the chequered flag in the weekend's Sprint, with Alonso involved in the opening lap mayhem that also saw both McLaren drivers retire, while Lance Stroll crashed into Esteban Ocon while attempting a bold overtaking move at Turn 1 late in the race. For that transgression, the Canadian was handed a five-place grid penalty and started the Grand Prix from 19th.

Of his more successful Sunday outing, in which he made up a host of places to finish 12th – Stroll said: “It was a fun race, attacking all race, and some good overtakes, so that was fun. We were close to getting points. We did the best we could, and it was going to be tricky from where we were starting.

“We made our way through and picked up some positions. The car was feeling good today, so we'll see what we can do in Mexico.”

Capaldi explains THAT grid walk on The Cooldown Room

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Heading to the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix? Here's your full-sensory guide to racing in the heart of CDMX – from cultural must-sees and local food favourites to the best photo spots, nightlife, and fan experiences at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez

In Mexico City, Formula 1 isn't just an event – it's part of the city's celebrations. The streets hum with anticipation long before the lights go out on Sunday, and the whole place seems to shift into celebration mode in the lead up to the Day of the Dead at the beginning of November. The air may feel thinner at this altitude, but the energy never dips.

Everywhere you go, there's colour and sound, from the mariachi in Plaza Garibaldi to the murals of Coyoacan, from markets stacked with fresh fruit and chillies to the smell of tacos al pastor being prepared in food stalls and trucks. Fans spill out of cafes and cantinas to discuss the excitement of the race, share food, and soak in Mexico City's unique atmosphere.

When the weekend arrives, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez becomes part of that wider festival. The Foro Sol – a concert stadium for most of the year – transforms into one of the most distinctive sections of the circuit, its stands packed with fans who bring wild passion and excitement. The whole weekend is full of exhilirating racing, set against a backdrop of art, music, and a vibrant local spirit.

For visitors and locals alike, the Mexico City Grand Prix is much more than a race weekend – it's a perfect way to showcase the city defined by warmth, creativity, and noise in the best possible way.

If you've arrived a day or two early, there's plenty to see and do in Mexico City before diving into the buzz of race weekend:

Float through Xochimilco's colourful canals Hop aboard a traditional trajinera and drift through Xochimilco's vibrant waterways surrounded by music, flowers, and food vendors. It's a lively half-day adventure that captures Mexico's festive spirit.

Step back in time at Templo Mayor and the Zocalo Visit the ancient ruins of Templo Mayor right in the heart of the city and explore the surrounding Zócalo square. You'll see how modern Mexico City and its Aztec heritage blend seamlessly together.

Hear the mariachis at Plaza Garibaldi As night falls, Plaza Garibaldi fills with mariachi bands, lively songs, and the rhythm of the city. Grab a drink from a nearby cantina and soak up the energy of this classic Mexican experience.

Take in the city from Torre Latinoamericana Head downtown to the Torre Latinoamericana, one of the city's tallest and most famous landmarks. The observation deck offers sweeping sunset views across Mexico City – the perfect way to wrap up the weekend before heading home.

Experience Día de los Muertos If your visit overlaps with the Day of the Dead celebrations, wander through streets lined with marigolds, altars, and painted skulls. Paseo de la Reforma and the Zócalo come alive with parades and art displays. Inside the Grand Prix, you'll often find themed activations and live performers dressed in traditional 'Catrina' attire bringing the celebration trackside.

If you're an early riser, or wanting to squeeze as much sightseeing as you can into the weekend, here are a few shorter trips to make the most of Mexico City before heading to the circuit for the racing action:

Wander through Chapultepec Park Spend a morning exploring this race weekend in Chapultepec Park, one of the largest city parks in the world. Take a peaceful walk beneath the trees, visit the castle for sweeping city views, or relax by the lake.

Explore the streets of Roma and Condesa Stroll through the leafy neighbourhoods of Roma and Condesa, filled with art-deco architecture, cafes, and weekend markets. Or visit in the evening to discover rooftop bars and taquerias that turn these creative districts into some of the city's best nightlife spots.

Discover the Palacio de Bellas Artes Admire the white marble facade and stained-glass dome of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, one of Mexico City's most photographed landmarks. Step inside to see murals by Diego Rivera or simply take in the atmosphere of the bustling square outside.

Located about five miles east of downtown Mexico City, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez is best reached with a little planning. Traffic and crowds build quickly on race days, so allow extra time to get to your gate and through security.

Driving and rideshare Driving to the circuit is not recommended and there is no parking available. We advise using public transport to reach the venue efficiently. If you are using a rideshare app, set your drop-off point a few blocks from your assigned gate and walk the final stretch to avoid traffic closures near the circuit.

Shuttles and public transport Public transport is the easiest and most reliable way to reach the circuit. The following routes are recommended:

Leaving the circuit Give yourself extra time as tens of thousands of fans exit the Autodromo at once. Metro stations and rideshare pick-up areas will be crowded, so grab a drink or snack inside the venue before heading out. If you're taking the Metro, Velodromo and Puebla stations are usually less congested than Ciudad Deportiva. Embrace the post-race atmosphere – the walk back through cheering fans and street vendors is part of the Mexico City Grand Prix experience.

Top photo spots

Fanzone
The Fanzone is the hub of off-track action, bringing together live music, driver appearances, and interactive sponsor activations alongside official team merchandise booths. Food stalls serve up local favourites and international options, while simulators, pit stop challenges, and photo ops keep the energy high all weekend.

Top fan hack
If your ticket allows, move around during practice sessions to see the track from different grandstands. Turns 1–3, the stadium section, and the main straight each give completely different perspectives – and photos!

A must-see at least once – Foro Sol explodes with colour and noise as cars roar through the stadium

Once the racing stops, Mexico City comes alive. From mariachi music and rooftop bars to late-night street food and fiestas that spill into the early hours, it's one of the most vibrant Grand Prix destinations on the calendar.

Zona Rosa for dancing and classic nightlife Located just off Paseo de la Reforma, Zona Rosa is packed with clubs, karaoke bars, and music venues that keep going until dawn. It's a safe, energetic district where the party continues long after the chequered flag falls.

Plaza Garibaldi for live mariachi and Mexican spirit Experience the heartbeat of traditional Mexico City as mariachis fill the square with trumpets, guitars, and serenades. Grab a table at a nearby cantina, order a tequila or mezcal, and enjoy one of the most authentic night scenes in the city.

Polanco for fine dining and upscale lounges If you're after something more refined, Polanco delivers high-end restaurants, rooftop terraces, and cocktail bars with skyline views. It's a great spot for a celebratory dinner or nightcap, offering a stylish contrast to the roar of the racetrack.

Roma and Condesa for rooftops and late-night bites Head to these stylish neighbourhoods where tree-lined streets come alive with locals celebrating over cocktails and tacos. From relaxed wine bars to lively rooftops, it's the perfect way to wind down without losing the buzz of race weekend.

Mexico City's culinary scene is as bold as its race weekend. Every meal bursts with colour, spice, and heat, turning street food and fine dining alike into part of the Grand Prix experience.

Tacos al pastor The city's most famous street food – marinated pork shaved from a vertical spit, topped with pineapple, onion, and coriander. Quick, flavourful, and found everywhere from roadside stalls to food courts around the city.

Tacos de suadero If pork isn't your favourite, try this one. With tender beef simmered slowly in its own fat, served with onion, coriander, and a squeeze of lime. It's a late-night favourite among locals and a must-try after an evening in Roma or Condesa.

Tlacoyos Oval-shaped corn masa cakes stuffed with beans, cheese, or fava and topped with cactus and salsa. They're a filling, traditional snack perfect for an early lunch.

Esquites or elote Corn served either in a cup or on the cob, these are topped with lime, chilli, mayo, and cheese. A sweet, spicy, and refreshing snack you'll find at stands near the circuit and across the city.

Barbacoa Slow-cooked lamb wrapped in maguey leaves until juicy and tender, often served on weekends. It's the recovery meal after a long race day.

Horchata A chilled rice-milk drink, flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla. Sweet, refreshing, and perfect for cooling down under the Mexico City sun.

Micheladas and mezcal For a post-race toast, order a michelada, a tangy mix of beer, lime, chilli, and salt. Or sample Mexico's smoky signature spirit, mezcal. Both are staples of local celebrations and taste best when shared with friends.

Churros A trip to Mexico wouldn't be complete without them. Crisp on the outside and soft inside, these sugar-dusted dough sticks are a race weekend essential. Dip them in thick chocolate sauce for the perfect sweet finish to your Grand Prix experience.

Altitude and weather awareness Mexico City sits over 2,200 metres above sea level, so hydrate often and pace yourself on your first day. The thinner air can leave you more tired than expected, especially under the sun.

Beat the Metro rush Travel early in the morning or between sessions to avoid crowded trains. Line 9 gets busy fast, so check which station is closest to your assigned gate before you go.

Pack for the weather Days are warm but evenings can be cool. Expect daytime temperatures of around 21–25°C (70–77°F) and evening lows near 9–12°C (48–54°F) during race weekend, so pack sunscreen, a hat, and a light jacket. Sudden showers are common, so a poncho or compact raincoat is worth carrying too.

Safety and etiquette Stick to well-lit streets, use official taxis or rideshare apps, and keep valuables tucked away in crowds. Locals are friendly and welcoming – a smile and a quick gracias (GRAH-see-ahs) go a long way.

Money and power Most vendors accept cards, but smaller stalls and merch stands are faster with pesos in hand – keep a few small notes ready. Bring a portable charger too, as you'll be filming and snapping all day and outlets inside the circuit are limited.

Learn a few local phrases Spanish is the official language in Mexico, and while many people in the tourism and hospitality industries speak some English, learning a few Spanish basics will go a long way.

The recent deaths of the icons cast a mournful light on a fading generation of actors who once redefined what movie stars could be — complex, messy, and all too human.


							By 

	Benjamin Svetkey


Articles Editor


	There was a moment, back in 2012, when Diane Keaton and Robert Redford nearly shared the screen. Both were reported to be “eyeing” the leads in a holiday-themed ensemble comedy titled The Most Wonderful Time, pitched as a Love Actually-style pastiche involving multiple interwoven tales of family and romance, all set against a backdrop of Christmas lights and yuletide meltdowns.


	Alas, that movie never got made — at least not in that form — and Keaton and Redford never again came so close to working together. But in their own ways, these two very different actors — she, the eccentric spirit of New Hollywood comedy; he, the golden-boy stoic of the American pastoral — were bound by something even more powerful than onscreen chemistry: generational gravity. They belonged to the same loose orbit of 1970s-era performers who upended the rules of stardom and helped reshape what American movies could be.

	Keaton died Oct. 11 at age 79 after a shockingly quick battle with pneumonia. Redford died in his sleep, at 89, a little less than a month earlier, on Sept. 16. Some from their cohort had gone before — Paul Newman in 2008, Shelley Duvall in 2024, Gene Hackman in February — while others have simply drifted from view. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway — all now in their 80s — have largely stepped away from the spotlight.


	Of course, this is nothing new. All stars, even the brightest, eventually flicker out as new generations take their place. But there's something different — something more poignant — about watching this particular circle begin to vanish.

	











	The stars who came before them had been shaped by the studio system — groomed, styled and slotted into types. They signed long-term contracts, wore what the wardrobe department handed them and gave interviews ghostwritten by studio publicists. Even the greats — Bogart, Hepburn, Gable, Davis — were often playing variations of a persona the system had helped construct. Their power came from polish, execution and consistency. Stardom was a product, and it was carefully managed.


	By the time Redford, Keaton, Beatty and the others were coming of age as actors, the old studio scaffolding was already coming apart, with the contract system unraveling and the great moguls who once ruled the town with an iron fist fading from the scene. There was no longer a press-office puppeteer telling actors how to dress or what to say, no studio image to protect. They were free to define themselves — onscreen and off — and to let those two identities blur. Their personas could be withholding, eccentric, neurotic, ambiguous, strange. They could play characters the previous generation never got near: complicated people with unresolved feelings and messy inner lives.


	At the same time, a new kind of director had taken over the asylum — such mavericks as Mike Nichols, Robert Altman, Hal Ashby, Alan J. Pakula and Martin Scorsese — filmmakers who weren't interested in preserving the system. They wanted to blow it up. Their films — Carnal Knowledge, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Shampoo, Klute, Taxi Driver — didn't just break the rules, they rewrote the language of cinema itself. And that reinvention gave this young, liberated generation of actors a canvas as unbound and unconventional as they were — a kind of free-spirited platform that hadn't existed before and hasn't really existed since.

	











	Few actors made better use of that freedom than Redford and Keaton. In such films as The Candidate, Three Days of the Condor and The Way We Were, Redford turned the clean-cut leading man into something more introspective and morally uncertain — a figure torn between idealism and self-interest. Keaton took the same open, idiosyncratic presence that made Annie Hall so engaging and revealed its darker shades in The Godfather and Looking for Mr. Goodbar, proving she could be fearless, complex, even unsettling. Both found truth in contradiction. They made uncertainty look thrilling.


	But by the early 1980s, as the counterculture spirit of the previous decade gave way to something more box office-driven and less tolerant of creative chaos, a different model of movie star started taking over. Actors weren't seeking to challenge the system anymore; they were the system, powering tentpoles, sequels and high-concept hits that could sell in every corner of the world. This was the era of the Event Movie, when opening-weekend grosses became the new measure of stardom. The actors who began appearing on marquees — Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, Gibson, Cruise — weren't celebrated for subtlety or transformation or their onscreen bravery, but for their box office clout.


	Sure, by the 1990s, there was a parallel indie movement where some of these stars could unfurl their dramatic range, '70s-style — Cruise in Magnolia, Stallone in Cop Land — but for all the critical acclaim and Oscar attention those roles might attract, what defined success in 1980s and '90s Hollywood were the ticket sales for such tentpoles as Top Gun, Die Hard, the Rambo movies and The Terminator. Actors had become commodities of scale, defined largely by their ability to summon $100 million grosses.

	











	When the new millennium arrived, that equation shifted yet again, even if the focus on money hadn't. Hollywood's center of gravity moved from stars to franchises. The IP became the real draw — superheroes, wizards, Jedi and other branded worlds. The costume, often spandex, mattered more than the actor inside it (even Redford got in on the act, playing a Marvel villain in Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Stardom no longer was the engine of the movie business; it was just another interchangeable part of the business.


	Then, in the 2010s and '20s, stardom started moving from the big screen to a much smaller stage — the phone. Hollywood was still turning out superhero sagas, prestige dramas and cozy seasonal fare (like that Christmas movie, The Most Wonderful Time, eventually rewritten and released in 2015 as the forgettable Love the Coopers, with Keaton still starring and Redford's role taken by, of all people, John Goodman). But the real competition for attention was moving elsewhere — to feeds and timelines, where fame was measured not by box office totals but by followers.


	Stars used to vanish between films. Today, they're required to stay perpetually present — posting skin care routines, political endorsements, personal podcasts. The carefully curated distance that once made icons feel larger-than-life has been replaced by the algorithmic closeness of TikTok confessionals. Even the indie-minded actors who might've inherited the Keaton/Redford mantle — your Ethan Hawkes, Michelle Williamses, Adam Drivers — have had to negotiate this attention economy. They're still serious actors, but they exist in a culture that prizes access over aura. The art of elusiveness — that quality of unknowable magnetism — has almost vanished.

	











	Every now and then, you catch a glimmer of that older magic — the awkward honesty and unvarnished humanity that defined the 1970s generation. Films like The Holdovers, Licorice Pizza, even Once Upon a Time in Hollywood evoke that mood again, though now it plays like nostalgia for the era when stars like Keaton and Redford ruled the screen. What was once rebellion now reads as retro — authenticity repackaged for an audience yearning for the very messiness that once made those earlier actors feel so real.


	The irony, of course, is that this new generation has more tools than ever to control their image, yet less actual control over how they're perceived. Every red carpet misstep, every viral sound bite, is instantly flattened into content. Stardom, once about transcendence, has become a form of relentless participation.


	As for the next generation of stars — if there's even to be one — it's hard to imagine it resembling the actors who came before, least of all the unruly brood who took over the screen during the 1970s. The conditions that once created icons have splintered. Theaters are shrinking, audiences scattered, and the machinery that once turned actors into household names has gone digital. Stardom used to depend on scarcity; the future will run on replication.


	When a Dutch creator recently introduced Tilly Norwood, a fully AI-generated “actress,” it wasn't her performance that felt uncanny — it was the idea behind it. A star with no past, no flesh-and-blood body, no human connection at all. Just a simulation of emotion, programmed to deliver the illusion of depth. Ironically, it's the exact inverse of what defined the 1970s generation: actors whose power came from being recognizably, sometimes painfully, real.

	











	Stars like Keaton and Redford were messy, mercurial, alive — and that was the point. They and the other '70s actors reminded audiences that being human was the story. Tilly, and the technologies that will follow her, promise something cleaner, faster, cheaper and more controllable — but infinitely less relatable. Maybe that's progress. Or maybe it's the final act in a long process of polishing the humanity out of movie stars altogether.

EP Eric Kripke and showrunner Michele Fazekas also discuss the possibility of 'Gen V' season three, building a team of young supes who can stand against Homelander, and Godolkin's and Sage's fates.


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


[This story contains major spoilers from the Gen V season two finale, “The Guardians of Godolkin.”]


	School's out for the summer at God U, with Gen V's leading supes passing with flying colors in the season-ending fight against Godolkin. 




	The finale helps set up the major battle against Homelander (Antony Starr) in The Boys‘ fifth and final season, but also closed the book on season two's villain twist, some of its leading heroes' biggest tests and the multi-episodic tribute to the late actor Chance Perdomo and his character Andre, whose on-screen passing ultimately helped shape several other characters' journeys across season two.

	“I don't think we would have had this finale,” says showrunner Michele Fazekas, when asked about how the writing team, which had four scripts at the time of Perdomo's death, wrote the ending with his character in mind. “I think it would have turned into a very different season. I don't know what, but it wouldn't have been that. We somewhat started from scratch on a lot of the storylines, and the way we build the story is we try to go where the characters are leading us.”


	The episode doubled as a swan song for the Gen V showrunner, who, after two seasons at the helm of the spinoff, has taken on showrunning duties elsewhere, and thus, returning in some capacity is unlikely. “I don't think I could,” she tells The Hollywood Reporter. “Obviously, there is timing, but no and that's ok. I'm very happy with my work on the show.”

	











	While classes are out for season two and Fazekas has graduated from Gen V, executive producer Eric Kripke notes that the YA series is not done if Prime Video is willing to give it and its supes another school year. “That's a little bit up to the audience and TV gods, but we're ready and willing if we get the nod,” he shares in a separate interview about potential plans for season three. 


	In two separate conversations combined below with Fazekas and Kripke, THR discusses how Gen V season two sets up aspects of The Boys season five, unpacks that Godolkin performance and failed crusade, and explores how the writers developed a group of supes to counter The Boys' biggest antagonist. 


	***


At the end of season two, viewers see A-Train and Starlight appear to invite the Guardians of Godolkin to join the resistance. How much of a role will these young supes, who now kind of look like their own hero team, play in The Boys season five? And how will it be different from the cameos of season four?


ERIC KRIPKE They are palying an important part. Part of the fun of wrapping out season two that way is that we really get to set the table for season five, where there's now this active and growing resistance led by Starlight that A-Train is an important part of. They're really trying to take the fight back to Homelander and this sort of fascist government. By the same respect, we still work hard to try to maintain our balance that The Boys is about The Boys, and Gen V is about Gen V. The characters provide crucial assists, but it's still about The Boys, and you can watch it without having watched Gen V and vice versa. But watching both is still a much more fun experience.

	











Those final moments with their arrival felt a little bit like the shows were merging, as if this could be the end of Gen V. But you don't see it as that? 


KRIPKE We don't play it in season five of The Boys that this is the end of Gen V. We leave them open-ended because we actually have more Gen V story to tell, and we'd love to tell it. It depends on the ratings and how many people end up tuning in. We have to make it so Amazon picks us up for another season. 


“The Hand That Feeds” by Nine Inch Nails plays in those final moments of the finale as the Gen V and The Boys characters meet. It's a song about rebellion and challenging the establishment and status quo. But it's also a political anthem critiquing the Bush administration's foreign policy that the band didn't perform at the 2005 VMAs because they weren't allowed to project an image of Bush's face. Were you aware of that history when you chose it, and if not, how did you land on it? 


MICHELE FAZEKAS I did not know that. Our editor, Maura [Corey], put it in there. She's really, really good at music. We spent a lot of time editing it so that certain parts of the song hit at the right places. So credit to our really amazing editor. 


All season, we've heard Marie can stop Homelander, but there's also the group that surrounds her whose journeys this season sort of represent themes — anti-corruption (Cate), courage over fear (Jordan), the power of difference (Sam), maintaining empathy in the face of cruelty (Emma), rejecting fear of the other (Annabeth), and collectivism over individualism (Marie). Those all feel a little like antidotes to fascism. What did you want to highlight through Marie and her friends about what it means to go from a maladjusted teen to an adult, and the kind of supe necessary to stop Homelander?












FAZEKAS At its heart, any show like this is a coming-of-age story. So what you have in a college show, whether or not it's a superhero show, is these kids who are away from their parents, on their own for the first time, and they have to figure out who they are. Who am I myself, and who am I outside of outside influences? Now, at a place like Godolkin University, we're going to get constant input that you should be this type of superhero. Can you fight that? Can you ignore the outside stuff and really dig down and figure out who you are as a person? What I find interesting about Gen V is the heroes on our show are sort of the villains on The Boys, but they haven't been corrupted yet. 


	And the entire existence of Godolkin University, in part, is: how do we corrupt these kids? We figure out what they want, and then we offer it to them. Cipher knew that with Marie, you want to be powerful. You want to know how powerful you can be, and I can teach you that. So I do think it is about embracing who you are, understanding who you are. Marie and Annabeth were able to mend fences when Annabeth admitted, listen, the reason I'm so mean to you is because I'm blaming myself, and it's easier to blame you than blame me. It's all around the idea that truth is the thing that is the most important, and being true about yourself and being true about what you want. It sounds very self-important in a way, but that's where we ended up.


Marie helps clinch this fight against Godolkin, only after momentarily waffling on the ethics of how to use her powers. Michele previously spoke about what makes Marie different from Homelander and brought up that she was nurtured differently. What other things in your mind make Marie different from Homelander?












KRIPKE She's absolutely right about the childhood. We've been very clear, and you see it with Ryan, too, this nature-nurture argument of how important nurturing is. You can almost line them up. Every single character that isn't a monster, like, had a good childhood.


Marie also has a great band of friends who love her, not fear her. 


KRIPKE Exactly. She has people who trust her, and she trusts. I'd say another thing that's different is Marie's still young, and just because she's incredibly powerful doesn't mean she has perfect control over it. There's a journey. She's not Neo at the end of The Matrix. Those become bummer, boring Messiah characters, and she's not that. She's still a person and has a hard time wrestling with the amount of power that she's finding herself to have. 


The gang doesn't just grow personally but also within their romantic relationships, which seem to have all fallen away by the finale. Why did it feel right to not tie everyone up neatly in a bow before they go fight, and had you thought about where they might go if the show gets to continue?


FAZEKAS I think for both Jordan and Emma, it shows growth for them. Even if Marie didn't want it, Marie had to accept it. It's these first love relationships. You're going to be messy, and you're going to lose yourself in it, and you're going to make bad choices. So when Jordan ends things with Marie, we're not slamming the door on that. We're not slamming the door on anything with Emma and Sam, or even Emma and Greg, if that is the way she goes. But what I really like is that it shows their emotional level up. I need to figure out who I am outside of us, which doesn't mean that we can't revisit it in the future. But it shows maturity.

	











Beyond Marie and her friends, in that final fight, you have two God U students whose powers were running jokes all season, but become essential players against Godolkin. How early on did you know they'd play that pivotal role, and what does it say about Godolkin's ideology?


FAZEKAS We did not know that Black Hole was going to play a pivotal role. He was just a joke based on a real thing called butt chugging that people do in college, evidently. As the season went on and we were figuring out what Godolkin's ultimate goal was, it started to become a nice counterpoint. He's talking about all of these useless superheroes and wanting to get rid of them so we can only focus on the good ones. I really liked telling the story that even the ones that are supposedly useless end up defeating him. That's what elevated the other characters in a really fun way. I also love the storyline of Emma trying to join this small resistance, where all they were doing was graffiti, and she's like, “No, let's really fuck shit up.” She becomes somewhat of a leader in that little group. But when we initially introduced them, we didn't have a clear idea that they were going to pay off in the season finale. It just organically happened. 


Viewers finally see Ethan Slater fully embody Godolkin after Hamish Linklater had been playing him as Cipher for seven episodes. Meanwhile, Linklater becomes Doug. How did you work with them, and if they worked together at all, in order to get to that twist that just plays out so well and ultimately sets up that finale fight? 

	











FAZEKAS They didn't work together, I don't believe. We let Ethan see Hamish's performance, and what we told him was, “We don't want you to be doing a Hamish Linklater impersonation. Just watch it and see what you can incorporate, if anything.” Just so he knows who he's supposed to be — and he did. It's very subtle, which I really like. Just the way he pronounces things, or the specificity of his language, and how he says words. Then I have to say, Hamish becoming a different person, becoming Doug, was — that was all Hamish. He's so good. He wanted to talk it through, well, who is he, and who was he, and where is he from? So he sort of created that himself. I don't think for a moment that [he is] not a different person than [he's] been these past seven episodes. He is a ridiculously talented person. Both of them take their craft seriously and want to study it and want to understand the history of their character. 


We see Sage's relationship and plan with Godolkin, like his head exploding, seemingly explode as well. Is she doing a death march here? How much does Homelander know about what's going on?


KRIPKE Well, it all went pretty sideways on Sage (Laughs). The story about Sage that we really liked — and it was Michele Fazekas' notion — was, “Why can't we give Sage a love story? Does she always have to be just such a calculated robot?” She genuinely loved the guy, and she had this plan. They were gonna move in together, and they were gonna break it to Homelander in a really careful way. They were going to be this power couple. She had this vision of a happy world with the other smartest person in the world, and he just went fucking nuts. She's begging him not to do this. She knew that his going down that path was going to be destructive for both of them. There's a reason she let Polarity out of that prison in the final episode. She knew that she had to ultimately protect her own hide. We play a bit of that. She comes into season five a little heartbroken. This guy really broke her heart. She was already a misanthrope, and it just makes her even more so.

	











Godolkin is seemingly gone, although you've teased he may appear in Vought Rising. We also have Stan Edgar, who appears this season, and now Marie. Who is Homelander up against in The Boys season five? Who are the players, and how fast is this pushback on him?


KRIPKE He's got a lot of people in line who want to bitch slap him. (Laughs) Obviously, Butcher is in the front of that line. But there's Stan Edgar, Marie, Annie, Huey. They're trying to mount a real push, but they're also outgunned, outmanned. You're in an entire country that has drunk Homelander's Kool-Aid. They're outmatched by the size of the hundreds of superheroes that are in every town across the country, who have been given authority over the police. So it really is a true underground resistance against a fascist government, which definitely has no comparison or parallel to anything going on anywhere in the world.

For me, chemistry is everything in a romance—and Samara and Kyle's performances are nothing short of electric. Their crime spree across the American South demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible.”

	











	Rehmeier's previous films include the punk rock romantic comedy Dinner In America, which also starred Gallner, and Snack Shack. Weaving reprises her role as Grace MacCaullay in Ready Or Not 2: Here I Come, and she also stars opposite Jason Segel in the Jorma Taccone thriller Over Your Dead Body, which has been acquired by IFC for theatrical release. 


	Gallner is acclaimed for his chameleon-like range and transformative performances in The Passenger, Strange Darling, Dinner In America and the two Smile films. He reunites with Rehmeier in A Bobby Thing.  


	The deal was negotiated by Magnolia SVP of Acquisitions John Von Thaden, and by CAA Media Finance, Verve Ventures, and UTA Independent Group on behalf of the filmmakers.  FilmNation is representing international rights. Weaving is represented by 111 Media, CAA, Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole and SSM&L; Gallner is represented by Paradigm, Range Media Partners, and attorney Stewart Brookman.  Rehmeier is represented by Verve and Ziffren.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hit TV Star Takes Sudden Break From Show for ‘Personal Reasons'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/chicago-pd-flueger-takes-personal-leave/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:41:05 GMT","

“Chicago P.D.” star Patrick John Flueger is taking a sudden leave of absence from the hit show on due to a personal matter. 

Flueger joined the cast of the popular NBC show in 2014 as Officer Adam Ruzek and has been an integral part of the Intelligence Unit. After many years of their on-and-off relationship, Flueger's character finally married his love interest Detective Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati) in the show's season 12 finale. The television couple share a daughter, Makayla (Ramona Edith Williams), whom they adopted in season 8. Ruzek also looks after his father, Disco Bob (Jack Coleman), who last season was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is now living at a nursing home.

“Patty and I have great chemistry and he's my best friend in the whole world,” Squerciati told PEOPLE on working alongside Flueger. She added that he is, “truly is one of my closest friends.”

“I think that that chemistry just shows and we love working together,” Squerciati said.

On their fan-favorite wedding episode, the actress said, “I wanted the classic wedding. I'm glad it was in a church. I'm glad it was a real wedding. They deserve it.” Adam and Kim's wedding marked the show's first formal nuptials.

Previously in the “Chicago” universe, Taylor Kinney, who stars in “Chicago Fire,” took a leave of absence similar to Flueger. Kinney returned to the show after 10 months. His leave of absence also pertained to him needing to “deal with a personal matter.”

Kinney has played Lieutenant Kelly Severide since “Chicago Fire” premiered in 2012. His character has gone on to become an integral part of the series, eventually going on to appear on the network's many One Chicago franchise spin-offs “Chicago P.D.” and “Chicago Med.”

On January 29, all three shows had a crossover event with Flueger and Kinney appearing in the same episode. In the episode, characters from NBC's “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago P.D.,” and “Chicago Med” came together to save the day after a dangerous gas explosion.

Deadline was first to report the news. “The temporary departure was unexpected, and scripts are being reworked to reflect Ruzek's absence, we hear. According to sources, the time off comes as Flueger has been going through a difficult period personally, with an instance of alcohol use on set.”

Luckily for fans of the police drama, PEOPLE has confirmed that Flueger plans to return later this season. 

“Chicago P.D.” is currently in its 13th season. This season revolves around the Intelligence Unit coming back together after they disbanded following the fallout of Deputy Chief Charlie Reid (Shawn Hatosy), which was led by Voight. Ruzek and Burgess have been focused on their new family life as a married couple.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Julianne Hough Weighs In on Robert Irwin's Unexpected Job Offers","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/julianne-hough-responds-robert-irwin-chippendales-offer/","Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:41:00 GMT","

Julianne Hough is weighing in on one of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34's most talked-about moments, and it doesn't even involve a score from the judges. After contestant Robert Irwin revealed he'd received offers to join Chippendales following his shirtless routine with partner Witney Carson, Hough couldn't help but laugh at the unexpected attention the 21-year-old wildlife conservationist has been getting.

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

After the shirtless routine, it seems that Irwin received offers to host with Chippendales. TMZ approached Hough about the job offer, and she joked, “I saw there's this older millennial group of women trying to do the math to see if that's appropriate or not.”

She laughed about this before ultimately saying that it probably isn't appropriate.

Irwin, who has been a fan-favorite on every episode of “Dancing With the Stars” 2025, ultimately turned down the job offer. Hough laughed when TMZ informed her that he turned it down, agreeing with Robert, saying that it was “the right move.”

While she thought it was the right move, she did go on to say that he has the skills to take on the job. “He's killing it,” she added. “He's amazing.”

The “Dancing With the Stars” co-host went on to say that “everybody on the show this year is incredible.”

That has helped the show bring in a record number of votes each week, which Hough continued, “I just love that everybody's watching. Thanks for watching, guys!”

After the news came out about the job offer from Chippendales, Irwin did address it while speaking to Entertainment Tonight.

In the interview, he confirmed, “It is true,” while laughing. His partner, Carson, was shocked.

Robert added, 

“I'm all about anything to push the conservation message. But, yeah, Chippendales, sorry, but it's just not quite. Mate, all power to 'em, but not for me. Not right now.”

While some fans might be disappointed by that news, he did continue, teasing “DWTS” fans, “I'll take the shirt off now and again, but I'm gonna draw the line there.”

@JulesHough #dwts #dancingwiththestars 

While fans are gushing over Robert Irwin every week, it looks like Julianne was having her own moment last week during Dedication Night.

While she and her co-host, Alfonso Ribeiro, were making their way out to the dancefloor, she almost tripped and fell on her dress. However, Hough handled it like a pro, laughed it off, and kept the cameras rolling.

“Dancing With the Stars” season 34 airs on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET, with new episodes available to stream the next day on Hulu.

Few actresses get the chance to make the entrance that German actress Nina Hoss (“Homeland,” “Tár”) does in Nia DaCosta's entertaining, visually lush adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's classic play “Hedda Gabler,” “Hedda.” According to Hoss, it's all in the screenplay.

We sat down at the Four Seasons to parse her latest tour-de-force performance. This time, Tessa Thompson plays the title role that Hoss had played 15 years ago on the German stage. And Hoss takes on Hedda‘s ex-lover, which DaCosta turned from brilliant, self-destructive academic Eilert Lövborg into brilliant, self-destructive academic Eileen Lövborg. It's a juicy role, and Hoss makes the most of it.

“The entrance is in the script,” Hoss said. “In the play, Hedda is constantly talking about Eilert Lövborg, now the woman Eileen, so there is this big expectation. Who is this person that seems to be on Hedda's mind? Everyone seems a little afraid and a little unsure. She seems to have changed. So something's up, but there a history between those two. But no one knows exactly what, as well. And then she arrives. It's this moment where time stands still and something is shifting. It's exciting, but you don't know what's going to happen. And I love that. If that happens in a film, you have everything.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Key to her impact: what she is wearing. In '50s England, her professional academic lesbian shows up in a provocatively sexy outfit with a gauzy bodice. Unlike the rotten food color palette of dark and yellowish greens and dark reds that DaCosta deploys to suggest “that something's not quite right in this world that we're seeing,” said Hoss, costume designer Lindsay Pugh put her in a black corset, “not too business-y. And we knew the top [had] to be see-through.” 

As far as her allure goes, Eileen “is not shying away,” said Hoss. “She's confident in that way.”

But she has other anxieties. “She's not really self-assured at that moment when she comes in,” said Hoss. “She doesn't know how to hold herself because she's not drinking anymore. ‘I might step into something that I might not have the power to withstand.' So she's not quite sure if she can manage this night. ‘Who am I, if I don't have that drink at hand that I can just get lighter and lose control with joy?'”

Two women are tracking Eileen at the party: Her hostess and ex-lover Hedda (Tessa Thompson), and her new partner Thea (Imogen Poots), “who's looking after her and gives her assurance that ‘you are a beautiful, worth-being-loved person,'” said Hoss. “She brings all of that, and that's, of course, something Hedda has to destroy [laughs]. Eileen expected that in some way, but she didn't quite know that it could get that vicious, and that far.”

 










We watch with horror as Hedda manipulates Eileen to get her to drink again. In a masterful moment, Eileen enters a library of her male peers and runs the room with her smart banter. “I loved doing that scene,” said Hoss. “She can hold the room. She's witty. She's funny. She misses the fact that there's something embarrassing happening with her dress. But even more, I love her for how she holds herself and how she just doesn't even try to understand why there are certain looks, because these looks are there anyway, so she knows what she's entering into, and she has learned along the way how to deal with it with humor and with self-assurance.”

Changing the character from a man to a woman was a huge improvement as far as Hoss is concerned. The Henrik Ibsen play “Hedda Gabler” and this movie aren't that far apart, except for this gender shift, '50s English manor setting, and the all-night party. 

“In the play, you hear about the party, but you're never in one,” said Hoss. “I've always thought, ‘Why has no one ever thought about making Lövborg a woman?' Because it charges everything. It's so much more powerful. We're more used to one man who tries to get the same position as the other man. You know the dynamics. When I read the script for the first time, I thought, ‘Oh, my God, it makes so much sense. It changes the dynamic between all the other characters.'”

 










If Hedda is trapped by the old ways, it's more exciting to have the representative of the new world that she could have been part of, that she rejected, be a woman, this woman. A male is just another representative of the patriarchy. 

“Lövborg doesn't want Hedda to be anything other than the one who admires him,” said Hoss. “Hedda is someone who lived the adventure and then went back into becoming part of a society that she doesn't quite know how to do anymore. And that's what Eileen challenges: ‘How can you deny yourself? What kind of life should that be? You know who you are, and why do you put yourself in that restriction, in that cage again?'”

Watching Hedda and Eileen duke it out at the party is both horrifying and delicious. “Eileen is trying to see where Hedda's at,” said Hoss. “And Hedda sees her in a different light and in a different way, and sees that she would have had the opportunity to change her life and do something else with her. But instead of working on herself, she works on the others. Eileen challenges it, but she wouldn't ever want to destroy Hedda. No one is really innocent and pure and good and positive. No, we all have our flaws, and we all have to check ourselves. And there's a lot of the grasp for power, or being better than others.”

 










Hoss compares Hedda to Hamlet. “We actresses all find Hedda so fascinating,” she said. “Hedda doesn't belong to any of us, just like Hamlet doesn't belong to any of the male actors. It's like everyone finds their own entryway and interpretation of that character. You can't put a rope on her. She's not a horse. She is a wild card, and when you play her, you make up your mind why she does certain things. But as a viewer, you're confused. Why does this female character go that far? It's also a slightly sick and weird kind of freedom. And it is, of course, a power game, because she enjoys having the power over everyone in the party.”

When Hoss came on board the project, the script was written, and Thompson (who also produces alongside DaCosta) was already cast as Hedda. “A lot happened during rehearsals,” said Hoss. “We were lucky enough to have a lot of time to read through, to be together in the North of England on this estate, to be in the actual rooms. It was all ready, so we had the time to feel it out, be in this bedroom, in the hall, in the garden at the lake. And there we had to figure out, what does it do to Hedda that Eileen is a woman, that she's challenged in a different way, and what is it then? What is it that Hedda feels that she has to restrict herself?”

 










“Hedda” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.  Amazon MGM will release the film in select theaters on Wednesday, October 22 and then globally on Prime Video on Wednesday, October 29. 

Next up: Hoss starred in “The Cherry Orchard” in London at the Donmar Warehouse in 2024, which then moved to St. Ann's Warehouse in New York. She has been shooting three films: one German, one French, and one Italian, which should be released in 2026. “When I am in English, I'm in a phase where I enjoy that I'm not in total control, and that there is this otherness,” said Hoss. “But you work through it, and you find a different kind of freedom in that. The same with French, you become another actor all of a sudden, because the language does something else with you. And it's fun to explore that. I switch back and forth between London and Berlin; I live in both.”

Three police officers in Minneapolis spotted an unidentified flying object that was spherical in shape with six glowing rings that changed colors.

Anonymous witnesses filed a report with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a nonprofit organization led by former US Navy pilot and whistleblower Ryan Graves, saying they observed the object from a parking garage using binoculars.

According to the report, one officer followed the object in a police car, while the other two continued to observe from the garage.

Officers described the object as hanging hundreds of meters high, moving at slow but hypersonic speeds, and generating lift without any noise.

Even more surprising, the report described a very close encounter between the unidentified flying object and a civilian helicopter.

The sighting took place near Minnesota's Prairie Island nuclear power plant, a detail that has raised eyebrows among UFO researchers, given the site's strategic importance.

The incident happened in February, but Graves shared the report on X on Monday. A similar sighting was recorded on July 7 in Anoka, about a mile from the witness. /Telegraph/","{'href': 'https://telegrafi.com', 'title': 'Telegrafi'}","other"

  The Delta King on the Sacramento River is one of several hotspots
  of the purported paranormal in Old Sacramento. Visitors and staff
  have reported sightings of a little girl and a middle-aged man
  who appear to be from a bygone era. (Photos by Scott Thomas

Exploring the dark history of Old Sacramento

  Shannon McCabe peers out from the Delta King, seeing its bow
  touched in twilight and gangplank lost in turning shadows. Her
  friend Wendy Russell leans over the deck's edge to watch a dead
  emerald tide gliding out towards the sundown. McCabe is widely
  known for hosting her eponymous Vampire Ball, a sumptuous
  spectacle of Gothic pageantry where acrylic fangs, blood-colored
  wine and live music electrify a nocturnal tribute to immortal
  wandering.



  Her annual fright festival happens this year on Saturday, October
  25. But right now, watching dusk draw on the 98-year-old planks
  of the mighty paddleboat, that is not what's on McCabe's mind.
  Her thoughts are drifting back to when she and Russell led ghost
  tours through Old Sacramento's cavernous bones of the frontier.



  Back then, the pair organized private walking excursions, though
  a few times they procured a black hearse that could drive some
  eight attendees into the darker thoroughfares.



  “I loved the folklore,” McCabe admits, glancing at the ship's red
  wheel warming in the floodlights. “I loved the stories. I loved
  to go around and tell people strange things that have happened to
  me and my friends as we walked through these darkened hallways of
  the Delta King, or down into the alleys of Old Sac.”



  I'm having a glass of wine with McCabe and Russell outside of the
  Delta King's Pilothouse restaurant, the original grand dining
  room, now a bar and restaurant adorned in intricate stained-glass
  windows depicting life on the Sacramento River. It's one of the
  best vantage points for seasonal festivities along the
  waterfront, including the Yuletide boat parade. I ask McCabe and
  Russell why the 280-foot vessel from the days of Prohibition is
  one of the first hits that comes up whenever Googling “haunted
  Sacramento.”




  Shannon McCabe, known for her annual Vampire Ball, hangs out at
  Honey and the Trap Cat, an underground bar in Old Sacramento
  where she once had her own spooky experience.

  Honey and the Trap Cat, an underground bar in Old Sacramento
  where she once had her own spooky experience.



  “There are two apparitions that show up regularly here on the
  Delta King,” McCabe says. “One is a girl who's 8 to 10 years old,
  with long blond hair and wearing a full-length cotton dress.
  She's seen running through the halls and hiding and giggling from
  guests and workers, usually on the second floor.” Child-size
  footprints have also been spotted on the ship's deck in the
  morning dew.



  “The other apparition that's seen is a middle-aged man in a light
  button-up shirt with dark pants, who's wearing a Navy blue cap,”
  McCabe notes. “He's seen in the early morning hours wandering the
  lobby and hallways. Sometimes employees have experienced phantom
  energy, like hearing a glass break near the mystery theater room,
  then finding nothing broken anywhere.”



  Such reports show why paranormal tourism has been a steady draw
  for Sacramento's waterfront over the years. Now that McCabe and
  Russell are focused on other projects, a newer company called US
  Ghost Adventures is offering narrated tours of the same
  neighborhood. Its guides usually have their walking groups stop
  at the Delta King.   



  Between glasses of chardonnay, McCabe asks our waiter if he's
  ever experienced anything bizarre or uncanny at work. The young
  man responds that his supervisor refuses to go to the bottom of
  the ship alone. In fact, he adds chattily, if his supervisor has
  to go anywhere on the Delta King that's not in its restaurant or
  within view of people, she makes another employee follow her. He
  says that's because employees have heard a little girl talking or
  singing in parts of the boat that no one has access to.



  McCabe and Russell raise their eyebrows at me and smile.



  The streets of Old Sacramento have similar tales after
  experiencing a steady stream of death. In August of 1850, city
  officials and a faction of rebellious settlers were involved in
  back-to-back gunfights that killed nine men, including
  Sacramento's first assessor, J.W. Woodward, and its first
  sheriff, Joseph McKinney. Then, a few months later on Halloween,
  local newspapers warned that “the Blue Death” — cholera — had
  arrived on the river docks. More than 800 Sacramentans would die
  in the next three months.



  Real events are entwined in ghost traditions. I've learned by
  taking paranormal-themed tours throughout the country and in
  Europe that the longer a neighborhood has existed and the more
  generations have passed through it, the deeper the strata of
  memory baked into its walls and streets. Ghost tourism is really
  about treading on the most intense elements of an area's legacy —
  conditions so extreme that we can imagine forlorn and poignant
  echoes reverberating from them.



  McCabe says that one night in 2009, she had her own encounter
  with the inexplicable. While prepping for her Vampire Ball in an
  Old Sacramento basement bar, a watering hole now called Honey and
  the Trapcat, which is at the original street level (Old Sac was
  raised 15 feet after a catastrophic flood in 1862), she could
  hear someone following her around, even though she knew she was
  alone. Others have reported seeing a woman from another time
  disappear right in front of them at that same bar.



  Now, watching McCabe and Russell sip wine at sunset, it's clear
  that their love affair with the dim shades bending beyond the
  boat are cemented by history and possibilities. “All I can think
  of is what it was before I walked on those grounds,” Russell
  admits. “For me, it's the fascination of what's beyond the
  present world.”

Latest strike, off coast of Colombia, killed two people while seven previous attacks in Caribbean killed at least 34

US politics live – latest updates

The US military has attacked and destroyed another boat in its ongoing and controversial fight against what it says are drug-trafficking activities.

The strike for the first time was carried out on the Pacific side of South America. Previous attacks have hit seven vessels in the Caribbean and killed at least 32 people.

The latest strike took place off the coast of Colombia and killed two people, according to a person briefed on the operation. It marked a departure from previous strikes, which have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, where the US has deployed an extraordinary military presence.

In a brief video released by US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a small boat, half-filled with brown packages, is seen moving along at sea. Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless in flames.
 In his post, Hegseth took the unusual step of equating the alleged drug traffickers to the terror group that conducted the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.
 “Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

In striking a boat in the Pacific, the administration widened the scope of its campaign, although the reasons for the expansion were not immediately clear. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and Hegseth gave no additional details other than the video on X.

Donald Trump announced what appears to have been the first strike on a boat on 3 September, releasing a brief video of the attack.

Since then, the Trump administration has detailed more strikes without disclosing many details about the targets other than the number of people killed, and the allegation that the boats carried narcotics. The attacks have prompted widespread condemnation, both from civil liberties groups and South American nations.

On Tuesday the Guardian revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is providing the bulk of the intelligence used to carry out the airstrikes. Experts say the agency's central role means much of the evidence used to select the targets will almost certainly remain secret.

The president confirmed last Wednesday that he had authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela, but not what the agency would be doing.

White House officials have tried to justify the increasing number of strikes with a dubious legal theory that claims the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organizations” with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardian has reported.

Until this month, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.

White House officials have also sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article two powers, which allow the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.

The self-defense argument revolves around Trump's designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.

The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel's members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.

But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.

The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC), the Guardian has previously reported.

Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Trump's second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.

That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.

Batteries are still a valued commodity, and hybrids make the best use of the necessary materials.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Are electric vehicles really the future? It's a question that has plagued the automotive industry for decades as we continue to understand the environmental impact of internal combustion engines. EVs have seemingly gotten much more popular over the last decade, but sales haven't reflected that. And that's a major catalyst behind Toyota's strategy to prioritize the construction and sale of hybrid vehicles over electric vehicles.

I recently learned about the brand's 1:6:90 initiative during a recent excursion to its Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) facility—currently responsible for building the Camry, the RAV4, Lexus ES, and Lexus 300h. Toyota's internal strategy suggests that the raw materials for one electric vehicle could be used to build six plug-in hybrids or 90 traditional hybrids; Kerry Creech, the president of TMMK, said during a roundtable that the main motivation was to optimize resource efficiency. That's also not to discount that the carbon reduction achieved by building (and driving) 90 hybrids would not be insignificant compared to selling just one electric vehicle.

The biggest brains in automotive engineering have been working to reduce carbon emissions for decades. It's not rocket science that EVs emit zero carbon, but they never became mainstream in the way many expected them to. Range anxiety remains a significant concern for many motorists who are on the fence about purchasing an electric vehicle as their next automobile. Hybrids and plug-in hybrids are infinitely more attractive, as they give customers a taste of all-electric power that's supplemented by good old-fashioned gasoline.

While many brands like Tesla are engineering cutting-edge tech, Toyota's more nuanced approach is selling customers what they actually want. The latter stance resonates with a greater number of buyers who aren't quite ready to make the jump to an electric vehicle. For context, let's take a look at Toyota's RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid. Unlike conventional hybrids, which use electric drive to supplement the internal combustion engine, plug-in hybrids can also travel a limited range on electric power alone.

For those of you who are still driving into an office five days a week, research says the average American drives approximately 30 miles a day. That means the RAV4 Prime and Prius Prime would both be able to complete the average American commute without burning a drop of gasoline; RAV4 Prime can do 42 miles on just the battery, and Prius Prime can do 44 miles. Pretty cool, right?

We should clarify that while Toyota's manufacturing initiative prioritizes the production of hybrids, these vehicles are actually quite complicated—even compared to modern EVs. All hybrids, regardless of which brand you buy from, are brilliant at extracting new levels of efficiency from a tank of gas. In fact, getting an internal combustion engine and electric propulsion system to behave is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to making these vehicles tick.

Internal combustion engines love consistency. That's because many of the fluids that lubricate the internals work best after they've reached a specific temperature window. As you may know, hybrid systems have the engine clicking on and off constantly; while that's great for efficiency, it's generally not enough runtime to get the fluids properly warmed up. So much so, in fact, that hybrids often use lower viscosity oils to cope with the lower operating temperatures induced by these stop-start scenarios.

If it wasn't abundantly clear, hybrid vehicles still make a ton of sense. If you're in the market for a new vehicle, we'd still find it hard to recommend an EV over a straightforward hybrid.

Having said that, there are automakers out there like Scout Motors that have flipped the hybrid idea on its head. Scout's latest vehicles will have an available Extended-Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) powertrain featuring electric drive that's supported by an internal combustion “range extender.” It's much simpler than a “conventional” hybrid system as the internal combustion engine isn't connected to the wheels—it's merely acting as a generator.

You keen readers will know we've seen the same idea as far back as 2013 with vehicles like the BMW i3. However, Scout's EREV architecture appears to be a considerable advancement over the half-baked powertrain found in BMW's kitschy hatchback. Assuming the numbers are right, it could potentially offer more than 500 miles of range on a single charge.

Several years ago, as a skunkworks team of engineers inside Rivian set out to develop an electric micromobility vehicle, one question loomed. “What do we build in-house?” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview recounting the early days of Also, which spun out of Rivian earlier this year.

“We realized the only way to do this well is to build everything,” said Scaringe, who sits on Also's board. 

The result, which was revealed Wednesday at an event in Oakland, is a pedal-assist electric bike called the TM-B that is more than just a bike, according to Scaringe and Also President Chris Yu. “This is a whole platform of products we're going to build in the microspace,” Scaringe said. And Scaringe wasn't kidding. During the Wednesday event, Also revealed two quad-vehicles as well, one of which will be supplied to Amazon.

At a passing glance, this “more than a bike” looks like a bike, albeit a sleekly designed one that has a few hidden-in-plain sight features. But Yu contends that what lies beneath the surface is what makes the TM-B special and compelling enough to break into a crowded e-bike market.

The TM-B will come in several trims, including a launch edition, performance, and base versions. 

The launch edition has identical specs with the performance trim, including a battery that has an estimated 100-mile range, 10 assistive levels, air shocks and air fork for the suspension, and two ride modes including sport that zips the rider down the road. The launch edition, which costs $4,500, is sprinkled with special “launch” colors of a purple ube and blue, and will come to market this spring.

The performance trim, which also retails at $4,500, is expected to come to market in the first half of 2026. The base version, which has a battery with up to 60 miles of range, five assistive levels, an air shock and coil fork for the suspension, and one standard ride mode, is expected to cost less than $4,000 when it hits the market in the second half of next year, according to Yu.

All of the bikes are equipped with front and rear LED lighting with integrated turn signals and have a top speed of 20 miles per hour. Biomotion design illuminates rider's legs as they pedal on the TM-B, which has 24-inch wheels. The TM-B can also be outfitted with all-terrain tires, pedals, and a trail ride mode that gives riders more manual control over the ride.

The battery is removable and comes with USB-C fast charging up to 240 watts that lets users power up devices. 

There is an integrated security feature to keep the battery and the bike safe as well. The security system is engaged once the rider walks away from the bike automatically locks the battery, wheels, and frame. If it is tampered with, the rider will receive an alert via the Also app and the bike itself will emit a loud honking sound. 

As a side note: that honking sound can be deployed by the rider as they navigate city streets. 

“You get a push notification in the unfortunate case when it starts moving away because we have LTE and GPS, and we have a real time, location,” Yu said while on stage Wednesday. In a worse-case scenario, if the bike is physically picked up and placed in a vehicle, the ebike owner can remotely disable it. 

“You can brick it,” Yu said. “And this is key, because since we own every board, every piece of software, every part of the bike, that means that no part of this is usable.”

Everything was developed by the Also and Rivian team, including the removable battery pack, power electronics, software, firmware, and a pedal-by-wire propulsion system that has no mechanical connection between a rider's pedaling and the movement of the bike. 

Even the tools to build these elements were designed here, according to Also CTO Jonathan Hall, who spoke to TechCrunch ahead of the event. 

All of the trims have several standout design and functional features, including a central touchscreen display that is integrated between the handlebars, and a modular top frame that allows the user to change from a solo, bench, or utility cargo setup within a few seconds. 

The standard solo seat comes with two water bottle cages. The utility setup has an integrated rear rack, one water bottle cage mount, and can carry about additional 77 pounds of cargo. Also is offering a third bench option as well. And all of these can be swapped out in a few seconds and without tools.

Notably, the software of each setup is aligned with that user and syncs with the central touchscreen. 

Like over at Rivian, Also's software is a central figure of its electric bike and will continue to be used to roll out new features, Yu told TechCrunch. For instance, software is used to provide accurate navigation and ETA to the rider by tightly integrating with the motion and speed of the ebike. 

“Because we know so much about your experience, we know what assist level you're in, we know what ride load you're in, we know the average speed that you've been going — we can give you a really, really precise ETA,” Yu said while showing off the TM-B on stage. “It sounds simple, but you're using this as a vehicle to get somewhere. It kind of matters to know when you're going to get there.”

The company also developed a helmet in-house called the Alpha Wave Helmet that uses a newly developed technology to improve rotational impact protection and a redesigned strap so the user can tighten it — no snapping — with one hand.

The helmet has numerous tech features beyond protecting your brain, including integrated lights and an audio system with four wind-shielded speakers and two noise-canceling microphones. The helmet syncs with the bike's central “portal” touchscreen or the rider's phone so they can listen to music, take calls, and receive turn-by-turn navigation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 40% of older adults in Italy reported skipping medical visits, with fear of infection and service disruptions reported as main reasons. Women, those with economic difficulties, and those with chronic conditions were more likely to forgo care.

""Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, improving communication, and supporting healthcare professionals with tools like telemedicine are key to building a more equitable and resilient healthcare system. Continuous monitoring is essential to respond to shifting reasons behind care renunciation and to guide effective, inclusive health strategies,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Benedetta Contoli, National Centre for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy. It was published online on October 13, 2025, in the European Journal of Public Health.

This study relied on self-reported data. The timing of the questions on healthcare renunciation may not have aligned perfectly with the COVID-19 emergency for all respondents. The coverage of the surveillance was lower in Northern regions, particularly Lombardy that did not participate, potentially affecting the generalisability of the findings.

This study did not receive any external financial support. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Of all the film festivals to fill the theaters throughout the year in Chicago, the Chicago International Film Festival offers the broadest scope and the biggest selection of films from names familiar to cinephiles and those who will be soon enough. This year, the 61st edition features 111 feature films, which range from local talent (like the latest from All Jacked Up And Full Of Worms‘ Alex Phillips) to the kinds of festival hits that critics have been tantalizing arthouse devotees with all year (like Annemarie Jacir's Palestine 36, Christian Petzold's Miroirs No. 3, Agnieszka Holland's Franz, and Clint Bentley's Train Dreams). So, as much as I'd like to cover the two dozen or so films in the fest that we've already reviewed at The A.V. Club, I was left to dodge those and instead hunt for some movies that've fallen through the cracks. Luckily, there were plenty of debuts to take a chance on at the Chicago International Film Festival 2025, and a pair of features from Romanian eye-poker Radu Jude to decide between. 

Seeing as we've got a piece on Jude's Dracula coming later in the month, I'm opting to highlight Kontinental '25. Compared to the sweeping and ungainly satires that've helped put Jude on the international map—films like Bad Luck Banging Or Loony Porn and Do Not Expect Too Much From The End Of The World—Kontinental '25 is contained, focused, and almost subtle. Well, as subtle as a comedy about a woman making a homeless man's suicide all about her can be. This warped, slimy take on Roberto Rossellini's Europa ‘51 refocuses that cinematic guilt trip on the amusing insufficiencies of the modern self-righteous. After Orsolya (Eszter Tompa) and a battalion of cops evict an otherwise homeless man (Gabriel Spahiu) from her boiler room, he kills himself, and Orsolya spends the following 100 minutes telling everyone she can find that it wasn't her fault.



The feature-length jab at well-meaning yet ultimately impotent (or worse) progressivism features a recurring punchline where Olsolya reminds everyone that she isn't legally responsible for this death, of course, and a form that reflects its subject matter. Jude's familiarly static camera—the film's no-budget iPhone set-up strategically placed to allow two characters to converse in the middle of the frame—letting the people in Kontinental '25 hang themselves with their own tone-deaf confessions, self-aggrandizing delusions, and weak-tea protests. As Olsolya talks with her family, her co-workers, her ex-student, and even her priest, the camera never flinches away from her wandering, self-centered quest for absolution.

It's less funny and less provocative than Jude's last few films, but its unrelenting focus on a pervasive contemporary feeling—that all we can do is sit and stare at the mounting atrocities around us—brings the massive problems of economic inequality, senseless war, and rampant racism down to a familiar level. Solving them as a society seems impossible. Successfully addressing them on an individual level, without becoming a bloviating hypocrite, is as absurd as Kontinental '25.

Similarly tough to watch but ultimately more upbeat in the long run is the sharp debut from writer-director Charlie Polinger: The Plague. Shrinking down the masculine hardships, bottled-up pain, and explosive release of Beau Travail for a group of preteen water polo players, Polinger's film ostensibly got made thanks to the help of producer-actor Joel Edgerton. But it's the young cast, filled with up-and-comers like Everett Blunck (who also starred in last year's Tribeca film Griffin In Summer), who makes this anxiety-inducing look at pubescent social structures so thrilling—and so brutal.

The story is told through the eyes of Tom Lerner Water Polo Camp newcomer Ben (Blunck). It's 2003 and little white boys with bleach-blond hair are saying “Okayyy” like Lil Jon. But even if the film is set two decades ago, the painful bonafides of its male social circle haven't aged a day. As Ben figures out where he'll sit in the cafeteria and how he'll avoid getting himself an embarrassing nickname after a single conversation with the cool clique, he finds that he's not a member of the lowest caste at camp. That dishonor belongs to Eli (Kenny Rasmussen), who all the other kids refer to as “The Plague” due to a pimply rash on his face and back. Don't talk to him, don't go near him, and definitely don't touch him.

Of course, Eli is just an uncool little weirdo who wears a long-sleeve shirt at all hours and spends his time perfecting sleight-of-hand tricks and doing Gollum impressions (again, it's 2003). He's not a leper, but he might as well be thanks to The Plague‘s insightful understanding of how kids sniff out, then target weaknesses. Riled up by their leader Jake (Kayo Martin, perfectly cruel), the teammates bully mostly by omission, but as these kinds of thrillers go, things escalate—and they don't stop with Eli. As the film dives into body horror's sensory deep end, cinematographer Steven Breckon's enticing slo-mo underwater photography somewhat undermined by Johan Lenox's relentless score, you quickly hit the bottom of its shallow characters. But that's not a flaw that demands banishment; aside from some ultra-direct speeches (especially from Edgerton, who plays their preachy coach) and an ending that lifts whole cloth from Claire Denis' classic, the exciting debut boasts some honest and cutting commentary around these angry, confused little boys.

Also assessing the foibles of kids on the cusp of teenagerdom is the dazzling French animated sci-fi Arco. Splitting the aesthetic difference between a classic piece of French animated sci-fi (Fantastic Planet) and the dreamy, youthful films of Hayao Miyazaki, Arco follows a young far-future time-traveler who, with the help of a purloined rainbow supersuit, travels back to the robot-filled year of 2075. This is the feature debut of filmmaker Ugo Bienvenu, who directed a music video for electropop band Jabberwocky that throws back to older-school comics. This film is filled with clean, smooth Golden Age sci-fi designs and an English-dubbed voice cast including Natalie Portman, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Mark Ruffalo, and Andy Samberg.

﻿

But really, it's just the story of a boy, Arco (Juliano Valdi), who bumps into a girl, Iris (Romy Fay). Even if they hail from different eras, with different responses to the failures of humanity and its effect on the planet, they're still kids who share a timeless curiosity. They learn about each other as they learn about the worlds they come from, evading dangers both mundane and existential as they grow closer together. It's this relationship and the swelling, motif-driven, Joe Hisaishi-like score from Arnaud Toulon that makes Arco feel most like a Ghibli film, because the rest is broader—both in style and narrative—than anything from that studio.

A trio of oddball brothers pursues Arco through this brightly colored retro-future, where the caretaker robots have the nostalgic design of The Venture Bros.‘ H.E.L.P.eR. and the parents are all working somewhere else, represented only by holograms. It's truly a kid's world, left to their own devices even as the devices have gotten exponentially more sophisticated. But few of the film's goofy genre specifics get fleshed out over the course of its zippy story, and none of its themes ever access the grandiose universality so elegantly tapped into by the best anime. That's not what Arco is interested in. Rather, the endearing central relationship and breezily drawn future settings confirm Arco as a soft sci-fi story that still only has respect for its young audience.
