Reform leader Nigel Farage has vowed to oppose the creation of a U.K. central bank digital currency (CBDC), declaring he would ‚Äúrather go to prison‚Äù than live under what he described as a system of government financial control.

He said the idea of a state-controlled digital pound ‚Äúfills [him] with total and utter horror‚Äù, calling it an ‚Äúauthoritarian step‚Äù incompatible with personal liberty. ‚ÄúI asked him straight ‚Äî are you still progressing your plans for a British central bank digital currency? ‚ÄúBailey and I may not agree on things, but he's honest. Reflecting on his own experience being ‚Äúdebanked‚Äù two years ago, Farage said the incident reinforced his belief in crypto as a tool for personal empowerment. ‚ÄúWhen I was debanked, I realised this is the ultimate freedom ‚Äî being in control securely of your own money, making your own decisions, free from authoritarian government,‚Äù he said. Farage said he now viewed crypto as ‚Äúthe antidote to financial censorship‚Äù and promised to lead a campaign for ‚Äúindividual liberty, freedom, independence and choice.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there's enough of us to win this great battle. Asked whether he had personally invested in digital assets, Farage replied, ‚ÄúYeah, of course.‚Äù He acknowledged the risks of speculative trading but distinguished it from long-term investment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto industry recently had one of its worst days ever. That's the largest ever liquidation event tracked by crypto-focused data analytics firm CoinGlass. The wipeout marked a dark spot for the digital assets market in an otherwise strong year for cryptocurrencies that saw bitcoin and ether hit record highs. More than a week after the event, its ripples are being felt most in smaller coins. Bitcoin and ether are trading between roughly 11% and 12% below their respective Oct. 10 highs, with the former token trading above its critical $100,000 resistance level and the latter hovering within striking distance of its key $4,000 price, according to a CNBC analysis of CoinMetrics data. Bitcoin and ether's comparative resilience is largely due to the fact that the two largest cryptos by market capitalization are older and more well established than alternative digital assets, GSR head of content and special projects Frank Chaparro told CNBC. "They're just bigger, more established assets, with ETFs and other structured products behind them," Chaparro said. Chaparro also noted that bitcoin and ether suffered less losses compared to alternative crypto-assets in this month's massive liquidation event. Solana, dogecoin, XRP and BNB are often used for leveraged trading on centralized or decentralized exchanges. "There's always been a lot of leverage in crypto," Fundstrat Global Advisors head of research Tom Lee said last week on CNBC. "The volatility and leverage is what has drawn people into that space, especially when you get outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, [which] are generally not held on margin." Leverage refers to the funds traders borrow to open positions that are larger than the initial capital invested, or margin, that they put up front. A position is liquidated, or forcibly closed, when the collateral a trader used to secure that position is no longer sufficient to cover their losses. The crypto wipeout came after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed earlier on Oct. 10 to impose "massive" tariffs on China, sending ripples across financial markets. "You have effectively what's been described as a doom loop in which the initial price drop triggers some liquidations. And when you're unwinding those positions into an order book that's thin...the spot prices of the assets that are being unwound crater," Chaparro said. "If you have one bitcoin as collateral when it's 100k, your collateral position is a lot different than when it's trading at 70k, and so then more accounts become under collateralized, and the cycle repeats itself." Last year, the U.S. approved the launch of several spot bitcoin ETFs as well as exchange traded funds that track ether, with issuers later rolling out offerings boasting two- or three-times leverage on the tokens' movements. Offshore, decentralized exchanges such as Hyperliquid and Binance Labs-linked Aster are becoming popular with traders that want to make bets on crypto with even more leverage. The former offers maximum leverage of 40-times for bitcoin and 25-times for ether, while Aster offers as much as 1,001x leverage, depending on the token. Trading products with more leverage appeal to investors because they offer higher returns. However, with the potential for higher rewards comes even greater likelihood of losses, according to Zach Pandl, head of research at crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale. On top of that, crypto's infrastructure for leveraged trading hasn't evolved to suit the market's particularities, Chaparro said. And, with crypto markets, you don't have the same traditional forces that can as easily prevent or remedy stress, like circuit breakers," Chaparro said. Crypto researcher Molly White wrote in her blog that the Oct. 10 liquidation event could be a harbinger of things to come for the crypto market and beyond. "The meltdown reminded us just how quickly crypto markets can unravel when an abrupt shock pierces the euphoria of traders who've been watching prices steadily rise, and seem to forget they can do anything else," crypto researcher Molly White said last Friday in the post. Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, also noted the possibility that we "see a big correction or bear market that is at least partly fueled by by large liquidations due to these leverage effects." But unlike White, Leon thinks traditional finance institutions' entrance into the cryptocurrency market could help counterbalance the effects of crypto-native players using massive amounts of leverage. "There's bigger and bigger quantum of capital in the space controlled by players, as opposed to many small retail traders," Leon said. "And as more institutional capital comes into this space, it mitigates some of that risk, because large institutions don't take on 50x leveraged positions ‚Ä¶ and they tend to hold longer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AVAX has a clear setup on the chart. Remittix focuses on fast, low-fee payments across borders, which many people and small businesses need. We will check AVAX and LINK first, then show how Remittix ties this story together for a must-hold altcoin list. AVAX is holding just above a local support band near $19.45 after rejecting $20.87. Price trades around $19.76 and is down about 4.89%, but the bull case stays intact while support holds. For the best crypto to buy now list, the next proof is a clean market-structure break on this timeframe. That confirmation would turn dips into entries and keep the invalidation simple if support fails. That mix of fresh funds and on-chain efficiency keeps AVAX near the front of screens for DeFi project builders and long-term holders who want the best long-term crypto investment with growing demand. If that hits, momentum can quickly target the $27 to $28 zone. Chainlink secures about $62B in value, holds roughly 62% oracle share, engages with whales and collaborates with Mastercard and Intercontinental Exchange. Real-world ties plus dominance make LINK a credible next big altcoin candidate. Remittix is built for simple, borderless transfers that actually get used. Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank are live, with another major CEX reveal coming soon. For the best crypto to buy now, AVAX offers structure plus funding tailwinds, LINK brings deep institutional reach and Remittix delivers crypto with real utility in payments. If you are building a basket of upcoming crypto projects and cross-chain DeFi project plays, these three fit the best crypto to buy now filter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spot gold fell to as low as $4,034 per ounce, extending its sharp losses from earlier in the week, and silver remained down nearly 8%. The moves follow remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, who announced plans for a ‚Äúskinny master account‚Äù program that would allow eligible fintech and crypto firms limited access to the Fed's payment system ‚Äî a step seen as integrating digital assets more directly into traditional finance. Those Fed comments were made at the Federal Reserve's first-ever Payments Innovation Conference in Washington. Market chatter on social media suggested that investors may be rotating out of precious metals and into bitcoin, echoing themes from Bitwise Asset Management's latest Crypto Market Compass report. Bitwise said a modest 3‚Äì4% shift of capital from gold into crypto could theoretically double Bitcoin's price, given the relative size difference between the two markets. Just today, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick wrote that he expects Bitcoin to briefly drop below $100,000 due to trade war concerns but said the decline may be short-lived, noting that recent gold weakness has historically sparked quick Bitcoin rebounds. These platforms aggregate odds based on where participants think bitcoin will end the year. Earlier in October, traders were predicting a $144,000 year-end price, but that has since dropped to around $129,000 as volatility and fear increased. So right now, it's safe to say that prediction markets are flashing a contrarian ‚Äúfear‚Äù signal. While Polymarket claims 91% accuracy, removing outlier bets brings that figure closer to 71%. Interestingly, this ratio tends to move opposite the Fear and Greed Index ‚Äî highlighting undervaluation during fear and overconfidence during greed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) continues to face resistance at the $4,000 mark after multiple failed recovery attempts. Despite broader market stability, the second-largest cryptocurrency struggles to flip this key psychological level into support. The selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) remains a major obstacle, limiting Ethereum's ability to regain upward momentum. Exchange net position data reveals a notable shift in trader behavior over the past 10 days. Outflows from exchanges, typically signaling accumulation, have dropped sharply. This slowdown suggests investors are pulling back from buying, reflecting uncertainty in Ethereum's near-term performance as the market digests recent price swings. As outflows decline, inflows are gaining momentum, indicating more ETH is moving onto exchanges for potential selling. This shift often precedes increased bearish pressure, as traders look to secure profits or mitigate losses. Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. This surge marks the third-largest movement in over three months, suggesting that previously inactive long-term holders are beginning to sell their assets. As LTHs move their holdings back into circulation, it shows growing impatience with stagnant prices. However, if Ethereum holders curb their selling and demand strengthens, ETH could rebound above $4,000. A decisive break of this resistance could lift prices toward $4,221, signaling renewed optimism and invalidating the prevailing bearish setup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cryptocurrency exchange has been slapped with a fine of almost $177 million ‚Äî the largest-ever penalty by Canada's financial intelligence agency ‚Äî for infractions including failing to flag more than 1,000 transactions with suspected links to criminal activity. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) announced the penalty for Xeltox Enterprises Ltd. on Wednesday. That penalty was given to Peken Global Ltd, the operator of another cryptocurrency firm, KuCoin, in September. "Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, Fintrac was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action," director and CEO Sarah Paquet said in a statement about the Cryptomus penalty. The agency found 1,068 instances where Cryptomus did not submit reports for July 2024 transactions involving known darknet markets and virtual currency wallets with ties to the criminal activity Paquet described. Virtual currencies also mask the identity of their holder, making both them and the darknet markets havens for criminal activity. FINTRAC said Cryptomus didn't just violate money laundering laws when it failed to flag suspicious transactions, it also committed a violation when it failed to report 7,557 transactions originating from Iran between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2024. Because of ministerial directives linked to financial transactions associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Cryptomus was supposed to treat these transactions as high risk. Furthermore, FINTRAC found 1,518 transactions in July 2024 that met the $10,000 threshold at which companies have to report a large transfer of virtual currency. FINTRAC said these instances went unreported by Cryptomus, which also had "incomplete and inadequate policies and procedures" that created deficiencies in how the company handled ongoing monitoring and "know-your-client" obligations. Under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, businesses ranging from financial institutions to real estate brokers and casinos must keep certain records, identify clients, maintain a compliance regime and report financial transactions meeting specific criteria to FINTRAC. In 2024-25, FINTRAC issued 23 violation notices to business that didn't comply. FINTRAC has imposed more than 150 penalties since it received the legislative authority to do so in 2008.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. Istanbul, Turkey ‚Äì October 2025 ‚Äî In a world where speed, scale, and security define success, few crypto exchanges have faced the dual challenge of building world-class infrastructure in a market affected by international sanctions on Iran. Nobitex, Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange with over ten million verified users, is proving that innovation and integrity can coexist ‚Äî showing how technology can drive trust and resilience in complex environments. While many exchanges rely on outsourced systems, Nobitex has built nearly its entire core infrastructure in-house, including: ‚Ä¢ A proprietary order-matching engine capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second ‚Ä¢ AI-powered monitoring systems that detect anomalies in milliseconds ‚Ä¢ Real-time wallet screening connected to dynamically updated international sanctions databases ‚Ä¢ Adaptive pricing engines that align fiat and crypto liquidity with global markets. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, Nobitex used it as an opportunity to innovate ‚Äî building a fully independent tech stack that meets international expectations for performance, transparency, and reliability. Nobitex has invested heavily in prevention-first architecture, including: ‚Ä¢ Air-gapped cold wallets for reserve assets ‚Ä¢ Multi-signature approval layers for large withdrawals ‚Ä¢ AI-driven anomaly detection tuned to regional behavioral data ‚Ä¢ Automated IP and device fingerprinting to prevent fraud. high-level cyberattacks over the past three years without loss of user funds ‚Äî setting a new benchmark for operational resilience in emerging markets. Even while operating in a market affected by international sanctions on Iran, Nobitex maintains strict international AML/KYC controls ‚Äî not through declarations, but through technology: ‚Ä¢ All users must complete verified KYC onboarding; anonymous accounts are prohibited ‚Ä¢ Wallets flagged by OFAC, FATF, EU, and UN lists are automatically blocked ‚Ä¢ All suspicious transactions are isolated and logged within seconds for review. This system is powered by a proprietary compliance engine built directly into Nobitex's infrastructure, providing faster and more accurate detection than typical third-party integrations. ‚ÄúTechnology allows us to be both compliant and inclusive,‚Äù said the compliance lead. In collaboration with regional developer communities, Nobitex has: ‚Ä¢ Released open APIs for wallet and payment developers. ‚Ä¢ Sponsored blockchain-for-good hackathons ‚Ä¢ Trained more than 5,000 developers and analysts in secure crypto infrastructure While some exchanges use tools that obscure transaction trails, Nobitex has taken a different path ‚Äî one of voluntary visibility: ‚Ä¢ It does not employ mixers or privacy obfuscation tools ‚Ä¢ It publishes annual transparency and compliance reports ‚Ä¢ It is developing a public blockchain explorer to make its on-chain activity verifiable. These actions make platform misuse measurably harder and position Nobitex as one of the few exchanges in restricted markets openly building toward global transparency standards. At a time when the global crypto industry faces trust crises and regulatory scrutiny, Nobitex's journey illustrates how necessity can drive genuine innovation. ‚ÄúWhat we've built shows that transparency, security, and compliance can thrive anywhere when technology leads the way.‚Äù Founded in 2018, Nobitex is the MENA region's leading cryptocurrency exchange, trusted by more than ten million verified users. The platform adheres to international AML/KYC frameworks, employs AI-based risk monitoring, and maintains open-data transparency dashboards. Nobitex's mission is to make blockchain-based fintech secure, transparent, and inclusive ‚Äî proving that responsible innovation can flourish even in restricted markets.</p>

Bitcoin may still be on track to reach $200,000 by the end of the year, even after a record $19 billion market liquidation and renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, according to Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick. This dynamic may fuel a Bitcoin rally to $200,000 by the end of 2025, Kendrick said. Despite the volatility, he remains confident that Bitcoin will rebound as markets stabilize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Banks, firms and governments that rely on it as an international means of payment and store of value worry about the  policies of an erratic and hostile ‚ÄúAmerica First" president. They fear further steps to weaponize the American currency. They fret that US government debt is on an unsustainable path and that the Federal Reserve, whose independence hangs in the balance, will feel pressure to inflate away those obligations. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act signed into law by President Donald Trump in July promises to let a thousand stablecoins bloom. To all appearances, there will be no shortage of licensees. The domestic implications have been much  discussed. Will stablecoins actually be fully backed by safe liquid collateral, or will the regulated, who have every incentive to hold higher-yielding assets, stay one step ahead of the regulators? Will the banks' deposit base be insulated by  prohibitions on stablecoins paying interest, or will issuers sidestep this ban by channelling interest payments through the exchanges on which their coins are traded, threatening the existence of the banking system? Still, some will argue that if there are risks, they are risks worth taking, because stablecoins will preserve the dollar's global hegemony. So it was argued by no less an authority than Donald Trump Junior at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore earlier this month. If those dollar stablecoins are held and used outside the US, they will provide an entirely new set of international payment rails, separate and in principle faster and cheaper than cross- border banking and the banks' hoary messaging  system, Swift. If this enhances the attractiveness of dollar payments, corporate treasurers will be encouraged to maintain inventories of dollars. Central banks, likewise, will be encouraged to hold reserves of dollars, since this will enable them to act as dollar lenders and liquidity providers of last resort. These complementarities will lock in dollar dominance. This argument is based on a slew of assumptions that need to be unpacked. First, the notion that dollar stablecoins will be attractive for payments assumes that they will in fact be stable (here come those good questions again), and that other governments will allow free use of dollar stablecoins by their residents. Some governments may hesitate, fearing that currency substitution would undermine the effectiveness of their domestic monetary policy. Others would worry about facilitating money laundering, tax avoidance and evasion of capital controls. European Union authorities will scrutinize  the compatibility of dollar stablecoins with the consumer-protection and market-integrity provisions of their Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. But anyone who has encountered China's Great Firewall knows that national authorities retain considerable power  to limit their citizens' digital transactions. True, Europeans will be able to access dollar  stablecoins offshore even if they are banned in Europe itself. But big banks and companies will be reluctant to engage in such regulatory evasion, given that they will pay a heavy price if caught. A third assumption is that jurisdictions where other currencies circulate will not issue their  own stablecoins. But China has just taken a step in this direction, adopting an ordinance authorizing the issuance of renminbi-linked stablecoins in Hong Kong. Finally, it is assumed that private-label stablecoins will not be outcompeted by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These are essentially the same instrument, only issued by central banks, which can guarantee their conversion into central bank money.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The MoD was responsible for the accidental data breach, which took place in February 2022 and is likely to have cost more than ¬£850 million. Evidence of the breach only came to light in July this year after a government superinjunction, imposed in August 2023, was lifted. Speaking to MPs this week, Information Commissioner John Edwards, who oversees government data protection, said his office decided not to launch an investigation into the historic leak after meeting with MoD officials. "During those sessions ‚Äì because of the classification ‚Äì no notes could be taken, so when my colleague made the decision to take no further action, and he informed me of that, we didn't document it immediately. It was only after the superinjunction was lifted that we recorded a formal decision and put that into the system," he said. Appearing before the House of Commons Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, Edwards denied that the superinjunction prevented note-taking or an investigation. "It's just that information systems make it quite difficult to store classified material and to make a meaningful decision." He said that after superinjunction was lifted, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) ‚Äì a non-departmental government body under the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) ‚Äì reviewed the information available and decided there was no reason to impugn that original decision. The leaked spreadsheet comprised 33,345 lines of data, including the names and contact details of applicants to the Afghan resettlement scheme ‚Äîa program for those at risk of Taliban reprisal following the withdrawal of UK and US forces in August 2021. The document also included information about applicants' family members. According to the NAO, the official responsible believed they were sharing a limited dataset with an external party for legitimate operational purposes. "It was contained in a hidden cell," Edwards said. Edwards told MPs the ICO decided not to investigate because it might hinder the MoD's response. When a breach becomes known to an organization, there is an immediate need within the organization to get to the root cause and to rectify the problems, and in this case, to keep safe people that may have been affected, and this was extremely serious. For the ICO to go in and start investigating [an incident, it] can actually get in the way." At the time, the ICO was also responding to a separate incident that took place in September 2021. The UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), the unit in charge of relocating citizens who worked for or with the UK government in Afghanistan, failed to BCC email recipients, putting Afghan interpreters at risk. It fined the department ¬£350,000 after an investigation concluded in late 2023. That was not a decision to do nothing," he said. Immediately after the superinjunction was lifted, the ICO wrote to the Cabinet Office to say a joint effort to improve public sector data protection was "not working well enough." In a joint committee with DSIT and the Cabinet Office, Edwards said there would be a plan to raise standards by the end of the year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kadena Foundation, the team behind the blockchain once pitched as a scalable proof-of-work alternative to Ethereum, said it will cease all business operations and dissolve its organization, citing market conditions and an inability to sustain active development. The Kadena team is ‚Äúno longer able to continue business operations and will be ceasing all activity and active maintenance of the Kadena blockchain immediately,‚Äù it said in an X post. The announcement sent KDA, Kadena's native token, tumbling more than 55% in 24 hours to below 9 cents, wiping out nearly all of its five-year price action. Kadena, founded by former JPMorgan blockchain engineers Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino, launched in 2019 with the promise of scaling proof-of-work networks through a unique multichain ‚Äúbraided‚Äù architecture. It combined traditional mining with smart-contract functionality and its own programming language, Pact. At its 2021 peak, KDA traded above $25 and the project reached a $25 billion valuation, driven by speculative enthusiasm for alternatives to Ethereum's high fees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dominance has been the quiet story behind recent price action. After a low formed the week of September 8, dominance rose for six straight weeks. The metric broke above 60 percent and produced a sharp wick that surprised many traders. That move shows where capital may flow next. When dominance falls, money often moves into altcoins. Right now dominance is testing a key zone. If it moves above the recent high, we should expect a clearer rotation toward Bitcoin. Analyst Benjamin Cowen said that many altcoins have been losing ground against Bitcoin. Some Bitcoin pairs hit new lows this cycle. That pattern matters because it changes how gains and losses show up for investors who hold alts instead of Bitcoin. That dynamic forces a different approach to risk and timing. How Ethereum performs against Bitcoin will shape whether dominance can make a new high. If ETH drops further, dominance has room to run. Watch ETH/BTC for clues on where rotation will go next. A familiar cycle plays out in social channels. Creators who back microcaps push the opposite view. When dominance spikes, the critics get emotional. The market does not care about pride. Buying low fee index funds does not require precise timing. For traders in altcoins, entry and exit timing can determine outcomes more than conviction alone. Past market resets have forced a cleanup. Weak leverage and poor projects exit the market. That process can clear the path for stronger networks to rally later. Only a few durable projects will lead the next leg up. When it rises, capital often flows to Bitcoin, impacting altcoin prices. Timing altcoin trades is key to managing risks in this dynamic. As per Coinpedia's BTC price prediction, the Bitcoin price could peak at $168k this year if the bullish sentiment sustains.
