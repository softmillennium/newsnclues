                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year, the 61st edition features 111 feature films, which range from local talent (like the latest from All Jacked Up And Full Of Worms‘ Alex Phillips) to the kinds of festival hits that critics have been tantalizing arthouse devotees with all year (like Annemarie Jacir's Palestine 36, Christian Petzold's Miroirs No. Club, I was left to dodge those and instead hunt for some movies that've fallen through the cracks. Luckily, there were plenty of debuts to take a chance on at the Chicago International Film Festival 2025, and a pair of features from Romanian eye-poker Radu Jude to decide between. Seeing as we've got a piece on Jude's Dracula coming later in the month, I'm opting to highlight Kontinental '25. This warped, slimy take on Roberto Rossellini's Europa ‘51 refocuses that cinematic guilt trip on the amusing insufficiencies of the modern self-righteous. After Orsolya (Eszter Tompa) and a battalion of cops evict an otherwise homeless man (Gabriel Spahiu) from her boiler room, he kills himself, and Orsolya spends the following 100 minutes telling everyone she can find that it wasn't her fault. The feature-length jab at well-meaning yet ultimately impotent (or worse) progressivism features a recurring punchline where Olsolya reminds everyone that she isn't legally responsible for this death, of course, and a form that reflects its subject matter. Jude's familiarly static camera—the film's no-budget iPhone set-up strategically placed to allow two characters to converse in the middle of the frame—letting the people in Kontinental '25 hang themselves with their own tone-deaf confessions, self-aggrandizing delusions, and weak-tea protests. It's less funny and less provocative than Jude's last few films, but its unrelenting focus on a pervasive contemporary feeling—that all we can do is sit and stare at the mounting atrocities around us—brings the massive problems of economic inequality, senseless war, and rampant racism down to a familiar level. Shrinking down the masculine hardships, bottled-up pain, and explosive release of Beau Travail for a group of preteen water polo players, Polinger's film ostensibly got made thanks to the help of producer-actor Joel Edgerton. But it's the young cast, filled with up-and-comers like Everett Blunck (who also starred in last year's Tribeca film Griffin In Summer), who makes this anxiety-inducing look at pubescent social structures so thrilling—and so brutal. It's 2003 and little white boys with bleach-blond hair are saying “Okayyy” like Lil Jon. But even if the film is set two decades ago, the painful bonafides of its male social circle haven't aged a day. Of course, Eli is just an uncool little weirdo who wears a long-sleeve shirt at all hours and spends his time perfecting sleight-of-hand tricks and doing Gollum impressions (again, it's 2003). He's not a leper, but he might as well be thanks to The Plague‘s insightful understanding of how kids sniff out, then target weaknesses. Riled up by their leader Jake (Kayo Martin, perfectly cruel), the teammates bully mostly by omission, but as these kinds of thrillers go, things escalate—and they don't stop with Eli. As the film dives into body horror's sensory deep end, cinematographer Steven Breckon's enticing slo-mo underwater photography somewhat undermined by Johan Lenox's relentless score, you quickly hit the bottom of its shallow characters. But that's not a flaw that demands banishment; aside from some ultra-direct speeches (especially from Edgerton, who plays their preachy coach) and an ending that lifts whole cloth from Claire Denis' classic, the exciting debut boasts some honest and cutting commentary around these angry, confused little boys. Splitting the aesthetic difference between a classic piece of French animated sci-fi (Fantastic Planet) and the dreamy, youthful films of Hayao Miyazaki, Arco follows a young far-future time-traveler who, with the help of a purloined rainbow supersuit, travels back to the robot-filled year of 2075. This is the feature debut of filmmaker Ugo Bienvenu, who directed a music video for electropop band Jabberwocky that throws back to older-school comics. This film is filled with clean, smooth Golden Age sci-fi designs and an English-dubbed voice cast including Natalie Portman, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Mark Ruffalo, and Andy Samberg. But really, it's just the story of a boy, Arco (Juliano Valdi), who bumps into a girl, Iris (Romy Fay). Even if they hail from different eras, with different responses to the failures of humanity and its effect on the planet, they're still kids who share a timeless curiosity. It's this relationship and the swelling, motif-driven, Joe Hisaishi-like score from Arnaud Toulon that makes Arco feel most like a Ghibli film, because the rest is broader—both in style and narrative—than anything from that studio. and the parents are all working somewhere else, represented only by holograms. Rather, the endearing central relationship and breezily drawn future settings confirm Arco as a soft sci-fi story that still only has respect for its young audience.

If you're not a Colleen Hoover fan, we've got bad news for you: Film adaptations from the best-selling author's many, many novels are heading straight for the multiplex near you in the coming years and months. What started with Justin Baldoni's spectacularly ill-fated “It Ends with Us” last summer — well, not money-wise, that thing made over $350 million, even with those heinous vibes — shows zero signs of abating. Adaptations of “Verity” and “Reminders of Him” are on their way, and the second Hoover film adaptation, “Regretting You,” has now arrived. Thankfully, this particular story trades the icky, criminal (in ways both literal and figurative) drama of “It Ends with Us” for something a bit soapier and silly. Related Stories ‘Welcome to Derry' Review: HBO's ‘It' Prequel Series Is the Wrong Kind of Clown Show How Do Teenagers Consume Movies and Shows? Nearly Half of Them Say Rarely on a TV Sisters Morgan (Allison Williams) and Jenny (Willa Fitzgerald) couldn't be more different — Morgan is dependable and steady, Jenny's primary interest is having fun — and their partners only further reflect that divide. Morgan's husband Chris (Scott Eastwood) relished being Jenny's beer pong partner in high school, but Morgan's unexpected pregnancy when she was just 17 forced him to grow up fast. Jenny's serious, bespectacled fiancée didn't quite seem like the most obvious match when they were teens — and he sure seemed to like making sad puppy eyes at Morgan — but he's recently returned to town after a long absence, promptly getting Jenny pregnant. The film, directed by YA dramedy maestro Josh Boone (“Stuck in Love,” “The Fault in Our Stars”) somewhat disconcertingly opens with a high school-set flashback — with all of the aforementioned adult stars playing their teen selves, jarring — that lays out all these complications and more. Seventeen years later, Morgan and Chris are the proud parents of budding actress Clara (Mckenna Grace), Jenny and Jonah just had an adorable baby and are preparing to get married, and everything feels … well, it feels fine enough, until a horrible tragedy upends all of this and so much more. The tragedy in question is no secret — Chris and Jenny are killed together in a horrific car accident, which inspires all sorts of awful questions — and the fallout is mostly predictable. As Morgan and Jonah navigate shifting alliances, Clara grapples with her grief, compounded by her confusion as to what in God's name is going on with her mom and uncle, plus a budding romance with local cool guy Miller (Mason Thames). And yet, within that messiness, there is occasional emotional truth here. Consider this: Chris and Jenny might be phenomenally bad partners, but in the brief moments we get to know them before the accident, we see they have other, very fine qualities. But that sort of texture and storytelling care isn't always on offer, and there's plenty of information we don't get here. After Chris' funeral (another weird bit: we never see Jenny's funeral, despite Clara often talking about it), stacks of flowers and pre-made meals all but block Morgan and Clara's front door, yet we never see any of those well-wishing friends and neighbors. Grief is messy and fucked up, but it too often feels like we're getting through that stuff to get to the good (read: kissy!) Well, it lands, even if in the soapiest of ways. That might even be part of the problem for Morgan and Jonah, who seem to have long ago narrowed their entire social (and romantic) circle to just them and their departed partners. The teenage romance opens things up a bit more. Much like grief, growing up is messy and fucked up, and Grace in particular takes on the many dimensions of Clara with ease. Funny little details still reign here, like how Miller wants to be a filmmaker — the hilariously-placed Sidney Lumet book on his nightstand hammers that home — while the assortment of movie posters on his walls really seals the deal. We're not sure how many teens these days still revere both “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” and “Witness” (??) in equal measure, but good for Miller. (His movie obsession also adds a truly deranged amount of AMC product placement; during movie dates, Clara and Miller seem moments away from filming their own Nicole Kidman ads). He's also just a nice kid, the last person Morgan should be worrying about being around Clara. Tucked into the melodrama of “Regretting You,” there is a sweet story about a mother and daughter trying to figure things out, but the reliance on their outside romances often detracts from it. Still, it's fun to watch “Regretting You” with a crowd who can appreciate and titter at its twists and revelations, people who can vibe with its melodramatic wackiness while also not necessarily making fun of it. During the film's opening flashback, when a young Chris whines to a tee-totaling Morgan “but drunk Morgan is my favorite Morgan!,” the man next to me laughed out an “oh, wow” that landed perfectly; he went on to literally slap his knee at two other points in the film. Now that's the energy a Colleen Hoover joint should inspire. Paramount Pictures will release “Regretting You” in theaters on Friday, October 24.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter School's out for the summer at God U, with Gen V's leading supes passing with flying colors in the season-ending fight against Godolkin. 'Gen V' Star Keeya King on Annabeth's Big Reveal and Potential of Marie "Turning Dark" 'Gen V' Star Maddie Phillips on Redemption and Why Cate Is Really Broken “I don't think we would have had this finale,” says showrunner Michele Fazekas, when asked about how the writing team, which had four scripts at the time of Perdomo's death, wrote the ending with his character in mind. “I think it would have turned into a very different season. “Obviously, there is timing, but no and that's ok. I'm very happy with my work on the show.” While classes are out for season two and Fazekas has graduated from Gen V, executive producer Eric Kripke notes that the YA series is not done if Prime Video is willing to give it and its supes another school year. “That's a little bit up to the audience and TV gods, but we're ready and willing if we get the nod,” he shares in a separate interview about potential plans for season three. In two separate conversations combined below with Fazekas and Kripke, THR discusses how Gen V season two sets up aspects of The Boys season five, unpacks that Godolkin performance and failed crusade, and explores how the writers developed a group of supes to counter The Boys' biggest antagonist. How much of a role will these young supes, who now kind of look like their own hero team, play in The Boys season five? And how will it be different from the cameos of season four? ERIC KRIPKE They are palying an important part. Part of the fun of wrapping out season two that way is that we really get to set the table for season five, where there's now this active and growing resistance led by Starlight that A-Train is an important part of. But watching both is still a much more fun experience. Those final moments with their arrival felt a little bit like the shows were merging, as if this could be the end of Gen V. But you don't see it as that? It depends on the ratings and how many people end up tuning in. We have to make it so Amazon picks us up for another season. But it's also a political anthem critiquing the Bush administration's foreign policy that the band didn't perform at the 2005 VMAs because they weren't allowed to project an image of Bush's face. Our editor, Maura [Corey], put it in there. We spent a lot of time editing it so that certain parts of the song hit at the right places. All season, we've heard Marie can stop Homelander, but there's also the group that surrounds her whose journeys this season sort of represent themes — anti-corruption (Cate), courage over fear (Jordan), the power of difference (Sam), maintaining empathy in the face of cruelty (Emma), rejecting fear of the other (Annabeth), and collectivism over individualism (Marie). Those all feel a little like antidotes to fascism. FAZEKAS At its heart, any show like this is a coming-of-age story. So what you have in a college show, whether or not it's a superhero show, is these kids who are away from their parents, on their own for the first time, and they have to figure out who they are. Now, at a place like Godolkin University, we're going to get constant input that you should be this type of superhero. And the entire existence of Godolkin University, in part, is: how do we corrupt these kids? Cipher knew that with Marie, you want to be powerful. Marie and Annabeth were able to mend fences when Annabeth admitted, listen, the reason I'm so mean to you is because I'm blaming myself, and it's easier to blame you than blame me. It sounds very self-important in a way, but that's where we ended up. Marie helps clinch this fight against Godolkin, only after momentarily waffling on the ethics of how to use her powers. Michele previously spoke about what makes Marie different from Homelander and brought up that she was nurtured differently. What other things in your mind make Marie different from Homelander? We've been very clear, and you see it with Ryan, too, this nature-nurture argument of how important nurturing is. I'd say another thing that's different is Marie's still young, and just because she's incredibly powerful doesn't mean she has perfect control over it. Those become bummer, boring Messiah characters, and she's not that. She's still a person and has a hard time wrestling with the amount of power that she's finding herself to have. The gang doesn't just grow personally but also within their romantic relationships, which seem to have all fallen away by the finale. Why did it feel right to not tie everyone up neatly in a bow before they go fight, and had you thought about where they might go if the show gets to continue? So when Jordan ends things with Marie, we're not slamming the door on that. We're not slamming the door on anything with Emma and Sam, or even Emma and Greg, if that is the way she goes. But what I really like is that it shows their emotional level up. I need to figure out who I am outside of us, which doesn't mean that we can't revisit it in the future. Beyond Marie and her friends, in that final fight, you have two God U students whose powers were running jokes all season, but become essential players against Godolkin. How early on did you know they'd play that pivotal role, and what does it say about Godolkin's ideology? FAZEKAS We did not know that Black Hole was going to play a pivotal role. As the season went on and we were figuring out what Godolkin's ultimate goal was, it started to become a nice counterpoint. He's talking about all of these useless superheroes and wanting to get rid of them so we can only focus on the good ones. That's what elevated the other characters in a really fun way. I also love the storyline of Emma trying to join this small resistance, where all they were doing was graffiti, and she's like, “No, let's really fuck shit up.” She becomes somewhat of a leader in that little group. But when we initially introduced them, we didn't have a clear idea that they were going to pay off in the season finale. Viewers finally see Ethan Slater fully embody Godolkin after Hamish Linklater had been playing him as Cipher for seven episodes. How did you work with them, and if they worked together at all, in order to get to that twist that just plays out so well and ultimately sets up that finale fight? I don't think for a moment that [he is] not a different person than [he's] been these past seven episodes. Both of them take their craft seriously and want to study it and want to understand the history of their character. We see Sage's relationship and plan with Godolkin, like his head exploding, seemingly explode as well. How much does Homelander know about what's going on? KRIPKE Well, it all went pretty sideways on Sage (Laughs). The story about Sage that we really liked — and it was Michele Fazekas' notion — was, “Why can't we give Sage a love story? They were gonna move in together, and they were gonna break it to Homelander in a really careful way. They were going to be this power couple. She had this vision of a happy world with the other smartest person in the world, and he just went fucking nuts. There's a reason she let Polarity out of that prison in the final episode. She comes into season five a little heartbroken. She was already a misanthrope, and it just makes her even more so. Godolkin is seemingly gone, although you've teased he may appear in Vought Rising.

Despite their recent rise in prevalence, prequels are often a bad fit for television. Serialized TV is built for lengthy, evolving stories; stories that can grow from season to season; that can begin as one thing and end as something else entirely. Sterling exceptions certainly exist, but our ongoing age of I.P. Related Stories How Do Teenagers Consume Movies and Shows? Nearly Half of Them Say Rarely on a TV ‘The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' Review: Maika Monroe Is a Nanny from Hell in Hulu's Safe and Streamlined Remake of Lurid '90s Classic The opening sequence — involving a scared little boy whose fear only accelerates during a nightmarish car ride — is a decent bellwether for the first five episodes (which is all that were screened for critics, of the eight total). Cheesy frights rely on cartoonish CGI and spewing blood to provoke imagery that's memorable for the wrong reasons. The franchise's iconic clown is nowhere to be found, replaced by one of the many toothless iterations of “It” our shapeshifting antagonist assumes instead. If this is how “It” begins and we already know how “It” ends, must we wait around to watch what happens in between? And shouldn't there be more to “It” than that? have dogged director Andy Muschietti since his first “It” feature terrorized theaters to the tune of $704 million in worldwide grosses, perhaps these red flags will only act as reassurance. The network prioritizes franchise continuity by bringing back the director of both “It” chapters to develop, produce, and helm select episodes of “Welcome to Derry,” alongside his producing partner and sister Barbara Muschietti. Bill Skarsgård returns, too, reprising his role as the dancing clown while flexing his influence over all things “It” by snagging an executive producer credit, too. Co-showrunner Jason Fuchs is another movie import, having served as co-producer on “Chapter Two,” but balancing those filmic staples are a stable of TV veterans, including co-showrunner Brad Caleb Kane (“Tokyo Vice”), his writers' room, and — most intriguingly — Oscar- and Emmy-winner Cord Jefferson (“American Fiction,” “Watchmen”), who's officially on board as a consulting producer. That last credit hints at the show's bigger thematic goals, most of which skew closer to broad gestures than fresh insights — at least, so far. Whereas the original “It” films double as allegories for removing fear as an obstacle to growing up (assuming the kids can survive their increasingly dangerous childhoods to begin with), “Welcome to Derry” positions its titular 1962 town as America in miniature. Despite white residents dismissing concerns over racial prejudice because “this isn't the South,” Black residents are presumed to be criminals, treated like pawns, and met with weary, skeptical glances wherever they go. Indigenous citizens don't fare much better, as their perspectives are ignored and rights get dismissed. When a character in Episode 2 growls, “This ain't America, this is Derry,” there's no doubting they are one in the same. This generalized recognition of our nation's foundational sins is certainly welcome, it's just not geared toward a particular point. Perhaps the final three episodes will pull together a cogent statement or two, something beyond the trope of ostensibly idyllic small towns hiding monstrous truths behind their white picket fences. But the “It” films were content to stick with broadly recognizable interpretations — growing up is hard! — so why bank on anything more from the series? That's because “Welcome to Derry” is shielded by spoiler embargoes, including much of the first episode (and, therefore, what happens after), which makes listing even the basic narrative a bit tricky. (HBO's own logline is just a single sentence filled with keyword gobbledygook.) Leroy (Jovan Adepo) is an Air Force major with lingering physical and emotional scars from the Korean War. Charlotte (Taylour Paige) is a housewife who used to be active in the civil rights movement before Leroy grew concerned that his partner's politics could cost him promotions. After moving to Derry, she looks after their son, Will (Blake Cameron James), while Leroy partakes in “special operations” with a uniquely talented (and uniquely trusted) soldier named Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk). If any of those names sound familiar, congratulations: You're a Stephen King superfan. “Welcome to Derry” is well-stocked with Easter eggs, whether they tie directly to “It” (like, say, through the Hanlon family tree) or other stories with roots in the King of Horror's favorite state. Trailers have tipped associations with “The Shining” and “The Shawshank Redemption,” but there are plenty more winks and nods to lore for those of you who care. “Welcome to Derry,” very much for worse, does not. Despite being nicely fashioned by Oscar-winning production designer Paul D. Austerberry, the town's origins are valued more than what's going on within it — the former of which is trotted out in blunt stretches of exposition, and the latter of which is realized in clunky set-pieces that are meant to be scary but settle for icky. (Plus, “Castle Rock” already built a much better King-verse, and it still got axed.) As much as I want to invest in Muschetti's vision for a prequel series that moves backward through time — if greenlit, Season 2 would take place in 1935, while Season 3 would jump back another 27 years to 1908 — what's shown in the here and now isn't as apt or ambitious as the structural apparatus around “It.” Character inconsistencies, leaps in logic, foreseeable yet functional twists — these are forgivable flaws in a horror show that brings the horror, but “Welcome to Derry” can't deliver where it counts. Episodes strain to touch on those fan-favorite aspects almost as often as they work to expand the Stephen King universe from within (even incorporating a missing kid plot reminiscent of “It: Chapter One”). But an engine fueled by filling in the blanks isn't built to last, and these dots, once connected, prove tacky and sour (especially without Pennywise, who's notably absent for most of the season). It's almost as though the prequel isn't equipped to handle significant change. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on December 14.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1981, Bruce Springsteen found himself at a crossroads. He'd just finished his tour for The River, which had brought his marathon-length, rock & roll-revivalist shows to a record number of audiences. The E Street Band was hitting on all cylinders. Nor did hearing his own voice blasting out of the radio, preaching about how you lay down your money and you play your part. So Bruce retreated to a rental in Colts Neck, New Jersey. He sat in with local bar bands at the Stone Pony, happy to be just another working musician cranking out Little Richard covers. He read the short stories of Flannery O'Connor. He brought in a newfangled home-recording device called the TEAC 144, in case he felt like cutting demos for the boys. He thought about his childhood, how dancing with his mother in their old living room gave him such joy, and how his father inspired such fear and dread in him as a kid. And late one night, Bruce happened to catch Badlands, Terrence Malick's 1973 movie that dramatized the killing spree of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate, on TV. Soon, he picked up his guitar and began singing: “He saw her standing/On her front porch/Just a-twirlin'/Her baton.” A few days later, after working out more of the song he initially called “Starkweather,” Bruce changed that “he” in the first line to “I” — the stark, old-weird-America death trip made personal. Then our hero went wandering down a path that would eventually cause the record company to lose their shit, force his manager Jon Landau to defend his friend's artistic integrity, risk alienating his fan base, and produce the bleakest and arguably best front-to-back masterpiece of his discography to date. Even casual students of Springsteenology 101 know the when, why, and how behind this outlier of a record, not to mention what lay just beyond the horizon. Which doesn't keep Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere from laying out all of the details about the making of Nebraska, his 1982 album that gave a voice to unrepentant murderers, tortured highway patrolmen, wannabe mobsters, car thieves, and Bruce's own conflicted memories about his childhood. Based on Warren Zanes' invaluable book of the same name, writer-director Scott Cooper's thinly sliced biopic-in-miniature boils everything down to a pivotal year in Bruce's life, right before the Boss is about to go stratospheric. And who better to play a moody, mercurial Bruce than Jeremy Allen White? Thankfully, White does not try to mount an impersonation of Springsteen; other than some onstage jumps and a brief, raspy post-concert exchange, there's no real attempt to “do” Bruce. White smartly leans into an overall loner vibe that suggests someone lost in the wilderness of his own isolation. Springsteen was famous enough to get recognized by a car salesman and passersby, yet still local enough to sit in every Sunday night with your basic around-the-way rockers. “I know who you are,” that salesman admits. Jeremy Allen White Covers Springsteen Classics on ‘Deliver Me From Nowhere' Soundtrack See Bruce Springsteen Perform ‘Streets of Philadelphia' at Academy Museum Gala Deliver Me From Nowhere actually works best when you forget you're watching a biopic — an irony, considering the title and marketing — and focus on one of the other half dozen genres that Cooper and Co. are serving up. It's a process movie keen on showing you how Springsteen recorded a handful of spare, sketch-like takes of “Atlantic City,” “Mansion on the Hill,” and “Nebraska” in his bedroom, as well as the way he and his cohort fought to preserve the crude vibe of those four-track demos, modern sound mixes be damned. And it's a love story, though not between Bruce and his girlfriend Faye Romano (Odessa Young), a composite of, per his memoir, “the perfectly fine women” he “roughly failed … over and over again.” Deliver is, at its core, a tribute to the bond between Springsteen and Jon Landau, played here by Jeremy Strong with big hang-dog energy. You'll get your blockbuster, company suits, but this is the next album. You wonder if something similar didn't transpire with film executives as well, who thought they were getting the next cradle-to-grave musical-superhero extravaganza here — a Boss-hemian Rhapsody. After seeing an early re-creation of that final River tour concert, with the final minutes of “Born to Run” getting the full Queen-at-Live-Aid treatment, they were probably levitating out of their seats. By the time they get to tiny, monochromatic Bruce cowering next to his pops while watching Night of the Hunter, their response could have been an encore from '82: “So this is the biopic, and it's going to be a trauma drama that looks and sounds like this?” It's probably the only movie about a rock star in which the payoff isn't gold records but going to therapy and seeing a grown man sit on his elderly dad's lap. It is a moment in which, to paraphrase the Bible: Bruce wept. Rina Sawayama Has Notes for the Team Behind Sabrina Carpenter's Japan-Inspired ‘SNL' Set Tyler, the Creator Is Trapped in an Online-Discourse Vortex Some will find it dour to a fault. Others will wish it had more sequences like the one in the Power Station, where Bruce and the band tear into “Born in the U.S.A.” and heed Landau's corny demand to “burn it down.” We don't blame them either, though despite the movie's flaws, what Cooper has given audiences here is way more compelling than a live-action greatest-hits compilation. The fact that you know he parachutes to safety and produces an enduring work sans compromise gives it a default happy ending. But what it's really doing is presenting a portrait of a slow-motion nervous breakdown that's narrowly avoided, and only because the subject was willing to finally reckon with his past. It's from the title track of an album he'd put out 40 years later, one in which the hero is “wearing a cross of my calling/On wheels of fire I come rolling down here.” Poised to became the savior of rock & roll, Bruce fell into a hole. Then he exorcised something via these dark dirges from the edge of his psyche, and you realize you've spent two hours watching him come on up for the rising. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Bronwyn Newport responded to the “identity theft” and “fraud” allegations that began to circulate online during the sixth episode of Season 6. “There's two separate things happening here,” Bronwyn said to a producer during one of her confessionals. Bronwyn continued to explain, “and then they're saying that I allegedly committed crimes, current day, in the last year or so. “But it's been a case that was dismissed and then later sealed, and I really, legally, can't talk about what my involvement is in that.” In the wake of all the rumors about her past legal troubles, Bronwyn and her husband Todd Bradley sat down to discuss how to best handle the “ridiculous headlines” that were going around. “You know this lying…online in the press affects all of us, personally and professionally,” said Todd, referencing his career as a successful software and tech executive. “I know that my name next to any of these words reflects poorly on you, and you need to be seen as someone who is trustworthy and beyond reproach.” Since both Todd and Bronwyn suspect that fellow housewife Lisa Barlow was involved in the reports suddenly surfacing, he had sent her a text message suggesting that she back out of the upcoming “RHOSLC” cast charter aboard a yacht with Captain Jason Chambers and the “Below Deck Down Under” crew. “It's unclear to me why you wanna go spend time with these people, why you wanna spend time with Lisa, why you wanna fly 18 hours to be in the same room with someone that continually lies about you, lies about me, lied about Gwen,” Todd said, referencing Bronwyn's young daughter. I don't know why you get in the gutter with her,” Todd said about Lisa. “You just get down in the gutter and muck around with slime.” “But don't come home complaining that you and Lisa got into a fight, because I assume it's gonna happen. In a recent interview with Us Weekly that Bronwyn shared on her Instagram, she explained why Todd has taken a step back from being on camera.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>See what Chip and Joanna have planned for their new series, as they move beyond Waco, Texas. On October 21, Chip and Joanna took to Instagram to give fans a sneak peek at their newest show, explaining how they've never done a series quite like this before. “We are so excited to announce our new series, called ‘Fixer Upper: Mountain House,'” Chip said. “Hopefully the project comes together in a way that you guys are going to be thrilled about,” Chip adds. Discovery, “Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House” is “a brand-new three-part limited series debuting Tuesday, December 9, 2025 at 9pm ET/PT on Magnolia Network and HGTV. Streaming the same day on HBO Max and discovery+, the series marks Chip and Joanna Gaines' first-ever ‘Fixer Upper' project outside their home state of Texas.” The release notes, “In ‘Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House,' Chip and Joanna take on a 1960s mountain property in Colorado, tackling unique design and construction hurdles that come with high-altitude living. “Colorado has come to be a special place for our family,” Joanna shared. “And somewhere in-between ski trips and spring breaks over the last decade, a dream took root to one day carve out a place of our own. While taking ‘Fixer Upper' out of state meant we were in for a steep learning curve, our hope is that this home would far outlast us, and we can't wait to share it with you.” The release shares, “Over three 60-minute episodes, viewers will watch the Gaineses navigate everything from creating spaces ideal for a multi-generational family gathering, to surprise visits from local wildlife, to uncovering unique architectural details. With plenty of surprises along the way, ‘Fixer Upper: Colorado Mountain House' captures the signature heart, humor, and design vision that fans have come to love, set against a brand-new backdrop.” I live in NC and immediately thought how great it would have been to go to our mountains and rebuild homes that were literally swept away by raging floods just over a year ago.

Convinced that she is simply cracking under the pressure of impending parenthood, the majority of her family and friends respond to her frantic pleas for help with a dismissive attitude. While working at a tenants' rights event, “ready to pop” expectant mother Caitlyn (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) briefly encounters Polly (Maika Monroe), a young woman worried about an imminent rent hike being enforced by her landlord. Though the advice Caitlyn gives her is clinical and cursory, it's clear she makes quite the impression on Polly, who reintroduces herself when she sees Caitlyn and her family at a local Los Angeles farmers market several months later. While this second encounter is even briefer than the first, Polly drops a hint about needing work; as fate would have it, Miguel has been suggesting that Caitlyn hire a nanny. The bulk of her nannying duties, however, lie in tending to Josie, whose daily regimen has been carefully calibrated to avoid ingesting microplastics, sugar, and other adverse yet omnipresent additives. Despite assurances that she will follow Caitlyn's strict guidelines, Polly immediately breaks every rule: She allows the girls to eat sickly sweet frosting, feeds Josie store-bought formula instead of her mother's steady supply of pre-pumped breastmilk, and even gives Emma a wildly irresponsible (and explosive) gift. Although Caitlyn is unsettled by Polly's deviation from her clearly articulated instructions, Miguel is quick to come to their nanny's defense, in part because Caitlyn previously suffered from postpartum psychosis after Emma's birth. Only Caitlyn's best friend and co-worker Stewart (Martin Starr in a small but potent supporting role) also senses something suspicious about Polly's general vibe, causing him to dig up some shocking revelations about both women's traumatic past. Working from a script by Micah Bloomberg (who previously wrote the 2022 erotic thriller Sanctuary), Cervera infuses her recurring thematic interests into this remake. For one, her Mexican background comes through in the film's mixed-race family dynamic. While this ethnic background isn't overly focused on, Cervera does stitch in a truly excellent joke about Mexicans and their love of pyrotechnics, something that those who share this identity will undoubtedly chuckle over. After Polly hints at her lesbian relationship, Caitlyn confides that she, too, has been with women before. The remake features riveting tension, assured performances, and hallmarks of an exciting new director's narrative fascinations, all while the politics of its central dynamic continue to cry out for examination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depeche Mode will include four previously unreleased tracks from their most recent album, Memento Mori, on a new live album set to arrive Dec. 5. Some fans were able to hear it early, though, when “In the End” played during the end credits of Depeche Mode: M, a new film that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival back in June. Depeche Mode: M was directed by Mexican filmmaker Fernando Frias and it will get a limited theatrical release starting Oct. 28. M is not a concert film in the strict sense, with Frias pairing performances from Depeche Mode's Memento Mori tour with an exploration of the role mortality plays in Mexican culture. The film features narration from actor Daniel Giménez Cacho, as well as interviews with fans, artists, and other cultural commentators. Rina Sawayama Has Notes for the Team Behind Sabrina Carpenter's Japan-Inspired ‘SNL' Set Tyler, the Creator Is Trapped in an Online-Discourse Vortex Death was, of course, also a potent subject for Depeche Mode, as the title, Mento Mori, suggests. A double-disc live album for Memento Mori: Mexico City will also be included in the box set, though the LP will have its own release on CD and vinyl, too. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just days after the death of Limp Bizkit co-founder bassist Sam Rivers at age 48 of undisclosed causes, TMZ is reporting that a spokesperson for St. Johns County, Florida Fire Rescue said they responded to a call on Saturday (Oct. 18) for a “nonresponsive person in cardiac arrest.” At press time no official cause of death had been announced and the gossip site added that a spokesperson for the St. Johns County Sheriff's office said that deputies responded to what is referred to as an “attended death” at Rivers' address, meaning a call in which the deceased was a patient under medical care for a serious or life-threatening illness likely to result in a near-term death. Ivy Queen Gives Tokischa Her Flowers at Latin Music Week 2025: 'You Are Blossoming' See Lainey Wilson in a New Trailer for 'Reminders of Him' Film, Based on the Colleen Hoover Bestseller Billboard reached out to the St. Johns Country Fire Rescue and Sheriff's offices — as well as Limp Bizkit's spokesperson — for comment, but had not heard back at press time. Singer Fred Durst posted an emotional tribute to Rivers on Monday saying, “it's so tragic he's not here now” and admitting that he'd gone through “gallons and gallons of tears since yesterday and I'm thinking, ‘my God, Sam's a legend,' you know? He lived it.” Earlier, the band — which also features guitarist Wes Borland, DJ Lethal and drummer John Otto — released a joint statement paying tribute to their beloved compatriot. At press time it appeared the band planned to carry on with its planned late 2025 Gringo Papi South American tour dates, which will resume on Nov. 29 at Explanada del Estadio Banorte in Mexico City before moving on to Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Argentina before winding down on Dec. 20 in Sao Paulo, Brazil; no replacement for Rivers has been announced yet.
