Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? During an oral argument on Wednesday, the Supreme Court appeared all but certain to divide along party lines in a case that seeks to fundamentally expand the role religion plays in American public schools. The Court's new decisions give religious conservatives far more ability both to ignore laws they do not like, and to demand that the government fund their religious institutions. After less than five years in power, the Court's new majority has rendered the country's religion jurisprudence unrecognizable, even to a lawyer who would have been considered an expert in the Constitution's approach to religion less than a decade ago. On the surface, Wednesday's argument in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond merely signaled that the Court's Republican majority will very likely take the next incremental step in its seemingly inexorable march toward integration of church and state. Upon closer inspection, however, the Oklahoma argument was unlike some of this Court's early forays into religion because some of the Republicans explicitly acknowledged that they are rewriting the Constitution's approach to religion, and a few of them even appeared to signal where they want this revolution to end. As Justice Brett Kavanuagh said late in the Oklahoma argument, the Court now has a “different constitutional understanding” of whether separation of church and state is even permitted. That new understanding, Kavanaugh suggested, is this: So long as an American can choose not to participate in a state-backed religious operation, church and state do not need to be separate — indeed, separation of church and state is often unconstitutional under this framework. In Oklahoma, which is about whether states must pay for religious charter schools using taxpayers' money, Kavanaugh's new regime would mandate a great deal of state funding for religious schools, so long as parents retain a “choice” about where to send their child. Under Kavanaugh's approach, if “no student is compelled to go to a religious charter school,” state charter school programs like the Oklahoma program at issue in this case must fund religious instruction. Again, this approach to religion is fundamentally different from how previous generations of justices viewed the Constitution — in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), for example, the Court said that “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” But, at the very least, the Court's new majority now appears to have settled on the rule it will apply in future cases seeking to mandate government funding of religious faith. Oklahoma is the culmination of a series of decisions which not only reject Everson, but seek to turn it on its head. The rule is no longer that church and state must be separated. The Court's current majority mandates that they must be entangled with each other. In fairness, the right of citizens to choose whether to participate in religious institutions has animated the Court's religion cases for quite a while. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), a 5-4 Court ruled that states may voluntarily include religious schools in a private school voucher program, so long as parents ultimately got to decide whether to send their child to a religious school. Carson held that, once a state sets up a private school voucher program, “it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.” So, once a voucher program exists, state funding of religion is now mandatory. That said, Carson also held that states are still allowed to “provide a strictly secular education in its public schools.” The question in Oklahoma is whether state charter school programs — charter schools are classified as nonreligious public schools under both federal law and the laws of 46 different states, even though they are often run in partnership with a private entity — are allowed to provide the strictly secular education the Court spoke of in Carson. But none of the five Republican justices who heard the Oklahoma case appeared persuaded that charter schools count as public entities that are allowed to be strictly secular. Chief Justice John Roberts, the closest thing this Court has to a moderate Republican, compared Oklahoma's charter schools to government contractors — he pointed to the Court's decision in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021) a government contracting case which held that a city could not exclude religious adoption agencies that refuse to place children with same-sex couples from its broader adoption program. Meanwhile, many of the justices appeared genuinely angry that religious schools have been excluded from state and federal charter school programs for as long as those programs have existed. Justice Samuel Alito went on a rant about how current law permits charter schools which teach that being LGBTQ is a “perfectly legitimate lifestyle,” but doesn't permit the government to fund religious viewpoints. In fairness, Kavanaugh at least acknowledged that his Court recently changed the rules. When Gregory Garre, the lawyer defending Oklahoma's ability to have a nonsectarian charter school program, pointed out that both federal law and every relevant state's law provides for secular charter schools, Kavanaugh responded that “at that point it was considered constitutional to discriminate against religious entities.” Based on Wednesday's argument, it appears likely that the Court will adopt the rule Kavanuagh articulated shortly thereafter — that government funding of religious schools is required so long as individual citizens retain the choice to send their children to a non-religious school. Democratic Justice Elena Kagan, for her part, spent much of the argument trying to draw out the implications of her Court's new approach to religion. Or suppose that a religious charter school wanted to toss out state curricular standards altogether? Would taxpayers be required to fund this school as well? If a city council puts out cookies and potato chips for attendees to snack on, do they violate the Constitution if these snacks are not kosher or halal? What if they are both kosher and halal, but they cannot be eaten by someone who holds the idiosyncratic religious belief that it is a sin to eat unhealthy food? Kavanaugh's view, at the very least, suggests that it is unconstitutional discrimination for the government to provide a benefit of any kind without also providing religious versions of that same benefit. Last week, in Mahmoud v. Taylor, most of the justices sounded extremely sympathetic to religious parents who objected to books being taught in public schools that have LGBTQ characters. Depending on how the Court rules in Mahmoud, it could impose such high burdens on schools that want to teach such books that public school districts will have little choice but to exclude them — effectively imposing a “Don't Say Gay” rule on every public school in the country. But for now, it appears the Republican justices' religious conservative revolution is likely to march onward, remaking public schools, and potentially many other public institutions. Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools. ﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.</p>

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said at a gathering of President Donald Trump's Cabinet that the agency was undergoing a restructuring to eliminate "well-documented politicization." CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that a restructuring was underway at President Donald Trump's direction to eliminate "well-documented politicization" of the agency. Trump joked during a meeting of his Cabinet secretaries on Wednesday that perhaps Ratcliffe was the only one "who's not allowed to talk about the great job he's done," given the classified nature of the Central Intelligence Agency's work. "At your direction, the CIA has deployed our unique covert action, authorities in various places and continents, to successfully advance your national security and foreign policy priorities, to advance peace, to end wars, to take terrorists off the battlefield, and to keep illicit drugs from coming into this country and harming Americans," Ratcliffe reported to Trump, in front of news cameras. "Unfortunately, as much as I would love to detail your accomplishments in that regard, we can't do so with this crowd. But you and I both know, Mr. President, that you have had a profound positive impact on America's national security posture. And Americans are safer because of your leadership." CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Kruse prepare to testify during the House Select Intelligence Committee hearing titled "Worldwide Threats Assessment," on Wednesday, March 26, 2025. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also referenced efforts to combat "politicization" within the intelligence community at the Cabinet meeting. Politicization of the intelligence community has gone on for far too long," Gabbard said. "This past week, I sent three criminal referrals for illegal and unauthorized leaks to the media of classified intelligence for prosecution. We have 11 more that are under investigation. The U.S. government has already declassified documents surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and Gabbard said she was working to declassify more documents around the assassination of former U.S. Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy – the father of Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as the assassination of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. "And we continue our extensive investigations around exposing the very serious issues we have related to election integrity, illegal abuses of FISA, Crossfire Hurricane, and others," Gabbard said. "Mr. President, under your leadership, we are working every day to bring about that transparency and accountability that the American people deserve." Last month, Trump signed an executive order instructing the FBI to immediately declassify files concerning the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the agency probe launched in 2016 that sought information on whether Trump campaign members colluded with Russia during the presidential race. Thirteen U.S. service members and roughly 170 Afghan civilians were killed when an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated at Kabul's airport. President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) One of those agencies was the CIA. The Justice Department announced last month that ISIS-K member Mohammad Sharifullah, also known as "Jafar," has been arrested on federal terrorism charges in connection to the attack and was extradited to the U.S. He made a brief appearance in Virginia federal court. Ratcliffe also told the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the CIA, at Trump's direction, has negotiated and secured the release of Americans like Mark Fogel and Ksenia Karelina, "who had been wrongfully detained, sending the message that you will forget about no Americans that are being held in other places unfairly and unjustly."

(Alexander Kazakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is ready to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. access to its valuable rare minerals in the hopes of ensuring continued American support for Kyiv in its grinding war with Russia, senior Ukrainian officials said Wednesday. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, right, and President Donald Trump, talk as they attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Vatican, Saturday, April 26, 2025. “Truly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Ukrainian television. U.S. President Donald Trump indicated in February that he wanted access to Ukraine's rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the war, describing it as reimbursement for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has given to Kyiv. The U.S. is seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries. After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns. According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine's path toward European Union membership — a key provision for Kyiv.

(Alexander Kazakov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, “but before it's done, it's necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added. “We realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Trump has chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for steps that he said were prolonging the killing, and he has rebuked Putin for complicating negotiations with “very bad timing” in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv. Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia. “We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,” department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her. Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine's mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand. Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 34-year-old permanent U.S. resident was detained by armed Department of Homeland Security agents on April 14 while seeking U.S. citizenship in Vermont. Mahdawi has been held since then at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, and his case has drawn national attention over the Trump administration's targeting of pro-Palestinian student activists. “The two weeks of detention so far demonstrate great harm to a person who has been charged with no crime,” said U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, according to ABC News. Crawford's order allows Mahdawi to be released on bail, pending the final outcome of his case in federal court. Prosecutors also alleged Mahdawi had expressed support for antisemitic violence and had “an interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose,” according to sealed government filings seen by NBC. “I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said outside the courtroom after his release, according to NBC News. The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement actions against Middle Eastern students tied to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Mahdawi is the second Columbia student in recent weeks to face detention. Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led protests against the war in Gaza, was arrested at his New York apartment on March 8. A judge ruled on April 11 that Khalil can be deported, though he remains in custody while appealing the decision.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? For decades, Christian relationship advice has trended toward regressive ideas about gender: namely, that women should be submissive to their husbands, who in turn are the head of the household. Yet the romantic lives of modern Christian advice-givers are often a lot more complex than the traditional marriage roles they espouse. Millions of Christian conservative women who follow these authors seem to recognize that the writers' imperfections are part of a longer journey toward self-improvement — a journey that might also reflect their own. Nowhere is that contradiction more evident than in mega-successful Christian author and influencer Lysa TerKeurst. On her way to amassing 3 million followers across social media, writing half a dozen New York Times bestsellers, and launching her own media network, TerKeurst has made messy confessionals a core part of her brand. Similar episodes have damaged the careers of Christian celebrities who were branded “false teachers” and could not overcome perceptions of having sinned. TerKeurst, however, not only acknowledged her own failed relationship — she mined it for further wisdom, placing her among a new wave of Christian self-help authors, who are writing more candidly about their struggles. TerKeurst's audience has responded by making her one of the most successful authors in the genre: She currently has not one, not two, but five books concurrently on the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Christian bestsellers list. For decades, the average Christian self-help book has framed marriage as a divinely ordained arrangement that's ultimately about serving God and reifying gender roles. From the beginning, TerKeurst was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. The theme of women's submission to men was and is ubiquitous. It was into this crowded, archaic environment that TerKeurst, in the early 2000s, launched her long and determined writing career, peddling general advice aimed mainly at Christian women. From the beginning, she was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. She parroted the usual evangelical tropes about submission and gender difference (one chapter of her women's guide is titled “Boys will be boys”), but she also pointed out to men that “Your wife needs you to be her teammate in raising the kids and taking care of the home.” TerKeurst also blogged incessantly, gradually building a following by focusing on lifestyle and dieting advice. Among her key attributes was vulnerability: In 2008, she wrote about getting an abortion a few months after she began dating her husband, and how the accompanying guilt and shame subsequently impacted her marriage. Her bite-sized, memorable aphorisms around the messages of self-image and empowerment (e.g. “those who constantly try to impress others will depress themselves”) were tailor-made for the early years of Instagram and other social media, alongside a perpetual barrage of family photos with attractive filters of her husband and their five kids. From the start of her writing career, TerKeurst wrote about ongoing issues in her marriage; in 2002's Capture Her Heart, she wrote about starting off the marriage with a host of issues and seeing multiple couples counselors without success. “So, for the past couple of years I have been in the hardest battle of my life trying to save my marriage.” The news drew shocked reactions, but many of TerKeurst's fans were sympathetic. “Now, through her transparency in the demise of her marriage, I have learned something about my marriage ... At some point, Art TerKeurst made one bad choice that led to a slew of others. That new recommitment didn't last, however; in 2022, TerKeurst detailed in an Instagram post that despite ongoing efforts to repair her marriage, her husband had continued to cheat, ultimately firming her resolve to choose divorce. “I've had to learn the hard way there's a big difference between mistakes (which we all make) and chosen patterns of behavior that dishonor God and the biblical covenant of marriage,” she wrote. TerKeurst wasn't the only high-profile Christian advice author who was caught up in a divorce scandal through this period; Christian blogger Glennon Doyle had a similar experience in 2016, only to swiftly fall for another woman, break with evangelical culture, and start a hit liberal podcast. TerKeurst, though, chose a less rebellious path: She continued to publish her relationship advice to her audience of Christian women looking for love in a so-called traditional marriage — only now her emphasis shifted to processing the trauma of a failed relationship. Rather than sticking out a toxic situation at all costs, she now leaned into the idea of letting God help her and her audience heal from heartbreak and betrayal while learning to set boundaries. “We can't tolerate destructive patterns and call it love.” And in 2024's I Want to Trust You, but I Don't: “Rebuilding trust requires a combination of three things: Time, believable behavior, and a track record of trustworthiness.” This message of empowerment and insistence on the right to exit a floundering relationship is a far cry from the vast majority of Christian advice literature, with its emphasis on submission and staying in the marriage at all costs. “Christian women authors, as with many mainstream women authors, derive a lot of their authority from their vulnerability,” journalist Katelyn Beaty, author of Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church, told Vox in an email. Writers like Rebekah Lyons and Ann Voskamp, for example, have opened up about their mental health struggles, while others like Jennie Allen have been painfully honest about their relationship struggles, such as Allen's husband's ongoing depression. Overly idealized social media feeds and stories from influencers have even drawn backlash from audiences for presenting a false view of Christianity. Women are now gravitating toward influencers like TerKeurst who offer a less glossy version of their lives. “Christian women want to feel that their favorite authors and Instagram follows are as flawed and ‘broken' as they are,” Beaty said, “even if they still appear on social media with perfect hair, beautiful families, and fashionable clothing.” “Christian influencers and self-help experts are still held to a high moral and spiritual standard,” she added, citing influential figures like Carl Lentz, who was fired from Hillsong Church after an affair and allegations of abusing his staff. “But authors may be held to a lower standard than people in official church and ministry leadership positions…Christians can relate strongly to a story of confessing sin, admitting brokenness, and seeking forgiveness and change.” Her conservative detractors have claimed that she's too liberal, while others have accused her of forwarding various “non-Biblical claims,” including “instructing men,” and for allying with proponents of the controversial prosperity gospel. In 2024, about two years after TerKeurst's divorce announcement, she remarried and restarted newlywed life. TerKeurst has managed to develop a deep bond with her readers and constructed a durable fan base by strategically sharing bits of herself, knowing she wasn't alone in her experiences. “This beautifully honest, candid and encouraging book has been a therapist, a nurse and a friend to me throughout the darkest winter of my life,” one reviewer wrote of the 2023 devotional collection You're Going to Make It.

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? For decades, Christian relationship advice has trended toward regressive ideas about gender: namely, that women should be submissive to their husbands, who in turn are the head of the household. Yet the romantic lives of modern Christian advice-givers are often a lot more complex than the traditional marriage roles they espouse. Millions of Christian conservative women who follow these authors seem to recognize that the writers' imperfections are part of a longer journey toward self-improvement — a journey that might also reflect their own. Nowhere is that contradiction more evident than in mega-successful Christian author and influencer Lysa TerKeurst. On her way to amassing 3 million followers across social media, writing half a dozen New York Times bestsellers, and launching her own media network, TerKeurst has made messy confessionals a core part of her brand. Similar episodes have damaged the careers of Christian celebrities who were branded “false teachers” and could not overcome perceptions of having sinned. TerKeurst, however, not only acknowledged her own failed relationship — she mined it for further wisdom, placing her among a new wave of Christian self-help authors, who are writing more candidly about their struggles. TerKeurst's audience has responded by making her one of the most successful authors in the genre: She currently has not one, not two, but five books concurrently on the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Christian bestsellers list. For decades, the average Christian self-help book has framed marriage as a divinely ordained arrangement that's ultimately about serving God and reifying gender roles. From the beginning, TerKeurst was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. The theme of women's submission to men was and is ubiquitous. It was into this crowded, archaic environment that TerKeurst, in the early 2000s, launched her long and determined writing career, peddling general advice aimed mainly at Christian women. From the beginning, she was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. She parroted the usual evangelical tropes about submission and gender difference (one chapter of her women's guide is titled “Boys will be boys”), but she also pointed out to men that “Your wife needs you to be her teammate in raising the kids and taking care of the home.” TerKeurst also blogged incessantly, gradually building a following by focusing on lifestyle and dieting advice. Among her key attributes was vulnerability: In 2008, she wrote about getting an abortion a few months after she began dating her husband, and how the accompanying guilt and shame subsequently impacted her marriage. Her bite-sized, memorable aphorisms around the messages of self-image and empowerment (e.g. “those who constantly try to impress others will depress themselves”) were tailor-made for the early years of Instagram and other social media, alongside a perpetual barrage of family photos with attractive filters of her husband and their five kids. From the start of her writing career, TerKeurst wrote about ongoing issues in her marriage; in 2002's Capture Her Heart, she wrote about starting off the marriage with a host of issues and seeing multiple couples counselors without success. “So, for the past couple of years I have been in the hardest battle of my life trying to save my marriage.” The news drew shocked reactions, but many of TerKeurst's fans were sympathetic. “Now, through her transparency in the demise of her marriage, I have learned something about my marriage ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that he could secure the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month but refuses to do so. There's a phone on this desk,” ABC News' Terry Moran, said to Trump during an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday night. “And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” the president added. “I'm not the one making this decision,” Trump said, adding that he says government lawyers do not want to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the US. The administration admitted in court last month that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, was deported because of an administrative error, ignoring a judge's 2019 ruling that he couldn't be sent back to his native El Salvador, where his life could be in danger. That's not up to us,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters earlier in April. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a recent meeting with Trump that his administration isn't “very fond of releasing terrorists” detained in his country and vowed to keep Abrego Garcia in prison. Abrego Garcia entered the US illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 withheld his removal, citing concerns for his safety. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.” US officials detained the father of three on March 12 and deported him after alleging that he was confirmed to be a member of MS-13 by a “reliable source.” Abrego Garcia and his wife, however, dispute the claim and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward it. “This is a MS-13 gang member,” Trump again said in the ABC interview, citing Abrego Garcia's tattooed hands which contain skulls covering their eyes, ears and mouth, which a police document described as “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.” And then they looked on his knuckles, he had MS-13,” Trump said, claiming Abrego Garcia's knuckles displayed the name of the gang. Trump repeatedly argued, however, in response that a photo that was posted on Truth Social of Abrego Garcia's knuckles was not photoshopped, while criticizing the ABC News journalist, telling Moran at one point, “No, no. Experts have cast doubt over whether Abrego Garcia's tattoos prove gang ties. The judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case said last Tuesday that the Trump administration was not acting in “good faith” and accused officials of intentional noncompliance with their obligation to produce information. This story has been updated to including additional developments and information from Trump's interview. CNN's Devan Cole and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.</p>

Miriam Haley, center, an accuser testifying at Harvey Weinstein's rape trial, arrives to the courtroom after a break in New York, Tuesday, April 29, 2025. Miriam Haley, center, an accuser testifying at Harvey Weinstein's rape trial, arrives to the courtroom after a break in New York, Tuesday, April 29, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — A former TV production assistant told a jury Wednesday that Harvey Weinstein held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her after she told him: “No, no — it's not going to happen.” Dabbing her eyes, Miriam Haley recalled what ran through her mind during the alleged July 2006 assault: “The unthinkable was happening, I just thought any unthinkable thing could happen. I just didn't know where it ended.” It's happening because New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction. The 73-year-old former studio boss has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone. Haley testified at the original trial and was candid last year about her mixed feelings about repeating the experience. Weinstein's attorneys haven't yet had their chance to question her and potentially try to poke holes in her account. But the defense has sought vigorously — if often unsuccessfully — to rein in the scope of Haley's testimony by objecting to prosecutors' questions, such as multiple queries about whether she had any sexual interest in Weinstein. The defense has argued that all of Weinstein's accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business. Haley began her testimony Tuesday by describing how she got to know Weinstein, briefly worked as a production assistant on his company's reality show “Project Runway” in June 2006 and had a series of interactions with him that were sometimes inappropriate and suggestive, but other times professional and polite. Throughout, Haley said, she was only looking for professional opportunity — not sex or romance — with the then-powerful producer of such Oscar winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Gangs of New York.” Weinstein's retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. He's also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial. Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point. The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used.</p>

Michael Bolton refuses to go down without a fight. Over the past year and a half, the two-time Grammy Award winner has been battling glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer, People magazine reported Wednesday in a cover story. The singer was diagnosed with glioblastoma in December 2023 after undergoing emergency surgery. The outlet reported that Bolton "has purposely not been given a prognosis." Michael Bolton's short-term memory, speech and mobility have been impacted by his treatment. "You're reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought," the father of three told the outlet. "Succumbing to the challenge is not an option. You're really quickly drawn into a duel. According to the outlet, doctors were able to remove Bolton's brain tumor in its entirety during his 2023 surgery. Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 following an infection. He finished radiation and chemotherapy treatment in October of that year. He now undergoes MRIs every two months to ensure his tumor hasn't returned. Bolton first shared news of his illness with fans on Instagram in January 2024. Bolton's website shared that the musician was expected to start his tour in February of that year with shows throughout 2024. Michael Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 due to an infection, People magazine reported. "It is always the hardest thing for me to ever disappoint my fans or postpone a show, but I have no doubt I am working hard to accelerate my recovery and get back to performing soon," he wrote at the time. People revealed that Bolton's most recent scan took place in April – it was clear. Still, his battle goes on with "grace and humor." On Christmas Day, Michael Bolton shared a new photo of himself with his family enjoying the holiday season. "Sending warm wishes for a holiday season filled with peace, love, and joy," the star captioned the post. "May the New Year bring health, happiness, and countless moments to cherish. Here's to fresh starts and beautiful moments in 2025!" "Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you're not alone going through it is a big deal," said the star. It reminds them that they're not alone." Bolton has turned to family for comfort. He also dedicates his time to his six grandchildren: Amelia, 14, Olivia, 13, Dylan, 11, Grayson, 10, River, 9, and Jack, 8. They especially enjoy family trivia night, which takes place regularly. Michael Bolton has sold more than 75 million records and earned two Grammys. Bolton also finds comfort in pursuing his love of music. He also keeps busy meditating daily, playing golf and working out with a personal trainer. "I find comfort in general more easily," Bolton explained. "[The whole experience] gives me a heightened sense of appreciation. I think we develop capabilities and problem management, and we learn how to make the best out of a bad situation." "You have to be a cheerleader for yourself," he stressed. Michael Bolton performs at Bridgewater Hall on Oct. 31, 2021, in Manchester, England. The outlet shared that Bolton now looks at his legacy differently. Before, it was about his lasting career as an artist. Throughout his 50-year reign in music, he's sold more than 75 million records. But now, it's about preparing his daughters for the future and sharing plenty of life lessons along the way. "How do I give things that they can take forward?" "Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give [them] – I want to be on the right side of that, so they feel great about who they are. Suddenly, a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?'" "I want to keep going," Bolton continued. "I feel there's still a lot to do on the fight side. "I'm filled with more love and pride in my girls as they raise their own families," he said at the time. And the important things never really change. According to People magazine, Michael Bolton has settled into life at home in Westport, Connecticut, where he's lived for more than 30 years. I think what you learn is that love is the most important thing, the people you love and care for in your life."

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House Monday that illegal immigration is not a ‘victimless crime.' FIRST ON FOX: A plane full of Central Asian illegal immigrants is on its way from the U.S. to Uzbekistan under a deal brokered between the two governments, Fox News Digital has learned. The flight, which took off this morning, had 131 migrants on board. People from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan were on board the flight, and Kyrgyzstan and Kazahkstan nationals are expected to continue on to their home countries from Uzbekistan. A map highlights Uzbekistan in the Central Asian region  (Getty Images ) The deal "underscores the deep security cooperation between our nations and sets a standard for U.S. alliances," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement. "We commend Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev for his leadership in sending a flight to return 131 illegal aliens back to their home country," said DHS  Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement. Uzbekistan, with its more than 37 million people, is a security partner of the U.S. in Central Asia, situated in the neighborhood of Iran, China and Afghanistan. The U.S. has deported illegal immigrants with suspected gang ties to El Salvador's CECOT prison. The arrangement follows a deal brokered by the Trump administration after a showdown with Colombia, by which the South American country agreed to accept its nationals, including those on military planes, after President Gustavo Petro originally rejected two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying unlawful migrants. It also follows an agreement with El Salvador, by which President Nayib Bukele agreed to receive not only his own nationals but those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. Many of the immigrants are suspected of gang ties and are being held in El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison. People board a U.S. military aircraft after the White House announced "deportation flights have begun" in the U.S. (White House) Border encounters dropped to an average of 11,363 per day in February and March, Trump's first two full months in office, compared to an average of nearly 160,000 during the Biden administration.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House Monday that illegal immigration is not a ‘victimless crime.' FIRST ON FOX: A plane full of Central Asian illegal immigrants is on its way from the U.S. to Uzbekistan at no cost to Americans under a deal brokered between the two governments, Fox News Digital has learned. Over 100 unlawful immigrants are flying back to Uzbekistan on Wednesday as part of the agreement, and Uzbekistan is paying for the chartered deportation flight, the first such agreement by a foreign government since President Donald Trump took office. The flight, which took off this morning, had 131 migrants on board. People from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan were on board the flight, and Kyrsgystan and Kazahkstan nationals are expected to continue on to their home countries from Uzbekistan. A map highlights Uzbekistan in the Central Asian region  (Getty Images ) "We commend Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev for his leadership in sending a flight to return 131 illegal aliens back to their home country," said DHS  Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement. Uzbekistan, with its more than 37 million people, is a security partner of the U.S. in Central Asia, situated in the neighborhood of Iran, China and Afghanistan. The U.S. has deported illegal immigrants with suspected gang ties to El Salvador's CECOT prison. The arrangement follows a deal brokered by the Trump administration after a showdown with Colombia, by which the South American country agreed to accept its nationals, including those on military planes, after President Gustavo Petro originally rejected two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying unlawful migrants. It also follows an agreement with El Salvador, by which President Nayib Bukele agreed to receive not only his own nationals but those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. Many of the immigrants are suspected of gang ties and are being held in El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison. People board a U.S. military aircraft after the White House announced "deportation flights have begun" in the U.S. (White House) Border encounters dropped to an average of 11,363 per day in February and March, Trump's first two full months in office, compared to an average of nearly 160,000 during the Biden administration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion. Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson, left, takes on Minnesota's Gable Steveson during a 285-pound match in the finals at the NCAA wrestling championship, Saturday, March 22, 2025, in Philadelphia.

Hulk Hogan felt sure he was onto something. After watching the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, he was absolutely certain. Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion. Last month, Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Minnesota's Gable Steveson — an Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo — with a late takedown to claim the national title at heavyweight. Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump after his victory last month in Philadelphia. Then, with a United States flag draped over his shoulders, the Air Force second lieutenant walked over and shook Trump's hand and hugged him. He'll be commissioner of a league that announced its plans on Wednesday. Hogan wants the league to provide more earnings opportunities for a sport that historically has lacked them. And after Hendrickson's big moment, he feels the time is now. Hogan, who at 71 still has those massive arms and the charisma to match, initially was a bit worried that the freestyle wrestlers might not have the personality to sell tickets. “Dude, they've all got that edge,” he said. And they've all got that little Conor McGregor swag.” Real American Freestyle events will feature single matches at eight men's and four women's weight classes. The women's U.S. Olympic freestyle team earned four medals in six weight classes in 2024, while the men claimed three medals. Zahid Valencia and Ben Askren have agreed to participate on the men's side. Hogan said Hendrickson and Steveson are possible additions, and his eyes lit up when the subject of a possible rematch came up. “How much can we say,” Hogan asked his advisors. Hogan's Real American Beer serves as the title sponsor, and he has plenty of support. Hogan knows some fans will be shocked that his next step does not involve pro wrestling, but he's confident in his decision. “The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,” he said. Because of name, image and likeness deals, college athletes will be able to participate, though Hogan said the league won't interfere with college, national and international competitions. Hogan did bring in one connection from his pro wrestling days. “Eric jumped in with both feet, and he's doing a lot to guide this ship right now, brother,” Hogan said. “He's setting so much stuff up production wise — just moving us forward, light years ahead of where we could have been on our own.” He is an accomplished wrestling coach who has helped build champions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Hogan said Martinez played a key role in getting USA Wrestling's blessing. Hogan considers the new league an alternative to pro wrestling. “I see this as an opportunity for me to get involved,” Hogan said, “to get back, quit sitting on the couch, to get involved with a bunch of powerful athletes that I can relate to as far as championship material, guys that are on top of their game, and I just — I couldn't pass on it.”</p>

Los Angeles Kings left wing Kevin Fiala celebrates a goal by center Phillip Danault during the second period in Game 1 of an NHL hockey first-round playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers, Monday, April 21, 2025, in Los Angeles. Before games, Dallas forward Matt Duchene relies on the same, tried-and-true routine. He blocks out a two-hour window for a nap, eats an identical meal — pasta and salmon — and spends time reviewing notes he's made in his journal. Like many NHL players and coaches, Duchene is a creature of habit. These familiar patterns can be sleep- or food-related. Or revolve around how they get dressed for a game. Or how they tinker with their hockey sticks. Many have their go-to menu on game day. For Vegas forward Pavel Dorofeyev, it's pasta with alfredo sauce and chicken, while Stars forward Mikko Rantanen prefers chicken, pasta and sweet potatoes. Vegas forward Tomas Hertl has the same breakfast every morning — scrambled eggs with mushrooms, ham and onions. “That's just been a game-on, turn-the-engine-on, type thing,” said Wedgewood, whose pregame meal is usually chickpea pasta with marinara sauce, two chicken breasts and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Coaches aren't immune to their routines, either. “They have a jalapeno-popper pizza with grape jelly,” DeBoer said. “Sounds crazy, but may be the best thing I've ever tasted.” Unless, of course, it involves how players put on their uniform. Same with Vegas defenseman Ben Hutton: “I kiss the inside of my jersey when I put it on,” he said. “I nap around the same time, that's just routine more than ritual. I was a little bit more (superstitious) when I was younger, but with my life the way it is, I've kind of had to change my schedule on the fly with a busy household,” said Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo, who has four kids, including triplets. Following morning home skates, Carolina forward Mark Jankowski typically takes Lucy, his 6-year-old golden retriever, for a stroll. “Get some sunlight,” said Jankowski, who was acquired by the Hurricanes in March. Then, a pregame meal for Jankowski, followed by slipping on a pair of Normatec boots — compression therapy to enhance circulation. He naps (60-90 minutes) before taking off for the rink. Washington goaltender Logan Thompson used to have numerous superstitions, including not stepping on cracks. “Over the last two years just switched it up of making sure my body feels good and just keeping it loose,” Thompson added. For keeping it loose, he credits “sewer ball,” a game played in some corner of a hockey arena all over. The exact rules are always subject to debate. “A good way to keep my mind off the game,” Thompson said. As part of his pregame routine, Hertl cranks up the tunes. These days, his playlist is heavy Czech music because it's been setting the proper goal-scoring mood. “I'm the kind of guy who can listen to everything,” Hertl said. Hanifin's teammate Brayden McNabb chomps on gum (peppermint) in warmups. Avalanche forward Jonathan Drouin spray-paints the bottom of his sticks to add a little extra weight. Stars forward Mason Marchment makes sure his stick is stiff and newly taped. Duchene slightly tweaks his routine depending on if it's a road or home game. On the road, he includes rice with his pasta and salmon. He also naps in a hyperbaric chamber before home games. “As a younger player, I was extremely superstitious, and I hated it,” said Duchene, who writes the title of a song — “Jim Bob” by Hardy — on his stick. “I did everything to the minute before a game. I got away from it a few years back. “That's the most pure form of playing hockey. That's how you do it your whole life.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is renewing GOP divisions over trade as the Senate prepares to vote on the repeal of President Donald Trump's global tariff emergency. Republicans have nervously given Trump leeway to negotiate a raft of trade deals, with the reimposition of tariffs serving as leverage, but Paul and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the Democratic co-sponsor, still want a vote. The resolution is considered privileged, meaning GOP leadership, who can lose three Republicans on any party-line vote, are unable to stop their request. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) acknowledged the measure stood a strong chance of passing, citing an earlier effort by Senate Democrats to repeal more narrow tariffs on Canada. But the vote amounted to a symbolic rebuke of the Trump administration and divided a party that traditionally prides itself on free trade. “Obviously, it's a, you know, opportunity for the Democrats to put something on the floor that they think puts Republicans in an uncomfortable position, but I don't think most Republicans at this point see it that way,” Thune said of this week's resolution, describing the mood of his conference as “wait and see.” Beyond Democrats, the universe of potential “yes” votes lies in the seven Republicans who co-sponsored a separate bill that would sunset any tariff not approved by Congress after 60 days. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME) — voted for the Canadian resolution and could be expected to do so again. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a co-sponsor of the Grassley bill, confirmed that he will not vote for the tariff repeal, calling it a partisan “shirts and skins exercise.” Several other co-sponsors were noncommittal or unaware the vote had been scheduled. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) declined to preview his vote but also described it as a “messaging” effort that had no chance of becoming law. The two men have periodically clashed on policy, but Paul has warmed to the president over his agency-slashing Department of Government Efficiency and Cabinet picks like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I voted for him, support him, love a lot of the things he's doing, but we shouldn't have a country ruled by emergency,” Paul said of the powers Trump is using on trade. McConnell, the former majority leader and home state colleague to Paul, made similar remarks at a business forum last week, noting that Kentucky relies heavily on international commerce, with its bourbon exports particularly vulnerable to a trade war. “It's not an anti-Trump thing, in my opinion, but a structural thing,” McConnell, whose relationship with the president soured after the Jan. 6 riot, said. Still, their vote against the Canadian tariffs on April 2, which came hours after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” duties, was viewed as the first legislative blemish of his second term. Republican anxiety has calmed some since Trump imposed those tariffs. The administration has been eager to show progress in trade talks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling reporters on Tuesday that 17 deals with major partners are in “motion.” Trump has also taken steps to ease the tariffs' impact, signing an executive order on Tuesday that prevents overlapping duties on the auto industry. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attempted to smooth over those concerns in a Tuesday lunch with Senate Republicans in which he briefed the conference on the state of negotiations, while congressional leaders are urging unity on the resolution vote. The administration had previously stoked confusion over whether Trump wants the tariffs to be a temporary bargaining chip or a permanent trade barrier. The uncertainty also spilled into Trump's relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Tuesday after reports that the retail giant would begin listing “import charges” on its website. Amazon denied the change after an angry call to Bezos from Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He has been making that face a lot these days. “There is certain momentum where people are now feeling like — well, the politicians are feeling like, ‘Oh there's a political reason why I should now speak out and be a fighter.' I don't care why you're joining the fight at this point, we just need everybody out there, right?” Pritzker told CNN in an interview a few minutes later. “And then there are others who are joining the fight because they're coming to a real realization that, ‘This is much worse than I thought it would be and it's getting worse.' And then I look at some of the people who have capitulated and I wonder in the end, is this how you want people to think of you?” Related article Tested by Trump's first 100 days, Democrats take stock of lessons learned for fights ahead There was nothing subtle about Pritzker's trip to New Hampshire, the state where politicians go to spark chatter about potential presidential runs. Nor was there much subtlety with his intense speech chiding his own party for “simpering timidity” and demanding a stronger, prouder response to what he sees as the “tyrants and traitors” among the Republicans, woven with lines designed to be easily clipped on social media. The existential bet is that things are going to get much darker and more authoritarian. The political bet is that Democrats will remember deep in their cores who was out front first. The Democratic Governors Association's aghast statement after Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was because Pritzker, along with frequent phone buddy Minnesota Gov. Pritzker and his aides are initiating calls to other governors, state legislators and activists urging them to follow Illinois' lead in anticipating Trump's next moves. Pritzker has his own plane, so it wasn't travel logistics that kept him from this year's National Governors Association meeting in February in Washington, but an unspoken statement about how feckless he has found the Republicans in the group in standing up for their states against Trump and how disappointingly docile he has found too many of his fellow Democrats. He likened it to the point when Nazis were on the rise, everyone was writing them off and only looking back “where you can feel, you know it, you can see and absorb what was happening in 1933, 1934.” Others, including fellow governors, see opportunism, or at least the convenient freedom that he has as a rich man in a solidly blue state so comfortable in his standing and wealth that he spent millions in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary to get a weaker candidate he could run up the score on. Unlimited money means unlimited new groups and organizations he can fund that don't do much except provide new avenues for press releases and TV bookings. His fortune means Pritzker has the dollars, but also the entre with other major donors to serve as a sort of angel investor in ways that are known among Democratic insiders but not immediately apparent. Sometimes that's through drawing attention by news of where he's weighing in. Stacy Pearson, an Arizona consultant who helped run last year's successful campaign to pass abortion protections in the state, told CNN that unlike other big donors who have not actually helped, Pritzker's efforts were so quietly strategic — ranging from chipping in for the legal fees to secure the initiative's spot on the ballot to subsidizing outreach and ads — that she found herself telling the governor right before the election that she couldn't figure out how they'd efficiently spend whatever else he was offering. “No one ever tells me,” Pearson remembers Pritzker saying with a big laugh, “they don't need more of my money.” Yet Pritzker is in a party where attacking Elon Musk can seem at times just as popular as attacking Trump, where independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been drawing massive crowds around the country for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and where several operatives already sizing up the prospective presidential field told CNN they're looking forward to making Pritzker's bank account his main weakness. I think it's an easy word for people to use. I don't take it as an offense to me.” Related article Bernie Sanders' message of resistance finds fresh life as Democratic Party searches for direction That's why, Pritzker said, he spent so much time traveling his state in his first run for governor and participating in dozens of debates and forums, so that “by the end, I think what people said is, ‘He's a normal guy and he cares about people like me. “I know Pritzker is a billionaire, but I also know he has been consistent in how he's spoken,” said Liz Kotowski, a retired environmental works employee from Manchester. One measure of the political moment and how Pritzker has placed himself in it: His call for mass protests and disruptions lit up Democrats online and top MAGA personalities, who quickly accused him of an incitement toward violence that was not, in fact, in his carefully worded speech. Also reposting video from that moment of the speech: Ocasio-Cortez. Part of Pritzker's speech in New Hampshire included blasting Trump for subverting Jewish values in the name of combatting antisemitism through the administration's war with elite universities. Pritzker didn't really read much of it when he was 13. “It's our family ethos that's kind of wrapped up in this thing. He was an enormously ethical person who cared deeply about this country and the fact that we were really saved by this country had we not had the ability to have safety and security. Phil Murphy, who set out to charm Trump over dinners at the president's Bedminster golf club during the height of Covid-19 and was one of the first to call the president after last year's assassination attempt, still ended up with Trump's former lawyer — via her new perch as an interim US attorney — investigating him over his handling of immigration enforcement. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, fiercely loyal since she was Trump's press secretary, had to go public after being denied federal recovery aid following recent storms in her state. But I was going to suffer that either way,” Pritzker said. “It's not like he hasn't had words about Chicago.” He also gave a speech urging Trump-stunned Democrats to rediscover themselves, then declared into the microphone, “I'm not running.” Pritzker didn't bother with a line he knows isn't true, though in the interview before the speech he stuck to saying he hasn't even decided whether to launch the campaign for a third term as governor that aides are already planning, teasing more speeches around the country, and giving on-brand line: “This is a time for people to stand up and fight.” Several party operatives working their way around the weekend's White House Correspondents' Dinner events were gaming when to reach out about signing up with him, while focus group research has already quietly been passed around about whether the governor's weight is a positive or negative with voters, according to people who've seen the findings. The Democratic diehards in the longtime first-primary state on Sunday night responded with a 40-minute clump waiting to thank Pritzker and take their own photos, or to lean in with a version of how state Rep. Zoe Manos said goodbye: “When are you coming back again?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump was supposed to destroy establishment centrists with an anti-woke global populist revolt. But his wild second presidency may be doing the opposite. Many Western democracies are experiencing the same intractable political issues that lifted Trump to his stunning electoral comeback last year, including high prices, affordable housing crises and difficulties controlling their borders. So not long ago, Trump's 2024 blueprint looked like a roadmap for populists everywhere. But his power grabs, attacks on US allies and tariff wars have swiftly brewed resentment. Foreigners might be cynical about their own leaders, but many look at Americans and think, “We don't want what you've got.” That's why Mark Carney is still prime minister of Canada. The Liberals' late sub-in is celebrating an astonishing election victory after pulling his party from 25 points behind in a couple of months. But he wouldn't even be in politics if it weren't for Trump, whose demands that Canada become the 51st US state and tariffs that could be existential for its economy doomed the opposition. “The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has echoed a lot of Trump's language for years,” said Matthew Lebo, a political scientist at Western University, Ontario. “To sound Trumpy at a moment when all of Canada's attention turns to Donald Trump and sees the damage of it – it was just awful timing for Poilievre.” But you don't get much more establishment than a prime minister who studied at Harvard and Oxford and ran two central banks. “Mark Carney just looked made for this moment,” Lebo said. The next chance for an anti-Trump wave is in Australia, which holds a general election this weekend. Weeks ago, Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seemed headed for defeat. But he's surged in the polls amid fury among voters over US tariffs, and the opposition conservative coalition, led by Peter Dutton, another anti-woke culture warrior, has stalled. But if Albanese's once-unpopular government survives, Dutton will face the same questions about political positioning as Poilievre. (Impressions that Dutton is accident-prone solidified early in the campaign after he punted an Australian football at a cameraman's head during a disastrous photo-op.) The US president is deeply disliked abroad, and his bombast and insults have fostered anti-Americanism that creates dilemmas for leaders who must deal with him. But his approval spiked over his unflappable dealings with the Trump and support for Ukraine as the US began to turn its back. Still, Starmer's greatest test lies ahead, with the president's state visit with King Charles III looming – an act of flattery by pageantry that many Britons oppose. French President Emmanuel Macron has been struggling almost since his reelection win and was instrumental in the collapse of his own government after disastrously calling National Assembly elections last year. He's been warning for years that Europe needs to take care of its own defense needs – and Trump's attacks on allies have allowed him to relaunch his perennial unofficial campaign to be the EU's indispensable leader. Germany's elections earlier this year seemed to buck the trend, since the far-right populist AfD party doubled its vote share after being openly backed by Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk. Anger over tariffs could blunt far-right leader Marine Le Pen's bid to use Trump-style tactics to brand her conviction for embezzlement as election meddling ahead of France's 2027 presidential vote. Even Brexit architect Nigel Farage, who critics accuse of spending more time at Mar-a-Lago than with his constituency in a faded English seaside town, distanced himself from Trump's Ukraine policy. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose anti-democratic playbook made him a MAGA hero, is increasingly unpopular ahead of elections next year. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who won office on Trump-style immigration policies, remains popular and is promoting herself as a bridge between her friend in the Oval Office and Europe. More broadly, Trump's sudden political earthquakes are looming over other campaigns. Both South Korea and Japan have key elections this year that will be shaped by the trade wars. Leaders of both US allies are under pressure to do quick deals to mitigate economic damage that could hurt their voters. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday rejected the idea that Japan's general election in July and South Korea's presidential vote in June will clog up talks on trade deals Trump needs to show his strategy is working. “I think from our talks that these governments actually want to have the framework of a trade deal done before they go into elections to show that they have successfully negotiated with the United States,” Bessent said. “So we are finding that they are actually much more keen to come to the table, get this done, and then go home and campaign on it.” But trade deals involve painful compromises that can alienate key voting blocs – hardly what politicians need before tough elections. It might, since there's no sign Trump will tone down his act. In fact, voters repeatedly send clear messages that they want change, but their new governments often struggle to deliver. And big political wins can quickly fade under the weight of intractable issues – just ask Starmer. He must defuse the trade war with Trump, which threatens to cause an economic crisis and destroy millions of Canadian jobs. He must find new markets and revenues for his country now that the US is no longer a reliable partner. And the prime minister doesn't have much room to maneuver. He'll need smaller parties to pass legislation that could entail tough political choices.

They appeased angry voters by brutally ditching unpopular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a desperate Hail Mary to keep power. They picked a non-politician in Carney to lead them. But in an era of grumpy voters and leaders struggling to deliver, even big electoral wins don't guarantee success. America, after all, is experiencing its third straight one-term presidency – assuming Trump obeys the Constitution and goes home in January 2029. Starmer's Labour Party landslide last year will count for nothing on Thursday, when Farage's far-right Reform Party is expected to claim huge wins in local elections that could portend its eclipse of Britain's most successful election machine, the Conservative Party, in the next general election. Is it too soon to predict a populist revival?</p>
