                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The law “cannot create a healthy home environment where one doesn't already exist,” an abortion advocacy group noted. Abortion rights advocates oppose notification or permission abortion laws for minors, noting that they can pose a danger to those who have difficult home lives with their parents or guardians. The Nevada law was passed in 1985 but has never been enforced, as it was immediately challenged and deemed unlawful due to precedents established by Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood of Nevada filed a challenge to the law, arguing that it is “unconstitutionally vague.” Responding to that challenge last week, U.S. District Judge Anne Traum placed a temporary hold on the law. Parental notification or permission laws exist in around three-quarters of U.S. states. But such exemptions come with obstacles that render them almost meaningless, including transportation barriers and minors not knowing about the bypass or how to obtain one. Judges with anti-abortion biases can also ignore safety concerns and simply say “no” to minors seeking an exemption. “Most minors already consult their parents beforehand” if they're seeking an abortion, Wild West Action Fund said in a Facebook post, adding that, “for many others, abuse incest, safety threats and a myriad of other concerns keep them from disclosing their abortion.” “Minors are capable of making these decisions for their own bodies and futures,” the organization added. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US homeland security secretary said Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador ‘not under our control' Noem repeated White House assertions about Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported from Maryland last month, in a new interview with CBS. Ábrego García was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. Despite the order, on 15 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials deported Ábrego García to El Salvador where he was held in the Center for Terrorism Confinement, a controversial mega-prison. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego García's deportation was an “administrative error”, it has repeatedly cast him as an MS-13 gang member on television – a claim his wife, a US citizen, and his attorneys staunchly reject. Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US, according to court documents. Trump officials claim that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because Ábrego García is a Salvadorian national and no longer in the US. Noem asserted the Trump administration's claims to CBS, saying: “President Trump and his administration has adhered to the court and respects the court and its decision,” adding, “This individual is not under the United States of America's jurisdiction and he is not one of our citizens. Last week, a federal judge accused the White House of “bad faith” in the case, arguing that “defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court's orders”. Upon being asked about the administration's claims against individuals who have been deported without due process, the homeland security secretary said: “Obviously, we're relying on the expertise of our investigators, our teams, double-checking, triple-checking, going through the paperwork, making sure that we have done everything absolutely correctly.” We have several activist judges across the country,” she said, despite some of the judges who have ruled against Trump's immigration policies being nominated by Republicans. Earlier this month, J Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan-appointee and conservative appellate judge, called the Trump administration's claims in Ábrego García's case “shocking”, saying: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States used Agent Orange as a weapon of war. From 1961-1971, the U.S. military sprayed toxins that contained large quantities of dioxin in order to destroy food supplies and improve visibility for the U.S. military by killing broad swathes of vegetation throughout southern Vietnam. As a result, many people have been born with congenital anomalies in the formation of the spinal cord, limbs, heart, palate, and more. This remains the largest deployment of herbicidal warfare in history. In the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the Nixon administration promised to contribute $3 billion for compensation and postwar reconstruction of Vietnam. In order to achieve justice for Agent Orange victims, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) introduced a legislative package on April 28. The Agent Orange Relief Act of 2025 provides for medical care and related assistance for Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange; provides additional environmental remediation for hotspots; and orders a health assessment and assistance to affected Vietnamese American communities. Tlaib also introduced The Victims of Agent Orange Act of 2025, which provides benefits for children of male U.S. veterans who served in Vietnam affected by congenital anomalies; these children are unprotected by current law, which only covers congenital anomalies for children of women veterans. The bill also supports greater research into Agent Orange-related health issues and directs a health assessment and provision of assistance for affected Vietnamese American communities. “Together, these two bills serve as an act of repair for the profound harms caused by the United States' use of Agent Orange and other herbicides. Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect the lives of American veterans, Vietnamese people, Vietnamese Americans, and their children,” Tlaib stated in a press release. “The lives of many victims are cut short, and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, which are often untreated or unrecognized. As we mark 50 years after the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam, it is time to meet our moral and legal obligations to heal the wounds inflicted by these atrocities.” The legislative package is co-sponsored by Representatives André Carson (D-Indiana), Sarah McBride (D-Delaware), Jerry Nadler (D-New York), Lateefah Simon (D-California) and Shri Thanedar (D-Michigan). The bills are endorsed by the Quincy Institute, Veterans For Peace, Vietnam Agent Orange Relief & Responsibility Campaign (VAORRC), CommonDefense.us, Minnesota Peace Project and Action Corps. Tlaib told Truthout, “For there to be any justice for the war crimes committed in Vietnam, the United States must devote itself to repair: by cleaning these ongoing Agent Orange contamination sites, investing in the medical care of those affected, and removing unexploded ordnance.” VAORRC, for which I serve as co-coordinator, assisted Tlaib in drafting the bills. In the congresswoman's press release, Susan Schnall and Ngo Thanh Nhan, also co-coordinators of VAORRC, thanked Tlaib for introducing this important legislation. The United States government used Agent Orange as an instrument of war from 1961-1971 on Vietnam, its people, and American soldiers on the ground. Ngo stated: “The Southeast Asian communities have victims of Agent Orange and were invisible to the public so far. These are very important acts for our communities in the U.S. to support and it takes great courage for Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to show this example of solidarity.” Many other Vietnamese people were or continue to be exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin through contact with the environment and food that was contaminated. Many offspring of those who were exposed have congenital anomalies, developmental disabilities, and other diseases. Second, third and fourth generation victims continue to suffer. They include AL Amyloidosis, bladder cancer, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure (hypertension), Hodgkin's disease, hypothyroidism, ischemic heart disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, acute and sub-acute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers and soft-tissue sarcomas. His sons were unable to walk or function normally. Their limbs “curled up” and they could only crawl. Shortly after her daughter was born, the child's skin began shedding. She could not tolerate physical contact with anyone. Tran's second daughter suffers from alpha thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder rarely seen in Asia. Many children are born without brains; others make inhuman sounds. There are victims who have never stood up. After refusing to serve a third tour, Mizo was court-martialed, received a dishonorable discharge and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. Before his death from Agent Orange-related maladies, Mizo helped found the Friendship Village where Vietnamese victims live in a supportive environment. Although a Biometrics study from 1965 showed that dioxin caused many congenital anomalies in animal experiments, the U.S. military suppressed those findings. In 2004, U.S. veteran and Vietnamese victims sued the chemical companies that knowingly manufactured Agent Orange and other herbicides, which they knew contained a lethal amount of dioxin. Despite agreeing to compensate U.S. veterans in an earlier lawsuit for some illnesses caused by their exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides, the U.S. government and the chemical companies claimed before the courts, and to this day, that no evidence supports a connection between exposure and disease. Efforts by veterans' groups and others to take care of U.S. vets produced a compensation scheme administered by the Veterans Administration. It annually pays out billions of dollars to veterans who can demonstrate that they were in a contaminated part of Vietnam and have an illness associated with Agent Orange exposure. Shamefully, the Vietnamese people who were exposed to Agent Orange on a scale unheard of in modern warfare have been denied recompense. The U.S. and Vietnam conduct $160 billion in annual commerce. Just compensation for victims of Agent Orange is a moral imperative. People who support Tlaib's legislation should contact their congressional representatives and urge them to sign on as additional co-sponsors.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wildfires raging near Jerusalem forced evacuations in several areas and led to several major road closures on Wednesday, as firefighters struggle to contain the flames amid dry conditions and high winds. “This is perhaps the largest fire ever in the country,” Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. The fire forced authorities to close Route 1, the major road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Wednesday – Israel's Memorial Day. Hours later, emergency workers ran amongst long lines of abandoned cars on the highway, looking for anyone who may still be in their cars, according to a video from United Hatzalah, an emergency response organization. “We don't know at this time what caused the fire. We are still not dealing with it,” Friedman said. The fire is active on multiple fronts, authorities said, with one area concentrated around the town of Neve Shalom, located about 15 miles west of Jerusalem. In one clip, the flames can be seen next to the road along a packed section of highway. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar held a marathon of talks with other countries to bring in firefighting aircraft, according to his office, particularly nearby countries in Europe. Three aircraft from Italy and Macedonia will arrive “as soon as possible,” the National Security Council said in a statement. At least ten communities in the area have been evacuated, authorities said. “We are in a time of national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilized to save lives and bring the fires under control,” said Defense Minister Israel Katz Wednesday. There are about 120 teams fighting the fire, Israel's Fire and Rescue Services said, as well as 12 firefighting aircraft and helicopters. More than a dozen people have arrived at two separate hospitals as a result of the fire, according to Shamir Medical Center and Kaplan Medical Center.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia can mobilize for war on a scale comparable to the Soviet Union during World War II if necessary, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 30. No one can have any doubts," Peskov said during a lecture at the Victory Museum in Moscow. He claimed that "millions" of Russians are already assisting the military effort against Ukraine by collecting aid, sending equipment and ammunition to the front line with personal funds, and weaving camouflage nets. "Somewhere around 30 million Soviet people... gave their lives in the fight against fascism," he added. Peskov's comments come as Russian authorities recruit 30,000 to 40,000 people into the army each month, sources familiar with U.S. and EU intelligence told the Wall Street Journal. Instead of formal conscription, the Kremlin has leaned on financial incentives and aggressive recruitment campaigns to fill its ranks, including offering lucrative contracts to volunteers. While Russian President Vladimir Putin has avoided another large-scale draft following the unpopular 2022 partial mobilization that triggered the exodus of over 261,000 Russians, military leaders are reportedly pressuring the Kremlin to initiate a broader draft. The current recruitment pace is sufficient to cover Russia's reported frontline losses, which NATO estimates at roughly 1,000 troops daily. Deputy Chairman of Russia's State Duma Defense Committee Alexei Zhuravlev said in January that a larger mobilization may be necessary in preparation for potential conflict with Western nations within the next three to four years. Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told LB.ua on April 9 that Russia could mobilize up to 5 million trained reservists, with a total potential capacity of 20 million people. Though conscripts are formally barred from frontline combat, many are indirectly drawn into the war through various recruitment methods.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lamberth said the Trump administration must seek congressional approval to take such action, noting that it “has no residual constitutional power to refuse” to spend appropriations by Congress. “It is, after all, Congress that makes the laws in this country. In this case, for example, it was Congress who ordained that the monies at issue should be allocated to RFE/RL,” Lamberth stated, referring to the acronym for Radio Free Europe. According to the court order, USAGM presented “a radically different grant agreement” in mid-April, leaving little time for a meaningful negotiation as Radio Free Europe was running out of funding. “If our nation is to thrive for another 250 years, each co-equal branch of government must be willing to courageously exert the authority entrusted to it by our Founders,” Lamberth stated. The cutbacks affect the organizations and agencies under its umbrella, including Voice of America (VOA); the Office of Cuba Broadcasting; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and other organizations such as Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The organization filed a lawsuit against USAGM on March 18 and subsequently sought a temporary restraining order to block the funding cancellation. Stephen Capus, president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, welcomed the ruling and said that they hope to receive the funding quickly. Capus said the group had to furlough staff and scale back some of its programming due to the funding cut. The Epoch Times reached out to USAGM for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Just slow down and you'll see it.” It is also where the Trump administration has paid to send 238 Venezuelan migrants, and a black hole from which no information escapes – except for what the Salvadorian government chooses to reveal. The Guardian requested to visit but received no response. “It's like Guantánamo on steroids,” said Juan Pappier, Human Rights Watch's deputy director for the Americas. “These people are outside the US, in a country with no separation of powers. They're in a space essentially ungoverned by law.” Three years ago, Bukele declared a state of exception that has continued ever since, suspending constitutional rights and unleashing the state to take on El Salvador's gangs, including through mass incarceration without due process. About 85,000 people – 1.4% of the population – have been arrested since. Most are being held in pre-trial detention. Human rights organisations believe many people without ties to gangs have been swept up, and have documented almost 400 deaths in custody. The mass arrests broke the gangs' territorial grip, brought homicides down and gave many Salvadorians a kind of freedom they hadn't known for years. But at the same time, Salvadorians know they now live at the whim of a president who has accumulated near absolute power. In Tecoluca, the rural district in the shadow of Cecot, most were afraid to speak with their names. César Cañas, a local councillor and activist, said that the prison was built without public consultation. Locals only found out when construction trucks started arriving in 2022. The military had set up a checkpoint on the access road, so Cañas approached on foot from the other side to investigate, finding that farmers had been forced to sell their land or face expropriation. “When Radio YSUCA published our findings, that forced the president to give his version,” said Cañas. “And he tweeted that they were building a mega-prison to house 40,000 terrorists. Even now, locals say they know almost nothing about what happens inside the prison. This reflects the fact that only one prisoner is known to have left the Cecot alive: Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who was wrongly deported from the US and subsequently transferred to another prison, where he still has no contact with the outside world. This tight control on information coming out of Cecot allows authorities to shape its image through choreographed visits from select media, influencers and US Republican politicians, making it the public face of the state of exception. Those visits have shown large cells with three tiers of metal beds but no sheets or mattresses. They never see sunlight, but the lights inside are never turned off – except for the pitch-black solitary confinement cells. The government says 15,000 prisoners are currently held there. “Cecot is not meant for rehabilitation,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organisation. “In that sense, it's intentionally cruel,” added Bullock. “And that's what is being communicated: that finally we have a leader strong enough to deal with these people how they should be dealt with, which is as something less than human.” The propaganda doesn't reflect the reality of El Salvador's state of exception nor its prison system, where people who may have nothing to do with gangs are trapped in still more terrible conditions in prisons such as Izalco. When Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, gave a speech in the prison, she did it in front of MS-13 members – not the Venezuelans they had just deported. “Cecot is the international mega-prison,” he said. People don't have a voice any more.” “I'd have preferred a mega-university,” he added quietly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawyers for an Australian woman accused of fatally poisoning three family members with deadly mushrooms have told the jury their deaths were a “terrible accident.” She is also charged with the attempted murder of Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, who was also at the lunch but survived. Crown prosecutors allege Patterson deliberately served lethal mushrooms to kill her lunch guests; her defense counsel claims the deaths were a tragic accident. They said when she learned how ill her guests had become after eating her meal, she “panicked” and acted in ways that may seem suspicious. The saga, which has gripped the nation for two years, began on a summer day in late July 2023 when Patterson hosted the four relatives of her estranged husband at her home, telling them she wanted to discuss a medical issue. Her ex-husband had also been invited but did not attend. During the meal, Patterson served her guests individual beef wellingtons – a steak and pastry dish that incorporates mushrooms. Her guests fell ill hours later and were all admitted to hospital where doctors suspected mushroom poisoning, prompting a police investigation. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC alleged that Patterson served the guests death cap mushrooms – a highly poisonous variety of wild fungus – that she had picked herself. Patterson herself had gone to the hospital, claiming to feel unwell after the meal – but her tests did not show severe illness, and she voluntarily discharged herself against doctors' advice, prosecutors said. Related article ‘Mushroom murder' trial begins for woman accused of killing lunch guests in Australia Prosecutors allege that cell data showed Patterson traveling to an area where death cap mushroom sightings had been detailed online, and that months before the lunch, she had posted online about dehydrating mushrooms for use in food, according to CNN affiliate Seven News. Patterson had told police she didn't own a dehydrator, but surveillance footage after the deaths showed her disposing of a unit at a local trash dump, which was later found to contain traces of death cap mushrooms, the court heard. Her defense lawyers told the jury they don't dispute that the guests died from her meal – but argued she had not intentionally poisoned them. “The defense case is that Erin Patterson did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests at that lunch on the 29th of July, 2023,” said defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC. “She didn't intend to cause anyone any harm on that day. Mandy admitted that Patterson had lied about the dehydrator and about foraging for mushrooms, saying she had simply panicked in the moment. “The defense case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food that she'd served to (them),” Mandy said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow sees no interest from Kiev in carrying out a dialogue; voices in the EU call for re-engaging with Russia; and Kiev levels the playing field in latest minerals deal proposal to the US. None of Russia's attempts to declare a ceasefire have been supported by Ukraine, which indicates that the Kiev regime is betting on war, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia. Nevertheless, Russia remains open to dialogue with Kiev without preconditions. "Not a single attempt to declare a ceasefire has in practice been supported by the Kiev regime, which continued to violate the truce. This shows that the regime is staking everything on war," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia, adding: "moreover, Kiev's self-imposed legislative ban on negotiations with Russia remains in effect." Hollow declarations of peace are not enough, we do not see any indication that Ukraine is demonstrating or confirming a willingness to pursue a ceasefire," Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large for Crimes of the Kiev Regime Rodion Miroshnik said in an interview with Izvestia. There have been no direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since the end of March 2022. "It is highly likely that such negotiations could resume in 2025, if only because Kiev is under considerable pressure from Washington and the international community to seek a diplomatic resolution," Tigran Melkonyan, analyst at the Center for Mediterranean Studies of the Higher School of Economics, told Izvestia. "Kiev is also facing serious challenges on the front lines - most notably a shortage of manpower. At the same time, it is important to remember that Zelensky has created a legal barrier by prohibiting himself, by law, from engaging in direct negotiations with Russia. Therefore, if talks do resume, they are likely to start at the level of technical working groups and Foreign Ministry representatives," he added. Two European Parliament factions support the notion of restoring relations with Moscow, and many MEPs would back direct dialogue with Russia should there be significant progress in negotiations between the United States and Russia. Moscow has also indicated its willingness to resume dialogue if such an initiative comes from the European side, according to the Federation Council. "I am a member of the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and if that group were to participate in talks, I would be happy to contribute to the re-establishment of contacts and mutually beneficial relations, which are important for Slovakia and Central Europe," Milan Uhrik, Deputy Chairman of the Europe of Sovereign Nations faction in the European Parliament, told Izvestia. "Today, we cannot expect a majority of MEPs to support such resolutions. But their concerns may dissipate once more substantial progress is achieved in negotiations between the Russian Federation and the United States," he added. Petar Volgin, a member of the European Parliament from Bulgaria, also expressed readiness to engage in dialogue with Russian counterparts. He noted that the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee could serve as a potential platform, though informal meetings in this format have not taken place since 2019. Within the European Union, the depth of understanding regarding their own internal situation and what is happening in Ukraine is close to nil. Communication with Russian parliamentarians would be of benefit to them," Kosachev said. At present, it is difficult to envision a shared agenda for discussion between Russia and the European Parliament, as the EP's current role is largely to produce anti-Russian resolutions. However, this does not mean that Russia should refrain from making proposals. Alexander Asafov, a member of Russia's Civic Chamber, noted in an interview with Izvestia, interparliamentary dialogue has proven effective, much like interparty dialogue within BRICS and with other allied nations. According to Ukrainian officials, the agreement between Ukraine and the United States concerning Ukrainian resources has been transformed from a "predatory" deal into an "equitable" one following revisions. However, if signed in its current form, the agreement would constitute a setback for US President Donald Trump, who had earlier pledged to recover American taxpayer funds spent on Ukraine, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Moreover, despite promises and forecasts, the agreement remains unsigned. Experts noted that US officials are beginning to understand the difficulty of negotiating with Ukraine, particularly when the latter is unwilling to compromise. Meanwhile, The Financial Times also reported that Washington and Kiev are close to finalizing a deal. The outlet suggested that the agreement - which could be signed as early as this week - would cover all of Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas, and other key energy assets. Speaking to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for International Studies at MGIMO University Nikolay Silayev said it would be prudent to wait and see what is ultimately signed. "For Donald Trump, the current situation is certainly a failure, as he has repeatedly emphasized his interest in this agreement, describing it as part of his broader peace plan for resolving the conflict in Ukraine. The United States has now learned firsthand what it means to negotiate with Ukraine when it has no intention of reaching an agreement," he said. Moreover, doubts persist regarding the legitimacy of President Vladimir Zelensky, whose official term expired on May 20, 2024. When Ukrainian authorities eventually sign it, political repercussions are inevitable," the expert concluded. Spain and Portugal had nearly fully restored their power grids by April 29 following the most extensive blackout in modern European history, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the Portuguese outlet Diaraias de Noticias, which cited a statement from local grid operator E-Redes. Experts told Vedomosti that the massive blackout in Spain and Portugal was caused by systemic vulnerabilities stemming from the rapid integration of renewable energy sources without adequate modernization of grid infrastructure, leading to reduced resilience and instability in the power system. Blackouts of this scale are relatively rare in Europe. Sergey Rozhenko, Head of energy analytics at Kept, noted that the increasing integration of industrial-scale electronics into power systems to accommodate renewable energy sources "reduces resilience to system failures." Data from Ember indicates that around 43% of Spain's energy is generated from renewable sources, with nuclear accounting for another 20% and fossil fuels comprising 23%. Grivach emphasized that the European energy system, built around renewables, has become highly weather-dependent. Spain and Portugal, where up to 50% of electricity is generated from renewables, remain particularly vulnerable, agreed Georgy Kutyrev, Research Fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Higher School of Economics. "Rapid deployment of renewables without accounting for their intermittency creates systemic imbalance," Kutyrev concluded. The organization forecasts that global silver demand will decline by 1% this year, reaching 1.15 bln troy ounces. Experts told Vedomosti that while the global silver market will remain in deficit in 2025, the shortfall is expected to narrow due to stable industrial demand and limited supply growth, with structural constraints, rising solar demand, and declining consumer interest creating a complex and imbalanced market. Silver's high thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its corrosion resistance, make it a vital industrial material. According to the Institute's forecast, industrial usage of silver will remain virtually unchanged in 2025 at 677.4 mln ounces, marking a slight year-on-year decrease of 0.5%. According to a report by Heraeus Precious Metals, a German technology company specializing in precious metals, the primary drivers of price growth are rising interest in solar energy and a resurgence in demand from the Indian market. Heraeus forecasts that silver prices in 2025 will fluctuate between $28 and $40 per ounce on the global market. Independent industrial expert Leonid Khazanov told Vedomosti that the silver market deficit is structural, driven by the fact that a significant portion of the metal is extracted as a byproduct of mining other resources. He estimates Russia's annual silver consumption at 80-100 metric tons. He pointed out that while industrial demand remains robust, consumer interest in jewelry and silverware is declining.

Hungary's Parliament voted on April 29 to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on X.

The decision formalizes Hungary's intention, first announced in early April during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Budapest.

The move follows the ICC's issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza — a move Budapest has sharply criticized.

"With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility," Szijjarto wrote.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar welcomed Hungary's move, according to the Times of Israel. Following the vote, withdrawing from the ICC jurisdiction will take a year, once Budapest officially notifies the U.N. Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, of its decision

The ICC, established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, is a permanent tribunal based in The Hague that prosecutes individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. 

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the forcible deportation of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. 

Despite the warrant, Mongolia hosted Putin for an official visit in September 2024, citing energy dependence as its reason for not executing the arrest and saying it had limited options.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. After two years of destructive fighting, Sudan's civil war has reached an uneasy stalemate. Over the past few weeks, fighting began to ebb, but it is again intensifying in North Darfur's provincial capital, El Fasher, the SAF's last remaining stronghold in Sudan's west. Because the war's frontlines seem mostly set, historical precedent suggests that now would be an ideal time for a cease-fire or even peace negotiations. In many previous African conflicts, a battlefield deadlock encouraged international actors to push for negotiations, as happened in 2005, when U.S.-backed talks ended the second Sudanese civil war after more than two decades of fighting between southern rebels and Khartoum. Indeed, it might even seem that de jure partitioning, akin to the 2011 secession of South Sudan, could be the least bad option. The Sudanese people certainly need a reprieve: the latest conflict has devastated the country, leaving as many as 150,000 Sudanese dead, nearly 13 million displaced, and up to 25 million facing severe food insecurity or famine. But in the case of Sudan's current civil war, any hope that negotiations, if they can be started, will result in lasting peace is illusory. Simultaneously, a wide variety of actors—including powerful foreign countries—have an interest in seeing the factions they have backed stay as powerful as possible. History strongly suggests, however, that any kind of territorial fragmentation will also fail to bring stability. If the warring sides continue to refuse a cease-fire or peace talks, that could yield a situation similar to what has occurred in Libya and Yemen: a de facto split in which Sudan remains intact in name only. Rival power centers will take hold in different parts of the country, and many of the groups that are fighting today, alongside new ones that will likely emerge, will continue to fight. The current Sudanese civil war is far from a straightforward, two-sided conflict. It began as a brawl between two factions within the country's security apparatus—the SAF, under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti. Burhan and Hemedti had allied to topple the civilian-led transitional government that had emerged after the long-standing Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir's ouster in 2019 but then turned on each other in April 2023. Over the course of two years, their rupture has metastasized into a much bigger war involving numerous Sudanese groups and well-resourced foreign patrons such as Egypt, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. New militias have emerged to align with each faction, and older armed groups have thrown their lot in with either the SAF or the RSF. After the Bashir regime armed Janjaweed militias to counter rebellions by non-Arab groups in Darfur, in 2013 it officially organized these militias into the RSF. In reality, however, one of the current war's most important motivators is Sudan's vast mineral and agricultural wealth. In addition, smaller factions have lined up behind one side or the other to wage more localized power struggles or to secure personal wealth: the JEM's leader, Gibril Ibrahim, for instance, has sided with the SAF, in part, to maintain his lucrative role as Sudan's minister of finance. On the surface, the fact that Sudan's civil war is driven by material rather than ideological interests makes the prospect of a negotiated settlement appear more viable, even if hammering one out would be complex. If each important faction got something concrete that it wanted, one theory goes—if natural resource concessions or cabinet positions were distributed satisfactorily among the combatants—the fighting could stop. But the RSF's forces are battle-hardened and skilled at insurgency tactics, giving them an advantage in urban warfare, as evidenced by their ability to hold Khartoum and other major cities for two years. Such efforts to resolve the Sudanese conflict misunderstood its dynamics. Even as the fighting has begun to ebb, many of the war's key players are unwilling to engage in a settlement that would end the stream of profits generated by their war machines. Early on, both sides sought external support to fund their war efforts. To secure an export corridor for Sudanese goods, Abu Dhabi has sent cargo flights full of powerful weapons, drones, and armored vehicles to the RSF via its client state (and Sudan's western neighbor), Chad. To that end, Cairo has sent military aid to the SAF and has allegedly engaged in airstrikes against the RSF. Egypt also relies on Sudanese resources—often smuggled—to help prop up its flailing economy. Although Saudi Arabia has publicly positioned itself as a peacemaker, it has implicitly sided with the SAF during past rounds of negotiations, in part because of its regional competition with the United Arab Emirates. The SAF has also courted Russia, which wants to establish a military base on the Red Sea, and it recently secured drones from Iran and Turkey, two actors that also want greater influence over nearby shipping lanes. For these international partners, an informal stalemate is not so different from a negotiated peace. And foreign backers can maintain lucrative supply lines without the burdens associated with doing business with a legitimate state (such as regulations and tariffs) or popular protests against resource extraction that benefits a small elite. Perhaps the greatest barriers to achieving a negotiated peace in Sudan, however, are internal. Each broad alliance is dangerously fragile, susceptible to infighting and splits. The war has already been marked by high-profile defections, such as that of Abu Aqla Kaykal and his Sudan Shield Forces. Challenging simplistic narratives that cast Sudan's wars as disputes between Arabs and Africans, this conflict has transcended ethnic bonds, which makes each coalition less robust. In October 2024, for instance, as the SAF recaptured El Gezira, some SAF troops and associated militias attacked non-Arab ethnic groups. In retaliation and to protect other non-Arab groups, SLA and JEM forces in El Gezira clashed with SAF-aligned Arab militias, even though those two groups are officially allied with the SAF. The RSF's recent retreat from central Sudan suggests that the militia may be willing to surrender that territory to focus on cementing its hold over Darfur. Even if some short-term truce could be reached, the large assortment of ethnic groups and ideological camps that have allied with each side means that restoring social cohesion will be even more difficult. The country's de facto partition is already beginning. A split may ostensibly seem an attractive outcome, but it is extremely unlikely to bring durable peace. The SAF's coalition includes both secular armed groups and Muslim Brotherhood–aligned Islamist militias, but its most important international patrons—Egypt and Saudi Arabia—are staunchly anti-Brotherhood. Furthermore, any new polities would not have contiguous ethnic boundaries. The project of governing heterogeneous regions would be tremendously complicated by Sudan's weak or absent state institutions, especially in historically marginalized territories held by the RSF. Additionally, both the SAF and RSF are moving away from land battles and instead seek to destabilize their rivals' territory with air or drone strikes, making the country as a whole increasingly ungovernable. Paradoxically, the high degree of fragmentation that makes a unified government so hard to achieve in Sudan is the same thing that makes any solution that splits the country and establishes multiple governments unstable. At present, both broad alliances would be hard-pressed to identify a contiguous area of territory that they and their supporters would be satisfied to maintain and other zones that they are willing to cede. And given the many accusations of war crimes leveled against each side, neither alliance could boast a solid mandate to govern within the territory it controls. Because the conflict is overwhelmingly driven by a struggle over regional power and resources, rather than any larger political vision for the country, it remains likely that alliances will keep shifting, militias will keep defecting, and breakaway groups will keep forming. Sadly, instead of either peace or partition, Sudan's most likely future is more war.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced a new policy that reduces the default withholding rate to 50 percent for recovering Social Security benefit overpayments under Title II, the federal program covering retirement and disability insurance.

Under the updated directive, any overpayment notice issued on or after April 25 will automatically carry a 50 percent withholding rate. Beneficiaries will have 90 days to respond—either by contesting the overpayment, requesting a waiver, or negotiating a lower repayment rate. If no action is taken within that window, the SSA will start withholding half the monthly benefit until the overpayment is fully repaid.

The updated rules do not apply to Title XVI overpayments, such as those involving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, who still face the 10 percent withholding rate. The revised policy also excludes cases involving fraud or similar fault, which follow different recovery procedures.

With its latest decision to cut the withholding rate in half, the SSA appears to be seeking a middle ground between fiscal responsibility and potential beneficiary hardship.

SSA's overpayment recovery practices have come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and watchdogs in recent years, particularly for the stress they impose on beneficiaries who may have had little or no role in the errors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ford Johansen, 15, and his seven-year-old sister, Darby, are still trying to accept that it was the last time they saw a smile from their mother, Jenifer Darbellay. They were looking for dessert from a food truck when the SUV came barrelling through. But Ms. Darbellay, 50, was hit hard and did not survive. People pay their respects at a vigil near the site of the Lapu Lapu festival tragedy in Vancouver, on April 29.Jimmy Jeong/The Globe and Mail “If you'd ever met her, you'd remember how she was the light in every room she'd go in,” her husband, Noel Johansen, holding the crutches he now needs to walk, speaking along with his children, told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday. Dozens of others are injured, including a 22-month-old boy, police said Tuesday. Police are confident that the attack was not an act of terrorism, though a motive remains unclear. He said he has not been able to see his parents' bodies yet to say goodbye, but was at Vancouver General Hospital with his sister's fiancé on Sunday, when she died in the early morning. “Canada is supposed to be a safe place,” he said. Kira Salim, a 34-year-old trans teacher-counsellor, was also identified as one of the victims by their colleagues at the New Westminster school district. They had moved to Canada from Brazil to live more safely as a queer person, said Nadia Sorban, their friend: “They were such a big, energetic, beautiful, smiling human.” Toan Le said his brother, Richard Le, was killed at the festival with his five-year-old daughter, Katie, and wife, Linh Hoang. Had Katie's brother, 16-year-old Adam, not stayed home to do his homework that night, he also would have been there, Mr. Among several fundraising pages set up online, with tens of thousands of dollars donated thus far, Rizza Azzir was confirmed as one of the victims by her cousin, Shelby Anne Marie Pacumio, who requested privacy to process the news. On her GoFundMe page, Ms. Pacumio said Ms. Azzir, “the sweetest soul,” moved to Canada from the Philippines, first to Winnipeg, then Vancouver. Other victims include Jendhel May Sico, described by sister Maydhel Ann Sico to have always lived life to the fullest, whose death was confirmed by her employees at Winnipeg-based Taiga Building Products; and Maria Victoria Bjarnason, known to most people as Vicky, who was visiting her family in Vancouver. They had just celebrated her birthday the day prior, and she was going to fly back home on Tuesday. Helgi was holding his mother's hand and attempted to pull her away from the car, “but unfortunately she was ripped away from him,” Kristjan wrote to The Globe in a Facebook message, adding Helgi was also hit and has a broken leg. “It feels like we are all sharing this big terrible thing together,” Mr. Johansen said. “But,” he added, “please remember what we went through.
