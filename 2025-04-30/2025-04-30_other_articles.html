                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Climate change is increasingly recognized not merely as an environmental crisis but as a threat multiplier, worsening political and economic tensions worldwide. Two factors — water scarcity and mass migration — are poised to completely reshape global conflict dynamics. Fresh water is a resource we all need to survive, and as it dwindles, conflicts can flare. Put together, these human-induced changes will lead to the widespread movement of people into countries that are hell-bent on protecting their resources. Once capitalism is at risk of crumbling, social divides increase, and nations, corporations, or even ultra-wealthy individuals may begin to take matters into their own hands — addressing climate change in a way that benefits them, potentially at the expense of others. Civilizations first emerged along fertile downstream river valleys — the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates and Indus. Nowadays, upstream states increasingly control the water that downstream populations rely upon — and in a warming world, that could fuel explosive conflicts. Consider Iraq: The once-rich agricultural areas near Basra have become increasingly barren due to upstream Turkish dams and accelerating climate change. Similar conflicts are brewing in the Nile Basin, where Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam has heightened Egypt's anxieties over future water security. While Egypt's recent history of internal unrest has many roots, projected water shortages linked to the dam and increasingly erratic rainfall have amplified fears about food insecurity, unemployment and migration, all of which could compound domestic instability. As global warming accelerates, it's possible that downstream states may clandestinely carry out or finance acts of ecoterrorism against their upstream neighbors, for instance by destroying dams, as Russia did in Ukraine. President Donald Trump recently threatened sanctions and tariffs against Mexico over disputes related to water treaties involving the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers, which have had dwindling flow in recent years thanks to climate change. They clashed violently with local farmers whose farms would be receiving less water. As hostilities over water grow, climate-driven migration will also fan the flames of conflict in and between countries. After climate-affected people have exhausted all other options for adapting in place, they may resort first to internal migration and then south-to-north mass migrations that may overwhelm national borders. As migration pressures mount, wealthier nations may increasingly militarize their frontiers rather than let in these climate refugees. To avoid this fate, modern states are going beyond simply building physical barriers; they are also deploying drones, artificial intelligence surveillance and even autonomous defense systems to keep refugees out. Border hardening may go hand-in-hand with policy shifts that mean governments only protect the rights of those who can pay. The recent proposal for restructuring the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) into the US International Humanitarian Agency explicitly prioritizes American "taxpayers" and companies rather than its citizens, reflecting a broader global trend toward commodifying citizenship. Democracies that prioritize distributing resources equitably and adapting to climate change are more resilient. Unfortunately, many countries today are backsliding, becoming less democratic and even rolling back climate policies. Günther Thallinger, a member of the insurance giant's board, warned that pretty soon the company won't be able to cover climate risks — an impact that will ricochet through financial services. "The financial sector as we know it ceases to function," he wrote in a LinkedIn post. When climate risks make large segments of global assets uninsurable — think entire districts or even cities vulnerable to flooding or wildfire — the foundations of capitalism wobble. Without significant political intervention, these pressures will dramatically widen social divides, fueling migration or even revolutionary movements. The above scenarios could collectively heighten the risk of an often overlooked possibility: one where a single nation or group of nations unilaterally decides to deploy a stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) — a type of geoengineering that, theoretically, reduces the effects of climate change by lowering overall solar radiation entering the atmosphere. However, the effects of such geoengineering strategies on rainfall patterns may inadvertently alter downwind rainfall patterns, or even cause "termination shocks" to temperature when ceased. —'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever Middle-income "buffer zone" countries, like Mexico or Turkey, that may be overwhelmed by a surge of migration, could view an SAI as a way of reducing migration pressure. So, too, might democratic countries whose governments want to take action on climate change but can't find a global policy consensus. Craig Martin, co-director of the International and Comparative Law Center at the Washburn University School of Law, and Scott Moore, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist, have described the SAI scenario as a conceivable cause for war, possibly declared by autocratic or oligarchic nations that are negatively affected, or that are looking for excuses to seize resources or territories. To prevent this spiraling scenario of violence, economic disruption and political breakdown, we need urgent, proactive international cooperation. In addition to dramatic climate change prevention efforts, we must include legally binding resource-sharing treaties, humane migration frameworks and collaborative adaptation efforts, where richer nations help poorer ones. Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. The question facing humanity now is not whether we will confront these pressures, but how we will choose to do so: through cooperation and proactive governance or through escalating militarization, inequity and instability. Our collective response today will define the peace and stability of tomorrow's world. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vallee is also the first prominent figure to suggest that aliens and UFOs might actually be coming from alternate realities rather than other planets. “I can tell you that in my files… some of which I contributed to the database of, there are at least half a dozen well-documented cases where the injuries that resulted in death were deliberate,” Vallee said recently. In 2008, Jacques Vallee worked on a secret UFO study launched by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP). The project was concealed inside a Las Vegas aerospace company. According to UFO expert and investigative journalist George Knapp, writing for KLAS News, “One focus of the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) was genuinely disturbing: the real-life health consequences for humans who come into contact with UFOs. Hundreds of serious injuries have been documented. While Vallee won't discuss specific AAWSAP files, except for cases he provided to the database, he said those cases of UFO-related injuries were not accidental.” Jacques Vallee is an advocate of transparency regarding what is really known about aliens and UFOs, but is concerned that revealing the truth could cause upheaval within world religions and governments. “If we want to disclose… something as simple as saying, ‘Yes, we acknowledge the phenomenon and it seems to be from space,' we would have to… answer a hundred other questions, that this is not the end of the story,” Vallee wrote in his most recent book, Forbidden Science 6: Scattered Castles. He suggests, “I think… that we should disclose with a structure,” but “the structure hasn't been invented yet.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One whistleblower has been left fearing for his life after leaking controversial Pentagon documents containing vital UFO and alien-related secrets, yet believes his sacrifice was worth it to report 'the truth'. Alien hunting has become a favored pastime for many across America, and you can even head to some of the most popular UFO sighting locations if you want to raise the chances of spotting an extraterrestrial creature. However, what many UFO believers really want is government proof of the existence of alien life, and while astronomers have discovered a planet over 100 light-years away with the potential for life, a recent major leak could indicate that it's reached Earth already. Former Pentagon officials have already debated and hinted at the existence of UFOs and UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena), but whistleblower Matthew Brown, as reported by the Daily Mail, has now revealed a secret program inside the Pentagon that was supposedly tracking UAPs and other alien-like objects. He says he first came across the information revealed in Immaculate Constellation by accident, as 'clearly misfield' documents were found on a shared server that Brown had access to. Detailing the reason why he decided to breach confidentiality rules and go public as a whistleblower, Brown revealed on Jeremy Corbell's WEAPONIZED podcast: "This is absolutely what I did not want to do," Brown revealed on Corbell's podcast.

"I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try and make for a family. My hope is that the stakes are not paid out, but they are life imprisonment and the possibility of execution." Corbell also detailed the dangers that Brown now faces, adding: "We have had very disturbing personal threats that we take extremely seriously - not just with Matt, but with some of the other whistleblowers who have already recorded with us. There are still two additional parts of Brown's testimony to be revealed across the rest of the year, but it's claimed that not enough is being done to protect whistleblowers following the release of information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: countdown, Jensen Ackles Jensen Ackles shared what we can expect from Showrunner Derek Haas and Prime Video's Countdown and the theme it shares with Supernatural. Earlier today, we learned that Showrunner Derek Haas (NBC's "Chicago" franchise) and Amazon MGM Studios's Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys)-starring Countdown would unleash its first three episodes on June 25th. When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum, portrayed by Ackles, is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions. Joining Ackles for the series are Eric Dane (Grey's Anatomy, Euphoria), Jessica Camacho (The Flash, Watchmen), Violett Beane (Death and Other Details), Elliot Knight (The Boys), and Uli Latukefu (Young Rock). "There's plenty of action and adventure, but there's also humor and a lot of heart in the show, especially in the way the characters relate to each other," Ackles shared during an interview with Men's Health. "Which feels like it aligns with a lot of the things I've done before. These are outcast officers that don't necessarily find comfort with their unit; they're renegade mavericks in their departments, and they see themselves within each other. I think the fans will react to that." "In the wake of 'The Boys,' I signed a deal with Amazon. They wanted to develop something with me in mind, so I had a few meetings with different writers and different kinds of takes for shows," Ackles shared regarding how the series came to be during a previous weekend fan event. He and I actually grew up in the same town; we went to neighboring high schools, so we had a lot in common right off the bat. But he's just a really great storyteller, and he comes from a long line of writing really kind of intense stuff. I liked the kind of world that he was setting it in, and I got excited about it," he added. "I was fortunate enough to be in a position to do that and be there from the beginning, the genesis of it all, 'cause that's not normal," Ackles explained. "For most actors, everything is kind of already cooked, and then they come in – they get cast in a role that's already happening. As for what viewers can expect from Countdown? I think they're shooting for June, probably – release next summer, and I'm excited to see what you guys think and to see it once it's on its feet."</p>
