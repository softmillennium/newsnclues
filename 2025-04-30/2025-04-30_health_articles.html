                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite steady increases in rates of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy, racial disparities in IBR have persisted in the years since implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reports a study in the May issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). "Our study demonstrates that Hispanic women are more likely to undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts in the post-ACA era," comments lead author Rachel E. Schafer, MPH, a medical student at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. "However, our analysis shows persistent racial disparities in breast reconstruction care. To better understand these trends, future studies are needed for targeted interventions to ensure equitable reconstructive care for all patients with breast cancer." The researchers used data from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project to analyze trends in IBR. The analysis included 224,506 patients undergoing mastectomy in 2005-08, before passage of the ACA; or 2016-22, after full ACA implementation. Pre-ACA data showed significant racial disparities in IBR. After ACA implementation, IBR rates increased across racial groups. The largest increases were seen for American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American patients: by 27.6% and 24.2%, respectively, compared to a 16.9% increase among White patients. Smaller but significant increases were seen in Asian patients and those classified as "other" race. In 2016-22, the IBR rate was 52.0% among White patients, compared to 46.5% for Black/African American, 38.7% for Asian, and 31.4% in American Indian/Alaska Native patients. The researchers note some important limitations of their study. It cannot account for the wide range of factors affecting access to reconstructive surgery or for the "complex interplay of cultural, social, and individual factors" affecting decisions about breast reconstruction. For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction can restore form and enhance patient satisfaction. The new analysis shows "a steady increase in immediate breast reconstruction rates in all minority groups when compared to White patients" since the ACA. "However, despite this advancement, disparities persist among different racial groups, indicating a complex landscape of reconstructive surgery rates despite legislative efforts," the researchers write. "These findings underscore the need for continued efforts to address disparities and promote equitable reconstructive care." “Legislative Impact and Persistent Disparities: Post-Mastectomy Breast Reconstruction Rates in the United States Among 224,506 Patients.” Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery.

One of the things I think was a very sad, terrible theme that came up in many political campaigns — it was in the Trump campaign and in campaigns of various governors and senators — was the idea that immigrants, whatever one thinks of our clearly broken immigration policy, somehow are threats to the health of the American people. These were kind of allusions to out-of-date discredited views about eugenics, and that we don't want them here because they're going to somehow weaken the health of our race. You can hear businessmen touting these ideas. Some of our billionaire entrepreneurs talk about the threat they see. We know that most of the groups that people are talking about aren't even a genetic class. There really aren't any groups that cluster around many of the cultural and social terminologies that we use to describe people. These people have genes, but it's culture, history, and even, to some extent, colonialism and racism, that defines the group, not some cluster of genes that's in the group. I don't even mean to say that there aren't genetic diseases that cluster within some ethnic and racial groups, but in the immigration debate, those categories are often phony. It's even worse now as people begin to think about deportation. Some officials, in high office and at the state and even local levels, are talking about identifying diseases that people might be bringing with them if they come into the country legally or illegally. I think, currently, some are thinking they can extend that to get people out of the country — citizens or not, dreamers or not, whatever they might be — because they are carriers of disease. I think it's hugely important for doctors and public health professionals to speak up and say that this is just false, whether you're telling patients who bring it up and worry about it in the office, you're at a town meeting, or you're thinking about testifying about one of these issues in your community. There is no evidence that any immigrants, particularly, let's say, on the Mexican border, are bringing in more coronavirus, tuberculosis, or measles. It's just not true that immigrants are disease carriers or that they brought plagues or disease problems into this country. There's not much evidence that it was true then, and there's certainly no evidence that it's true now. Fishing for disease as a reason to restrict, ban, or deport people is not something that medicine should be complicit with. Adding bogus, phony, or disinformation science as a rationale is bad not only in terms of being the wrong reasons to deal with someone who wants to immigrate, but also it is a way to stereotype and make a group bear a claim of being disease ridden or having inferior health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new systematic review has found that parents and other child caregivers who have alcohol-related diagnoses are twice as likely to maltreat children in their care than parents and caregivers with no alcohol-related diagnoses. 'Child maltreatment' included physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse; neglect; and other types of maltreatment such as harsh parenting. The sample size ranged from 501 to 84,245 (median 4782). Caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses were associated with higher child maltreatment incidence (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.89) and recurrence (1.92; 1.13-3.28) compared with caregivers without alcohol-related diagnoses. Lead author Dr. June Leung, of the SHORE & Whariki Research Centre, Massey University, says "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the relationship between caregiver alcohol use and all types of child maltreatment. We found consistent associations between caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses and child maltreatment. We also could not rule out a link between any caregiver drinking and child maltreatment. Our findings call for stronger actions to limit alcohol harm, including child maltreatment." This review was published in the scientific journal Addiction. Leung, J. Y. Y., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed precisely measured human fecal material to foster a new era in gut microbiome research. According to the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for Gut Microbiome Research & Education, this critical resource will help advance the utility and reproducibility of microbiome-based diagnostics — “which still remain relatively meaningless clinically, although patients continue to buy direct-to-consumer tests, and a standard reference material will mean there's a better way to ensure quality control and accuracy.” Though not a therapeutic, Human Fecal Material RM is expected to speed up gastrointestinal (GI) therapeutics since many microbiome-based drugs are inspired by fecal transplants with human stool as the developmental starting point. A standardized reference material will be an important resource as industry develops and tests new drugs. It can be purchased online at the NIST Store (shop.nist.gov). Scientists, including those working at biopharmaceutical and biotech companies, can use this material to further their research and develop new drugs that target the microbiome, including treatments that contain living bacteria. “We hope our reference material will lay the foundation for gut microbiome research to thrive and reach its full potential.” About 300 tubes from each cohort were picked, and aliquots then underwent multiomic analyses. Offering his perspective on the new product, Sudhir K. Dutta, MBBS, MACG, associate professor in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, said, “This tool will be 100% useful for microbiome research.” “A standard stool product will allow for greater comparability in preclinical studies and later clinical trials testing interventions to alter the microbiome.” Jackson, Dutta, and Holtz disclosed having no relevant competing interests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders and brain health. A recent Nutrients study explores the medicinal role of curcumin in the treatment and prevention of neuroinflammation and metabolic disorders. Curcumin is extracted from the rhizome of turmeric, which is otherwise known as Curcuma longa, a plant in the Zingerberaceae family. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound characterized by two aromatic rings with conjugated double bonds. The chemical structure of curcumin supports its electron donor role and prevents free radical formation. Phenolic compounds impart color to many fruits and play a vital role in facilitating seed dispersal. Polyphenols also protect plants from oxidative damage caused by sunlight and other environmental factors, in addition to preserving the organoleptic qualities of plant food products like red wine, olive oils, and wheat. These compounds also remain stable in acidic conditions, such as the stomach, which allows curcumin to remain intact to influence metabolic processes beyond the gastrointestinal tract. During phase I, the double bonds in curcumin are reduced to produce metabolites like dihydrocurcumin, hexa-hydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, and octahydrocurcumin. During phase II, these metabolites are conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate. Some studies have reported that curcumin may also be metabolized by gut bacteria, particularly in the colon. Polyphenols can counteract inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are processes implicated in the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Certain metabolites derived from curcumin, such as tetrahydrocurcumin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In human THP1 monocytes, curcumin doses ranging from 7.5 μM to 30 μM successfully mitigated the effects of stimulation with bacterial toxin (LPS) and INFγ (interferon γ) in a dose-dependent manner. This antioxidant activity was attributed to the blocking of toll-like receptor 4 / mitogen-activated protein kinase (TLR4/MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways, as well as reversed M1 polarization. Curcumin doses of 25.5 μM or less have also been shown to reduce inflammasome activation. One recent study also reported that 20 μM of curcumin may prevent inflammation-related damage caused by hypoxia. A recent meta-analysis revealed that consuming 1,500 mg or more of curcumin every day for one month could significantly reduce body mass index (BMI) values and other body parameters, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Considering its medicinal properties, various curcumin-based formulations have been devised to improve the bioavailability of this polyphenol compound, such as co-administering curcumin with piperine and nanocurcumin encapsulation. In vitro studies have reported that curcumin influences the cellular viability rate and cell cycle regulation of preadipocytes. At high doses, curcumin promotes DNA fragmentation and enhances the apoptotic rate by activating caspases. Low doses of curcumin reduce cell proliferation without affecting viability. Mechanistically, curcumin reduces the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and delays clonal expansion and the cell cycle, thereby exerting antiadipogenic effects. Curcumin also interferes with adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) activity to block anabolism and promote lipid catabolism, both of which can support the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome. More specifically, activated AMPK reduces lipogenesis by inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), prevents triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (GPAT-1), and triggers β-oxidation of fatty acids by increasing transport with carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). Within the brain, low doses of curcumin may prevent inflammation by inhibiting microglia polarization and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, like interleukin 1β  (IL-1β) and IL-6. Curcumin also increases the activity of anti-inflammatory molecules like arginase 1 and IL-4. Clinical trial results have highlighted the beneficial effects of curcumin in treating overweight patients with chronic systemic inflammation. For example, 80 mg of curcumin daily for three months led to a significant reduction in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in overweight/obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) between 25 and 50 years of age. In a separate study, type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients treated with 300 mg daily of curcuminoids for three months exhibited a significant reduction in insulin resistance parameters and circulating levels of free fatty acid (FFA), which are often present in high amounts in obese patients with inflammation. Obese patients with T2D and depression who were treated with 1,500 mg daily of curcuminoids for one year also reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. In the future, additional research is needed to confirm the translational potential of curcumin in clinical practice. Large clinical trials with heterogeneous populations should also be conducted to confirm the clinical utility of curcumin in treating patients with metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AVI-4773 and related MPro inhibitors outperform existing treatments like nirmatrelvir in preclinical studies, offering a promising path toward pan-coronavirus therapies. Study: Structure-based discovery of highly bioavailable, covalent, broad-spectrum coronavirus MPro inhibitors with potent in vivo efficacy. Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous novel antiviral therapeutic agents have been developed to target key proteases involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication. Nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir, for example, are main protease (Mpro) inhibitors that are currently approved for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. The continuous emergence of highly transmissible, pathogenic, and immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants has weakened the efficacy of existing antiviral agents. Moreover, the looming threat of future pandemics due to coronaviral reservoirs in bats and other small mammals emphasizes the importance of identifying novel therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity. A recent study published in Science Advances reports the recent discovery of Mpro inhibitors that exhibit broad activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. AVI-1084, for example, exhibited a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 29 μM. This scaffold was subsequently used to contract a library of over 17,000 analogs that were evaluated for their binding activity to and docking into Mpro. The improved potency of these compounds was attributed to fluoro- and chloro- substitutions in the thiophene ring of AVI-1084 that increased their interactions with the Mpro S2 pocket. When an isoquinoline group was used to replace the pyridinone ring, AVI-3318 was created and found to be 50-fold more potent than AVI-1084. Additional structure-activity relationship (SAR) expansion involved adding various side chains at the remaining two positions of the dihydrouracil core in an effort to further improve compound potency. AVI-4303, which is a C5 benzotriazole analog, exhibited ten-fold higher potency than AVI-3318. Comparatively, N1 propargyl analogs including AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 successfully bound to the S1 site with a nanomolar IC50, which is 100-fold more potent than the des-propargyl molecule AVI-4375, which had an IC50 of 7.4 μM. Mouse in vivo studies demonstrated powerful antiviral activity of AVI-4516 against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant of concern (VOC). AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 retained similar potency to nirmaltrevir, whereas AVI-4692 and AVI-4694 were more potent than nirmatrelvir when tested against a triple mutant containing the most common mutations associated with drug resistance. AVI-4773 reduced viral titers to undetectable levels  after three doses, which is a three-log reduction in viral load as compared to ensitrelvir treatment. The combination of C6-aryl substitution with the propargyl warhead [AVI-4694] has great potential to produce an agent that effectively targets recently emergent variants of SARS-CoV-2.” The inhibitory activity of AVI-4773 and other compounds in this series is likely due to the unactivated N-propargyl side chain. AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 exhibit potent MPro inhibition, which warrants additional research to optimize the chemical structure of these tool compounds for the development of future pan-coronavirus therapeutics. Some of the key advantages of this distinct chemotype include easy modification by functional groups or substitutions at different binding sites, simple synthesis protocol, reduced manufacturing costs, potent pan-coronaviral activity, as well as superior pharmacokinetic properties and tissue distribution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at UCL have uncovered why individuals who experience anxiety and depression often struggle with persistent low self-belief in their abilities. A new study, published in Nature Communications, examined two large groups of people (230 and 278 participants) to measure their "confidence" when doing individual jobs and their "self-belief" when judging their overall performance of these individual jobs collectively. They found that those with symptoms of anxiety and depression tended to build their overall self-belief by focusing their attention on jobs where they thought they didn't perform as strongly (i.e. on low confidence) – rather than also considering jobs where they did perform well (i.e. on high confidence). In order to gain a better understanding of how participants evaluate themselves (also known as metacognition or their awareness and understanding of their own thought processes), they were asked to complete a computer game, which asked them to help the residents of a fictional town, named "Fruitville", to complete their farming jobs. These jobs required skills involving fine-grained vision (to distinguish different fruits) as well as memory (to remember which fruits were picked). Then at the end of each session of the game, they reported how well they thought they performed on the entire session (i.e. overall self-belief about their ability). During the game, an auditor occasionally appeared to give people feedback on how well they were doing. The researchers found that people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression did not differ in their performance on the games than those with less strong symptoms. They also found that positive feedback boosted overall self-belief, and negative feedback reduced it in all participants – regardless of whether they had symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression still had lower overall self-belief. This is because they tended to ignore those jobs within the game where they felt confident in their choices and instead, focused on times when they were less confident. This reduced sensitivity to their own confidence helps explain why people with certain mental health conditions have persistent low self-belief - despite their actual performance not differing from others and despite receiving similarly positive feedback. Lead author, Dr. Sucharit Katyal who completed the work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and is currently at the University of Copenhagen, said: "Overall, our findings offer a simple yet powerful message – that the persistent negative self-beliefs experienced by people with anxiety and depression are often illusory, and may be rooted in a dysfunctional view of how they evaluate themselves . This would also explain why anxiety and depression symptoms are also closely linked to imposter syndrome where some people persistently doubt their achievements despite being competent. "When forming beliefs about ourselves, we should take our own metacognitive estimates with a pinch of salt, and perhaps adequately rely on the feedback provided by others." The researchers now hope that their findings will help pave the way for more effective interventions and support strategies for people with anxiety and depression. By understanding how these individuals respond differently to their own performance and feedback, we can develop better strategies to support them in building and maintaining confidence – so they can flourish in the workplace and beyond." Distorted learning from local metacognition supports transdiagnostic underconfidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Employing too few permanent nurses on hospital wards is linked to longer inpatient stays, readmissions, patient deaths, and ultimately costs more in lives and money, finds a long term study published online in the journal BMJ Quality & Safety. Redressing the balance is cost-effective, saving an estimated £4728 for each year of healthy life gained per patient, but not if temporary agency staff are used to plug the gaps, the findings indicate. Inadvertent understaffing–through unfilled vacancies–or deliberate–through cost cutting measures–of ward nurses risks harming hospital patients, and is a key contributor to nursing recruitment and retention issues, say the researchers. To find out if investing in higher nurse staffing levels to offset understaffing would be cost-effective, they set out to estimate the associations between registered nurse and healthcare assistant staffing levels and risk of patient deaths, readmissions, and length of stay in acute adult inpatient wards. They drew on data provided by four NHS hospital trusts with diverse nurse staffing levels, sizes, teaching status, serving diverse local populations in England. Three of the trusts provided acute inpatient services predominantly from single hospital sites, and the fourth provided inpatient services across four sites within one city. The data were derived from electronic healthcare records and staffing rosters and spanned the period April 2015 to March 2020 for a total of 626,313 patients in 185 different acute care wards. Two main nursing team roles were included in the study: registered nurses (RNs) who have completed university degree level training and are registered with the profession's regulator; and nursing support staff (such as healthcare assistants) who don't have this level of training and who are largely unregulated. Patients spent an average of 8 days on the ward. The calculations showed that patients on wards understaffed by RNs were more likely to die (5% vs 4% for those with adequate RN staffing levels), to be readmitted (15% vs 14%), and to stay in hospital longer (8 days vs 5 days), with similar figures for inadequate numbers of nursing support staff. Patients who experienced understaffing received an average care shortfall of 1 hour 9 minutes/day in the first 5 days, while those who didn't experience understaffing, received an average of 3 hours 22 minutes of care above the ward average. Each day a patient experienced RN understaffing (staffing below the ward average) during the first 5 days of their stay, the risks of death and readmission within 30 days increased by 8% and 1%, respectively. When all 5 days after admission were understaffed, length of stay increased by 69%. But the risk of readmission within 30 days fell by 0.6%. The researchers calculated that eliminating understaffing of both nursing roles would cost an additional £197 per patient admission, avoiding 6527 of the 31,885 deaths during the study period and gaining 44,483 years of life in good health. This equates to an additional staff cost of £2778 per healthy year of life, and £2685 if reduced sick leave and averted readmissions are taken into account. If agency staff are used to eliminate understaffing instead, staff costs for each additional healthy year of life gained were higher, ranging from £7320 to £14,639. "The findings give no indication that it makes rational economic sense to target efforts to rectify low staffing only on the most acute patients. Not only is this logistically difficult for patients whose acuity is emergent (occurring while on a general ward), it also gives much less benefit at a considerably higher cost per unit improvement in outcome," explain the researchers. "Steps to address low staffing for the general (lower acuity) population are likely to benefit high-acuity patients as well, in so far as they are in the same units, whereas the opposite is unlikely to occur if interventions are targeted on high-acuity patients in high-acuity units," they add. Understaffing was also judged relative to ward norms rather than a validated assessment of staffing need. But the researchers conclude: "When considering alternative policy strategies, this study indicates the importance of prioritising investment in RNs employed on wards over support staff, as well as showing there are no shortcuts to employing enough RNs, as using temporary staff is more costly and less effective."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have developed a new diagnostic test that can quickly and accurately diagnose bacterial meningitis. The test measures the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that is already often tested in blood to detect bacterial infections. Research shows that elevated CRP in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. Currently it often takes a long time before meningitis is diagnosed, which delays the start of adequate treatment. Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening condition in which one in six patients die and half of the survivors have residual symptoms. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. The distinction between bacterial meningitis and similar conditions is often difficult for doctors. Until now, reliable diagnostic tests that could quickly distinguish were lacking." Matthijs Brouwer, last author and Amsterdam UMC neurologist Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have discovered that the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. CRP is already frequently tested in blood to detect bacterial infections, but the value of this test in cerebrospinal fluid had not been well researched until now. After previous successful laboratory tests, the researchers now showed that the device that measures CRP in blood is also sensitive enough to measure CRP in cerebrospinal fluid. In the study published today, researchers describe how the test was introduced and how effective it is in practice. "Our results show that all patients with bacterial meningitis had an elevated CRP in their cerebrospinal fluid. This was the case in only a few patients without bacterial meningitis, " adds Brouwer. It is expected that more hospitals will adopt the test, because it can easily be performed in laboratories with existing equipment. We could not have predicted in advance that a new diagnostic test would be used in patients within a year of its discovery," concludes Brouwer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have shown that better cardiovascular and mental health, as measured by the Life's Crucial 9, correlates with lower infertility rates in women; however, its predictive power offers no advantage over existing tools. Study: Life's crucial 9 is inversely and linearly associated with female infertility prevalence: a cross-sectional analysis from NHANES 2013–2018. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored the associations between Life's Crucial 9 (LC9) and female infertility. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study found that female infertility prevalence has increased by over 56 million cases in the past three decades worldwide, and is also projected to increase over the next decade. Female infertility can cause emotional and psychological stress. Besides, female infertility may be linked to the development of various gynecologic cancers, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) is a tool for cardiovascular health assessment by the American Heart Association. Recently, LC9 was proposed, building on the LE8, and includes a mental health assessment component. Females not of reproductive age and those with missing data were excluded. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 was used to assess diet quality. Sleep health, physical activity, and nicotine exposure were self-reported. The blood glucose score was determined based on glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, or a history of diabetes, while the blood lipid score was derived from serum levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A depression score was calculated from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Female infertility was ascertained from the self-reported Reproductive Health Questionnaire. Covariates included age, ethnicity/race, education, marital status, income-poverty ratio, alcohol intake, age at menarche, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) history, and intake of birth control pills. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between female infertility and LC9. Furthermore, restricted cubic spline models were examined to investigate non-linear associations between the independent variable and female infertility. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether LC9 improves over LE8 in predicting female infertility. The study enrolled 2,088 females, with an average age of 32.6 years. The infertile population was more likely to be non-single, non-Hispanic White, and older than females without infertility. As LC9 scores increased, subjects were younger, non-Hispanic White, free from infertility, moderate/light or never drinkers, and had higher age at menarche and no PID history. The fully adjusted model indicated that a 10-point increment in LC9 reduced the odds of female infertility by more than 21%. Similarly, a 10-point increment in LE8 decreased the odds of infertility by nearly 18%. Both LE8 and LC9 showed negative linear associations with female infertility. Further, higher scores for BMI, sleep health, blood glucose, and depression were each independently and inversely associated with infertility. Further, the team identified ethnicity/race and age as significant effect modifiers. That is, the associations between infertility and LC9 were more pronounced in the Mexican American population and in women under 35 years. The ROC curve analysis revealed that LC9 and LE8 had comparable predictive capabilities for female infertility, with modest area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.594 and 0.590, respectively, indicating limited predictive utility. The findings reveal inverse linear associations of LE8 and LC9 with female infertility. Depression, blood glucose, BMI, and sleep health were the components of the LC9 that were (inversely) associated with female infertility. However, LC9 did not significantly outperform LE8 in predicting female infertility. These results suggest that incorporating a depression score into LE8 may not be essential for infertility prediction, despite depression's association with infertility. The authors note that the overlap between depression and other cardiovascular risk factors may reduce its added predictive value, and that depression assessment tools like the PHQ-9 may introduce subjectivity. Future research should examine the benefits of LC9 in other health domains, particularly in young women and underserved ethnic groups, and explore interventions targeting modifiable LC9 components, such as sleep and mental health. Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported measures, and the inability to infer causality. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Study: Revisiting the cognitive and behavioral aspects of loneliness: Insights from different measurement approaches. The study aimed to assess the agreement between these classification methods, informing future research and treatment interventions for this growing public health concern. Study findings demonstrated a fair to substantial classification agreement, but also revealed the considerable impact of cognitive and behavioral traits, such as interpretation bias, participant self-esteem, and social avoidance, on participant group differences across classification methods. These results highlight the complexity of loneliness and call for future treatments to carefully consider the several dimensions of loneliness across both cognitive and behavioral axes. While exceedingly common (almost everyone experiences periods of loneliness across their lifetimes), today's fast-paced world and reductions in sufficient social interaction have exacerbated chronic loneliness to a globally relevant public health concern, affecting between 5.3–12.7% of all people and causing significant negative mental and physical health outcomes. While the former is an evolutionary cue that encourages increased social connections, the latter results from cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies and can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues, as outlined in Cacioppo and Hawkley's cognitive loneliness model. "This model suggests that loneliness triggers a cascade of cognitive processes that heighten awareness of social disconnection. These processes include heightened sensitivity to subjective social threats, negative attributions, and biased social information processing, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors such as social withdrawal and increased vigilance toward potential social threats and thereafter maintain or increase feelings of loneliness." A distinct yet often overlooked difference between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness is its persistence. Current measures of loneliness, including the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the Rasch-Type Loneliness Scale (RTLS), may not sufficiently account for the persistence and other dimensions of maladaptive loneliness's complexity, thereby compromising their ability to classify patients accurately and inform subsequent treatment. It is essential to note that while this study explores the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, its primary focus is on the maladaptive aspects and does not directly investigate adaptive loneliness in practice. It evaluates cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals across the loneliness spectrum by first classifying them via three distinct classification methodologies (frequency, distress, and chronicity), subsequently evaluating the degree of agreement between these methodologies, and finally elucidating the impacts of these psychological variables as dependent outcomes (rejection sensitivity, interpretation bias, self-esteem, etc.) Study data was obtained via an online survey hosted on SurveyCircle, internet forums, and social media. Target participants were German-speaking adults aged 18 years or older. Loneliness distress was measured using a 2-item custom query ('Do you feel lonely?' in combination with 'extent of distress due to loneliness'). Additionally, interpretation bias was recorded using the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ), social avoidance behavior using the Cognitive-Behavioral Avoidance Scale (CBAS), rejection sensitivity using the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ), comfort of self-disclosure using the Distress Disclosure Index (DDI), self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and avoidance goal intensity using the Inventory of Approach and Avoidance Goals (IAAM) scale. To account for confounds introduced by overlaps with anxiety and depression, psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Subscale (SIAS-6). Of the 1,389 individuals who participated in the online survey, 553 did not complete it, and 44 participants failed data integrity checks, resulting in a final study cohort of 790 participants (mean age = 31.86, 81% female). "…these results indicate that while there is some overlap between different loneliness classification methods, they are not entirely interchangeable. The varying levels of agreement across measures suggest that each method captures a distinct aspect of loneliness, with distress and chronicity showing the highest alignment and frequency showing lower agreement with the other methods." Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that individuals classified as lonely using frequency classification were more likely to experience rejection sensitivity and lower self-esteem (large effects), interpretation bias, social avoidance behavior, and lower distress disclosure (medium effects), as well as avoidance goal intensity (small effects). Notably, similar cognitive and behavioral differences were observed across all three classification methods. However, the effect sizes varied, with distress-based classifications showing the strongest associations and chronicity-based classifications showing similar but sometimes smaller effects. The authors note several limitations to their findings. The cross-sectional design of the study does not permit conclusions about causality; therefore, it remains unclear whether cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies cause persistent loneliness or result from it. There is also a potential for self-selection bias, as individuals experiencing loneliness may have been more inclined to participate in a study explicitly advertised as focusing on loneliness, potentially inflating prevalence rates. Additionally, the study relied solely on self-report measures, which can introduce response biases such as underreporting or overreporting feelings due to social desirability or recall issues. Furthermore, the study was not pre-registered, which limits transparency regarding hypothesis testing. The present study reveals that while classifications of loneliness patients according to differing criteria (frequency versus distress versus chronicity) may display fair to substantial agreements, nuanced evaluations of these patients highlight stark differences in their dimensions and experiences of loneliness. At the same time, the cognitive and behavioral correlates associated with loneliness were consistent across classification methods, suggesting a shared profile of maladaptive traits among those identified as lonely by any of the three approaches. "Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to build on these findings, further to investigate the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, and develop effective strategies to combat loneliness."
