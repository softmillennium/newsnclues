                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: NBCUniversal recently went through two major changes: the spinoff of a new standalone company that will house cable networks such as E!, Syfy, Oxygen and USA Network and a restructure that saw new roles for top executives including Pearlena Igbokwe and Frances Berwick. Deadline understands that the Comcast-owned company is now starting a process of layoffs tied to these moves. We're hearing that a few dozen employees across NBCUniversal's television and streaming business are being let go. It was always expected that a number of NBCUniversal executives who worked across multiple cable networks and streaming service Peacock, would depart with SpinCo looming. Deadline understands that people who were moving to SpinCo from NBCU were informed earlier this week and these cuts are now being made following that. Earlier this year, SpinCo named Val Boreland, who was EVP and Head of Content Acquisitions, TV & Streaming for NBCUniversal, as its President of Entertainment. These networks, which may well get their own head of originals working for Boreland, don't greenlight as many originals as NBC, Peacock or Bravo, which are all obviously remaining with NBCUniversal, but there are still plenty of original series across E!, Syfy and USA Network, in particular such as House of Villains and Botched. Oxygen also orders a raft of true-crime content such as Cold Justice, produced by Dick Wolf, Deadly Waters with Captain Lee, and long-running series Snapped. Following a previous restructure, many of its top execs bought and developed programming across NBC, its cable networks and Peacock. But the move in January by Donna Langley, Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment in January to make Pearlena Igbokwe  Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted and Frances Berwick, Chairman, Bravo & Peacock Unscripted, cleared some of this up. It also led to the departure of the likes of Peacock President Kelly Campbell and Corie Henson, who was EVP, Unscripted Content, Competition and Game Shows, NBCUniversal Entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Numerous Hallmark Channel stars have rallied around actor Noel Johansen, whose wife died on April 26, 2025, when an SUV plowed into the crowd at Vancouver's Lapu Lapu Day festival, per the Associated Press, killing 11 and injuring dozens at the annual Filipino cultural celebration. Artist Jen Darbellay, 50, was among those killed, while Johansen and their seven-year-old daughter Darby were injured, according to the Vancouver Sun. Family friend Michael Daingerfield Hall told the paper that the family was preparing to walk a block-and-a-half home when chaos broke out. He has created a GoFundMe campaign for the family, which many Hallmark stars have shared with fans. Two days after the tragedy, on April 28, Johansen was on crutches while attending an emotional candlelight vigil for victims, per the Global News, and expressed how heartbroken his family is over his wife's death. Propped up on his crutches, Johansen choked back tears as he told the crowd, “What you see here, it's just an injury that means nothing to me because what's inside my heart is broken. A 30-year-old man whom Vancouver police said has a “significant history of interactions with authorities involving mental health,” has been charged with the murders of those who died, according to Reuters. On April 29, multiple Hallmark stars shared a GoFundMe campaign set up by Daingerfield Hall for Johansen and his kids. WCTH actress Loretta Walsh posted a photo of the couple on Instagram and shared that Darbellay was personal friend, writing, “Jen was a bright light – beautiful inside and out. An artist, a creative, an empath, she was always so sweet with her greeting of ‘Hey Beauty' and always so positive and kind.” Noel has his own physical injuries from the incident, plus he will need time away from work to be with his children and to heal physically and emotionally. Others who have shared the fund for Johansen include “The Chicken Sisters” actress Rukiya Bernard, “Curious Caterer” actress Jaycie Dotin, and WCTH star Pascale Hutton.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The label founded by Todd Moscowitz has grown rapidly since it adopted a three-tiered approach to signing and developing artists. Blankenship released the track in April 2024 through a distribution company called Foundation. “Maxed Out” performed well — so well that Blankenship graduated to Foundation's sister operation, Santa Anna Label Group, a more high-touch distributor that's able to put marketing muscle behind its artists. “I appreciate their expertise on the content and digital side,” says Brian Schwartz, who manages Blankenship. “And they know how to pour the fuel on what's working.” “Maxed Out” now has more than 121 million on-demand streams in the U.S., according to Luminate. After launching Alamo in 2016 and introducing Santa Anna at the start of 2023, Moscowitz has cobbled the companies together into “a soup-to-nuts, fully integrated ecosystem where artists [have] a path to graduate to a premier frontline label,” as he puts it. This approach is becoming increasingly common, as both major labels and independents look to sign more acts and offer an array of options that allows those artists to grow over time — while also remaining attached to the company that initially offered them funding. Foundation functions as a feeder system, signing a lot of young artists, many in hip-hop and R&B, primarily to low-money, short-term distribution deals. 1 album recently with the PARTYNEXTDOOR–Drake collaboration $ome $exy $ongs 4 U — as well as individual artists who have already generated some momentum. And Alamo is the more traditional frontline label: It signs a small number of artists directly and provides services to each of them. Hybrid companies like this — offering the flexibility of a distributor but the promotional firepower of a major label — often work better in theory than in practice. In 2024, Santa Anna added more than a point (1.04%) of current market share to Alamo's 2.11% total. Already this year, Alamo has grown to a 2.91% current share through the first quarter — 1.83% of it from Santa Anna/Foundation — which is good for eighth among all labels in the U.S. Getting to release a Drake collaborative album was a coup for the company; $ome $exy $ongs 4 U, which Santa Anna co-distributed with Republic Records, earned 246,000 equivalent album units its opening week. He calls Alamo's integration with Santa Anna and Foundation “brilliant — and potentially an indicator of where things are going in the future.” He worked at Def Jam during its 1990s heyday and then moved to Warner Music Group (WMG) in 2004, initially as president of Asylum Records. There, he designed “a fluid system in terms of the deals, because when you're dealing with entrepreneurs, you must be flexible,” as he put it in 2022. When WMG launched its Independent Label Group in 2006, Moscowitz was named president of the new outfit. He later co-founded the indie 300 Entertainment, which launched in 2014, before jumping ship to get Alamo off the ground two years later. Alamo, which now functions as a frontline label under the Sony Music umbrella, signed chart-topping rappers like Rod Wave and Lil Durk, who have combined to earn 11 top five Billboard 200 albums for the label, including four No. Even as Alamo enjoyed that traditional label success, however, Moscowitz couldn't help but notice that “distribution [was] becoming an ever more important entry point into the business for artists.” Major labels have launched their own distribution wings one after another in recent years, whether that's REPUBLIC (Imperial), 300 (Sparta), or more recently, Warner Records (Revolution). To compete in this landscape “with a credible, recognized offering,” Moscowitz invested in Foundation at the end of 2022 and launched Santa Anna shortly after. Another executive familiar with the company says they can easily send out hundreds of deals in a year. Five separate Foundation contracts viewed by Billboard show that in the past, the company often offered artists advances between $20,000 and $30,000 with few guaranteed services. In exchange, the artist has to fork over a set number of songs — maybe two dozen new tracks, or some already-released music along with a smaller number of future records. Foundation takes a cut of royalties, usually between 20 percent and 30 percent, which attorneys say is in line with industry norms for these sorts of agreements. Moscowitz is adamant that Foundation's purpose “is not to have a thousand artists doing 100,000 streams a week and make some distribution revenue.” “Most of our artists' streams go up dramatically after signing with us,” he says. “Some go up so much that it makes sense to engage the entire company and spend substantial money and effort marketing them.” “Their marketing people are talking to our artists; their playlisting team is talking to our artists,” he says. “Every time we've asked Todd for something,” Schwartz adds, “he's showed up.” “Many of these sorts of deals come with upstream clauses, meaning the major-affiliated distributor — in this case, Santa Anna — may have the right to trade the artist up to a frontline label,” says Loren Wells, a music lawyer familiar with Santa Anna. But many young artists may see that outcome as unlikely, or simply think, ‘If the worst case scenario is getting signed to a major label with a decent advance, that's not really a worst case scenario. '” And in genres like country that still favor old-school record deals, Wells continues, the upstream terms may still seem more appealing than other labels' traditional offers. Moscowitz says Santa Anna is able to secure future long-term rights because artists “value what we bring to the table” in terms of marketing and promotion. “We have eight or 10 artists like Chuckyy, Raq baby, and Bayker Blankenship who are breaking and will be the future stars of our company,” Moscowitz says. “Santa Anna is functioning exactly the way we want.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert De Niro‘s daughter Airyn is ready to talk about her transition. In a new profile with Them, the actor's daughter with model Toukie Smith opened up about how she wants to emulate her mother as she continues to embrace her trans identity and be a symbol of representation. “I'd want to see more trans women, more Black women who are maybe bigger-bodied or don't fit the mold of super thin or heroin chic.” The new interview comes after Airyn was the target of tabloid headlines that called her “Robert De Niro's nepo baby son,” questioning her pink locs and feminine outfit. “Not only did they get information wrong about me… They just sort of reminded me that people really don't know anything about me,” she said. It's part of why she's decided to speak about her identity publicly. “Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success… I'm like, you know what? As she enters this new phase of her life, Airyn said she worries about how her family might “still think of me as the person I was before the transition,” but she looks forward to stepping into this new time of her life with bravery. “Whether it's just turning on the charm or not putting on a mask, but wanting to be feminine in a way that's inviting and warm and welcoming.” Trump Insists Clearly Edited Pic of Abrego Garcia's Tats Is Real in Testy Interview Sammy Hagar to Alex Van Halen: ‘Just Leave Me Alone. “My dad was very big on us finding our own sort of path,” Airyn said. After her story was published, Laverne Cox shared a sweet message for Airyn, saying she was “deeply honored” to have helped inspire Airyn in her transition. “I believe in every fiber of my being that we are anointed… Claiming our transness and owning it is stepping into a sacredness that is really beautiful.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rock, DC's superhero flick to team Luca Guadagnino and The Penguin‘s Colin Farrell, has halted production plans, sources have confirmed to Deadline. While the film was supposed to enter production in the coming months, we're now told it'll look to shoot next summer. Studio insiders said that ultimately, shooting this summer was untenable, as the team would have had to rush through prep to hit the right weather conditions at the right time. The film is being shot primarily on location in the U.K. and shooting exteriors in the dead of winter would not have been optimal conditions for cast, crew and equipment. James Gunn On Jason Momoa Playing Lobo In DCU's 'Supergirl' Film: "I've Loved Watching Jason Bring Him To Life" Rock news comes as a shock as the film was greenlit months ago with a $65 million budget and plan to shoot this August. Sources close to the project say Guadagnino was scouting locations last week and that the studio was far down the line with Alien: Romulus breakout David Jonsson to join Farrell, as well as Challengers star Mike Faist, who also had an offer. Rock, a World War II-set superhero actioner, Farrell was set to play Sgt. Franklin John Rock, the character created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert, who first debuted in the 1959 DC issue Our Army at War as a WWII infantry soldier. The character gained stature in 1977 when he got his own comic book series, which ran through 1988. Rock was conceived as part of the DC universe overseen by studio chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, rather than as part of the world inhabited by Farrell's The Penguin and overseen by The Batman's Matt Reeves. The project was set to reteam Guadagnino with Justin Kuritzkes, his screenwriter on Challengers and Queer. Guadagnino will next see the release of After the Hunt, his #Me Too-themed thriller for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will be released on October 10. Next up for DC Studios is Gunn's Superman, which hits theaters on July 11. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

I am deputy director of R&B/hip-hop, Carl Lamarre, and we are here live at WrestleMania in Las Vegas at WWE World. Billboard kicked off WrestleMania week on Thursday at WWE World. Think of it like Comic Con for wrestling fans. Wrestlers were signing top cards and belts. You could walk down the ramp to your favorite superstar's entrance. Some pros were even giving wrestling demos in the ring. You could also catch a live podcast recording and thank John Cena for his 25 years in wrestling. Fanatics hosted a Make-a-Wish event with superstar wrestlers Tiffany Stratton and Braun Strowman in attendance. That's, like, my favorite part of being a superstar is getting to meet them and, like, do stuff like this, where they get to do their own entrances.

From con men to real estate closers, David Mamet has made a career out of writing characters who know how to spot a sucker. And with “Henry Johnson,” his first film in 10 years, he invites his devotees to look under the hood and examine the psyche of one of the weak, easily manipulated individuals that his most memorable characters spend their lives exploiting. Adapted from his play of the same name, which premiered in Los Angeles in 2023 before mounting a Chicago production this spring, “Henry Johnson” unfolds over the course of four two-handed scenes. Major plot events happen almost entirely offscreen, with its ensemble of characters using them as jumping off points to soliloquize about everything from the value of therapy to Snow White's vagina. Everyone has preconceived opinions about his writing style, but Mamet puts it to use, with more substance than recent misfires like the endless phone conversation in “China Doll” or the critically panned Harvey Weinstein play “Bitter Wheat.” The Pulitzer winner has something to say, but whether anyone still wants to hear it is another question entirely.

He timidly approaches Mr. Barnes (Chris Bauer), his boss at an unspecified job, with a request to hire a friend of his who is eligible for parole. While Henry initially tries to spin his behavior as a benevolent act of kindness, Barnes effectively makes the case that Henry was merely manipulated by a charming sociopath. Furthermore, he reveals that he knows Henry embezzled $300,000 from the company to help pay the man's defense attorneys, and Barnes has every intention to press charges. He encourages Henry to be more aggressive in life, no matter the cost. Henry eventually complies in the form of actions that will have to remain unmentioned, as it's quite easy to spoil a film with only four scenes. For a character whose actions set so many consequences in motion, Henry is remarkably passive. The kind of empty suit who, as Shiv Roy so memorably put it, will always suck the biggest dick in the room, his only function in life is to make himself useful to one strongman before jumping ship to another when he's inevitably cast aside. A prominent Trump supporter whose outspoken opinions have overshadowed his work for the past decade, Mamet presents a fairly damning indictment of weakness in our society that has a wide berth of interpretations depending on where your own views fall. In one sense, Henry is the kind of useless man who creates hard times with his own passivity. Nearly all the film's tragedy could be avoided if he could just grow a backbone for five consecutive seconds and stand up to a bully. I'm sure there's someone who'd make the case that a childhood spent replacing seed oils with beef tallow and saying slurs in school could have fixed all of it, but Mamet mercifully never goes there. Many critics have hailed “Henry Johnson” as Mamet's best play in years. Even the most realistic kitchen sink dramas ever staged aren't true “realism,” because there's always the inherent absurdity of watching live actors whose entire world is confined to a small stage. Mamet never takes advantage of film's capacity to offer a more naturalistic portrayal of human life, and watching two men chew scenery for 20 uninterrupted minutes in an office seems considerably goofier when it's shot in high definition. There's also no reason for so much of the action to take place offscreen. The approach worked for Sophocles (and probably for the stage productions of “Henry Johnson” as well), but what comes across as clever in one format simply seems lazy in another. “Henry Johnson” opens at the Aero Theatre in Los Angeles and becomes available on VOD on Friday, May 9, with more theatrical markets added throughout May.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But for the last three months, actor John Brotherton has stepped into the role of real-life superhero in Los Angeles, where wildfires burned thousands of homes and businesses to the ground in January 2025, mere miles from where he lives. Like most superheroes, though, Brotherton downplays his efforts and doesn't want any credit for all the heavy lifting he's done since tragedy struck. Having worked for many years with late actor Paul Walker's foundation, Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Brotherton knows that after a natural disaster, “everyone kind of plays that superhero right away. “And I can see now, having now been in the community for a while, the need will probably be here for another two years.” The organization collects donated, new merchandise from individuals and companies and matches the items with families who have specifically requested those items, from furniture to clothes to kitchenware. Displaced people — thousands of whom are still living in hotels, apartments or makeshift housing — come to ROWW's “depot” by appointment to receive a curated collection of donations specifically pulled together for them by volunteers, including Brotherton. Wearing a Romance University hoodie as he chatted with EntertainmentNOW, Brotherton said Benjamin Ayres' initiative — an online collective of generous Hallmark fans that holds fundraisers for various charities — provided them with a cash infusion of over $7,000 in February, raised in just one week, that allowed them to purchase specific items for families. “We bought a bunch of air fryers and air purifiers to put in our curated care packages, and they were such a hit.” “With big (nonprofit) organizations, often you give a check, and it's hard to understand exactly where those dollars are going,” Brotherton continued. “They're doing amazing things, but it's like, where does my $100 go? As families come to ROWW's collection site for individual appointments to receive their care packages, Brotherton said almost all of the recipients wind up crying. “Have your needs met, have a conversation, come back if we can fulfill more as your needs unfold — anything from a bed to toothpaste.” Those who'd like to volunteer in-person in L.A. or in other hard-hit areas of the country where ROWW has deployed response teams, can sign up on their website or send an email to responders@roww.org. Financial donations of any amount are always welcome, Brotherton said, because it all adds up, and companies can coordinate donations of merchandise; his “Fuller House” castmate and friend Candace Cameron Bure, provided many items from her clothing line. “And then, you know, there's also (building) awareness,” Brotherton said, noting how helpful it is when people share ROWW's mission with friends or social media followers. There's a million ways that people can give, even if they don't have $1 to spare.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian singer-songwriter Matt Andersen has an unrelenting work ethic. Since the early 2000s, he's seemingly always been on tour or recording new music. Andersen immediately cites his father, a self-employed tree logger who worked long days in the northern woods of Andersen's native province of New Brunswick. Calling in from his home not far out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the cell service is spotty and scratchy at best. It's a symbol of just how far away Andersen is from not only the United States border, but the southern origins of the music he champions and radiates so beautifully — Delta blues, Memphis soul, and Appalachian folk. Recorded in his garage-turned-studio, the 10-song LP is a refreshing, uplifting voice in uncertain times — especially for Canadian musicians, whose access to the U.S. market is being increasingly threatened by President Trump and his tariffs. “When the world's got ahold of you/you can hold on to me.” Early on, he found himself at weekly family music jams in his hometown of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick (population: 1,574), gradually learning guitar. “Music is a big part of the culture there. Held at his grandfather's house every Saturday night, the gatherings were a much-needed way to connect with others and pass the time in a very rural area, especially during the unforgiving winter months of ice, snow, and below-zero temperatures. “When I was younger, especially being from a small town, we were at the mercy of whatever was on the radio,” Andersen chuckles. Andersen had to seek out other influences and musical rabbit holes when it came to the blues and folk, whether it be via the internet in search of guitar tabs for obscure tunes or simply discovering Eric Clapton's seminal 1992 album Unplugged. “I got more into the bluesy-folk stuff and just started to branch out,” Andersen says. It's places I would never go without my guitar.

I might as well be an astronaut,” Andersen says. Much like his famed Canadian songwriting heroes — Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Gord Downie, among them — Andersen distills the essence of life in the vastness of the country in songs about love, friendship, and passion. “[With songwriting], you can kind of tell where people are from,” Andersen says. With my writing, local colloquialisms work their way in.” Once he hit the touring circuits, Andersen became a notable force up and down the highways and backcountry roads of greater North America. Averaging 200 shows a year, he found himself accepted into sacred American blues circles, soon touring and performing alongside the Tedeschi Trucks Band, Buddy Guy, and Bo Diddley. “My grandfather loved to play, and he always thought as long as somebody wanted to listen, somebody could play,” Andersen says.

Paapa Essiedu, who is set to star in the HBO “Harry Potter” series, has made a public statement in support of trans, non-binary, and intersex communities. Essiedu signed an open letter calling for film and TV industry action to protect trans rights after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that gender is defined by biological sex. That action goes directly against Essiedu's producer, J.K. Rowling, who created the “Harry Potter” franchise and is producing the Max series. In addition to Essiedu, stars Harris Dickinson, Nicola Coughlan, Bella Ramsey, Jack Rooke, Faye Marsay, Kate Herron, director Molly Manning Walker, and more than 400 other filmmakers supported the open letter, which was first circulated by Motive Pictures producer Sid Strickland and script editor Jack Casey. The letter asks organizations such as BAFTA, BFI, Directors U.K., Picturehouse, BBC, Writers Guild, and Channel 4 to commit to protecting trans people.

Writers to the Trans Community published last week and call upon members of our industry and cultural bodies to join us.” The U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 17 that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. Public spaces such as restaurants, theaters, shops, and hospitals will no longer allow trans women to use the women's restrooms, as stated by the Equalities & Human Rights Commission guidance. Of course, notorious TERF-er (and Essiedu's soon to be collaborator) Rowling celebrated the ruling on social media. “‘Womanhood' is not some quasi-mystical state into which men can identify. Pretending it is makes both studying the harms done to actual women, and enforcing women's rights, impossible,” Rowling wrote. Both are male, and giving them access to women's single-sex spaces has caused proven harm to women and girls. How did three men occupying the medal podium at a women's sporting event help female athletes? It continues to astound me that privileged young women who've benefited from those advances all their lives are proudly urging on the dismantling of the protections and spaces that were so hard won, and pretending this is progressive.” There too was an open letter directed to Lithgow in particular, titled “Please Walk Away from Harry Potter,” due to Rowling's political views. Lithgow said that “a very good friend who is the mother of a trans child” first gave him the letter; however, he did not reconsider taking the role of Dumbledore because of it. “I thought, ‘Why is this a factor at all?' I wonder how JK Rowling has absorbed it,” Lithgow said. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Now, 15 years later, she returns to relaunched Lost Highway Records a country superstar who fought to make music on her terms, expanding the genre in the process. With a divorce in the rearview and blue skies ahead, she talks to THR about why she wanted to go home again. It's a warm, cloudless April Saturday in Tennessee, and right now, Kacey Musgraves' life is a Kacey Musgraves song. The singer-songwriter is driving southbound to rural Williamsport — exactly an hour from her Nashville home — where she'll be going horseback riding and rambling along the river with a few friends. “A good friend of mine has a beautiful farm on hundreds of acres,” she says in her Texas twang. It has all these specific species of things that don't exist anywhere else. My friends and I go out there, bring a picnic and just live our best lives — barefoot, dirty, in the river. CEIPA Board Member Tatsuya Nomura on Matsuri'25, J-Pop's Global Rise and Japan's Shift to Streaming Ole Obermann and Rachel Newman Named Co-Heads of Apple Music Excursions like these have colored her songwriting on tracks like “Space Cowboy,” “Oh What a World,” “Butterflies” and “Cardinal,” and they're good for her mental health, too. “Horses have given me such an outlet for tranquility. It's something that takes me outside of looking at my phone screen,” Musgraves says. There was a time when it'd be a sure bet to think Spacey Kacey would be out there in nature, lighting up in early celebration. But on the title track to last year's Deeper Well, the singer-songwriter admits she “used to wake and bake,” and follows that up with, “I'm getting rid of the habits that I feel are real good at wasting my time.” “I just don't wake up and hit a gravity bong the size of my face anymore, which is what I did for a long time. But, hey, more power to whatever suits you.” Beyond those idyllic moments out in nature, now over a year removed from Deeper Well, Musgraves is entering a new era in her career that has one of country's most innovative superstars going back to her beginnings. It's a full-circle moment for Musgraves, who got her start at Lost Highway in 2011 as its final artist signing, before the label folded into Mercury Nashville a year later after respected label head Luke Lewis retired. The same could be said of Lost Highway, which cemented its place as a home for nontraditional successes, like 2000's O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack, a multiplatinum selling album that won the Grammy Award for album of the year in 2002. “Kacey is exactly the type of artist we are looking for with Lost Highway,” Interscope CEO John Janick tells THR. “We wanted someone who's going to move and shape culture, not follow it. Listening to your straight country cover, I imagine some may see this as your return to traditional country music. While some might think of it as a “return,” I want to make it super clear that I never left. But since the beginning, I've always had an exploratory foot out the door a little bit, allowing myself to infuse all these other genres that speak to me. Maybe it's not quite right to say you're “going back” — you just won the Grammy for country song of the year. But people have looked to you as an artist who stretches the boundaries of what a country song could be. That said, your “Lost Highway” cover feels much more traditional. From the age of 7, 8 years old, I was singing all the country standards and classics: Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Snow, Cindy Walker. And it really feels good to wholeheartedly embrace that sound, because I'm always listening to that kind of thing. There may be a misconception that country music is easy to replicate. It comes across as very simple, and the best country music is. What was your reaction when you were asked to be the first signee to the new Lost Highway? My manager, Jason [Owen], was at my house for dinner, and he asked, “What would you think of doing this?” I was so excited, like, “Absolutely, yes!” It's a no-brainer. It made me very emotional, because it brought back so many memories and an aerial view of looking at all I've gotten to do, all the wonderful people I've gotten to meet, and the songs that have come out of that. (Editor's note: Listen to Musgraves' “Lost Highway” below.) I have always been such a massive fan of Lost Highway. It was my dream to be signed there. So, being asked to be part of the relaunch, it's awesome. There's talk about other creative ventures within this as well, like merch capsules and me helping to shape things outside of my own projects. We're still looking at what that exactly means, but it's a true passion project for me. In this world where there are so many varying degrees of genre, to have a home for artists who are left of center is necessary. Lost Highway was home to a certain type of artist — call it the outlaw: Willie Nelson, Shelby Lynne, Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier. I am a huge fan of Mary Gauthier. Do you think that being in their company helped you to envision your future self as someone who could color outside traditional country's lines? When you can look at artists who have made it work doing it their own way, not chasing a prior mold, it does give other artists permission to say, “That's what I want to do.” There's a reason people on the creative side and people on the business side traditionally, stereotypically, have rubs: because they are looking through different lenses. It makes sense that when labels basically serve as a bank to fund things, they're going to want the least risk involved. To have the opportunity to bring something back that honors the relationship between creativity, being unique and risk, we need more of that. I find it so interesting that we point to these artists who were outliers and outlaws, like Willie Nelson. Now we all point to him as this icon, a new north star for normal. It takes someone breaking out and doing something different. I was told not to [release the song] and all these reasons why. I was nervous, because Luke Lewis had left, Lost Highway had folded, and I was already halfway through making [2013's Same Trailer, Different Park], my first real creative statement to the world. “Arrow” was the last song I turned in for that record. As a vocal ally for the LGBTQ+ community, can you see how “Arrow” helped establish the more inclusive country music scene we're seeing now? It's funny, though, because I wasn't setting out to be some martyr or freaking rule-breaker. I'm just doing my job as a songwriter. When you look at country music as a genre and where it started, it is really textured, beautiful layers of real stories, heartbreak, things that aren't always easy to talk about. And that's what always draws me back to country music: It's there for you, no matter what you're going through. How did you approach recording your version of “Lost Highway?” I didn't think it needed some avant-garde reimagining. I almost fell out of my chair — Alba is the next town over to the teeny, tiny town I'm from, Golden. Alba has no more than 500 people; I've never heard it referenced anywhere in pop culture. This song is full-circle for me, in terms of where I started and where I am now, my label. Your take has a nod to old-school Nashville radio. That's my sweet grandpa bringing me onto like a country-music hour. He was visiting Nashville and I wanted his voice on this, so we convinced him to get in the vocal booth. It's hard to put into words just how beautiful that is for me. When I was down in Texas, I was at this weird, little junk shop, and they had this rattlesnake tail for sale — a rattler from a real rattlesnake. I bought it and thought, “I'm going to use this somehow, somewhere.” I'm playing the rattlesnake tail on “Lost Highway.” It's just a little percussive part, but there's a rattlesnake tail on there. Back in the era that this song was written, it was common for folk artists to have rattlesnake tails in their guitars because they thought it would bring good mojo. I love being in a period of time where I'm not rushed by a deadline and have the space to mosey and poke around. I'm not sure yet where it's going to end up. There was Same Trailer, then Pageant Material went even harder in the country direction — it was a love letter to all the classic country I love. Naturally, it felt good for me to explore some other sounds, and I went into Golden Hour territory. With Deeper Well, I swung back in toward my center. I've been feeling really good playing around with some more — I want to say “traditional” — but at the same time, there always has to be a modern edge there in some way. There has to be a balance between tradition and future. I'm going to South America, then Asia and Australia. I'm playing this massive rodeo [São Paulo's Jaguariúna], which is really cool. It's been really cool to see the rest of the world come to love country music, because, really, country is more about a mentality and an attitude versus geography.
