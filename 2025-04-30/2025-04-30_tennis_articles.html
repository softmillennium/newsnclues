                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev has seen tennis change dramatically since he first arrived on the ATP Tour. Zverev is currently at his career-high ranking of world number two, after reaching two Grand Slam finals over the past year. However, he faced a setback after Zverev was beaten by Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. After Zverev was beaten in straight sets by the aforementioned Cerundolo, he headed to his post-match press conference. While Zverev suggested that there were perhaps better players at the very top of the game when he first made a breakthrough, he was adamant that there is more depth on the ATP Tour in 2025. “The depth of players is much more. “Before when I remember when I got to the top 10 for the first time in 2017, which was eight years ago, the top 10 was very strong and we had the four best players in the world with Novak [Djokovic], Rafa [Nadal], Roger [Federer], Andy [Murray], Stan [Stan Wawrinka] and [Juan Martin] Del Po[tro]. Zverev first broke into the top 10 in 2017 after he won his first ATP Masters 1000 title at the Italian Open. The only two players that were in the top 10 at that point and still remain there today are Zverev and Djokovic. One of the most notable differences is the number of points that the world number three has, with Carlos Alcaraz currently holding 2,605 more points than Wawrinka, who was in third spot in May 2017. Very little currently separates Zverev and Alcaraz, with Jannik Sinner still world number one despite being banned for three months.</p>

At the ninth annual championships held in Naples, Florida, Agassi and Waters met 13-year-old Stevie Petropouleas and 16-year-old Tristan Dussault in the opening round on Wednesday. (Fun fact: Petropouleas and Dussault began their careers in tennis before facing injuries that forced them to trade their racquets for paddles. As the commentators noted, it was a strategic move as they shifted momentum into their favor, winning four straight points on Petropouleas' serve and taking the lead for the first time.Petropouleas and Dussault win game two 11-9 off a backhand unforced error by Agassi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year, it was glory for Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles, and in the women's, Iga Swiatek continued to show why she is the queen of clay. Meanwhile, Swiatek dispatched of Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 to win her fourth singles title at this tournament. Of course, Coco Gauff and others will be out to stop her, while in the men's, Jannik Sinner is set to return from his three-month drug ban in time to compete. For Britain, Jack Draper is one to watch. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic is more than likely to not play on clay until the start of the French Open after withdrawing from the Italian Open. The 2025 French Open is set to get underway on Sunday, May 25, and will run until Sunday, June 8. Practice for the tournament begins on Monday, May 19, while qualifying to find out the remaining competitors also starts then as well. First-round matches will be starting at 10am UK time, and the tournament will progress from there. The women's singles final is scheduled for Saturday, June 7 and will take place at 2pm. The men's is on Sunday, June 8 and again will start at 2pm. A full provisional schedule for the event can be found here. Fans can sign up for coverage of the entire tournament here. Listen via the talkSPORT app here, or on DAB digital radio, through your smart speaker and on 1089 or 1053 AM. Of course, all of the usual suspects will be there in both the men and women's singles. America's Gauff already has her eyes set on glory at the French Open. However, she is determined to emerge victorious this time. Speaking at a recent press conference about if she would like to be world No.1 or win a grand slam more, Gauff said: "Another major. "Obviously, if you could have both, that's great.” He said: "It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis. "It's a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in tournaments."

WASHINGTON (TNND) — Andre Agassi, a former world No. 1 tennis player and Grand Slam champion, has debuted professionally in another racket sport: Pickleball. Agassi teamed up with 18-year-old  pro Anna Leigh Waters, who, according to Tennis.com, is "highly regarded at being the greatest women's player of all time," to compete at the Minto U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, Fla. Their first match together was held on Wednesday afternoon, just one day after Agassi celebrated his 55th birthday at the tournament. Before the match, Agassi and Waters warmed up extensively in East Naples Community Park, where the tournament, which runs from April 26 to May 3, is expected to draw more than 50,000 spectators. The warmups drew a crowd of both Agassi and Waters fans. When announcing their partnership, Agassi had great praise for Waters' success in the sport. Waters has 173 Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles matches, with 148 of those titles being gold. She is the defending women's doubles champion at the U.S. Open, while  Agassi's name has recently become synonymous with not just tennis, but pickleball too, with appearances in the Pickleball Slam and an endorsement with popular pickler brand JOOLA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner is set to make his return to the world of tennis after a three-month suspension. The Italian tested positive for clostebol last year at Indian Wells, and the news got leaked to the press in August, shortly after his Cincinnati Open win. This year, after winning the Australian Open, he agreed with WADA on a three-month suspension. With his suspension ending on May 4, there are plenty of talking points surrounding Sinner. As his return looms large at the Rome Masters, his form will be under a microscope. Although much was discussed about his talent, his mentality has grown even more in the past 9-10 months after the doping scandal. After the doping case came to light in August, Sinner was under intense criticism from Stanislas Wawrinka and Nick Kyrgios. 1 should have been put in the same boat as Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova, who were suspended for more than a year for their doping cases. However, Sinner could not do much but keep his head down and perform on the court. His performance was immaculate as he won the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup to close his 2024 season. Considering that he is coming from a three-month suspension in front of his adoring fans, his expectations would remain the same. However, Sinner has shown he can perform when the critics are loud. That reminds tennis fans of Novak Djokovic and how the Serb used to dismantle crowd favorites during his prime years. Since the start of the 2024 season, Jannik Sinner has won against every player he has faced except Carlos Alcaraz. The young Spaniard has developed one of the best modern rivalries with Sinner as the duo is set to take over from the “Big 3.” However, in terms of head-to-head battles, Sinner failed in all three attempts against Alcaraz in 2024. One of those losses came at the Roland Garros semifinals, where Alcaraz won in five sets to reach the final and win his first title on the Paris dirt. The Italian is unbeatable against almost everyone, but if his nemesis has issues with injuries, that opens the path for him. From Alexander Zverev to João Fonseca, each player has had lapses in consistency. There is a reason why, despite being away from the sport for three months, no one has come close to toppling Sinner from the No. These are encouraging signs for Sinner, who has been anything but inconsistent since the start of the 2024 season. With an inconsistent field, he knows that he just needs a few matches under his belt to click into gear. This article first appeared on Total Apex Sports and was syndicated with permission.</p>

The 23-year-old, who will return to action at Italian Open after short ban, ‘wasn't in a very happy place' before year's first grand slam

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner said this week he considered quitting the sport because of the turmoil surrounding his doping suspension.

When asked in a Rai TV interview on Tuesday if there was ever a moment when he wanted to give it all up, the 23-year-old hesitated briefly before responding: “Yes. I remember that I wasn't in a very happy place before the Australian Open this year.”

At the start of January in Melbourne – a grand slam that he won – it was still unclear whether Sinner would face a lengthy suspension before his doping case from 2024, when he blamed a masseur for giving him a banned cream.

In the end, a deal was made whereby he would receive a short three-month ban and return for the Italian Open starting next week.

He said he was anxious around the turn of the year about what 2025 might bring.

“I arrived in Australia and didn't feel comfortable, whether in the locker room or while eating. The players were looking at me differently,” he added. “That wasn't nice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 20 minutes on the clay courts of Madrid, Iga Świątek threw her racket down on to her bag in frustration. A couple of minutes later, the fear became reality, as Madison Keys served up the first 6-0 set, or bagel, that Świątek has received in almost four years. It also offers another data point during what has been a strange Madrid Open for the defending champion. Świątek, who has won 10 clay-court titles including four French Opens, has looked more vulnerable than perhaps she ever has on her favorite surface while never getting into real jeopardy because she is so otherworldly on it when she finds her game. The prodigious topspin on her groundstrokes rears up and pulls players off the court, creating short replies which she can devour. Her matches in Madrid have been so in her control that she has determined their closeness for good and for bad. Against Keys, Świątek was truly overrun for the first time. Having handled Linda Noskova's aggression with relative comfort in between her matches against Eala and Shnaider, Świątek had no answer to Keys' forehand and, though she said she was “feeling the ball,” sprayed groundstroke after groundstroke long. She repeatedly changed her racket and asked for restrings, looking for the higher tension that would give her more control. After beating Eala, Świątek said of the changes she made: “I wanted to keep my margins and play a little bit more safe, to just play more balls in because I was making some unforced errors that weren't really necessary.” That quote could just have easily come from her match with Keys. She moved the ball, rather than trying to blast it. Keys duly started producing more mistakes, and from there Świątek flowed. She faces either Mirra Andreeva or Coco Gauff in the semifinals May 1. Clay season is the time to start making more of a judgement on Świątek's form in 2025 — or so it appeared. Winning tournaments is par for her, so much so that if she were to win the Madrid Open, the Italian Open and the French Open, she wouldn't even gain any points on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka — because she won them all last year. She has also hardly had a bad year by any rational tennis measure. Świątek has reached the quarterfinal or better in every tournament she's entered. She was one point away from the Australian Open final. Of her seven losses in 2025, five have come either in a final or to the defending champion and two have come against Ostapenko, one of the only active players against whom Świątek has a negative head-t0-head. Against Keys in Madrid it initially looked like more of the same. Keys destroyed Świątek in the second set of their Australian Open semifinal, and the quicker conditions at Madrid's altitude make it more hospitable to big-serving hitters like her, even more so than they do Świątek. All this means that a comeback win for Świątek should suggest that her form is in a very healthy place, but external factors and some elements of her game make it hard to reach that conclusion with any certainty. Normally so decisive, Świątek was second-guessing herself, exemplified by the short forehand she sprayed long to fall down 5-0. In numerous matches in Madrid, she has hit shots straight to her opponent from seemingly unassailable positions with expanses of the court gaping, extending points that could have been over in just one strike. Despite four wins in Madrid, frustration appears to be a watchword for Świątek right now. After beating Eala in her opening match, Świątek was so dissatisfied with her performance that she put in some extra practice before speaking to the media. Once in the interview room, Świątek referenced that after the Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, where she suffered a dispiriting loss to Ostapenko, “she had some other stuff going on”. After beating Noskova, Świątek clarified that she'd had to go home to Poland between Stuttgart and Madrid, “for private reasons.” “Then coming here being in a little bit of rush for sure wasn't super comfortable,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him. The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol, which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy. Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping," Sinner said. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently, and I didn't like it at all. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way. Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month. "Sometimes it goes very well, sometimes there is a drop, and I don't know why, so I will certainly be very happy to return to the court. "I am certainly very happy that this phase is now over and we are ready to start again." Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion. "It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all, also what I went through, and it was very difficult. "I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From May 19 to June 8, 2025, the Roland Garros clay-court tennis tournament takes place in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, at Porte d'Auteuil. Armed with their trusty rackets, they string together backhands, drop shots and aces, slaughtering many a tennis ball with their powerful strokes. But how many of these little yellow balls are used each year at Roland-Garros? It's hard to say for sure how many balls were used, but in 2017, our colleagues at Le Parisien reported that around 70,000 balls were used over 15 days of competition, or around 5,000 per day. In the course of a tennis match, balls are changed every 9 games. As clay wears out the balls more than any other surface, you need to count on more than for any other Grand Slam tournament. However, there's no question of throwing away these balls, which are still almost new after use! They are then recycled thanks to Opération Balle Jaune, run by the FFT since 2009, crushed in factories and reused to create sports floors and courts! Three weeks to enjoy the world's best tennis players at Porte d'Auteuil. Here's a roundup of all the latest news and information you need to know about the tournament!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former ATP star John Isner has cast doubt on Novak Djokovic's chances of winning the French Open as he claimed the great Serb “only cares about Wimbledon at this point.” The 37-year-old's last win on clay was his stunning victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the Paris Olympics gold medal match in August. The Serbian, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major, won his maiden French Open crown in 2016 to complete the Career Grand Slam. Speaking on the Nothing Major Podcast, Isner argued Djokovic will already have his sights set on Wimbledon — where he is a seven-time champion. “Obviously, it's really hard for us to say, but if I have to guess, I think he only cares about Wimbledon at this point,” said the former world No 8. Novak Djokovic's Rome decision labelled ‘troubling' and ‘very strange' as two tennis icons react Novak Djokovic's retirement announcement would no longer be a shock “Three out of five sets over two weeks on clay, with all the great players, with [Jannik] Sinner coming back – it is very unlikely. “He was very frustrated, I don't know if you guys saw, in Madrid on the practice court. He is still getting frustrated on the practice court, he wants to continue to get better and try and compete for these big tournaments like in Madrid. “I think give him another day, he'll put this loss behind him and we all know his goals for the rest of his career are try to win another Grand Slam, which would be ridiculous for him to do at 37 or 38 years old.” READ NEXT: Has Novak Djokovic's former biggest strength become his key weakness?

Daniil Medvedev said he'd be willing to pay for Novak Djokovic's services as a coach, when the Serbian eventually retires. The 37-year-old, 24-time Grand Slam winner is still a formidable opponent on the court, but has many more tournaments behind him than in front. With Djokovic currently leading their head-to-head 10-5, Medvedev expressed a desire to collaborate rather than clash with the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the future. In an interview with the Serbian publication Sportal, Medvedev admitted: "I would pay for Novak to be my coach. I don't believe that Novak will be a coach right away. "It is more realistic that he will give advice and share his experience with his friends who are closest to him on the Tour. Therefore, if there is such a possibility, I would also be happy to be in such a situation. "Of course, that won't happen while Djokovic is playing, because that would put him in the wrong position. That's why it will happen when he ends his career." When prodded about the timeline of Djokovic hanging up his racket, Medvedev said with a grin, "In five years." He then dropped an astounding revelation that Djokovic has already made a pact to coach another competitor, specifically Alexander Zverev, after his retirement. Medvedev added: "I heard in Australia that Sasha Zverev said that Novak promised him that he would work with him for a year when he finished his career." Following Medvedev's statements at the Madrid Open, Djokovic acknowledged his interest in teaming up with the Russian in the future, but stressed that there's "no price" that could entice him at this moment. The Serbian champion opened up by saying: "It's very flattering that he thinks I can help him and be useful to his career. One day I would consider becoming a member of their team. "First, I have to end my career in order to think about that offer, and I don't know when that will happen yet.</p>
