                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The story of a Wales man who believes he accidentally threw away $750 million worth of Bitcoin is now poised to get the Hollywood treatment. On Wednesday, a new Los Angeles-based production company, Lebul, announced that it secured the exclusive rights to tell the story of James Howells, an IT engineer who mined 8,000 BTC back in 2009—when the tokens were effectively worthless—and then lost them all. Last month, a British appeals court issued a final ruling ordering him to not sift through the waste site in search of his hard drive. Howells told Decrypt he has “received hundreds of offers” from “all sorts of award-winning production companies” over the years, to turn his saga into a documentary. But ultimately he went with Lebul—in part, he said, because the company is willing to help launch a “global media campaign to support my broader objective of acquiring the Docksway landfill.” Lebul says it plans to turn the story of Howell's failed mission to search his local landfill into “a bold, multi-platform media venture including a premium docuseries, podcast, and an expansive short-form content and marketing strategy across social platforms.” "This isn't just content," Reese Van Allen, the company's president of unscripted entertainment, said in a statement. Howells is confident the media enterprise will not only do justice to his experiences, but also touch on more universal themes. “The documentary will expose the environmental contradictions of Newport City Council and shine a light on the long-term financial obligations taxpayers face from maintaining a closed landfill,” he said, “while also introducing a global narrative built around technology, reclamation, and digital ownership.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

Now, Bitcoin dominance is positioning itself for a reclaim of 64%. It's likely BTC dominance reclaims 64% in a very similar fashion to the reclaim of ~60%.” Rekt Capital says Bitcoin may be on the verge of entering another price discovery phase after a lengthy consolidation period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vitalik Buterin outlined his 2025 Ethereum development priorities, including single-slot finality, statelessness, enhanced privacy and decentralized infrastructure. In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols. Earlier in April, he also published a short-term privacy roadmap for Ethereum, detailing technical solutions to the network's transparency. Earlier this month, the Ethereum Foundation co-executive director, Tomasz Stańczak, said that Buterin now has more time for research and exploration. Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes swapping EVM language for RISC-V In today's post, Buterin said that this year, he would be researching single-slot finality on Ethereum. This proposed upgrade would allow blocks to become final in a single slot within 12 seconds. This would significantly reduce the time needed to confirm transactions irreversibly and improve user experience. This would lead to nodes no longer storing the full state (account balances, contracts, etc.) but instead requiring users to provide the necessary state data (witnesses) with each transaction. Buterin also expects to study ways to improve the ecosystem's cybersecurity on both the front and back ends, as well as its resilience and decentralization. Besides working on the Ethereum protocol, Buterin expects to dedicate his attention to improving communication tools, information sharing, and the social layer surrounding Ethereum. This includes governance changes, the network's resources management and open-source development funding. Buterin explained that this also involves developing better encrypted messaging, software documentation, and leading their adoption in the ecosystem. Buterin cited the intention to investigate cryptography, operating systems, hardware, physical infrastructure and biological defence without further explanation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stolen $330 million was laundered through 300 wallets and 20+ exchanges, experts told Cointelegraph. The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million. Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions. Once stolen, the attacker wasted no time laundering the Bitcoin using a peel chain method — a common obfuscation technique in which large sums are broken into smaller, harder-to-trace chunks. Hacken's internal tool, Extractor, tracked $284 million worth of BTC funneled through these chains, which now amounts to around $60 million after repeated “peeling” and redistribution across low-credibility exchanges. Rudytsia said over 300 hacker wallets and 20+ exchanges or payment services were involved, including Binance. “Major problem in cases like this (similar to Genesis creditor's 4064 BTC theft back in Aug 2024) is that freezing centralized exchange accounts used in the laundering process is hardened due to particularly slow legal process of police reporting and investigations,” Rudytsia added. “Once funds are swapped into Monero, tracing becomes virtually impossible due to its privacy-preserving architecture. The chance of recovery drops significantly after this step,” Cyvers Alerts senior security operations lead Hakan Unal said. Unal said that the attacker likely had pre-established accounts across multiple exchanges and OTC desks, suggesting a high degree of premeditation. A small portion of the stolen BTC was also bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various platforms, further complicating tracking efforts. Related: North Korean hackers set up 3 shell companies to scam crypto devs While attribution remains uncertain, experts agree the laundering tactics show rare automation and coordination for a heist of this magnitude. “So far, we haven't been able to confidently link this activity to any known hacker group, as the laundering methods used — while sophisticated — don't clearly match the signature patterns of previously identified actors,” Unal noted. In the first quarter of 2025, hackers stole more than $1.6 billion worth of crypto from exchanges and onchain smart contracts, blockchain security firm PeckShield said in an April report.

The transition, scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, aims to support enhanced performance, future features, and improved scalability for the platform's digital collectibles ecosystem. The upgrade will bring changes to wallet compatibility, with Algorand-based wallets like Pera and Defly no longer supported post-migration. Users will instead be able to connect using MetaMask or other EVM-compatible wallets that support WalletConnect. “The FIFA Blockchain was created to support new experiences, enable wallet compatibility, and provide stronger foundations for future innovation,” FIFA stated in its migration FAQ document. Users who have exported collectibles must reimport them before the migration date to ensure inclusion in the automatic transfer process. After the cut-off date, manual migrations will require additional verification. USDC balances will remain available for spending until the migration date and can be withdrawn, but not spent, after the transition. In May 2022, FIFA announced a strategic collaboration with Algorand, naming it the official blockchain partner of the organization. As part of the agreement, Algorand provided a blockchain-supported wallet solution and played a key role in shaping FIFA's digital asset strategy. Through this collaboration, FIFA explored blockchain-driven innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital wallets, with a focus on transparency, sustainability, and revenue growth. Powered by Algorand, the NFT platform enables fans to collect and engage with iconic football moments in digital form. ALGO, Algorand's native asset, dropped 3% to $0.2213 on Binance following the news.</p>

Institutional demand for Bitcoin remains strong, supporting a bullish thesis, as US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the positive trend seen since April 17. The K33 report speculates that positive news will emerge from MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings presentation on Thursday, as the company nearly depleted its $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) shelf offering this week. The analyst explains that the massive $21 billion ATM announced by MSTR on October 30, 2024, is now practically emptied after another BTC purchase on Monday. Six months after this announcement, $128.7 million remains of the original $21 billion ATM offering. Nonetheless, other funding sources, such as convertibles and perpetual preferred stock offerings Strife (STRF), have moved slower. Such an announcement would likely benefit the BTC price. Bitcoin institutional demand remained strong so far this week. According to the data from SoSoValue shown below, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the trend of inflows since April 17. If these inflows intensify, Bitcoin prices could rally further. Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% through Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and has hovered around this level in the last four days. If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price is extending its consolidation streak, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as traders await a decisive breakout. LINK network activity declines, with new and active addresses falling from a recent peak. Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further. If XRP holds above the immediate support at $2.21, a reversal could soon ensue. THORChain announced on Tuesday that its stagenet development of its Ripple (XRP) integration is nearing the final step, with mainnet activation imminent. This integration enhances THORChain's economic model by increasing swap activity and protocol fees. This week's rally was supported by strong institutional demand, as US spot ETFs recorded a total inflow of $2.68 billion until Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first glance, this appears to mark a decline from the previous year's $46.1 billion. However, our 2024 figures reflect-lower bound estimates based on identified illicit addresses — when accounting for likely undiscovered activity, the true number is closer to $51.3 billion. As blockchain adoption accelerates and decentralized infrastructure expands, so does the attack surface. With every new protocol, smart contract, and wallet user added to the ecosystem, the need for robust blockchain security grows more urgent. From smart contract exploits and cross-chain bridge hacks, to phishing campaigns that drain users wallets, the risks facing blockchain technology are evolving in real time. However, with the right tools, many attacks can be stopped before they strike. In this blog, we'll explore the most pressing blockchain security challenges and the steps participants can take now to build more resilient infrastructure. Keep reading to learn more about the following topics: Blockchain security refers to the combination of cybersecurity principles, tools, and best practices aimed at mitigating risk, avoiding malicious attacks, and preventing unauthorized access while operating on blockchain networks. The codebase of public blockchains is open source — publicly available and continually vetted by developers who review the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. In contrast, private blockchains are exclusive, permissioned networks with limited access, making them more centralized. The centralized nature of these blockchains means that there is a single point of failure, making it crucial for the institution to implement strong security measures. Although private blockchains may not benefit as much from the decentralized and security-by-numbers approach of public blockchains, they are generally faster and more efficient due to less computational work required for consensus algorithms. Blockchain technology runs on a distributed digital ledger system. That's where consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, come into play. Miners and stakers are incentivized with rewards to secure the network. This process ensures everyone agrees (or reaches consensus) on the validity of each transaction. By linking each block using cryptography and distributing the ledger across numerous computers, any attempt to tamper with a block would disrupt the entire chain. Unlike traditional finance — which operates on permissions to pull funds — a crypto transaction is a push transaction, initiated peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediary. Participants in blockchain networks control their digital assets on the blockchain with a private key — a cryptographically secured method of authentication and access. Because no intermediary is required, personal responsibility becomes much more important when transferring value on-chain. This makes it notoriously difficult to recover funds that are lost or stolen. The notion that blockchain technology is inherently immune to security threats is somewhat misleading, but several of its unique structural features bolster its intrinsic security: New protocols, features, and use cases emerge faster than they can be thoroughly vetted, leaving gaps that attackers are quick to exploit. Anyone can deploy a contract, launch a token, or interact with protocols, creating low barriers for malicious actors to operate at scale. As users move assets across multiple blockchains, visibility into transactions can become fragmented. Monitoring and securing these flows requires coordination across protocols — something the current infrastructure isn't fully equipped to handle. Finally, one of the most persistent challenges is real-time detection. This ambiguity makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between malicious and benign actions before damage is done. The following threats target applications operating on-chain — such as DeFi protocols, bridges, and phishing tokens — rather than the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself. Smart contracts are self-executing code that power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But once deployed, a single bug can expose millions in locked assets. Without code audits, even well-intentioned projects can become exposed. If attackers influence or corrupt these inputs, they can trigger faulty contract logic. For instance, manipulating the reported price of an asset could allow an attacker to buy it at a discount or trigger a liquidation cascade. In DeFi, where value is algorithmically tied to oracle data, the consequences can be immediate and catastrophic. Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains, but they've also become prime targets for attackers. Many bridge architectures rely on complex smart contracts and custodial mechanisms, creating large honeypots of funds. Some of the most damaging attacks are social in nature. Rug pulls occur when developers abruptly withdraw liquidity or abandon a project after attracting user investment, leaving holders with worthless tokens. These schemes often masquerade as legitimate startups, leveraging hype, influencer marketing, and anonymous teams to build trust before vanishing with user funds. Moreover, approximately 94% of DEX pools involved in suspected pump-and-dump schemes appear to be rugged by the address that created the DEX pool. Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors in crypto. As we recently revealed in our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, nearly $10 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraud and scams, although we estimate this number is likely closer to $12.4 billion, which would be a slight increase from amounts stolen in 2023. Whether through fake wallet apps, malicious airdrops, or impersonated support accounts, attackers trick users into revealing private keys or signing malicious transactions. On-chain data provides an invaluable window into blockchain activity, helping security teams identify red flags early — whether that's unusual transaction patterns, interactions with known malicious contracts, or sudden liquidity movements. Real-time monitoring and transaction analysis are essential for catching threats in motion. Chainalysis plays a critical role in blockchain analytics by connecting activity across chains and platforms, enabling faster detection, deeper investigations, and more coordinated responses. As threats grow more complex, this kind of integrated, data-driven approach is key to building safer blockchain infrastructure. Chainalysis Hexagate brings proactive defense to the forefront of blockchain security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Carolina House members are expected to vote Wednesday on whether the state can invest a portion of its public funds — for retirement, education, transportation, general spending, and more — in cryptocurrency. The NC Digital Assets Investments Act, sponsored by 27 Republicans, would permit the state treasury department to place up to 5% of funds' assets in digital currencies like Bitcoin. It also calls for the North Carolina treasurer and the State Bureau of Investigation to study how seized digital assets could be used to establish a digital assets reserve. House leaders have adjusted key aspects of the legislation since a smaller group of Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, introduced it two months ago. Under the current bill, digital assets can comprise up to 5% of any fund — lowered from an original 10% cap, and a third-party consultant now must assess any crypto investments. The updated legislation also opens the door to more cryptocurrencies, erasing an initial market capitalization requirement (of $750 billion) that had essentially made only Bitcoin eligible. On April 19, the chamber passed a budget which allows for 5% of funds' assets to be digital. Josh Stein has voiced support for a state cryptocurrency investing bill, telling The News & Observer in February that he favored “giving people more authority to do their jobs.” “But if there are wise investments that can result in a positive, diversified return for the pension fund, then I'm comfortable with the treasurer making that investment.” At least 40 states have introduced cryptocurrency bills this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, with Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Dakota among those weighing public investments. A pair of states, Wisconsin and Michigan, already allow crypto in their retirement portfolios. And on Tuesday, Arizona legislators advanced a bill to create the country's first state Bitcoin reserve. Momentum for Bitcoin investing at the state level has coincided with President Donald Trump's calls for a national digital asset reserve tethered to the world's largest cryptocurrency. As of Tuesday evening, the world's top cryptocurrency sold at around $95,500. Bitcoin's price has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, propelled by a huge spike in November following Trump's election victory. The North Carolina Blockchain Initiative worked with state lawmakers on its cryptocurrency investment legislation. “We should be, I would say, using more proven financial instruments to fund those funds.” It isn't yet known who precisely will make North Carolina pension decisions — on digital or traditional assets. Another bill changing how North Carolina handles state investments passed the House on Tuesday, moving the state closer to replacing its sole fiduciary model with a shared governance structure. It would be overseen by a five-member board of directors responsible for managing state investments. Briner, during his campaign for state treasurer, championed this change. He has continued to do so, arguing that North Carolina is at the bottom for pension plan returns, in part because of its governance structure. A previous version of the bill included language allowing cryptocurrency investments, but that provision was removed. Appointees must have investment expertise and would serve staggered six-year terms. The board would appoint a chief investment officer, who must have at least 15 years of experience managing pensions, endowments or similar funds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data-driven Dogecoin price forecasts from CoinCodex and Changelly show that the largest meme coin may struggle to break above the $0.3 resistance this year, posting a modest 55% return. This mediocre price forecast has prompted DOGE traders to seek greener pastures in new altcoins like Remittix (RTX). This PayFi token is already up over 400% in presale, and crypto analysts posit it might top 2025 crypto gains with a 150x multiplier. Remittix is building a cutting-edge financial infrastructure that connects cryptocurrencies to everyday fiat payment networks across the world. This innovative approach makes it a breeze for the average consumer and businesses to undertake cross-border transactions with the speed benefits of crypto while enjoying the convenience of traditional payment apps. That eliminates the extra hidden costs levied by traditional channels, helping users retain more of their money during transfer. While cross-border crypto pioneers like XRP and XLM focus on large financial giants, Remittix fills a critical gap in the market by bringing faster, cheaper, and seamless cross-border crypto payments to crypto holders and small business owners. That's why top market pundits believe Remittix is well-positioned to take a significant slice of the $800 billion market as its addressable market grows due to rising crypto trends in the cross-border payments sector. Controlling even 3-5% of this market will be enough to push RTX into the XRP and XLM league, sparking a 150x moonshot for the altcoin. At current rates, Dogecoin is over 20% up from the dip, showing signs of growth as buying pressure and trader interest rise. This has sparked rumors of a potential DOGE bullish reversal amid news of Z Squared and Coepti's merger to expand Dogecoin mining. Some analysts, like $Kev_Capital_TA, have put forth insane Dogecoin price predictions of $1.5 or even $3.8. But this crazy target requires the DOGE market cap to exceed $200 billion, which is not an easy feat! This underwhelming Dogecoin price forecast has spurred an increasing number of meme coin traders to jump ship, piling into other new altcoins that promise better gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Rollup Scroll Now Lets Users Exit Independently, Becoming 'First' to Hit Decentralization Milestone Scroll said Monday it has become the first Ethereum Layer 2 using zero-knowledge proofs to reach a critical development stage, allowing users to post transactions without relying on a central operator. “While Scroll has always had a fully functional zk proof system, users previously had to trust the centralized sequencer to avoid censorship or downtime,” it said. Scroll's Euclid upgrade, which users voted to approve earlier this month, keeps the system running even if the primary operator stops or tries to block user actions. Rollups typically start at Stage 0 with full team control, move to Stage 1 where smart contracts take over but a safety council can step in, and reach Stage 2 when the system runs entirely on code with no central authority. This fixes a big problem for tools like Scroll. Working with Axiom—a project that helps smart contracts verify past blockchain data—Scroll built a new tool called OpenVM, which breaks down large actions into smaller, provable pieces. To keep users safe, all system changes must be voted on and then wait three days before they apply. This gives users time to exit if they don't like the changes. At least nine members must agree to do anything, and at least seven of them must not work for Scroll. Despite the improvements, Scroll has had its fair share of problems. Launched in 2023, it went to market later than competitors like zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM. Still, Scroll says it's now "looking forward" to Stage 2, which would limit what any one group can do in an emergency, even the Security Council.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around $95,000 at the time of writing on Wednesday, and a breakout suggests gains toward $100,000. Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and hovered around this level in the last four days. If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions. Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on April 22 and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. ETH has been consolidating around $1,740 for the past two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to hover around $1,800. If ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000. Conversely, if ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A closely followed analyst believes that the crypto markets are primed for a corrective move following strong rallies over the past couple of weeks. Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks “a dip is going to come soon,” but he doesn't see any reason to be super bearish once the correction takes place. Should a marketwide pullback materialize, Altcoin Sherpa says he plans to accumulate five altcoins. Loads of others too, but those are on my short list for now.” “Fartcoin: wouldn't be surprised to see this pullback a little bit here, but don't forget that hot air rises in the end.
