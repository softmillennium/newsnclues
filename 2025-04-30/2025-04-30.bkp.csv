            Wildfires raging near Jerusalem forced evacuations in several areas and led to several major road closures on Wednesday, as firefighters struggle to contain the flames amid dry conditions and high winds.
    


            Israel is seeking international assistance to fight the fires, as the defense minister says the country is “in a time of national emergency.”
    


            “This is perhaps the largest fire ever in the country,” Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He warned that winds in excess of 60 miles an hour are expected “in the near future,” dramatically increasing the risk of the fires.
    


            The fire forced authorities to close Route 1, the major road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Wednesday – Israel's Memorial Day.
    


            Videos from social media show people walking along the highway with thick smoke filling the air.
    


            Hours later, emergency workers ran amongst long lines of abandoned cars on the highway, looking for anyone who may still be in their cars, according to a video from United Hatzalah, an emergency response organization.
    


            “We don't know at this time what caused the fire. We don't have even a bit of a clue. We are still not dealing with it,” Friedman said. “We are far from control.”
    


            The fire is active on multiple fronts, authorities said, with one area concentrated around the town of Neve Shalom, located about 15 miles west of Jerusalem. In one clip, the flames can be seen next to the road along a packed section of highway.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar held a marathon of talks with other countries to bring in firefighting aircraft, according to his office, particularly nearby countries in Europe. Three aircraft from Italy and Macedonia will arrive “as soon as possible,” the National Security Council said in a statement.
    


            At least ten communities in the area have been evacuated, authorities said.
    


            “We are in a time of national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilized to save lives and bring the fires under control,” said Defense Minister Israel Katz Wednesday.
    


            There are about 120 teams fighting the fire, Israel's Fire and Rescue Services said, as well as 12 firefighting aircraft and helicopters.
    


            More than a dozen people have arrived at two separate hospitals as a result of the fire, according to Shamir Medical Center and Kaplan Medical Center.
    


            Meanwhile, Hadassah Medical Center on the outskirts of Jerusalem asked the public not to come to the hospital “unless absolutely necessary.” The hospital has begun evacuating patients who do not need to be hospitalized, even as it prepares to accept new patients who may have suffered injuries in the fires.
    


            The fire is in approximately the same location as a similar blaze last week.

Follow:


            Lawyers for an Australian woman accused of fatally poisoning three family members with deadly mushrooms have told the jury their deaths were a “terrible accident.”
    


Erin Patterson is standing trial for the 2023 deaths of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson – who all died in hospital days after Patterson served them a meal that contained death cap mushrooms.
    


            She is also charged with the attempted murder of Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, who was also at the lunch but survived.
    


            Crown prosecutors allege Patterson deliberately served lethal mushrooms to kill her lunch guests; her defense counsel claims the deaths were a tragic accident.
    


            During opening arguments on Wednesday, Patterson's lawyers admitted that she initially lied to police when she said she hadn't foraged for mushrooms and didn't own a dehydrator. They said when she learned how ill her guests had become after eating her meal, she “panicked” and acted in ways that may seem suspicious.
    


            The saga, which has gripped the nation for two years, began on a summer day in late July 2023 when Patterson hosted the four relatives of her estranged husband at her home, telling them she wanted to discuss a medical issue. Her ex-husband had also been invited but did not attend.
    


            The court heard she told her guests she had cancer and asked them for advice on how she should break it to her two children. The prosecution alleges she did not have cancer, and had used the “medical issues” discussion to ensure the children would not be at the meal; the defense admitted she had lied about the diagnosis.
    


            During the meal, Patterson served her guests individual beef wellingtons – a steak and pastry dish that incorporates mushrooms. Her guests fell ill hours later and were all admitted to hospital where doctors suspected mushroom poisoning, prompting a police investigation. Patterson was arrested and charged several months later.
    


            Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC alleged that Patterson served the guests death cap mushrooms – a highly poisonous variety of wild fungus – that she had picked herself.
    


            Patterson herself had gone to the hospital, claiming to feel unwell after the meal – but her tests did not show severe illness, and she voluntarily discharged herself against doctors' advice, prosecutors said.

            Prosecutors allege that cell data showed Patterson traveling to an area where death cap mushroom sightings had been detailed online, and that months before the lunch, she had posted online about dehydrating mushrooms for use in food, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.
    


            Patterson had told police she didn't own a dehydrator, but surveillance footage after the deaths showed her disposing of a unit at a local trash dump, which was later found to contain traces of death cap mushrooms, the court heard.
    


            Patterson insists she is innocent. Her defense lawyers told the jury they don't dispute that the guests died from her meal – but argued she had not intentionally poisoned them.
    


            “The defense case is that Erin Patterson did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests at that lunch on the 29th of July, 2023,” said defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC.
    


            “She didn't intend to cause anyone any harm on that day. The defense case is that what happened was a tragedy, a terrible accident.”
    


            Mandy admitted that Patterson had lied about the dehydrator and about foraging for mushrooms, saying she had simply panicked in the moment.
    


            “The defense case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food that she'd served to (them),” Mandy said. “Three people died because of the food that Erin Patterson served that day. So you'll need to think about this issue – how Erin Patterson felt about that in the days that followed.”
    


            Patterson has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The case is expected to continue for up to six weeks.

            Britain's military launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Tuesday with US forces, its defense ministry said – the first public acknowledgment of a joint operation since the Trump administration escalated the US campaign against the militant group.
    


            The strikes targeted “a cluster of buildings” south of the capital Sanaa used by Houthis to manufacture drones, which the group uses to attack ships at sea, Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement released Wednesday.
    


            The Royal Air Force sent Typhoon fighter jets to target those buildings, dropping precision bombs after dark following “very careful planning … to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure,” the statement said. All the aircraft returned safely, it added.
    


            The Iran-backed Houthis began a military campaign in solidarity with Palestinians when Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023. They have repeatedly attacked US Navy ships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden – two waterways that are critical to international shipping routes – and fired missiles at Israel.
    


            In response, the US has tried to disrupt the Houthis' capabilities by going after their primary weapons, and by destroying maritime drones and underwater drones.

            The UK has participated in joint strikes with the US against the Houthis before, including numerous operations in 2024.
    


            But Wednesday's statement marks its first acknowledgment of a joint strike since President Donald Trump launched his aggressive military campaign against the group, vowing to use “overwhelming force” to stop the Red Sea attacks.
    


            Tuesday's joint operation “was in line with long-standing policy of the UK government, following the Houthis initiating their campaign of attacks in November 2023, threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, striking international ships, and killing innocent merchant mariners,” said the ministry statement.
    


            John Healey, the UK's defense secretary, said the strikes aimed to prevent further Houthi attacks, adding that a 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea had caused regional instability and damaged the UK's economy.
    


            Since Trump began his campaign – known as “Operation Rough Rider” – on March 15, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites. The US military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in its  monthlong campaign, while analysts estimate dozens of Houthi military officers have been killed.
    


            But so far the US operation has had limited impact in harming the group's operations, and the militants have successfully shot down many multimillion-dollar American drones, hindering the US' ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, US officials told CNN last week.
    


            On Monday the Houthis alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing dozens.
    


            In response, US Central Command said it was “aware of the claims of civilian casualties related to the US strikes in Yemen, and we take those claims very seriously. We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree officially renaming Volgograd International Airport as ‘Stalingrad'. The name change comes in response to a request from veterans of the Second World War and the Ukraine conflict, as well as local officials.

“In order to immortalize the Victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, I hereby decree… to assign Volgograd International Airport the historic name ‘Stalingrad',” the decree published by the Kremlin press service on Tuesday reads.

The Great Patriotic War is the Russian term referring to the period from June 22, 1941, to May 9, 1945, during which the Soviet Union fought against Nazi Germany.

The renaming of the airpot in Volgograd comes less than two weeks before Russia celebrates 80 years since the victory over the Nazis.

The city of Volgograd has retained its name despite repeated suggestions of reverting to the Soviet-era title of Stalingrad over recent years.

The city was the site of one of the fiercest battles of World War II, which historians believe changed the course of the conflict in the Soviet Union's favor and paved the way for the ultimate defeat of the Nazis.

From 1925 until 1961, the city and its airport were named Stalingrad in honor of Joseph Stalin. In 1961, they were renamed as Volgograd after the river on whose banks they are located.

There have been at least two major efforts to bring back the name Stalingrad, in 2013 and 2021, led mainly by the Communist Party. Over the past ten years, the city has occasionally used the name Stalingrad during ceremonies honoring wartime sacrifices as a gesture of respect.

The presidential administration previously urged caution over calls to rename Volgograd as Stalingrad.

Critics of the idea have argued that the step would provide a boost to Stalinists. The former Soviet leader remains a controversial figure in Russia, with some willing to overlook his role in repressing the population for the sake of his perceived achievements as a statesman.

A 2023 survey by the state-run pollster VCIOM found that around 67% of Volgograd residents were wary of the name change and preferred retaining the city's current name.

Ukraine is preparing to sign a long-discussed minerals agreement with the US as early as Wednesday, Bloomberg has reported, citing sources. Talks over the deal – which includes a joint fund for developing the country's resources – have been a source of tension between Kiev and Washington for months.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal confirmed that the sides are expecting to sign the deal within 24 hours, adding that Kiev would hand over half of the proceeds from resource extraction to the joint US-Ukraine fund.

Ukraine and the US have been working since February to finalize the agreement granting Washington access to the country's deposits of rare earths and other minerals. The administration of US President Donald Trump has described the deal as a pathway to recouping funds Washington has spent aiding Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. However, Ukrainian officials have insisted that all US support was provided unconditionally.

According to a person familiar with the matter interviewed by Bloomberg, the sides have completed a draft agreement. As a result, Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko is said to be on her way to Washington for the signing.

The agreement outlines the creation of a joint fund for managing investment projects in Ukraine and aims to increase cooperation in mining, energy, and related technology. A draft of the deal also shows Washington has acknowledged Ukraine's EU integration goals and agreed the deal should not conflict with them.

The US has also reportedly agreed that only future military aid to Kiev would count toward its contribution to the investment fund. Earlier, Washington insisted that past military aid should also be included in the agreement.

The development comes after Sviridenko signed a preliminary memorandum on the resource deal earlier this month. Despite this, Trump later criticized the Ukrainian leadership for slow progress, demanding the agreement be signed “immediately.”

The deal was widely expected to be signed in late February during Vladimir Zelensky's visit to the White House. However, the Ukrainian leader entered into an open spat with Trump, who accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War III” and showing reluctance to accept a ceasefire with Russia.

NEW DELHI, April 30. /TASS/. The Pakistani military violated ceasefire agreements along the international border with India, India's ANI news agency reported, citing defense sources.

""Till yesterday morning, the Pakistan Army was violating the ceasefire only along the Line of Control but now, they have escalated the situation and violated the ceasefire along the international borders by firing along the International Border in Jammu's Paragwal sector last night,"" the sources said.

The Paragwal sector is located in the Jammu District of India's Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir south of the Line of Control, along the internationally recognized border between India and Pakistan.

The Indian army stated earlier that during the night of April 29-30, the Pakistani military ""initiated unprovoked small-arms fire across the Line of Control opposite the Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor sectors in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir."" Indian troops ""responded swiftly and proportionately.""

Reports of ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border have been coming in for a week amid tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad caused by a deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir.

On April 22, armed men killed 25 Indians and one Nepalese national and wounded many more with machine gun fire in the popular tourist town of Pahalgam in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. According to media reports, Indian intelligence agencies allegedly found evidence that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was involved in the terrorist attack committed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba group (outlawed in Russia). After the attack, India almost halved its embassy staff in Pakistan, suspended an agreement with Islamabad on the allocation of water resources, declared the military advisors of the Pakistani diplomatic mission in India personae non gratae, and also suspended the issuance of visas to Pakistani citizens.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high-level security meeting on Tuesday. According to sources, he stated that the Indian armed forces had ""complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing"" of the country's response to the Pahalgam attack. Pakistani Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, in turn, said that India planned ""to carry out military action"" against Pakistan within the next 24 to 36 hours.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, April 30. /TASS/. Moscow sees no interest from Kiev in carrying out a dialogue; voices in the EU call for re-engaging with Russia; and Kiev levels the playing field in latest minerals deal proposal to the US. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

None of Russia's attempts to declare a ceasefire have been supported by Ukraine, which indicates that the Kiev regime is betting on war, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia. The Russian Foreign Ministry emphasizes that Moscow has no contact with the Ukrainian side, apart from coordination on prisoner exchanges. Nevertheless, Russia remains open to dialogue with Kiev without preconditions.

""Not a single attempt to declare a ceasefire has in practice been supported by the Kiev regime, which continued to violate the truce. This shows that the regime is staking everything on war,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia, adding: ""moreover, Kiev's self-imposed legislative ban on negotiations with Russia remains in effect.""

""There is no basis to suggest that Ukraine is ready to alter its actions on the ground in any way. We do not see this happening. All we observe is erratic, pseudo-peacekeeping rhetoric. Hollow declarations of peace are not enough, we do not see any indication that Ukraine is demonstrating or confirming a willingness to pursue a ceasefire,"" Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large for Crimes of the Kiev Regime Rodion Miroshnik said in an interview with Izvestia.

""At present, there is contact with Ukraine only on matters related to exchanges at the military level. There is also dialogue at the ombudsman level. There are no other official contacts - neither exploratory meetings nor negotiations about negotiations. The only efforts we see come from the Americans, who are attempting to act as mediators,"" Miroshnik added.

There have been no direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since the end of March 2022. The last meeting between representatives of the two countries took place in Istanbul.

""It is highly likely that such negotiations could resume in 2025, if only because Kiev is under considerable pressure from Washington and the international community to seek a diplomatic resolution,"" Tigran Melkonyan, analyst at the Center for Mediterranean Studies of the Higher School of Economics, told Izvestia. ""Kiev is also facing serious challenges on the front lines - most notably a shortage of manpower. At the same time, it is important to remember that Zelensky has created a legal barrier by prohibiting himself, by law, from engaging in direct negotiations with Russia. Therefore, if talks do resume, they are likely to start at the level of technical working groups and Foreign Ministry representatives,"" he added.

 

Negotiations between Russia and the European Union may begin at the parliamentary level. While the EU leadership currently rejects the idea of dialogue with Moscow, members of the European Parliament interviewed by Izvestia have expressed readiness for renewed contact. Two European Parliament factions support the notion of restoring relations with Moscow, and many MEPs would back direct dialogue with Russia should there be significant progress in negotiations between the United States and Russia. Moscow has also indicated its willingness to resume dialogue if such an initiative comes from the European side, according to the Federation Council.

""I am a member of the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and if that group were to participate in talks, I would be happy to contribute to the re-establishment of contacts and mutually beneficial relations, which are important for Slovakia and Central Europe,"" Milan Uhrik, Deputy Chairman of the Europe of Sovereign Nations faction in the European Parliament, told Izvestia.

""Today, we cannot expect a majority of MEPs to support such resolutions. But their concerns may dissipate once more substantial progress is achieved in negotiations between the Russian Federation and the United States,"" he added.

Petar Volgin, a member of the European Parliament from Bulgaria, also expressed readiness to engage in dialogue with Russian counterparts. He noted that the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee could serve as a potential platform, though informal meetings in this format have not taken place since 2019.

Russia's Federation Council is open to resuming dialogue with the European Parliament if such an initiative comes from the latter, Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, told Izvestia.

""Dialogue is always preferable to no dialogue, especially given that we have no shortage of issues to discuss. Within the European Union, the depth of understanding regarding their own internal situation and what is happening in Ukraine is close to nil. Communication with Russian parliamentarians would be of benefit to them,"" Kosachev said.

At present, it is difficult to envision a shared agenda for discussion between Russia and the European Parliament, as the EP's current role is largely to produce anti-Russian resolutions. However, this does not mean that Russia should refrain from making proposals. Alexander Asafov, a member of Russia's Civic Chamber, noted in an interview with Izvestia, interparliamentary dialogue has proven effective, much like interparty dialogue within BRICS and with other allied nations.

 

According to Ukrainian officials, the agreement between Ukraine and the United States concerning Ukrainian resources has been transformed from a ""predatory"" deal into an ""equitable"" one following revisions. The updated version reportedly adheres to the Ukrainian Constitution and excludes any obligations to repay previously rendered assistance from Washington. However, if signed in its current form, the agreement would constitute a setback for US President Donald Trump, who had earlier pledged to recover American taxpayer funds spent on Ukraine, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Moreover, despite promises and forecasts, the agreement remains unsigned. Experts noted that US officials are beginning to understand the difficulty of negotiating with Ukraine, particularly when the latter is unwilling to compromise.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal discussed the content of the agreement during a meeting late last week in Washington with US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. According to Shmygal, the two sides reviewed Ukraine's key red lines, agreeing in particular that the proposed agreement must not contradict the Ukrainian Constitution or the country's obligations to the European Union. He also noted that, during the Ukrainian delegation's visit to the United States, arrangements were made with representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue supporting Ukraine.

Meanwhile, The Financial Times also reported that Washington and Kiev are close to finalizing a deal. The outlet suggested that the agreement - which could be signed as early as this week - would cover all of Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas, and other key energy assets.

Speaking to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for International Studies at MGIMO University Nikolay Silayev said it would be prudent to wait and see what is ultimately signed. When that might happen remains unclear. ""For Donald Trump, the current situation is certainly a failure, as he has repeatedly emphasized his interest in this agreement, describing it as part of his broader peace plan for resolving the conflict in Ukraine. The United States has now learned firsthand what it means to negotiate with Ukraine when it has no intention of reaching an agreement,"" he said.

Regarding the resource agreement itself, he noted that numerous questions remain, particularly as to whether it complies with the Ukrainian Constitution. Moreover, doubts persist regarding the legitimacy of President Vladimir Zelensky, whose official term expired on May 20, 2024. ""Clearly, the agreement was initially disadvantageous for Kiev. When Ukrainian authorities eventually sign it, political repercussions are inevitable,"" the expert concluded.

 

Spain and Portugal had nearly fully restored their power grids by April 29 following the most extensive blackout in modern European history, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the Portuguese outlet Diaraias de Noticias, which cited a statement from local grid operator E-Redes. Experts told Vedomosti that the massive blackout in Spain and Portugal was caused by systemic vulnerabilities stemming from the rapid integration of renewable energy sources without adequate modernization of grid infrastructure, leading to reduced resilience and instability in the power system.

Blackouts of this scale are relatively rare in Europe. At this stage, the only certainty is that the disruption originated from within the system itself, without any malicious external interference, despite ongoing speculation about a possible cyberattack, Deputy Director of the National Energy Security Fund Alexey Grivach told the newspaper.

Sergey Rozhenko, Head of energy analytics at Kept, noted that the increasing integration of industrial-scale electronics into power systems to accommodate renewable energy sources ""reduces resilience to system failures."" According to him, the primary cause of the blackout was the drop in synchronous inertia.

Data from Ember indicates that around 43% of Spain's energy is generated from renewable sources, with nuclear accounting for another 20% and fossil fuels comprising 23%. Grivach emphasized that the European energy system, built around renewables, has become highly weather-dependent. ""What happened in Spain and subsequently spread to neighboring Portugal and southwestern France shows this vulnerability. Ultimately, the restoration of electricity was achieved only by ramping up output from gas-fired power plants to five times the level they had been producing at the time of the blackout,"" he explained.

Spain and Portugal, where up to 50% of electricity is generated from renewables, remain particularly vulnerable, agreed Georgy Kutyrev, Research Fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Higher School of Economics. He attributed the incident to the push toward the green economy movement without corresponding modernization of infrastructure. ""Rapid deployment of renewables without accounting for their intermittency creates systemic imbalance,"" Kutyrev concluded.

 

The global silver market is projected to remain in deficit for the fifth consecutive year in 2025, although the shortfall in metal supply is expected to decrease, according to an annual report from The Silver Institute. The organization forecasts that global silver demand will decline by 1% this year, reaching 1.15 bln troy ounces. Experts told Vedomosti that while the global silver market will remain in deficit in 2025, the shortfall is expected to narrow due to stable industrial demand and limited supply growth, with structural constraints, rising solar demand, and declining consumer interest creating a complex and imbalanced market.

The industrial sector continues to be the primary driver of silver consumption, the report said. Silver's high thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its corrosion resistance, make it a vital industrial material. According to the Institute's forecast, industrial usage of silver will remain virtually unchanged in 2025 at 677.4 mln ounces, marking a slight year-on-year decrease of 0.5%.

This year's global silver deficit is projected at 187.6 mln ounces - the lowest level in the past four years, the Institute noted. In 2024, the deficit amounted to 210.5 mln ounces, meaning the expected shortfall for 2025 represents an 11% reduction.

According to a report by Heraeus Precious Metals, a German technology company specializing in precious metals, the primary drivers of price growth are rising interest in solar energy and a resurgence in demand from the Indian market. Heraeus forecasts that silver prices in 2025 will fluctuate between $28 and $40 per ounce on the global market.

Independent industrial expert Leonid Khazanov told Vedomosti that the silver market deficit is structural, driven by the fact that a significant portion of the metal is extracted as a byproduct of mining other resources. He estimates Russia's annual silver consumption at 80-100 metric tons.

Despite the ongoing shortage, the silver market in 2025 remains subject to a range of opposing factors, analyst at Finam Financial Group Alexander Potavin told the newspaper. He pointed out that while industrial demand remains robust, consumer interest in jewelry and silverware is declining. On the supply side, output growth is expected to be limited due to deteriorating ore quality and high production costs, while secondary recycling will be insufficient to meet global needs.

Deputy prime minister and economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko will reportedly be in Washington later today to sign the agreement

Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal has offered his take on the US minerals deal, with Reuters reporting his comments that the reworked agreement has become a “real partnership deal”.

He said the deal is to be signed within the next 24 hours, with two additional agreements to follow.

Shmyhal added that the deal will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament, with consultations set to start tomorrow, Reuters said.

He added that future US aid for Ukraine can be considered as part of US contribution to the investment fund to be established under the deal, according to Reuters.

Let's wait for more details or, ideally, the full text of the deal though.

It is believed that the text has evolved significantly since the first attempt at signing it in February, which ended with that Oval Office spat between Trump, JD Vance and Zelenskyy.

The announcement of the construction of a new road bridge connecting Russia and North Korea comes after reports that about 600 North Korean troops have been killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine.

North Korea has suffered about 4,700 casualties so far, including injuries and deaths, out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said on Wednesday, citing the country's intelligence agency.

In return for dispatching troops and supplying weapons to Russia, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance on spy satellites, as well as drones and anti-air missiles, they said.

Lee Seong-kweun, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters:

After six months of participation in the war, the North Korean military has become less inept, and its combat capability has significantly improved as it becomes accustomed to using new weapons such as drones.

On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent troops to fight for Russia in the war in Ukraine under orders from its leader, Kim Jong-un.

Russia and North Korea have begun construction of a road bridge between the two countries as part of an effort to strengthen their strategic partnership, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said.

Mishustin announced work had started on the bridge across the Tumnen river while in a video meeting with the chair of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Pak Thae-song, on Wednesday.

“This is a truly a milestone for Russian-Korean relations,” Mishustin said.

It symbolises our common desire to strengthen friendly, good-neighbourly relations and increase inter-regional cooperation.

The bridge is being built near the existing “Friendship Bridge”, a rail bridge which was commissioned in 1959 after the Korean war.

Pak was quoted as saying:

It will become an eternal historical memorial structure symbolising the unbreakable Korean-Russian friendly relations.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that some small groups of Ukrainian soldiers were still holed up in basements and hideouts in Russia's western Kursk region.

Putin earlier this week phoned his top commanders in Kursk to congratulate them on “victory” and the end of their operation to expel Ukrainian forces from the region after a Ukrainian force stormed across the border last August, Reuters reported.

Speaking at an event in Moscow, Putin said radio intercepts suggested that the few Ukrainians left behind were asking commanders to urgently evacuate them to safety.

Ukraine has said that some of its forces are still inside Kursk and in Russia's nearby Belgorod region.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he had no doubt that Moscow would sooner or later repair its relations with European countries.

Speaking at a forum in Moscow, Putin said many in Europe share Russia's position on certain issues.

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting at Pope Francis's funeral was “indicative” of the “effort” being put in to secure a peace deal for Ukraine, UK foreign secretary David Lammy has said.

The US and Ukrainian presidents were pictured in discussion at the Vatican over the weekend, having both travelled to Rome for the service, PA reported.

The foreign secretary told the House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee on Wednesday that Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron have done “a lot of the heavy lifting” in terms of trying to bring nations together to support any potential future agreement.

It comes as Ukrainian official indicated they are willing to sign a minerals resources agreement with the US, perhaps as soon as Wednesday, with the country's economy minister in Washington looking to iron out the final technical details.

The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on Saturday was the first since their fraught White House encounter earlier this year. In the hours after, the American president appeared to criticise Vladimir Putin, writing on TruthSocial that the Russian leader could be “just tapping me along”.

The United States wants Ukraine to sign two additional documents together with their minerals deal, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

However, Kyiv thinks the two supplements need more work, Reuters reported.

… and on that note, that's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, but I leave you with Tom Ambrose who will guide you through the evening and bring you all the latest updates on the minerals deal.

As we wait to hear more on the US minerals deal, let me bring you new comments from Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office.

Writing for the Guardian, Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's most senior aide, explained Moscow's seemingly contradictory logic as Russia calls for a three-day ceasefire in May, while stalling on a longer ceasefire and proper peace talks.

He said:

On Monday, the Kremlin offered a three-day pause in hostilities against Ukraine in May, to coincide with Moscow's celebrations of the end of the second world war.

In a context where Ukraine is calling for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, and the US a permanent one, Russia wants concessions before a lasting pause or permanent peace can even be discussed.

Central to the Kremlin's demands is the removal of sanctions – especially those restricting its aviation sector.

We must be cautious not to make concessions prematurely, under the guise of quick progress. The short pause offered would not make a meaningful difference to the war, and accepting it would enable a regime that has repeatedly shown intent to prolong its war of aggression and undermine this chance for a just, fair and lasting peace.

Yermak went on to explain the problem with removing the requested sanctions, saying that “the apparent humanitarian and economic nature of Russia's request masks the political and military advantage that any softening of aviation sanctions would hand the Russian president and his war machine.”

You can read his comment in full here:

There's a lot of conflicting reporting on when the minerals deal could be signed, and if it really could be as early as today – as some reports suggested earlier (14:33).

In the last few minutes, the Financial Times (£) said that the talks “ran into last-minute hurdles,” as a US source told the newspaper that the “negotiations had not concluded because Ukraine had sought to revisit terms agreed at the weekend.”

We will keep an eye on this for you and bring you all the latest updates here.

Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal has offered his take on the US minerals deal, with Reuters reporting his comments that the reworked agreement has become a “real partnership deal”.

He said the deal is to be signed within the next 24 hours, with two additional agreements to follow.

Shmyhal added that the deal will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament, with consultations set to start tomorrow, Reuters said.

He added that future US aid for Ukraine can be considered as part of US contribution to the investment fund to be established under the deal, according to Reuters.

Let's wait for more details or, ideally, the full text of the deal though.

It is believed that the text has evolved significantly since the first attempt at signing it in February, which ended with that Oval Office spat between Trump, JD Vance and Zelenskyy.

Elsewhere, the Kremlin claimed that president Vladimir Putin was open to peace despite its continuing aggression on Ukraine, but stressed that the conflict is so complicated that the rapid progress that Washington wants is difficult to achieve, Reuters reported.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov insisted that Putin “remains open to political and diplomatic methods of resolving this conflict” started by Russia.

But news agency TASS quoted Peskov as saying that the root causes of the war were too complex to be resolved in one day.

After the Kremlin's remark, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv was ready for peace talks in any format if Moscow signed up to an unconditional ceasefire, Reuters noted.

Ukraine expects to sign a much-anticipated minerals deal with the United States on Wednesday, a senior source in the Ukrainian presidency told AFP.

Deputy prime minister and economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko will be in Washington later to sign the agreement, the final draft of which the Ukrainian government “has yet to approve”, the source said, adding that the agreement provides for a “50/50” joint fund between Kyiv and Washington.

Reuters reminded that the two sides signed a memorandum on 18 April as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resources in Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials hope that signing the deal promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump will help to firm up softening American support for Kyiv in the war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion more than three years ago, Reuters added.

The way is now paved for the Merz administration to finally take up office.

On Monday, the coalition agreement will be signed, and we're also expecting the SPD to announce its cabinet posts. Then on Tuesday, Merz is due to be voted into office by the Bundestag, after which his government will be sworn in.

Rumour has it that Merz will hold his first cabinet meeting on Tuesday afternoon, sending out the signal that he means to get down to business straight away amid looming challenges, from economic malaise, to grave domestic concerns, such as how to tackle irregular migration, overburdensome bureaucracy, and not least how to outflank the far-right AfD (recent polls showing them to have overtaken the CDU/CSU for the first time).

There's also the question that has been on the minds of everyone since his controversial multi-billion Euro financial bonanza he pushed through parliament in March – what exactly is he going to do with the money, and how long will it be before malcontent Germans start to feel the effects of it?

That's even before touching on the myriad geopolitical complications.

Merz has long since sent out the signal that Ukraine will be at the top of his agenda, having appointed a pro-Kyiv ex soldier as foreign minister and pledged to continue Germany's support.

The closer he has got to taking office, the more cautious he has become in his rhetoric towards US President Trump, but Merz has made no mistake he knows what is at stake, saying on Monday:

“We have come to the realisation that we can no longer be certain of the transatlantic relationship in the spirit of freedom and the rules-based order.”

With this morning's news that the Social Democrats' party base has voted in favour of the party's coalition agreement with the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, the last hurdle has finally fallen for the long awaited new German government to be formed, ending six months of grindingly painful political gridlock and (hopefully also) the chronic national ennui.

Almost 85% were in favour of the deal, which at first glance looks high, yet, voter participation among the 358,000 members of Germany's oldest political party was only 56%, itself a clear expression of the disgruntlement – or, as the SPD's general secretary Matthias Miersch put it this morning, at the briefest of press briefings at the SPD's headquarters, the Willy Brandt Haus, in Berlin – the “scepticism” many members feel about participating at all in this new administration.

After all, the SPD, after three years of being at the helm under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is now the junior partner in the new government of Friedrich Merz, and the fear within the party is that its already diminished profile in the political landscape – having delivered its worst ever election result in February – will become even more watered down, as will its ability to imprint its social democratic principles on Europe's biggest economy.

“Yes, there is scepticism,” Miersch admitted, and many “open-ended questions”, but hopefully, he added, “this scepticism can be dispelled” once the government gets to work, stressing: “es geht nicht um uns, es geht um das Land” – “this isn't about us, it's about the country”. He thanked party members for their support and “trust especially in these times of great uncertainty”.

This is certainly the tenor of the new era. As Merz said on Monday, presenting his new ministers, this is “no time for euphoria”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Leaked documents indicate Harita, owner of key nickel mine in Indonesia, did not reveal water contamination

One of Indonesia's largest nickel-mining companies, which supplies a mineral critical to the global electric car industry, did not tell the public that local drinking water was polluted, according to documents seen by the Guardian.

Indonesia has become the world's biggest producer of nickel, used in the production of wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. But observers have voiced concerns that regulatory oversight in the country has failed to keep up with the rush to develop mines to satisfy booming global demand.

Leaked documents seen by the Guardian suggest a source of drinking water close to a $1bn (£800m) mining project owned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group on remote Obi Island, was contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in the Erin Brockovich story and film.

Cr6 can cause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harm when ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has also been linked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown that Cr6 in drinking water can be a result of industrial processes.

The leak comes after a Guardian investigation into pollution at the site in 2022 was disputed by the mining company, which extracts and processes nickel for use in EV batteries.

For the 2022 investigation, water samples collected from a spring in the village of Kawasi, less than 200 metres from the mining site, were tested at government-certified laboratories and suggested high levels of contamination from carcinogenic Cr6 of 60 parts per billion (ppb). The maximum contaminant level allowed by law in Indonesia is 50ppb.

In response to the Guardian's original investigation, a Harita company said its own results had shown that the spring water was suitable for consumption and met the quality standards set by the Indonesian government.

However, the leaked documents and emails suggest a Harita company found the Cr6 values in Kawasi spring, used as drinking water by villagers, in excess of Indonesian quality standards just one day after its statement to the contrary. It then found even higher values in subsequent days. It does not appear to have made this data public.

The Guardian was given a chance to review the material by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) in a joint investigation with the Gecko Project, a non-profit newsroom.

The material suggests tests of Kawasi's spring water undertaken by a Harita company found Cr6 concentrations of 70ppb on 1 February 2022, one day after the Harita company provided its statement to the Guardian. On 7 February 2022 a value of 128ppb was recorded.

A weekly environment report from December 2022 reported that values of 140ppb had been recorded at the spring.

Harita has not responded to requests for comment on the leaked material and test results but in a press release published on its website this month, the company said it conducts periodic monitoring of the water at Kawasi spring to ensure it is safe and uncontaminated.

Environmental health experts have said the test results suggest a significant issue with pollution.

Matthew Baird, an environmental lawyer based in south-east Asia, said: “These are figures that need to be taken into account not just by the company, but also the Indonesian government.”

“Nickel is meant to be one of the transition metals [to move to a green, low-carbon economy] and we require a just transition to ensure the protection of the environment, human rights and the community,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Temperatures south Asians dread each year arrive early as experts talk of ever shorter transition to summer-like heat

The summer conditions south Asian countries dread each year have arrived alarmingly early, and it's only April. Much of India and Pakistan is already sweltering in heatwave conditions, in what scientists say is fast becoming the “new normal”.

Temperatures in the region typically climb through May, peaking in June before the monsoon brings relief. But this year, the heat has come early. “As far as Asia and the Indian subcontinent are concerned, there was a quick transition from a short window of spring conditions to summer-like heat,” said GP Sharma, the meteorology president of Skymet, India's leading private forecaster.

South Asia, home to 1.9 billion people, is particularly vulnerable. Many live in areas highly exposed to extreme heat and lack access to basic cooling, healthcare or water.

In Delhi, where spring usually offers a short spell of mild temperatures, thermometers have risen past 40C in April – “up to 5C above the seasonal average” – according to a report by ClimaMeter, a platform that tracks extreme weather events.

“Human-driven climate change” is to blame for the “dangerous” kind of heat seen in recent weeks, it said.

“These spring heatwaves are not anomalies. They're signals. We need to move beyond awareness into action,” said Gianmarco Mengaldo, a climate expert at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report.

Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately.

Temperatures in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hit 44C, triggering heatstroke reports among construction workers and farmers. Other states are also grappling with intense heat.

The Indian Meteorological Department has reported an “above-normal number of heatwave days”. Temperatures are expected to climb steadily across the subcontinent, with the highest readings forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.

Pakistan is also reeling. In the city of Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, the mercury has soared to 50C – nearly 8.5C above the April average. In other parts of the country, temperatures have hovered in the high 40s.

“What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events,” said an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The country “remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis”, it said.

Urban heat is making things worse. Data comparing 1950–1986 with 1987–2023 shows that cities such as Delhi and Islamabad are now up to 3C hotter on average than nearby rural areas.

“When it comes to heatwaves, the question is no longer if they are linked to climate change, but what kind of thresholds we are reaching,” said Mengaldo. “Preparedness is essential. But right now, our infrastructure is not well adapted.”

Natural climate variability such as the El Niño cycle can affect regional weather, but it is now in a neutral phase.

ClimaMeter said: “Compared to pre-1986 levels, similar meteorological conditions now produce temperatures up to 4C higher – almost entirely due to human-driven climate change.”

South Asia is not alone. “In the northern hemisphere spring months, we are already seeing conditions in parts of the Middle East that are incompatible with human life,” said Mengaldo.

“This is very serious for the populations … we also expect summer temperatures in Spain and France to reach unprecedented levels in the next few years,” he said. “Many of the events predicted for 2050 or 2070 are already happening. We underestimated the speed of change. What we're seeing now is an acceleration – a failure of our predictive models.”

David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the report, said: “The only sustainable solution is to stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions. Without drastically reducing emissions and building climate resilience through better insulation, use of green energy, and other moves, the implications are alarming.”

“Even if we act now, the climate system will take decades – sometimes over a century – to cool down,” Mengaldo added. “The sea level rise is already locked in for hundreds of years.”

Both researchers stressed economic inequality and infrastructure played a critical role in determining who survives extreme heat. “There are different temperature thresholds – actual temperature, [humidity index] and others,” said Mengaldo. “Economic levels play a huge role in how people can cope and sustain themselves.”

Delhi has updated its heat action plan, focusing on vulnerable groups such as elderly people, construction workers, and street vendors. But implementation is inconsistent.

Faranda said adaptation was increasingly unaffordable for many heat-prone countries, with electricity grids buckling and causing widespread power cuts. “When multiple events occur, there's often no escape,” he said.

Mengaldo highlighted the need for innovation: “We need better-insulated housing, materials that prevent energy loss, and architectural designs that promote natural cooling. These can significantly reduce energy demand during extreme heat.”

Faranda also said people must change their lifestyles. “Energy demand keeps increasing. If we want to survive the coming decades, we must not only build more renewables but also reduce energy consumption overall: through lifestyle changes, efficient architecture, and better materials.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

“What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,” archeologist David Palomino said. 
The mummy was found in Aspero, a sacred site within the city of Caral that was a garbage dump for more than 30 years until becoming an archeological site in the 1990s.

The US will continue to push for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the WHO, a US government spokesperson said on Tuesday, even though Washington has taken steps to pull out of the world health body.

An unnamed US Department of State spokesperson told the Central News Agency that Taiwan is a “reliable and capable partner” around the world, “and its partnerships around the world, including those that advance global health security, provide significant and sustainable benefits to the citizens of those countries.”

“The United States will continue to advocate in support of Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including the WHO,” the spokesperson said.

The US did just that during a round of WHO Executive Board meetings in February, the spokesperson added.

“The United States was pleased to urge WHO member states to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in WHO, including as an observer at the World Health Assembly,” they said.

The spokesperson was referring to a statement by Jeffrey Hay, first secretary to the US' Permanent Mission to the UN, during a meeting on Feb. 5 of the 156th WHO Executive Board.

The comments by the spokesperson were in response to a question on whether the US would continue to support Taiwan's inclusion as an observer or participant during the World Health Assembly's meeting from May 19 to 27 in Geneva, Switzerland.

The state department reiterated Washington's support for Taiwan's WHA participation, even though the US is set to officially withdraw from the WHO in January next year after the global health body received a formal letter of withdrawal from the US administration in January.

The Republic of China, Taiwan's official name, left the WHO in 1972, and since then, Taiwan has been unable to attend the WHA even as an observer due to Chinese pressure, except from 2009 to 2016, when relations with China were warmer under the then-Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) government and Beijing supported Taiwan's participation.

Since 2017, Taiwan has worked closely every year with its diplomatic allies and friendly nations, including the US, Japan and the EU, to push its bid to participate in the WHA, yet without success.

                                        President William Lai has cracked down on his political enemies and has attempted to exterminate all opposition forces, the chairman said                                        The legislature would motion for a presidential recall after May 20, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) said yesterday at a protest themed “against green communists and dictatorship” in Taipei.
Taiwan is supposed to be a peaceful homeland where people are united, but President William Lai (賴清德) has been polarizing and tearing apart society since his inauguration, Chu said.
Lai must show his commitment to his job, otherwise a referendum could be initiated to recall him, he said.
Democracy means the rule of the people, not the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but Lai has failed to fulfill his                                    


OFF-TARGET:
                                        More than 30,000 participants were expected to take part in the Games next month, but only 6,550 foreign and 19,400 Taiwanese athletes have registered                                        Taipei city councilors yesterday blasted the organizers of next month's World Masters Games over sudden timetable and venue changes, which they said have caused thousands of participants to back out of the international sporting event, among other organizational issues.
They also cited visa delays and political interference by China as reasons many foreign athletes are requesting refunds for the event, to be held from May 17 to 30.
Jointly organized by the Taipei and New Taipei City governments, the games have been rocked by numerous controversies since preparations began in 2020.

Shen Ming-shih (沈明室), a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said he made the assessment after two Japanese military experts warned of emerging threats from China based on a drill conducted this month by the Chinese People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Eastern Theater Command.
Japan Institute for National Fundamentals researcher Maki Nakagawa said the drill differed from the

Shuttler Lin Chun-yi yesterday kept Taiwan on the board as they faced their first major challenge of the group stage after marching into the last eight at the Sudirman Cup Finals in Xiamen, China.

Taiwan were losing 3-1 to South Korea as of press time last night, with only the men's doubles match remaining.

Taiwan and four-time champions South Korea have already progressed to the quarter-finals, after Taiwan on Monday blanked the Czech Republic 5-0 without giving up a single game.

Before last night's tie, Taiwan were undefeated in Group B, with a 9-1 match record, ahead of South Korea, who, although also undefeated, were in second with an 8-2 match record.

That quickly changed last night on Xiamen Fenghuang Gymnasium's court 2, where the world No. 19 mixed doubles duo of Chen Cheng-kuan and Hsu Yin-hui, playing their first match of the tournament, struggled to keep up with South Korea's Seo Seung-jae and Chae Yu-jung, who ran away with a 21-12, 21-10 victory in just 29 minutes.

In the women's singles, World No. 24 Chiu Pin-chian, who on Sunday lost Taiwan's only match of their opener against Canada, faced a tough draw against world No. 1 superstar An Se-young.

Paris Olympic women's champion An took advantage of Taiwan playing the biennial mixed team competition without former world No. 1 Tai Tzu-ying, going on to dominate Chiu 21-7, 21-13 in 42 minutes.

In the men's singles, world No. 17 Lin kept Taiwan competitive, making Cho Geon-yeop fight for every point in the Taiwanese's 21-15 opening game victory. Lin then ratcheted up the pressure, running off with an 11-1 lead in the opening minutes of the second game before winning 21-10.

It was Lin's second win of the tournament, after he on Monday made quick work of the Czech Republic's Jan Louda.

In the women's doubles, the world No. 15 duo of Hsieh Pei-shan and Hung En-tzu, who ended Taiwan's Canada tie with a decisive victory on Sunday, fought world No. 3 Baek Ha-na and Lee So-hee to a first-game 21-17 victory, but were unable to keep up their momentum, losing 21-12, 21-12.

As of press time last night, two-time Olympic gold-medalist Wang Chi-lin and partner Chiu Hsiang-chieh were playing Seo and Kim Won-ho.

In last night's other tie, 13-time champions China were beating Thailand 2-1 as of press time last night.

In yesterday's early matches, Hong Kong and Canada, both already out of contention for the quarter-finals, ended their campaigns on a high with victories.

Hong Kong enjoyed a 5-0 sweep of Algeria in Group A, where record champions China and Thailand have already booked their places in the next round.

In Group B, Canada stormed past the Czech Republic 4-1.

On Tuesday, Japan — who have never won a title after finishing as runners-up in 2015, 2019 and 2021 — breezed through to the quarters, crushing France 5-0, while Group C rivals Malaysia, also eyeing a first Sudirman crown, advanced with a 4-1 win over Australia.

In Group D, former champions Indonesia marched into the quarter-finals with a 4-1 win over India, while Denmark routed England 5-0 to send them into the last eight.



                                                                                Bologna on Thursday advanced past Empoli to reach their first Coppa Italia final in more than half a century.
Thijs Dallinga's 87th-minute header earned Bologna a 2-1 win and his side advanced 5-1 on aggregate.
Giovanni Fabbian opened the scoring for Bologna with a header seven minutes in. Then Viktor Kovalenko equalized for Empoli in the 30th minute by turning in a rebound to finish off a counterattack.
Bologna won the first leg 3-0.
In the May 14 final in Rome, Bologna are to face AC Milan, who eliminated city rivals Inter 4-1 on aggregate following a 3-0 win on Wednesday.
Bologna last reached the

Jaden McDaniels scored a career playoff-high 30 points and spearheaded Minnesota's stifling defense on an ailing Luka Doncic, and the Timberwolves beat the Los Angeles Lakers 116-104 to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Friday night.
“Jaden never looks tired. He looks like he could play 48 minutes,” said teammate Anthony Edwards, who had 29 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.
Julius Randle added 22 points for the Wolves, who outscored

No fixtures were played on Friday or Saturday because of the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome, meaning the full round of Serie A matches took place on Sunday and yesterday.

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on April 29 that Russia is preparing potential military aggression under the guise of joint exercises with Belarus this summer.

""Look at Belarus — this summer, Russia is preparing something there under the guise of military exercises. This is how its new attacks usually start,"" Zelensky said at the Three Seas Summit, according to Suspilne. 

""But where this time? I don't know. Ukraine? Lithuania? Poland? God forbid! But we all have to be prepared. All our institutions are open to cooperation.""

Belarus will host the Zapad 2025 (West 2025) military exercises with Russian forces, part of a long-standing series of drills held every two years since 2009. 

The most recent iteration, Zapad-2021, involved over 200,000 participants and served as a prelude to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Despite not being directly involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory.

Belarus shares borders with Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Russia, positioning it as a key strategic corridor between NATO and Moscow. 

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously said that the upcoming Zapad exercises could enable Russia to covertly assemble offensive forces under the guise of drills.

""All exercises have a purpose. And one of these goals is the covert creation of offensive troop groups,"" Syrskyi told Lb.ua on April 9. 

""The visibility of the exercises is the most acceptable way to relocate, redeploy troops, concentrate them in a certain direction, and create a group of troops.""

Zelensky has repeatedly cautioned that Russia may escalate military actions beyond Ukraine.

On Feb. 14, during the Munich Security Conference, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to deploy up to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus, suggesting a possible buildup for future offensives against NATO countries. 

""Based on all the information I've gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he is preparing for war against NATO countries next year (2026),"" Zelensky said, though he added he could not be entirely sure.

Tensions between NATO and Moscow have intensified following Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine. 

Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a risk of a larger war in Europe within the next five years, pointing to Russia's growing militarization and hostile posture.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Hungary's Parliament voted on April 29 to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on X.

The decision formalizes Hungary's intention, first announced in early April during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Budapest.

The move follows the ICC's issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza — a move Budapest has sharply criticized.

""With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility,"" Szijjarto wrote.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar welcomed Hungary's move, according to the Times of Israel. Following the vote, withdrawing from the ICC jurisdiction will take a year, once Budapest officially notifies the U.N. Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, of its decision

The ICC, established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, is a permanent tribunal based in The Hague that prosecutes individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. 

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the forcible deportation of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. 

Despite the warrant, Mongolia hosted Putin for an official visit in September 2024, citing energy dependence as its reason for not executing the arrest and saying it had limited options.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The UN secretary-general's warning comes as worries of spiraling conflict grow over a deadly attack in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Islamabad claims 'credible intelligence' Delhi is planning an imminent military strike.

Here are the latest developments from Wednesday, April 30, on tensions between India and Pakistan following the Kashmir attack.

Pakistan's national carrier has canceled all flights to Gilgit and Skardu, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir due to security concerns.

News site Geo News reported that Pakistan International Airlines canceled multiple flights from Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.

Meanwhile, Express News reported that Pakistan issued new directives to air traffic controllers to ramp up monitoring of Pakistani airspace.

More Pakistani nationals living in India headed to the mainland crossing between the two countries on Wednesday, well after the deadline for them to leave by Sunday had passed.

India has ordered almost all Pakistani citizens to leave the country as part of Delhi's response to the attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which it has linked to Pakistan.

Sara Khan, who was ordered back to Pakistan without her husband, Aurangzeb Khan, who holds an Indian passport, told the Associated Press news agency, ""they told me you are illegal and you should go.""

""We have settled our families here. We request the government not to uproot our families,"" said Khan, who had a long-term visa that was valid until July 2026.

The Pakistani government, which denies any involvement in last week's attack, has retaliated with its own measures, including the cancellation of most visas for Indian citizens.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, the Kremlin announced.

The May 9 event marks the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Modi was invited to attend alongside other international leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not provide a reason for Modi's absence. According to the Russian state news agency TASS, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh may represent India instead.

India's government said Wednesday that Russia had been informed that India would be represented by Singh.

Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region following last week's deadly attack.

Militants killed 26 people, mostly tourists on Tuesday, April 22. India has blamed the attack on Pakistan, which has repeatedly denied the allegation. Kashmir is a disputed territory administered by India, Pakistan and China.

DW's New Delhi bureau chief Sandra Petersmann suggested that India's recent history indicates a possibility of military action following the Kashmir attack.

She cited Delhi's limited military responses to attacks on Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016 and 2019.

""In 2019, the Indian Air Force struck an alleged military training camp for terrorist in Abbottabad in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which is close to the Afghan border but lost a jet in the process,"" she said. 

""So all of this is clearly indicating that a potential military reaction from India after this attack on civilians is very much on the table,"" Petersmann added.

India was also trying to diplomatically isolate Pakistan, adding pressure on Islamabad.

Conflict in Kashmir ""goes much beyond the region,"" Petersmann said, noting that China's territorial claims could mean the involvement of three nuclear powers, not just two. 

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Tuesday.

""The secretary-general also expressed his deep concern at rising tensions between India and Pakistan and underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences,"" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

A confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors ""would be catastrophic for those two countries and for the world as a whole,"" the statement added.

Sharif's office said he had asked Guterres to ""counsel India to exercise restraint.""

""Pakistan remains committed to peace, but will defend its sovereignty with full force if challenged,"" he wrote on X. 

Jaishankar appreciated the call from Guterres and said, ""India is resolved that the perpetrators, planners, and backers of this attack are brought to justice."" 

Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that New Delhi intended to use last week's militant attack on civilians as a ""pretext"" for further military action.

""Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident,"" Attaullah Tarar wrote on the social media platform X. 

The statement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly authorized his country's armed forces on Tuesday to respond to the Kashmir attack in whatever way they see fit.

Welcome to DW's coverage of events in Kashmir and the wider region on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

On April 22, gunmen killed 26 people, most of whom were tourists, near a resort close to the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The attack prompted New Delhi and Islamabad to downgrade diplomatic ties, and India suspended a key water-sharing treaty with Pakistan.

The following days have seen cross-border firing from both sides, with no reported casualties.

On Tuesday, Pakistan accused India of planning a military strike within the next 24-36 hours.

Common chemicals found in everyday plastic products may be associated with cardiovascular disease worldwide, with highest impacts in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific. 

A chemical found in household plastic items could be associated with cardiovascular disease, according to a new study.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year according to the World Health Organization.  

The new study from researchers at NYU Langone Health in the US suggests certain common plastic chemicals might be associated with more than 10% of heart disease deaths in adults ages 55 to 64. 

Health and environmental data from population surveys was analyzed to estimate mortality from exposure to phthalates — chemicals that are used to increase the durability and flexibility of plastics. 

Based on their analysis, they estimated exposure to the phthalate DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) could have contributed to 350,000 deaths in 2018. 

As the study was not designed to establish whether DEHP directly causes heart disease, they caution against drawing definitive conclusions. 

""The idea is to basically track exposures [to DEHP]. We had to model exposures across the globe based upon the available data, so, there are limitations in what we have,"" said lead researcher Leonardo Trasande, director of the NYU Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, US. 

While DEHP is found worldwide, the study found its impact is concentrated in just a few regions.  Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific account for three-quarters of the total estimated deaths associated with DEHP. 

India is estimated to have the highest mortality at more than 100,000 deaths, followed by Pakistan and Egypt. 

""The previous study on which the modeling was based accounted for body mass index, dietary consumption, physical activity, and a host of other of the usual social determinants of health that we consider as potential alternate explanations,"" Trasande said.

Previous studies have reported negative impacts of phthalates on reproductive health and the immune system.

""What we know at the present time is that multiple chemicals used in plastic materials contribute to inflammation, hack our hormones our natural signaling molecules that underlie basic biological functions, including metabolism and cardiovascular function,"" said Trasande. 

""But this study and the study on which it's based, don't exist in isolation. There is a larger body of studies from the laboratory, from animals and from humans that suggest that these chemicals contribute to heart disease.”

Every day we are surrounded by plastic and avoiding it can seem impossible, but Trasande said people can take several precautionary measures. 

""We can renegotiate our relationship with plastic,"" said Trasande. 

""Particularly, we need to avoid microwaving and dishwashing plastic, because that's a way to resorb the chemicals used in plastic materials or turn them into microplastics that can deliver these chemicals into the human.""

A global plastics treaty is being negotiated by the United Nations. In the European Union, phthalates such as DEHP are banned in toys and cosmetics.

""There is a high ambition coalition of countries that is working to [...] not only reduce chemicals used in plastic materials of concern, but also to address the magnitude of plastic pollution.""

Members of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) have voted in favor of a 144-page coalition agreement with the conservatives. This clears the way for Friedrich Merz to become the new chancellor. DW has more.

Below is our roundup of news from Germany on Wednesday, April 30.

German inflation eased slightly to 2.1% in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March and the second decline in a row, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).

Once again, energy prices had a dampening effect on inflation, as oil prices fell in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff policy. By contrast, food prices rose by 2.8%.

Meanwhile, core inflation — a figure that excludes volatile prices of food and energy — rose to 2.9%, up from 2.6% in March.

Germany's inflation rate stabilized at 2.2% in 2024, after years of high price increases due to the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Pensions for more than 21 million German retirees will rise by 3.75% on July 1, the outgoing cabinet decided in its final meeting on Wednesday.

For a standard pension with average earnings and 45 years of contributions, this means about €66 ($75) more per month. And for a smaller pension of €1,000, the increase will bring an additional €37.40 per month.

Labor Minister Hubertus Heil had already announced the increase in March. After the cabinet's decision, he called the increase ""good news for pensioners.""

""Thanks to the good wage development, the pension adjustment strengthens their purchasing power,"" Heil said.

""Stable pensions are not a handout, they are hard-earned and an expression of fairness,"" he added.

The pension increase will be set by decree by Heil's ministry. However, it still has to be approved by the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament. The increase can then take effect on July 1.

China rejected accusations of spying on Wednesday after Germany's federal prosecutor's office charged Maximilian Krah, a former member of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and another German national for espionage on Tuesday. 

""The so-called 'China espionage threat theory' is completely unfounded and a malicious slander,"" said Guo Jiakun, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a press conference.

""We urge the German side to stop smearing and vilifying China, and to take concrete actions to uphold the positive momentum in the development of bilateral relations,"" Jiakun said, adding that China ""has always upheld the principles of mutual respect.""

The Chinese spy identified by German prosecutors as Jian G., a German citizen, has been suspected of working with Chinese intelligence since 2002, including during his tenure as an aide to Alternative for Germany (AfD) MEP Maximilian Krah from 2019 to 2024.

He is suspected of illegally accessing over 500 documents that the European Parliament, where his boss Krah served as a member from 2019 to 2025, classified as ""particularly sensitive.""

Prosecutors stated that a Chinese national named Yaqi X. has been charged with assisting Jian G. in accessing information about flights and passengers at Leipzig Airport. She was employed by a company that provided logistics services to the airport.

A court in Germany has decided that a Muslim woman can't be granted an exemption to wear a niqab face covering while driving. 

The Berlin-Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court (OVG) rejected an appeal by a Muslim woman who applied for an exemption to Germany's road regulations, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.

These ban face coverings to make sure anyone driving a vehicle is identifiable. 

The woman has applied for exemption to wear the niqab, which covers the entire face except for the eyes, on religious grounds.

She argued that not wearing a face veil would expose her to the gaze of strangers when she was driving, violating her right to freedom of religion.  

This ruling confirms a January decision by a Berlin administrative court on the same case, and the woman doesn't have further right of appeal, the spokesperson said. 

Other courts in Germany have previously ruled on the issue of driving while fully veiled. 

They have consistently rejected any exemption on religious grounds.

The court in Frankfurt am Main has dropped the tax evasion case against former German Football Association (DFB) president Theo Zwanziger in connection with the 2006 World Cup in exchange for a fine.

Zwanziger will have to pay €10,000 ($11,370) to a charity, the court decided. The prosecution and defense had agreed on this amount.

The criminal proceedings concerned allegations of tax evasion in connection with the organization of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.

Zwanziger was accused of filing false tax returns for his association as the former president of the German Football Association (DFB), which allegedly resulted in millions of dollars in tax evasion. The ruling in his case means that none of the three original defendants are still on trial.

In September, the court dismissed the case against former DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach in exchange for a fine of €25,000. This was followed last week by the dismissal of the case against former DFB General Secretary Horst Schmidt, also in exchange for a fine.

This outcome was largely expected. 

Three factors contributed to the decision: the SPD managed to secure seven ministries out of 16 despite a historically poor election result; fresh elections would likely have worsened their outcome while boosting the far-right AfD; and the party is familiar with coalition dynamics from past experience with the CDU.

SPD leadership views this approval as a sign of party support, though it is far from a ""marriage of love.""

Meanwhile, Lars Klingbeil, one of the SPD leaders, is set to become vice chancellor, a role traditionally tied to the finance ministry.

Klingbeil has established strong working relationships with Merz during coalition negotiations.

Boris Pistorius, the popular defense minister, is expected to retain his position.

However, challenges remain in appointing women and younger leaders to ministerial roles, and questions linger about who will take responsibility for the SPD's poor election result.

Rumors have it that Saskia Esken, the other party leader, may have to make way. 

More announcements from the SPD are expected on Monday, the coalition treaty will officially be signed, and the new Cabinet will be sworn in on Tuesday.

In a sign of continued economic weakness in Germany, the number of unemployed in April fell only slightly by 36,000 to 2.932 million, according to the Federal Employment Agency (BA). 

This means the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 6.3%. In March, unemployment in Germany rose by 26,000.

However, compared to April last year, the number of unemployed was 182,000 higher.

Due to the high level of unemployment, the BA is in danger of slipping into the red this year, according to the head of the agency, Andrea Nahles.

The agency will first use its reserves of €3.2 billion ($3.6 billion). ""This is the cushion we have for the time being,"" Nahles said.

However, the BA expects to run a deficit if the poor development continues. A quick improvement is not expected.

Germany's economy performed slightly better in the first three months of the year than expected.

The gross domestic product rose by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, compared with the previous three-month period, preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) showed.

Growth had been projected to reach just 0.1%.

This follows a 0.2% contraction in the final quarter of 2024.

The growth was supported by increases in both private consumption and investment.

Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), is set to become the country's next vice chancellor and finance minister, according to party sources.

The party's executive committee reportedly approved Klingbeil's nomination unanimously, shortly after the SPD announced that its members had overwhelmingly approved a coalition agreement with the CDU/CSU bloc.

The 47-year-old Klingbeil forged a close partnership with incoming conservative chancellor Friedrich Merz during negotiations to form a coalition after Germany's general election in February.

With SPD members approving the coalition agreement, Christian Democratic Union leader Friedrich Merz is set to be elected chancellor by parliament on May 6.

This would pave the way for the new government to take office exactly six months after the current center-left coalition collapsed over the sacking of former finance minister Christian Lindner.

In December, Chancellor Olaf Scholz called and lost a vote of confidence after the collapse of his coalition government, paving the way for new elections.

On February 23, Germans voted for a new Bundestag, the lower house of the parliament. The results were disappointing for the parties of the governing coalition, all of which lost their share of the vote, with Lindner's FDP failing to enter parliament.

The conservative CDU/CSU bloc appeared to be the winner with 22.6% of the vote.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in second with 20.8%, but the populist party is ""firewalled"" by Germany's established parties, meaning they have refused to work with the far right.

CDU leader Friedrich Merz decided to enter coalition negotiations with the SPD, which came in third with 16.4%.

Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has approved a coalition agreement with the conservatives, sources close to the party said.

According to the reports, 84% of participating members voted in favor of the deal.

This is more than the 66% in the last membership vote to form a government with the CDU/CSU bloc in 2017.

The vote, which ended just before midnight on Tuesday, took place over a two-week period. 

Voter turnout was 56%, the sources said. A minimum of 20% of members needed to take part in the vote for it to be valid.

Weighed down by sluggish business in the key Chinese market, German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz reported a sharp drop in earnings at the start of 2025.

The company reported a 43% year-on-year drop in first-quarter net profit to €1.73 billion ($1.96 billion).

Revenue fell 7.3% to 33.2 billion yuan due to a global decline in vehicle sales. Operating profit fell nearly 41% to €2.29 billion, reflecting ongoing market challenges.

Mercedes-Benz also warned of a potentially significant impact on profitability from recently imposed US import tariffs.

However, the company said it remains difficult to assess the exact impact on demand due to the evolving situation and possible retaliatory measures.

German automaker Volkswagen reported a steep drop in first-quarter profit. The company cited heavy one-time charges and a weaker performance in China.

Europe's largest automaker posted a nearly 41% year-on-year drop in profit to €2.19 billion ($2.49 billion) for the first three months of 2025.

While group revenues rose nearly 3% to €77.6 billion, several headwinds weighed on the bottom line.

In addition to previously announced multi-billion-dollar special charges, Volkswagen earned significantly less from its joint ventures in China, a key market. Losses also worsened in the battery division.

Volkswagen reaffirmed its outlook for the year, although the forecast does not yet take into account the potential impact of new US trade tariffs under President Donald Trump's administration.

Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) on Wednesday will announce the result of a membership vote on a coalition deal with the conservative bloc of Christian Democrats (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).

Since the parties have already signed the coalition agreement, the approval of the new government depends on the SPD's party base.

The SPD's roughly 358,000 members had until 23:59 (2159 GMT) on Tuesday to vote on the 144-page agreement.

To pass, not only must a majority of members approve the program, but at least 20% of the party's membership must vote.

If the SPD approves the deal, the CDU's Friedrich Merz will be elected chancellor by parliament on May 6.

Thank you for following our coverage of news in Germany on Wednesday, 30 April. 

The process to secure Germany's next government appears to be coming to a close with one part of the coalition, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to give (or not) the final green light to the 144-page coalition agreement.

SPD members voted on Tuesday, with results expected on Wednesday, after the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) bloc gave their approval on Monday.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz's cabinet will meet on Wednesday for what is expected to be its last session. The outgoing chancellor will then travel to Paris for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.

We're also expecting the release of the German inflation and unemployment figures for April.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

			President's objectives on immigration and trade are the right ones. His execution has been chaotic, childish and vindictive

On the issues of immigration, trade, and national security, US president Donald Trump's broad objectives are generally the right ones. But in the first 100 days of his second, non-consecutive term, Trump's approach to achieving his legitimate goals has mirrored his own flawed character in being both amateurish and mean-spirited.

Polls show that the top issues for voters in the 2024 elections were immigration and the economy. The Trump administration's round-up and deportation of criminal illegal aliens has succeeded as a deterrent, radically reducing the crowds of economic migrants posing as asylum seekers at America's borders. Democratic complaints that the administration has violated due process are valid in some cases but would be more persuasive if most Democrats did not routinely blur the distinction between illegal and legal immigrants.

While Trump's immigration crackdown has been a qualified success, his trade policy has been a disaster. What was needed was a thoughtful, multi-year and multi-decade strategy for combining sector-specific industrial policies with partial decoupling from China and reshoring of selected strategic manufacturing industries. What America and its trading partners got instead was the chaos of “liberation day”, April 2.

With no prior notice, Trump announced a new global tariff of 10 per cent on all imports, combined with “reciprocal” tariffs that had nothing to do with reciprocity but were mathematically derived from trade imbalances with other countries. The result was the greatest stock market crash since Covid. The prospect of a global flight from US Treasury bonds forced the administration to postpone the bizarrely arbitrary tariffs, except for those on China.

Any necessary reordering of global supply chains to reindustrialise the US and rebalance today's unbalanced trade will cause disruptions and cries of pain. But the shambolic tariff roll-out revealed that Trump's squabbling advisors do not even agree on the purpose of tariffs: Reindustrialisation? Revenue? Bargaining chips in negotiations to open foreign markets?

In foreign policy, the Trump administration should have subordinated trade disputes with American allies to the goal of balancing against China's bid for global industrial and commercial hegemony. Instead, Trump slapped tariffs on Canada and Mexico to punish them for flows of illegal immigrants and fentanyl across US borders.

He added insult to injury with the absurd announcement that henceforth the Gulf of Mexico would be known as the Gulf of America, and childishly restricted Associated Press access to the White House when the news agency insisted on using the proper name. While there are legitimate concerns about Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and Greenland, rather than engage in quiet diplomacy, Trump bullied Panama and ranted that Greenland, a dependency of Denmark, should be annexed to the US, along with Canada.

An American president is the nation's diplomat-in-chief, for better or for worse – in Trump's case, for worse. On 4 February, Trump suggested that the US take over the Gaza Strip and deport the two million inhabitants to make room for a real estate development, a wicked and deranged proposal that was quickly dropped. On 28 Feb, he undermined his stated goal of ending the fighting in Ukraine by publicly berating Volodomyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in the White House. Since then, the President has negotiated with Russia from a position of weakness, responding to a Russian offensive by writing “Vladimir, stop!” on his vanity social media platform, Truth Social.

The first 100 days of the second Trump administration in domestic policy have seen a barrage of blunders as well. Thanks to federal deficit spending during the Great Recession and the Covid pandemic, for the first time in American history the US is spending more in interest payments on the national debt than on national defence.

Higher economic growth, accelerated by liberating American energy production from Biden-era constraints and investment in reshored manufacturing, can help to make the debt burden sustainable. But a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will also be necessary.

To his credit, Trump has stated that he is open to higher taxes on the rich, although the idea is opposed by his Republican allies in Congress. But Trump empowered Elon Musk, the world's richest man and Trump's biggest donor in 2024, to cut federal spending as head of the dubiously-legal “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge).

Before Musk was reined in by push-back from Trump's Cabinet secretaries and the federal judiciary, he and his team had found only pocket change in savings, while crippling the Social Security administration, the Center for Disease Control, the National Weather Service, and other essential agencies with apparently random firings of civil servants.

The Trump administration has embraced the theory of “the unitary executive”, which holds that the unchecked power of the president includes the power to defund or completely destroy agencies created and paid for by Congress, including America's independent central bank, the Federal Reserve. Indeed, the 78-year-old chief executive seems determined to vindicate those who have called him a would-be dictator.

Unlike any previous American president, he has adopted the tactics of foreign strong men, like suing critical media companies in an apparent bid to intimidate them. He has weaponised the Justice Department to go after his opponents, including Letitia James, the New York State Attorney General, who had prosecuted him on flimsy charges, and he has pardoned violent members of the mob that rioted at the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021. He has bullied law firms with Democratic affiliations and threatened to get the IRS to strip the tax exemption from Harvard University to punish it for not bowing to his administration's demands.

While turning the executive branch into an instrument of personal vengeance, Trump is accused of shamelessly using the office of the presidency for his own financial gain, promising a dinner with him on May 22 for big-spending holders of his bitcoin, $Trump, which is described as the “most exclusive invitation in the world”. To top it off, while repeating the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him, Trump is teasing a blatantly unconstitutional third term for himself in office.

In spite of all this, voters in the 2026 and 2028 elections may prefer Republicans to Democrats, who remain united behind mass immigration, gender craziness, identity politics, and a war on fossil fuels. And a more disciplined White House may recover from the chaos of the first 100 days. But the second Trump administration is off to a very bad start indeed.

A Democrat governor who hid her face during a “disastrous” Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump joined the president during a visit to Michigan to mark his 100 days in office.

Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan governor, attempted to shield her face with a folder at an event in the Oval Office earlier this month, drawing mockery online and condemnation from fellow Democrats.

Despite attempting to distance herself from Mr Trump in the wake of the meeting, she accompanied the president on his visit to the state on Tuesday as he marked 100 days in office since returning to the White House in January.

Her appearance will likely further isolate Democrats who regard Mr Trump as a toxic figure and are frustrated with their party's seeming inability to stand up to him.

Ms Whitmer is hoping to secure investment in the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, where Mr Trump addressed the Michigan National Guard on Tuesday.

A spokeswoman for the Michigan governor said she was planning to appear at the base to “support her troops and the longstanding effort she has made to secure support for Selfridge”.

Mr Trump greeted Ms Whitmer with a hug after landing in Michigan, and at the air base said he would replace its ageing fleet with “21 brand-new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets”.

He then invited Ms Whitmer up to the podium, where the surprised governor said she had not expected to talk but was “grateful” for the president's announcement.

Ms Whitmer, 53, is a frontrunner to become the Democrats' presidential candidate in 2028, but is in an awkward position because she needs Mr Trump's support to secure federal funding for her state.

She was seen as a favourite to succeed Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket last year when the election was thrown into chaos by his disastrous debate performance, and according to journalist Michel Wolff Mr Trump was convinced he would lose the election to her.

Democrats fear the popular swing state governor is now squandering her chances for a potential White House bid.

Earlier this month, she met with Mr Trump at the White House in what she had apparently expected would be a private meeting to discuss the impact of tariffs on her state.

She was seemingly caught unawares by the media in attendance, and vainly attempted to hide her face from cameras by shielding it with a large blue folder.

The strange moment quickly went viral on social media.

Ms Whitmer was just feet from the US president as he claimed the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” and signed executive orders for the justice department to conduct probes into critics, later insisting that her presence was “not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made”.

In what could further complicate her relationship with the party grassroots, Mr Trump showered her with praise, calling her a “very good person” and saying she had done “an excellent job”.

Brad Bannon, a Democrat strategist, suggested the soundbite would come back to haunt her presidential ambitions, telling Fox News: “One of her opponents will dig that clip up and put it in a television ad.”

One Democrat staffer labelled the event a “a f-----g disaster” which lost “some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem”.

Her appearances with Mr Trump are a potentially damaging misstep while potential rivals are jockeying to become the Democrats' next presidential candidate, and she risks being outflanked by more vocal critics of the US president.

JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, is positioning himself as a favourite among party activists frustrated at the lack of meaningful opposition by Democrats, launching a barrage of attacks on Mr Trump in recent appearances.

Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor, has taken a tougher stance on Mr Trump's tariff policy than Ms Whitmer, accusing him of “forcing an economic recession”.

Rashida Tlaib Wants to Change That.","https://truthout.org/articles/vietnamese-agent-orange-victims-remain-uncompensated-tlaib-aims-to-change-that/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:01:49 GMT","

Vietnamese and US descendants of those exposed to Agent Orange continue to face diseases and congenital anomalies.

Today marks 50 years since the end of the U.S. War in Vietnam, which killed an estimated 3.3 million Vietnamese people, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians, tens of thousands of Laotians and more than 58,000 U.S. service members. But for many Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian people; Vietnamese Americans; and U.S. Vietnam veterans and their descendants, the impacts of the war never ended. They continue to suffer the devastating consequences of Agent Orange, an herbicide mixture used by the U.S. military that contained dioxin, the deadliest chemical known to humankind.

The United States used Agent Orange as a weapon of war. From 1961-1971, the U.S. military sprayed toxins that contained large quantities of dioxin in order to destroy food supplies and improve visibility for the U.S. military by killing broad swathes of vegetation throughout southern Vietnam. As a result, many people have been born with congenital anomalies in the formation of the spinal cord, limbs, heart, palate, and more. This remains the largest deployment of herbicidal warfare in history.

In the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the Nixon administration promised to contribute $3 billion for compensation and postwar reconstruction of Vietnam. But that promise remains unfulfilled. Although the U.S. has funded the cleanup of two of the largest dioxin-contaminated “hotspots” and there has been some remuneration for U.S. veterans, there has been none for the Vietnamese people, the intended victims of the deadly spraying.

In order to achieve justice for Agent Orange victims, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) introduced a legislative package on April 28. The Agent Orange Relief Act of 2025 provides for medical care and related assistance for Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange; provides additional environmental remediation for hotspots; and orders a health assessment and assistance to affected Vietnamese American communities.

Tlaib also introduced The Victims of Agent Orange Act of 2025, which provides benefits for children of male U.S. veterans who served in Vietnam affected by congenital anomalies; these children are unprotected by current law, which only covers congenital anomalies for children of women veterans. The bill also supports greater research into Agent Orange-related health issues and directs a health assessment and provision of assistance for affected Vietnamese American communities.

“Together, these two bills serve as an act of repair for the profound harms caused by the United States' use of Agent Orange and other herbicides. Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect the lives of American veterans, Vietnamese people, Vietnamese Americans, and their children,” Tlaib stated in a press release. “The lives of many victims are cut short, and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, which are often untreated or unrecognized. As we mark 50 years after the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam, it is time to meet our moral and legal obligations to heal the wounds inflicted by these atrocities.”

Many continue to suffer the devastating consequences of Agent Orange, an herbicide mixture used by the U.S. military that contained dioxin, the deadliest chemical known to humankind.

The legislative package is co-sponsored by Representatives André Carson (D-Indiana), Sarah McBride (D-Delaware), Jerry Nadler (D-New York), Lateefah Simon (D-California) and Shri Thanedar (D-Michigan). The bills are endorsed by the Quincy Institute, Veterans For Peace, Vietnam Agent Orange Relief & Responsibility Campaign (VAORRC), CommonDefense.us, Minnesota Peace Project and Action Corps.

Tlaib told Truthout, “For there to be any justice for the war crimes committed in Vietnam, the United States must devote itself to repair: by cleaning these ongoing Agent Orange contamination sites, investing in the medical care of those affected, and removing unexploded ordnance.”

VAORRC, for which I serve as co-coordinator, assisted Tlaib in drafting the bills. In the congresswoman's press release, Susan Schnall and Ngo Thanh Nhan, also co-coordinators of VAORRC, thanked Tlaib for introducing this important legislation.

Schnall, president of Veterans For Peace, said:

The United States government used Agent Orange as an instrument of war from 1961-1971 on Vietnam, its people, and American soldiers on the ground. As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Vietnam, we celebrate these two pieces of legislation that promote healing for the American people and the Vietnamese people harmed, and cleanup of the contaminated land in Vietnam.

Ngo stated: “The Southeast Asian communities have victims of Agent Orange and were invisible to the public so far. These are very important acts for our communities in the U.S. to support and it takes great courage for Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to show this example of solidarity.”

Between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian people, and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin during the spraying operations. Many other Vietnamese people were or continue to be exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin through contact with the environment and food that was contaminated. Many offspring of those who were exposed have congenital anomalies, developmental disabilities, and other diseases. Second, third and fourth generation victims continue to suffer.

The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes 19 diseases and illnesses to be associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the U.S. military in Vietnam. They include AL Amyloidosis, bladder cancer, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure (hypertension), Hodgkin's disease, hypothyroidism, ischemic heart disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, acute and sub-acute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers and soft-tissue sarcomas.

In 2009, I served as one of seven judges from three continents on the International Peoples' Tribunal of Conscience in Support of the Vietnamese Victims of Agent Orange in Paris. The panel heard two days of testimony from 27 witnesses, including Vietnamese and U.S. veteran victims, journalists and scientists. Some had visible disabilities due to their exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin.

Mai Giang Vu, who was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the Army of South Vietnam, carried barrels of the chemicals in the jungle. His sons were unable to walk or function normally. Their limbs “curled up” and they could only crawl. By the age of 18, they were bedridden. One died at age 23, the other at 25.

Between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian people, and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin during the spraying operations.

Nga Tran is a French Vietnamese woman who worked in Vietnam as a war correspondent. She was there when the U.S. military began spraying chemical defoliants and a large cloud of the agent enveloped her. Shortly after her daughter was born, the child's skin began shedding. She could not tolerate physical contact with anyone. The child never grew. She remained 6.6 pounds – her birth weight – until she died at age 17 months. Tran's second daughter suffers from alpha thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder rarely seen in Asia. Tran saw a woman who gave birth to a “ball” with no human form. Many children are born without brains; others make inhuman sounds. There are victims who have never stood up. They creep and barely lift their heads.

Rosemarie Hohn Mizo is the widow of George Mizo who served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. After refusing to serve a third tour, Mizo was court-martialed, received a dishonorable discharge and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. Before his death from Agent Orange-related maladies, Mizo helped found the Friendship Village where Vietnamese victims live in a supportive environment.

Jeanne Stellman, who wrote the seminal Agent Orange article in Nature, testified that “This is the largest unstudied [unnatural] environmental disaster in the world.”

Although a Biometrics study from 1965 showed that dioxin caused many congenital anomalies in animal experiments, the U.S. military suppressed those findings. The results of the study were leaked in 1969 but the spraying of Agent Orange continued until 1971.

The tribunal found that “The damages caused to the land and forests, water supply, and communities and the ecosystems can legitimately be called an ecocide, as the forests and jungles in large parts of southern Vietnam have been devastated and denuded, and may either never grow back or take 50 to 200 years to regenerate.”

In 2004, U.S. veteran and Vietnamese victims sued the chemical companies that knowingly manufactured Agent Orange and other herbicides, which they knew contained a lethal amount of dioxin. The victims were prohibited from suing the U.S. government because of sovereign immunity. Despite agreeing to compensate U.S. veterans in an earlier lawsuit for some illnesses caused by their exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides, the U.S. government and the chemical companies claimed before the courts, and to this day, that no evidence supports a connection between exposure and disease.

Efforts by veterans' groups and others to take care of U.S. vets produced a compensation scheme administered by the Veterans Administration. It annually pays out billions of dollars to veterans who can demonstrate that they were in a contaminated part of Vietnam and have an illness associated with Agent Orange exposure.

Shamefully, the Vietnamese people who were exposed to Agent Orange on a scale unheard of in modern warfare have been denied recompense.

After the 2009 Paris tribunal, while I was president of the National Lawyers Guild, I participated in a delegation to Vietnam to present our findings to President Nguyen Minh Triet. I told him I was baffled that even as U.S. bombs were falling on the Vietnamese people, they made a distinction between the U.S. government and the American people. The president responded, “We fought the forces of aggression, but we always reserved our love for the people of America … because we knew they always supported us.” He was referring to the powerful U.S. antiwar movement in which I was a proud participant.

The United States and Vietnam normalized relations 30 years ago following a 19-year trade embargo on the latter. “It's taken decades to build the current level of mutual trust and cooperation between the United States and Vietnam,” George Black, author of The Long Reckoning, an examination of U.S.-Vietnam relations since the war, told The New York Times. “And the whole process has been underpinned by our willingness to deal with the worst humanitarian legacies.”

But Donald Trump has started a new war on Vietnam, a tariff war, imposing a 46 percent tariff rate (temporarily on hold as the two countries “negotiate”). The U.S. and Vietnam conduct $160 billion in annual commerce. And while the Vietnamese people commemorate 50 years since the end of the American war in their country, the Trump administration has ordered its senior diplomats in Vietnam to avoid participation in the commemoration events.

Just compensation for victims of Agent Orange is a moral imperative. People who support Tlaib's legislation should contact their congressional representatives and urge them to sign on as additional co-sponsors.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Poll: Majority of Voters View Trump as “Dictator” Who Threatens Democratic Norms","https://truthout.org/articles/poll-majority-of-voters-view-trump-as-dictator-who-threatens-democratic-norms/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:19:35 GMT","

Trump has demanded prosecutions against outlets that have published his low polling numbers, calling media “the enemy.”

New polling demonstrates that most voters see President Donald Trump as a dangerous politician and view his leadership style as dictatorial.

In Truth Social posts earlier this week, Trump seemed to confirm that point of view, expressing disdain for the press and demanding firings at news companies that published data showcasing voters' negative views of his presidency 100 days into his second term.

In a post on Monday, Trump called such surveys “FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS,” citing longtime conservative pollster John McLaughlin, who has described polls showing Trump's negative approval ratings as fraudulent. (Notably, McLaughin has counted the president among his clients, including during the 2024 presidential campaign.)

Trump further claimed that the surveys were weighted wrongly and did not include enough Republican voters — something that would be tough to replicate across multiple polls consistently showing majority disapproval among voters. He then demanded disciplinary action against those media organizations, including criminal inquiries. 

“These people should be investigated for ELECTION FRAUD,” Trump wrote in his post, referring to the press as “Negative Criminals.”

“They suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome, and there is nothing that anyone, or anything, can do about it,” Trump added, before calling media “THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” — an epithet he frequently hurls against journalists who publish factual reporting on him and his policies.

Numbers from a PRRI survey published last week demonstrate that most voters view the president's behavior as alarming.

The poll gave respondents two options to choose from, asking whether they believe Trump is a “strong leader who should be given the power he needs to restore America's greatness,” or “a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” Only 44 percent viewed him as a “strong leader,” while a majority of respondents, 52 percent, called him a “dictator” who posed a threat to the country's democratic norms.

Even a significant percentage of the president's own base said Trump was dangerous, with more than one in six Republican voters (17 percent) describing him as a dangerous dictator.

The poll also showed that voters are opposed to Trump theoretically expanding presidential power. Seventy-seven percent of respondents said Trump should not suspend the midterms in 2026 if he is unable to “get our country out of crisis in the next year,” while just 17 percent said he should take such an action. And only 20 percent believed that, “because things have gotten so far off track, we need a president who is willing to break some laws if that's what it takes to save the country,” while 76 percent of respondents disagreed with that viewpoint.

Despite his dismal 100-day polling numbers, Trump suggested to a crowd of his supporters in Michigan on Tuesday that he would continue to impose his far right agenda, even if it meant disregarding judicial rulings against his executive actions.

“Nothing will stop me,” Trump told his loyalists.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday announced he is scrapping a women's leadership program implemented during President Donald Trump's first term.

The program is operated by the United Nations and is “pushed by feminists and left-wing activists,” according to the defense secretary.

Hegseth said that “politicians fawn” over the program but troops “hate” it.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem co-sponsored the WPS Act when she represented South Dakota in Congress.

Tuesday's announcement aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to end federal diversity initiatives across the government. It also aligns with the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency to slash government waste and abuse.

Hegseth declared he would “fight to end the program for our next budget.” The Pentagon did not provide specific details on how much the initiative costs.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced a new policy that reduces the default withholding rate to 50 percent for recovering Social Security benefit overpayments under Title II, the federal program covering retirement and disability insurance.

Under the updated directive, any overpayment notice issued on or after April 25 will automatically carry a 50 percent withholding rate. Beneficiaries will have 90 days to respond—either by contesting the overpayment, requesting a waiver, or negotiating a lower repayment rate. If no action is taken within that window, the SSA will start withholding half the monthly benefit until the overpayment is fully repaid.

The updated rules do not apply to Title XVI overpayments, such as those involving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, who still face the 10 percent withholding rate. The revised policy also excludes cases involving fraud or similar fault, which follow different recovery procedures.

With its latest decision to cut the withholding rate in half, the SSA appears to be seeking a middle ground between fiscal responsibility and potential beneficiary hardship.

SSA's overpayment recovery practices have come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and watchdogs in recent years, particularly for the stress they impose on beneficiaries who may have had little or no role in the errors.

The SSA says it has launched an internal review and is working to expand data-sharing with payroll systems to help reduce payment errors.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was officially suspended by Wisconsin's Supreme Court on April 29, after she was arrested by the FBI on April 25 and accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities.

“It is ordered ... that Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan is temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge in the state of Wisconsin, effective the date of this order and until further order of the court,” the justices wrote in their statement.

Dugan faces one count of “obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency,” and another of “concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.”

Wisconsin's Supreme Court Justices said that it was in the public interest, to protect public confidence, to remove her from her post as she faces those two federal charges. They also noted that they were acting on their own initiative rather than at the request of anyone.

According to the affidavit, witnesses said she appeared “visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,” upon learning of the arrest party's arrival. Witnesses also alleged that Dugan “escorted” Flores Ruiz and his lawyer “out of the courtroom through the ‘jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse” (the door is only used by defendants if they are in the custody of deputies), after she “ordered” the team of FBI and deportation officials to go to the chief judge's office.

Another officer noticed Flores Ruiz and his lawyer on an elevator and alerted the arrest team, who apprehended him after a foot race outside the courthouse.

Her next court appearance as a defendant is May 15, and she could face more disciplinary actions against her license to practice law.

A state court spokesperson told The Associated Press that a reserve judge began serving in Dugan's place on April 28 and will continue to do so for an indefinite period of time.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

After two years of destructive fighting, Sudan's civil war has reached an uneasy stalemate. Since the beginning of 2025, the Sudanese Armed Forces and allied militias have made significant gains against the Rapid Support Forces, the powerful militia accused of genocide, as the two factions vie for control of the country. By late March, the SAF had recaptured the capital, Khartoum, reclaiming Sudan's presidential palace and clearing most of the city of RSF fighters. Nevertheless, the SAF is unlikely to defeat the RSF outright: the militia continues to maintain strong control over approximately a quarter of the country's territory, largely in the west. And the RSF, in turn, seems unlikely to be able to retake the ground it has lost in the eastern, northern, and central parts of the country and is now focusing its efforts on fortifying its hold over the vast Darfur region. Over the past few weeks, fighting began to ebb, but it is again intensifying in North Darfur's provincial capital, El Fasher, the SAF's last remaining stronghold in Sudan's west.

Because the war's frontlines seem mostly set, historical precedent suggests that now would be an ideal time for a cease-fire or even peace negotiations. In many previous African conflicts, a battlefield deadlock encouraged international actors to push for negotiations, as happened in 2005, when U.S.-backed talks ended the second Sudanese civil war after more than two decades of fighting between southern rebels and Khartoum. Indeed, it might even seem that de jure partitioning, akin to the 2011 secession of South Sudan, could be the least bad option. The Sudanese people certainly need a reprieve: the latest conflict has devastated the country, leaving as many as 150,000 Sudanese dead, nearly 13 million displaced, and up to 25 million facing severe food insecurity or famine.

But in the case of Sudan's current civil war, any hope that negotiations, if they can be started, will result in lasting peace is illusory. The conflict has deepened existing ethnic and regional fault lines; the atrocities that the RSF, in particular, has perpetrated have made negotiations unpalatable for many of the SAF's backers. Simultaneously, a wide variety of actors—including powerful foreign countries—have an interest in seeing the factions they have backed stay as powerful as possible. That makes crafting a peace settlement that generates a single government difficult.

History strongly suggests, however, that any kind of territorial fragmentation will also fail to bring stability. South Sudan's secession did not dampen the conflict consuming the region; it merely displaced the fighting, as the rebel group that had fought Khartoum fragmented and its factions began to battle one another. If the warring sides continue to refuse a cease-fire or peace talks, that could yield a situation similar to what has occurred in Libya and Yemen: a de facto split in which Sudan remains intact in name only. Rival power centers will take hold in different parts of the country, and many of the groups that are fighting today, alongside new ones that will likely emerge, will continue to fight.

The current Sudanese civil war is far from a straightforward, two-sided conflict. It began as a brawl between two factions within the country's security apparatus—the SAF, under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti. Burhan and Hemedti had allied to topple the civilian-led transitional government that had emerged after the long-standing Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir's ouster in 2019 but then turned on each other in April 2023.

Over the course of two years, their rupture has metastasized into a much bigger war involving numerous Sudanese groups and well-resourced foreign patrons such as Egypt, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. New militias have emerged to align with each faction, and older armed groups have thrown their lot in with either the SAF or the RSF. The older groups include major tribal and regional militias, such as the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), both based in the Darfur region and aligned with the SAF, as well as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), a longtime rebel force that has allied with the RSF.



Neither the SAF nor the RSF claims to be waging war for ideological reasons. Although the SAF's leadership has branded its fight as a nonsectarian battle for the survival of the Sudanese state, Islamists have dominated its top officer corps for nearly four decades. After the Bashir regime armed Janjaweed militias to counter rebellions by non-Arab groups in Darfur, in 2013 it officially organized these militias into the RSF. Although the RSF's constituent militias have credibly been accused of genocide, the RSF now appropriates the very claims of marginalization and disenfranchisement once voiced by the ethnic rebel groups it was originally tasked with eliminating.

In reality, however, one of the current war's most important motivators is Sudan's vast mineral and agricultural wealth. The country has huge gold reserves and the second-largest amount of arable land in Africa, and both domestic and foreign interests are struggling for control of these resources. In addition, smaller factions have lined up behind one side or the other to wage more localized power struggles or to secure personal wealth: the JEM's leader, Gibril Ibrahim, for instance, has sided with the SAF, in part, to maintain his lucrative role as Sudan's minister of finance.

On the surface, the fact that Sudan's civil war is driven by material rather than ideological interests makes the prospect of a negotiated settlement appear more viable, even if hammering one out would be complex. If each important faction got something concrete that it wanted, one theory goes—if natural resource concessions or cabinet positions were distributed satisfactorily among the combatants—the fighting could stop. Hypothetically, a military stalemate could also induce the combatants to come to the table. The SAF has more troops and airpower. But the RSF's forces are battle-hardened and skilled at insurgency tactics, giving them an advantage in urban warfare, as evidenced by their ability to hold Khartoum and other major cities for two years. Numerous rounds of talks have been attempted, including formal negotiations led by Saudi Arabia and the United States and secret talks facilitated by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. But each attempt has failed.

Such efforts to resolve the Sudanese conflict misunderstood its dynamics. Although neither side can eliminate the other, both the SAF and the RSF have managed to make, and hold onto, territorial gains covering the parts of the country that their domestic and international constituencies consider the most important. Even as the fighting has begun to ebb, many of the war's key players are unwilling to engage in a settlement that would end the stream of profits generated by their war machines.

Early on, both sides sought external support to fund their war efforts. The United Arab Emirates has sustained the relationship it nurtured with the RSF from 2015 to 2019, when it hired RSF troops to serve as mercenaries in Yemen. To secure an export corridor for Sudanese goods, Abu Dhabi has sent cargo flights full of powerful weapons, drones, and armored vehicles to the RSF via its client state (and Sudan's western neighbor), Chad. Egypt, meanwhile, seeks a sympathetic ally in Khartoum as it aims to secure influence over the Nile in the face of Ethiopia's efforts to exercise power over the crucial waterway. To that end, Cairo has sent military aid to the SAF and has allegedly engaged in airstrikes against the RSF. Egypt also relies on Sudanese resources—often smuggled—to help prop up its flailing economy.

Other countries have backed one side or the other, too. Although Saudi Arabia has publicly positioned itself as a peacemaker, it has implicitly sided with the SAF during past rounds of negotiations, in part because of its regional competition with the United Arab Emirates. The SAF has also courted Russia, which wants to establish a military base on the Red Sea, and it recently secured drones from Iran and Turkey, two actors that also want greater influence over nearby shipping lanes.

For these international partners, an informal stalemate is not so different from a negotiated peace. As long as each coalition's area of control remains largely set, the kinds of economic activities important to these patrons can proceed without the bother of negotiating a politically difficult resolution. And foreign backers can maintain lucrative supply lines without the burdens associated with doing business with a legitimate state (such as regulations and tariffs) or popular protests against resource extraction that benefits a small elite.

Perhaps the greatest barriers to achieving a negotiated peace in Sudan, however, are internal. Each broad alliance is dangerously fragile, susceptible to infighting and splits. Given that neither the SAF nor the RSF have a rigid ethnic or sectarian identity, or a publicly professed ideological mission, little commands the loyalty of the smaller allied militias beyond the resources they are currently receiving. The war has already been marked by high-profile defections, such as that of Abu Aqla Kaykal and his Sudan Shield Forces. Kaykal initially aligned with the SAF and then defected to the RSF in mid-2023, proving instrumental to the militia's capture of Sudan's El Gezira state in the country's fertile center. But when the SAF recaptured the region in late 2024, he again switched sides.

Challenging simplistic narratives that cast Sudan's wars as disputes between Arabs and Africans, this conflict has transcended ethnic bonds, which makes each coalition less robust. In October 2024, for instance, as the SAF recaptured El Gezira, some SAF troops and associated militias attacked non-Arab ethnic groups. In retaliation and to protect other non-Arab groups, SLA and JEM forces in El Gezira clashed with SAF-aligned Arab militias, even though those two groups are officially allied with the SAF.

To the extent that the factions' territorial control continues to shift on the margins, that could push further defections. The RSF's recent retreat from central Sudan suggests that the militia may be willing to surrender that territory to focus on cementing its hold over Darfur. That would leave the two major Darfuri groups allied with the SAF—the SLA and the JEM—without any territory under their control, making defection tempting. These complex dynamics complicate peace talks because it is often unclear what each side is really able to offer.

Even if some short-term truce could be reached, the large assortment of ethnic groups and ideological camps that have allied with each side means that restoring social cohesion will be even more difficult. Even before the civil war, the variety of interests at play in Sudan were complicated. After two years of war, fault lines have hardened, and divides have become more emotional.

The country's de facto partition is already beginning. The map of territorial control in Sudan today suggests a bifurcated country, with the west—apart from El Fasher, North Darfur's capital—largely under the RSF's grasp, and the east, north, and center of the country held by the SAF. In February in Nairobi, the RSF and its partners signed a transitional constitutional agreement paving the way for the declaration of a parallel government over the large swaths of land they control.

A split may ostensibly seem an attractive outcome, but it is extremely unlikely to bring durable peace. Both the SAF and the RSF coalitions are fragile: the newly formalized RSF alliance makes strange bedfellows of the staunchly secular SPLM-N and a variety of breakaway factions from Sufi religious orders for whom secularism is a political third rail. The SAF's coalition includes both secular armed groups and Muslim Brotherhood–aligned Islamist militias, but its most important international patrons—Egypt and Saudi Arabia—are staunchly anti-Brotherhood. Furthermore, any new polities would not have contiguous ethnic boundaries. The project of governing heterogeneous regions would be tremendously complicated by Sudan's weak or absent state institutions, especially in historically marginalized territories held by the RSF. And if the country split further, its two nascent polities—one landlocked—would be far less economically viable than if they remained united. Additionally, both the SAF and RSF are moving away from land battles and instead seek to destabilize their rivals' territory with air or drone strikes, making the country as a whole increasingly ungovernable.

Paradoxically, the high degree of fragmentation that makes a unified government so hard to achieve in Sudan is the same thing that makes any solution that splits the country and establishes multiple governments unstable. At present, both broad alliances would be hard-pressed to identify a contiguous area of territory that they and their supporters would be satisfied to maintain and other zones that they are willing to cede. And given the many accusations of war crimes leveled against each side, neither alliance could boast a solid mandate to govern within the territory it controls.

Because the conflict is overwhelmingly driven by a struggle over regional power and resources, rather than any larger political vision for the country, it remains likely that alliances will keep shifting, militias will keep defecting, and breakaway groups will keep forming. Sadly, instead of either peace or partition, Sudan's most likely future is more war.

BOYD VAN DIJK is an Oxford Martin Fellow at the University of Oxford and the author of Preparing for War: The Making of the Geneva Conventions.

In early March, as its cease-fire with Hamas began to unravel, Israel again turned to a tactic it had used earlier in the war in Gaza: imposing a total blockade on the territory, including a cutoff of all deliveries of food, medicine, fuel, and electricity. The aim, according to Israeli cabinet officials, was to make life unbearable for Gaza's two million citizens to force Hamas to accept Israeli demands in talks on a cease-fire extension. On social media, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, echoing statements by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, defended the government's decision to “completely halt” the flow of humanitarian aid, calling it a way to open the “gates of hell . . . as quickly and deadly as possible.” This was not an isolated remark; Smotrich had previously suggested that blocking aid to Gaza was justified even at the cost of mass civilian starvation. Seven weeks into the new siege, as the UN World Food Program announced that border closings had caused all of its food stocks in Gaza to run out, Moshe Saada, a Knesset member from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, told Israel's Channel 14 TV that that was the intention: “Yes, I will starve the residents of Gaza, yes, this is our obligation,” Saada said.

Amid a war in which tens of thousands of civilians have been killed by more direct means, Israel's serial blockades of Gaza may at first appear a secondary issue. But the tactic—and the justifications Israeli officials have offered for using it—has become a major test for international law. This week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is holding hearings on the issue, following a UN General Assembly request to investigate whether Israel violated the UN Charter by blocking UNRWA, the principal UN aid agency in Gaza. And in November, the International Criminal Court (ICC) already issued international arrest warrants not only for the leaders of Hamas but also for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the case of Hamas, the ICC charges related to atrocities committed in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israeli civilians. At the heart of the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant, however, is a different, and rarely invoked crime: the ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, accuses them of orchestrating a criminal starvation policy against Gaza's civilian population.

In its classification of war crimes, the Rome Statute, the 1998 treaty that established the ICC, includes “intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare,” a tactic that can involve “willfully impeding relief supplies.” By publicly declaring Israel's intention to impose a total siege of Gaza and then enforcing measures that deprive Gazans of food and other goods that are indispensable to civilians' survival, the ICC prosecutor alleges, Netanyahu and Gallant have committed the war crime of starvation. It is the first time in history that a major court has centered a war crimes prosecution on this particular charge.

As the war in Gaza has unfolded, the consequences of the blockades have been far-reaching. In October 2024, after a year of war during which aid shipments often slowed to a trickle, a UN-backed food assessment found that roughly four-fifths of Gaza's 2.2 million population were facing “extreme hunger.” Now, as the Israeli military dramatically escalates its new ground offensive, fears are rising that the humanitarian crisis could again reach, or even exceed, those catastrophic levels. Already in early April, the World Food Program announced that all 25 of the bakeries it supports in Gaza, many of which had been vital for civilian survival during earlier phases of the war, had been forced to shut down because of a lack of flour and fuel. Since fuel and electricity are needed to run the desalination plants that provide much of Gaza's drinking water, an estimated 91 percent of the population also faces water insecurity, aggravating the food shortages and reviving the specter of disease. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the people of Gaza are now entering the longest period without relief aid since hostilities began in October 2023. “Right now, it is probably the worst humanitarian situation ever seen throughout the war,” a spokesperson for OCHA said last week.

Despite these plainly visible effects of Israeli policies, the ICC faces a steep uphill battle. For one thing, it has never attempted to prosecute the leader of a Western country. The arrest warrants have placed ICC member states, especially Israel's European allies and Canada, in a precarious position. If Netanyahu—or Gallant—enters one of those countries, its authorities are legally required to detain him. (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban flouted this requirement when he hosted Netanyahu in early April.) For its part, the United States has strongly opposed the case against the Israelis from the outset, and President Donald Trump has set out to destroy the ICC itself, withdrawing U.S. support for a war crimes prosecution of Russian President Vladimir Putin and authorizing sanctions on ICC officials in February that are aimed at making it extremely difficult for the court to operate. Fearing that its future could be in jeopardy, the court has rushed to pay staff salaries in advance and made an appeal to EU member states for emergency aid. Paradoxically, the very weapon the ICC tries to prosecute, economic coercion, is now being used against the court itself. “The court is facing an existential threat,” ICC's president, Tomoko Akane, told the European Parliament in March.

Equally challenging, however, is the substance of the ICC case. Despite its long and devastating history, intentional starvation of a civilian population is notoriously difficult to prove, and belligerents that have used the tactic have rarely been held to account. Thus, the ICC's actions highlight both the acute urgency of the mass hunger crisis in Gaza and the persistent challenges in prosecuting starvation as a crime. Notwithstanding these daunting legal obstacles, the ICC prosecutor's move has drawn international attention to a particularly dangerous form of warfare against civilians, one that has until now gone too often under the radar. Whether or not the ICC case succeeds, the precedent it establishes could redraw the legal boundaries of war and force states to reckon with rules they once thought would never apply to them.

Although millions of civilians died in the twentieth century as a result of siege and starvation strategies, the effort to treat starvation as a war crime is surprisingly recent. Unlike other war crimes codified in the aftermath of the two world wars, the use of starvation as a weapon of armed conflict was not formally prohibited in international law until 1977. Since then, despite the explicit ban, prosecutions of this crime have been exceedingly rare. Most post–World War II international criminal tribunals, including the one established in the early 1990s for wartime abuses in the former Yugoslavia, did not include forced starvation in their founding statutes, let alone seek to prosecute it.

One of the key reasons was that throughout the twentieth century, starvation blockades were integral to Western strategic thinking—and, as many statesmen saw it, to the maintenance of international order itself. During World War I, blockade planners in both Germany and the United Kingdom regarded civilian populations as the backbone of modern militaries: in a total war, they reasoned, cutting off food imports for enemy civilians was not only permissible but also perhaps necessary. Thus, beginning in 1914, the United Kingdom imposed a naval blockade on all the Central Powers that eventually resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Indeed, so terrifyingly effective was the tactic, known in German as the Hungerblockade, that both victors and vanquished viewed it as a war-winning weapon that had caused the societal collapse of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918.

In World War II, starvation campaigns became, if anything, even more important, and both the Allied and Axis powers explicitly acknowledged that their aim was to kill enemy civilians. As part of its all-out war against Japan, for example, the United States launched Operation Starvation, a submarine and air blockade cutting off food and raw materials. After the war, the Nazis were held accountable for civilian starvation actions at the Nuremberg tribunals, although such measures were subsumed under meta-crimes such as extermination. For the victorious Allied parties, there was no accountability at all.

The West's strategic embrace of starvation lasted well beyond Hitler's downfall in 1945, and discussion of the tactic was notably absent from much of the architecture of postwar international law. Neither the 1948 Genocide Convention nor the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for example, explicitly addressed the deliberate starvation of civilians. But it was the drafting of the Geneva Conventions that provides the clearest window into why starvation crimes were marginalized after World War II.

When state representatives met in Geneva in mid-1949 to draft conventions for protecting victims of war, many countries sought to enshrine stronger humanitarian safeguards for armed conflict. In particular, the International Committee of the Red Cross, along with many representatives from states that had been occupied during World War II, including the Soviet Union, pushed for guarantees of free passage for humanitarian aid and a prohibition on the destruction of objects essential to civilian survival. But the United States and the United Kingdom were adamant about preserving their ability to impose blockades and resisted any provisions that might limit their naval or air power. Envisioning possible future sieges against communist or anticolonial adversaries, they successfully watered down these proposals.

The resulting compromise helped lay the groundwork for a Cold War–era legal consensus on starvation blockades. While it fell short of prohibiting the tactic, the Geneva Conventions stigmatized the pillaging of land, protected aid workers, and nominally recognized the principle of humanitarian access—although the protection of that access was greatly weakened by restrictive conditions and sweeping inspection powers, allowing blockaders to obstruct aid on even the slightest suspicion that it might benefit the enemy.



After 1949, blockading powers were unable to formally reclaim the right to deliberately starve civilians as a lawful weapon of war. Nonetheless, they were able to create significant carve outs, in which nonintentional civilian death could be considered legally tolerable under specific circumstances. The United States, for example, used starvation tactics on a large scale in the Vietnam War, with its systematic destruction of crops in areas suspected of harboring communist guerrillas. Within the emerging framework, a government at war could claim that starving enemy combatants remained legal and that as a result, incidental civilian deaths were tragic but nearly unavoidable outcomes of a legitimate method of modern warfare against totalitarian enemies. As is well known, few wartime famines can be described as deliberate from start to finish; more often, they are a consequence of blockade policies that prioritize military needs over civilian lives.

By the 1970s, however, a wave of newly independent countries, including in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere, led a new push to further stigmatize starvation tactics, driven by direct experience of this kind of warfare by their former colonial overlords. In negotiations leading to the addition of two new protocols to the Geneva Conventions in 1977, these states pressed for robust rules against indiscriminate bombing, crop destruction, and starvation. Still, not all postcolonial states supported a comprehensive ban. Nigeria, for example, which had deliberately exploited the 1949 legal carve outs for blockades to devastating effect during the Nigeria-Biafra war of the late 1960s, recognized the tactical advantages of starvation in suppressing secessionist insurgencies. As a result, the new international legal architecture curbed starvation tactics in interstate wars and during occupations but stopped short of fully criminalizing the weapon, particularly when used by poorer states against insurgent groups in civil wars.

This outcome had dramatic consequences. Stateless or marginalized minorities—Biafrans, Darfuris, Kurds, Tigrayans—remained vulnerable to famine-inducing blockades by hostile governments. Even after the Rome Statute classified starvation as a war crime, the designation applied only to interstate armed conflicts. It took until 2019 for countries, including Germany, to formally recognize starvation as a crime in civil wars, as well. Still, until the ICC case against Israel, it had never been prosecuted as a standalone offense. Despite its codification in treaty law, charging a belligerent with starvation crimes was considered too politically sensitive, too entangled with the military strategies of powerful states. Deliberate starvation has persisted as a military strategy not just because it is cheap, simple, and brutally effective but also because it is so difficult to punish.

The ICC's arrest warrants against Israel's leaders seek to challenge this long-standing impunity. But the case also highlights the continuing difficulties of prosecuting starvation crimes: prosecutors need to prove that the Israeli leadership intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival. As with genocide, however, it is often extremely difficult to prove intent. In the event of mass famine in a conflict situation, political or military leaders may be able to frame any resultant deaths as simply an unfortunate consequence of modern warfare.

Moreover, the way blockades are imposed can also make the crimes harder to pin down. In a bombing campaign, for example, the source is usually unambiguous and the result immediate and often visually spectacular. By contrast, the destructive effects of blockades usually unfold indirectly, over time, and often out of sight. They are also the consequence of administrative routines—permits denied, crossings closed, shipments blocked—that are overseen by faceless bureaucrats. To paraphrase Hannah Arendt, starvation tactics are the work of the “desk murderer”: methodical, concealed, and often masked by some alternative rationale, such as security imperatives or preventing weapons smuggling. This often hidden process has long shielded starvation campaigns from legal prosecution.

Consider Sudan's two-year conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces militia, which has led to calamitous food shortages for even larger numbers of people than in Gaza. By the middle of 2024, the UN concluded that 18 million Sudanese were “acutely hungry,” including some 3.6 million children. As Alex de Waal has written in Foreign Affairs, “This dire situation . . . is the direct consequence of actions by both sides of Sudan's terrible civil war.” The ICC prosecutor has opened a war crimes inquiry into Sudan's Darfur region—a region over which the court has clear jurisdiction following a 2005 referral by the UN Security Council—where the RSF is now besieging El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur. Yet despite growing reports linking the humanitarian crisis across the country to deliberate starvation tactics, the tribunal has not yet publicly brought charges citing starvation as a war crime in the Sudanese context. (In April, however, the ICJ took up the issue in a genocide case filed by Sudan's military government against the United Arab Emirates that alleges Emirati support for starvation tactics by the RSF.)

In making the war in Gaza the ICC's first prosecution of starvation crimes, then, the ICC prosecutor appears to have determined that the blunt public statements by Israeli leaders provide unusually concrete evidence of intent, regardless of various jurisdictional obstacles. On October 9, 2023, for example, two days after the Hamas attacks, Gallant declared a “complete siege” of Gaza, ordering the cutoff of all electricity, food, and fuel, and referring to Gazans as “human animals.” Similarly, in the opening weeks of the war and again more recently, Netanyahu publicly refused to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. During the first year of the war, Israel did begin to let small amounts of aid into Gaza, largely in response to international condemnations and pressure from the Biden administration. Yet more recently, rather than moderating such overt statements of intent, the Israeli leadership has doubled down on its rhetoric even as it has reimposed a total blockade and resumed its bombing campaign. In March, for example, Gallant's successor as defense minister, Yisrael Katz, joined other ministers in talk of unleashing the “gates of hell” on Gazans. Such public declarations by Israel's political leadership have turned starvation from a war crime that was never prosecuted into what some scholars of international law have called “low-hanging fruit”—and helping make starvation charge the centerpiece of the ICC arrest warrants.

Yet the ICC prosecutor's focus on the rhetoric of Israeli officials raises deeper questions about the viability of seeking justice for starvation crimes. Would the ICC have been able to issue arrest warrants if Netanyahu and Gallant had been more discreet in their public statements? The press release announcing the ICC's decision suggests that if Israel's leadership had avoided explicitly declaring a starvation siege—regardless of the outcome of the tactic—the charges might have been confined instead to “command responsibility” for direct attacks on civilians and crimes against humanity. These in themselves are serious offenses but perhaps less damaging than the crime of starvation, with its implication of intent to destroy a civilian group in whole or in part.

Given the enormous political headwinds now facing the ICC, the case against Israel may go nowhere. Yet the court's focus on the crime of starvation could have legal ramifications for other recent and unfolding conflicts. Around the Red Sea and in central Africa, warring parties continue to use siege tactics and starvation campaigns largely unimpeded. Following the precedents set in Geneva in 1949, the states employing these tactics continue to claim that the resulting famines are either nonexistent, or unintended consequences of lawful actions against enemy combatants. Although it is unlikely to help the Palestinians' plight, the arrest warrants against Israeli leaders marks a small but important legal watershed, potentially clarifying and even lowering the threshold needed to prove intent in future prosecutions, whether in domestic or international courts. The recent arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in The Hague suggests that such efforts are not necessarily in vain.

The timing of the ICC's decision is important, as it coincided not only with growing alarm over the threat of mass famine in northern Gaza but also with a critical long-term shift in global attitudes toward the use of starvation as a weapon. Certainly, the tactic remains entangled with the strategic priorities of the world's most powerful states, with China preparing for a potential strangulation blockade of Taiwan and the U.S. Department of Defense continuing to accept starvation sieges as potentially legal methods of warfare against enemy combatants. Since the late 1990s, however, progressive lawyers, nongovernmental organizations, and other activist forces have pressed both states and courts to stigmatize starvation campaigns, and recent conflicts have highlighted their unacceptable civilian costs.

Now, the ICC case against Israel—and the implication that even powerful allies of the West can be held to account—puts these changing global norms to the test. In late April, The Guardian reported that Khan, the ICC prosecutor, has applied for additional arrest warrants against Israeli officials, suggesting the case may broaden further. As major European powers seek to rapidly augment their defense capabilities in a world in which the U.S. defense umbrella is no longer assured, their governments face a choice: they can either enforce the international principles they so often champion or abandon their claim to moral leadership. Just as crucially, major states in the global South that have long and rightly criticized international courts for targeting only non-Western actors and outright adversaries of the West must now step up. If these states wish to reclaim the mantle of defending international law, they must back the efforts of the ICC and the ICJ not just in word but in deed. Otherwise, the two courts and the international rules they seek to enforce may be consigned to irrelevance.

Live Updates


• Economy goes into reverse: The US economy just had its worst quarter since 2022 as President Donald Trump's tariff spree has unnerved consumers and businesses. During a Cabinet meeting, Trump defended his economic policies after claiming earlier that the negative report isn't related to tariffs but instead former President Joe Biden's fault. Trump will be hosting prominent CEOs later today.
    


• Immigration: Trump hailed hardline immigration policies as a signature accomplishment of the first 100 days of his second term. But a CNN poll released today found a rising share of Americans say that Trump's deportation policies have gone too far.
    


• Ukraine: Kyiv expects to sign a natural resources deal with the US today, a source told CNN. The two countries have been trying to hammer out an agreement, which Trump has largely billed as Ukraine “paying back” for aid provided to fight back against Russia's full-scale invasion.
    


            The agency charged with policing federal campaign finance laws is losing its enforcement and policy-making powers with the resignation of a Republican commissioner.
    


            Allen Dickerson's departure today — combined with President Donald Trump's February firing of long-serving Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub — leaves the Federal Election Commission (FEC) with just three members and lacking a quorum. The six-member commission needs at least four members to pursue high-level business. Another commissioner, Republican Sean Cooksey, resigned in January.
    


            Dickerson announced his resignation during an open meeting of the panel today. His four-year term expires this week. But previously some FEC commissioners, including Weintraub, had remained with the agency well after the expiration of their terms.
    


            The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about Trump's timeline for nominating replacements to the FEC, which operates with three commissioners from each party. The posts require Senate confirmation.
    


            The FEC, which often gridlocks along partisan lines, has lost its enforcement ability several times before, including for monthslong periods during the 2020 presidential campaign.
    


            A legal battle is ongoing over Trump's effort to shape the agency's decision-making. In February, he issued a sweeping executive order mandating White House review of regulations at the FEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other independent agencies, as he advances a controversial theory that presidents should have near-complete control over the executive branch.
    


            The order also bars any employee of the executive branch from interpreting laws in a way that “contravenes” the views of the president or the attorney general.
    


            The Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional campaign arms have filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's order, arguing his move imperils fair elections and could allow Trump to determine the outcome of FEC complaints against Democrats.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced new US sanctions on Iran's energy sector amid ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to reach a nuclear deal with Tehran.
    


            “The President is committed to driving Iran's illicit oil and petrochemical exports — including exports to China — to zero under his maximum pressure campaign,” Rubio said in a statement.
    


            The sanctions target seven entities engaged in the trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products and identify two ships that are part of a sanctioned marine management company that has played a key role in the Iranian crude energy supply chain. Five of the entities are based in the United Arab Emirates, according to a fact sheet from the department.
    


            “So long as Iran attempts to generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, and support its terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will take steps to hold both Iran and all its partners engaged in sanctions evasion accountable,” Rubio said.
    


Where talks stand: Leaders from the United States and Iran painted a positive but cautious picture of progress made in talks between the nations over Iran's nuclear program on Saturday, after the third phase of the discussions wrapped up in Oman. Further talks are expected, but have not been formally announced.
    


            A last-minute disagreement appears to be threatening to derail the minerals deal that the United States and Ukraine were hoping to sign today.
    


            According to US and Ukrainian sources familiar with each country's positions, the disagreement boils down to which documents are meant to be signed today.
    


            Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said earlier Ukraine was ready to sign the deal, and then continue to work with the US to “finalize” two “technical documents” outlining the details of the deal at a later date.
    


            A source familiar with the Ukrainian position said that while the US “offered” to sign all three documents today, Ukraine believed more work was needed on the technical side.
    


            Meanwhile, a source familiar with the US position told CNN that all three documents needed to be signed today, and that the Ukrainians were trying to reopen terms which have already been agreed upon as part of the package.
    


            As some Senate Republicans insisted that today's dismal economic report is indicative of former President Joe Biden's economic policies — not President Donald Trump's — one Democratic senator told CNN that it is “wishful thinking.”
    


                    “The person who is president of the United States bears the burden of what the economy is doing, or the benefit of what it's doing,” Vermont Sen. Peter Welch said.
                





            “These tariffs are a disaster. They serve no positive purpose at all, and there's a lot of hesitation on the part of many of my Republican colleagues because of the power of Trump,” he added. “But at a certain point they're going to be listening to the power of their constituents who want no more tariffs.”
    


            GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis argued that “you can't blame it all on Biden, but you can't blame it all on Trump either.”
    


            “We're at a transition point,” she continued. “It's going to be a bumpy ride. We need to stay the course. We need to give the President a chance to get reciprocal tariffs in line country by country.”
    


            Asked whether the report is a sign that the administration needs to change their policies, Lummis encouraged them to stay the course. “It's too early, I think, to change the economic plans,” she said.
    


            Two Republican senators — Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins — said they plan to vote in favor of effectively block President Donald Trump's tariffs today.
    


            It's a sign that GOP Sen. Rand Paul's resolution to revoke the emergency order Trump is using to enact his trade policy will likely have enough Republican votes to pass in the Senate.
    


                    “I am, yeah,” Murkowski said when asked by CNN's Manu Raju if she'll support Paul's resolution.
                





            Collins also told CNN “that is my intention” when asked if she would vote for the measure.
    


            Even if the resolution passes in the Senate, it is essentially dead-on-arrival in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson moved earlier this month to block such resolutions by inserting language in a recently adopted House rule to protect Trump's tariffs.
    


            Other Republican senators acknowledged the toll Trump's tariff policies are having as the US GDP contracted in the first quarter, but urged patience and argued Trump could turn the economy around by midterm elections next year.
    


Here's what some are saying:



            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting that “American families are finding their financial footing again.”
    


            However, recent economic surveys suggest otherwise.
    


            Consumer confidence sank to the lowest level this month since 2020, the Conference Board reported earlier this week. The survey also pointed to consumers' dismal expectations regarding future employment prospects and income levels.
    


            “Consumers explicitly mentioned concerns about tariffs increasing prices and having negative impacts on the economy,” the Conference Board said in its report released Tuesday. It also noted that “while the majority complained about the high cost of living, there were also some references to declines in the prices of gas and some food items.”
    


            The Conference Board's survey data echoes the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index, which fell 8% in April compared to the prior month.
    


            “While this month's deterioration was particularly strong for middle-income families, expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation,” Joanne Hsu, the survey's director, said in a release.
    


            President Donald Trump touted Republican efforts in Congress to help pass his “one big beautiful bill” that he claims will result in the biggest tax cut in US history, during a meeting with Cabinet members at the White House today.
    


            He said that one the biggest items his administration is working on, “maybe bigger than tariffs in a certain sense,” is the sweeping legislative agenda that is “wielding its way right now through the Senate.”
    


            Trump praised the efforts of Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson and their “unified attack” in trying to get his sweeping legislation through.
    


                     “We have to attack because the Democrats are trying to stop it at every-every turn. It would mean a 58% tax hike if they were successful and lots of other bad things beyond the tax hike, but with us it'll be the biggest tax cut in American history,” the president claimed.
                





            President Donald Trump said China's economy is “doing very poorly right now” because of the 145% tariffs he enacted.
    


            His comments, made during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, came after a report released earlier in the day showed China's factory activity contracted this month at its fastest pace in 16 months. “I just saw some reports coming out, and I don't want that to happen to China,” Trump said. “I was actually saddened to hear it.”
    


            A senior statistician at China's National Bureau of Statistics said the decline in factory orders was due to “sharp changes in the external environment and other factors.”
    


            Additionally, various recent cargo data points to a sharp decline in shipments of goods from China to the United States as well as some container ships returning to China without unloading goods. For instance, Flexport, a cargo logistics company, reported recently that bookings from China to the US are down around 60% since 145% tariffs went into effect.
    


            “At a certain point, I hope we're going to make a deal with China. We're talking to China,” Trump said. Beijing, however, recently denied that such talks are occurring.
    


            The United States is ready to sign a natural resources agreement with Ukraine as early as Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the discussions, but it is contingent on the Ukrainians living up to the memorandum of intent signed earlier this month.
    


            Ukrainians are trying to reopen terms on a variety of points, the source said, but final technical documents were already agreed to between the US and Ukraine over the weekend, which the source said included transparency and accountability measures. 



            That version of events does not align with comments made by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal earlier on Wednesday. He said the “last details” were still being finalized.
    


            CNN is seeking a comment from the Ukrainian government. A memorandum of intent that was signed by the US and Ukraine seen by CNN does not include explicit mention of transparency and accountability measures.
    


More on minerals deal: The sticking points, according to the source familiar, are on the governance of the joint investment fund between the US and Ukraine and making sure all funds are fully traceable. The source added that US and Ukrainian teams were up until 1:30 a.m. early Wednesday morning after staying up late over the weekend to finalize documents.
    


            Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic minister, was told not to travel to the US unless the agreements were finalized, the source said. As CNN reported earlier Wednesday, Shmyhal told Ukrainian television that Svyrydenko was on her way to Washington.
    


            The Trump administration on Wednesday stressed its readiness to secure a deal quickly.
    


            “President Trump has said that the time to get this done is now, and we are moving with all deliberate speed towards this end. The United States is committed to the quick conclusion of this vital agreement, and to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine,” a US Treasury spokesperson told CNN.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele have been directly in touch about the detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the US mistakenly deported to El Salvador's notorious mega prison, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.
    


            A US official told CNN the Trump administration has been working closely with El Salvador and asked for Abrego Garcia's return but insisted that Bukele has made clear that he's not returning him to the US, citing an Oval Office meeting between Bukele and President Donald Trump this month.
    


More on the case: The secretive seven-day pause in Abrego Garcia's court case last week arose because a diplomatic resolution had become a possibility, according to other sources familiar with the matter. That pause expires Wednesday afternoon, a federal judge ruled.
    


            Yet it is unclear what the goal of the discussions was, however, as multiple officials tell CNN the Trump administration is not seeking to return Abrego Garcia to the US or grant him any additional due process in either country.
    


            Abrego Garcia has been moved from CECOT, officially known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, to another facility in El Salvador, but there have otherwise been few public developments in the high-stakes case.
    


            At Cabinet meetings, President Donald Trump typically gives his Cabinet members time to speak about their accomplishments and what they're up to at their individual agencies. This time, Trump tossed first to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, poking fun at some of the controversy that has swirled around the Pentagon.
    


            “I can start with Pete on the left, because he's my least controversial person in the cabinet,” Trump said as the room broke out in laughs.
    


            Giving Hegseth a friendly pat on the back, Trump added, “They don't know how good he is.”
    


            Hegseth's job is “safe,” Trump recently said in an interview with The Atlantic, after the defense secretary came under fire over reports he discussed military plans in a second Signal group chat that included his wife and brother.
    


            As CNN previously reported, some of Hegseth's former employees described “chaos” at the Pentagon under Hegseth's leadership.
    


            “It's been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Hegseth's former spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN.
    


            President Donald Trump is participating in a Cabinet meeting at the White House.
    


            The meeting comes just hours after the Commerce Department showed in a report that the US economy had its worst quarter since 2022 as Trump's significant policy changes unnerved consumers and businesses.
    


            The event also comes after Trump touted his record at a rally in Michigan last night, where he declared that he had just completed the “the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country.”
    


            Later this afternoon, as CNN previously reported, the White House will host prominent CEOs as the administration showcases investments made in the US during Trump's first 100 days in office.
    


            Among the prominent business leaders invited to the event are NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, GE Aerospace CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks and SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son.
    


            The event is aimed at highlighting the administration's work to attract investments and to encourage further commitments from other major companies, said a White House official earlier this week.
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo contributed reporting to this post. 



            GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin voiced uneasiness with the state of the economy after the US gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter of Donald Trump's presidency.
    


Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, told CNN that “we've got to get GDP growth going in the right direction.”
    


            Pressed on the impact for Republicans if economic turmoil continues, Tillis argued that the Trump agenda bill, including sweeping tax cuts, that GOP lawmakers are hoping to pass this summer could help get things back on track.
    


                    “Clearly, if we have this kind of froth this time next year, then it's a real challenge for Republicans. But I believe if we pass the TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) in a substantially similar form, and then we settle down the tariffs and get some of the deals, then we get the economy back on track. But you can't look at this today and recognize it for anything other than being unacceptable,” he said.
                





Johnson, who has expressed concerns about the impact of tariffs on his state, said “not good” when asked by CNN about the GDP contraction.
    


            Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's ready to give the Trump administration room to find a successful path forward on tariffs and downplayed the GDP news.
    


            Thune, who like many Republicans has long opposed tariffs, also pointed to the massive budget reconciliation bill the GOP is trying to pass in the near future as something that would boost the economy.
    


CNN's Ted Barrett contributed reporting to this post. 



            Senate Appropriations chair, Susan Collins, is breaking with the Trump administration over its handling of federal biomedical research.
    


            The Maine Republican on Wednesday criticized the administration's moves to slash funding, layoff federal health officials and cancel medical research grants, warning that the shakeups could undercut scientific progress.
    


                    “Proposed funding cuts, the firing of essential federal scientists, and policy uncertainties threaten to undermine the foundation for our nation's global leadership,” Collins said during a committee hearing on biomedical innovation.
                





            Those actions put US dominance in biomedical innovation “at real risk and must be reversed,” she added.
    


            Several Republicans, including Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chair Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, have expressed concerns about funding cuts, particularly to state universities dependent on National Institutes of Health grants for key medical research.
    


More context: Directors of research centers in both Maine and Alabama testified at the Wednesday hearing. Collins noted that in Maine alone, NIH grants and contracts support nearly 1,500 jobs and $286 million in “economic activity.”
    


            Besides mass layoffs, NIH has cancelled roughly 780 research grants totaling more than $2 billion. The administration is mulling a proposal to slash NIH's budget by up to 40% next year.
    


                    “But we must not lose sight at what is truly at stake here,” Collins told the committee. “If clinical trials are halted, research is stopped, and laboratories are closed, effective treatments and cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, Type I diabetes, childhood cancers, and Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy, will be delayed or not discovered at all.”
                





            Peter Navarro, special counselor to the president, attempted to spin the GDP report as “very positive news” for Americans on Wednesday morning, touting how tariffs are driving a “tremendous amount” of domestic investment.
    


            “This was the best negative print, as they say in the trade, for GDP I have ever seen in my life. It really should be very positive news for America,” Navarro told reporters at the White House.
    


            While consumer spending slowed, businesses increased spending, as CNN reported, likely to get ahead of price increases due to tariffs. But the US economy saw its worst quarter since 2022, according to a new GDP report from the Commerce Department, registering at a rate of -0.3%. The Dow was down 700 points, or 1.73%, Wednesday morning. The S&P 500 fell 2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.5%.
    


                    “We've seen amidst the media barrage against the Trump tariffs and warnings and all of that, a slight deterioration of consumer sentiment and to a certain extent, business sentiment. That's what we call soft data. But when you look at the hard data, all we're seeing is good, strong news,” Navarro said.
                





            CNN asked Navarro why, if the reports are good news, President Donald Trump tried to blame former President Joe Biden for an “Overhang” and leaving “us with bad numbers” in a social media post Wednesday morning.
    


            “There's two things going on here,” Navarro said. “We inherited a tremendously bad set of economic policies from Joe Biden. The fruit of that ‘poison Biden tree' is a series of spending bills which have drawn our debt far over a fiscal cliff and we're trying to bring that back with the tax bill and the reorientation of spending.”
    


            Recent analysis of congressional Republicans' tax bill suggest it would add trillions of dollars to the deficit over a decade, even with the potential spending cuts being pushed by party leadership.
    


            Asked about trade deals, Navarro said: “Deals are coming, just be patient,” as he walked toward the West Wing.
    


            Inflation slowed sharply in March, moving closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, while consumer spending continued to fuel the economy.
    


            The latest data lands at a time when uncertainty is swelling about the extent to which President Donald Trump's massive policy moves — including a broad suite of tariffs — could upend the economy.
    


            Today's report from the Commerce Department showed that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose 2.3% in March from the year before, slower from February's 2.7% increase. On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged, versus 0.4% in February.
    


            Economists expected the PCE price index to have cooled to 2.2% annually in March.
    


            Consumer spending rose 0.7% from February, marking a sharp acceleration from 0.1%.
    


            President Donald Trump shifted the blame for the US economy posting its worst quarter since 2022 to former President Joe Biden, saying it has “NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS.”
    


            The GDP report released by Trump's administration today, which registered at -0.3% in the first quarter, sent US futures falling. It's a sharp slowdown from 2024's fourth quarter 2.4% rate. Most economists say Trump's monumental bid to reshape global trade is likely to send inflation climbing in the US and could even trigger a recession.
    


            But Trump, who has continuously denied that his tariffs would have an overall negative impact on the economy, tried to pass the buck to Biden.
    


                    “This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.' This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            On his 101st day in office, Trump urged Americans to “BE PATIENT!!!”
    


            As CNN reported, the Dow is on a six-day winning streak, its longest continuous rally since July. Yet the blue-chip index is on track to finish down 3.5% on the month because the stock market has been recovering from a steep slump caused by Trump's tariffs.
    


            The S&P 500 dropped more than 11% in the first eight days of the month as Trump on April 2 unveiled his so-called reciprocal tariffs. The Dow was down 400 points, or 1%, Wednesday morning. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2%.
    


            While the latest GDP report points to a much weaker economy compared to last year, that doesn't necessarily mean Americans are in the throes of a recession just yet.
    


            A recession is technically defined as a broad-based contraction in the economy — encompassing the labor market, consumer spending, industrial activity and business investment — that lasts for more than a few months. And even though it may feel like there is a recession, according to polls and surveys, the economy remains in good shape on a few important fronts.
    


            Unemployment remains relatively low — 4.2% as of March — businesses are continuing to invest in their operations and consumers haven't retreated with their spending in any meaningful way just yet, government data shows.
    


            A rule of thumb for defining a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, which also hasn't happened yet. The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official recession arbiter, though the group's call can come many months after a recession has officially started.
    


Remember: The last time the US economy was in a recession was in 2020, which lasted just two months and was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Before that, it was the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 through June 2009 and was the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.
    


            The US economy just had its worst quarter since 2022 as President Donald Trump's significant policy changes unnerved consumers and businesses.
    


            Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department.
    


            That's a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's 2.4% rate.The Trump administration has been on a chaotic tariff spree over the past several months, escalating trade tensions with China and unsettling Americans.
    


            Most economists say Trump's monumental bid to reshape global trade is likely to send inflation climbing in the United States and could even trigger a recession.
    


Ukraine is expecting to sign a natural resources deal with the United States on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko will be in the US to sign the document, the source added.
    


            The news of the deal being signed as early as Wednesday was first reported by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.
    


More on the deal: The US and Ukraine have been trying to hammer out a natural resources agreement that would give Washington access to Kyiv's untapped mineral riches in exchange for investment since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
    


            CNN has reached out to the US Treasury and the White House for comment.
    


            Trump has largely billed the agreement as Ukraine “paying back” for the aid the US has provided to Ukraine since Russia launched its unprovoked full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
    


            The details of the agreement have not been made public. However, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sunday that the deal “will not include assistance provided before its signing.”

            A rising share of Americans say that President Donald Trump's deportation policies have gone too far, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds.
    


            Just over half, 52%, say Trump has gone too far in deporting undocumented immigrants, up from 45% in February. A similar 52% now say that Trump's immigration policies have not made the US safer. And most, 57%, say that they do not believe the federal government is being careful in following the law while carrying out deportations.
    


            Trump's numbers on immigration remain stronger than his approval rating overall or on the economy – a different dynamic from his first term, when it was among his weakest issues. But the latest data suggests that, as the White House begins to implement its immigration agenda, a number of those moves have proved unpopular. The administration's push to revoke the visas of some international students, for instance, draws 2-to-1 opposition, while moving troops to the southern border garners more supportive reactions.

            President Donald Trump marked his 100th day in office yesterday with events in Michigan and ABC airing a taped interview.
    


            At a rally last night, Trump said his immigration crackdown was a signature achievement of his second term. He also hailed his retribution against his political enemies and targeting of “woke” policies.

            President Donald Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that he could secure the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month but refuses to do so.
    


            The comments appear to contradict previous remarks made by him and his top aides who say the US does not have the ability to return Abrego Garcia because he is in the custody of a foreign government, despite the Supreme Court's ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return.
    


            “You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk,” ABC News' Terry Moran, said to Trump during an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday night.
    


            “I could,” Trump replied.
    


            Pointing to the phone, Moran said: “You could pick it up and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the President of El Salvador and say, ‘Send him back.'”
    


            “And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” the president added. “But he is not.”
    


            “I'm not the one making this decision,” Trump said, adding that he says government lawyers do not want to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the US.

How the deportation of a Salvadoran man has become a hinge point in US history



            The administration admitted in court last month that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, was deported because of an administrative error, ignoring a judge's 2019 ruling that he couldn't be sent back to his native El Salvador, where his life could be in danger.
    


            US officials, however, have since refused to return Abrego Garcia to the US, arguing they lack power to force El Salvador to do so.
    


            “That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters earlier in April.
    


            Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a recent meeting with Trump that his administration isn't “very fond of releasing terrorists” detained in his country and vowed to keep Abrego Garcia in prison.
    


            Abrego Garcia entered the US illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 withheld his removal, citing concerns for his safety. That meant he could not be deported to El Salvador but could be deported to another country. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            US officials detained the father of three on March 12 and deported him after alleging that he was confirmed to be a member of MS-13 by a “reliable source.”
    


            The Trump administration has designated the MS-13 gang as a foreign terrorist organization. Abrego Garcia and his wife, however, dispute the claim and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward it.



            “This is a MS-13 gang member,” Trump again said in the ABC interview, citing Abrego Garcia's tattooed hands which contain skulls covering their eyes, ears and mouth, which a police document described as “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.”
    


            “He said he wasn't a member of a gang. And then they looked on his knuckles, he had MS-13,” Trump said, claiming Abrego Garcia's knuckles displayed the name of the gang.
    


            Moran responded that the Maryland man “had some tattoos that are interpreted that way” and that the numbers and letters were “photoshopped.”
    


            Trump repeatedly argued, however, in response that a photo that was posted on Truth Social of Abrego Garcia's knuckles was not photoshopped, while criticizing the ABC News journalist, telling Moran at one point, “No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted.”
    


            The online photo displayed Abrego Garcia's tattooed knuckles with the letters and numbers of the gang above each tattoo and was altered to show the correlation of each tattoo to what the Trump administration says relates him to the name of the gang.
    


            Experts have cast doubt over whether Abrego Garcia's tattoos prove gang ties.
    


            The judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case said last Tuesday that the Trump administration was not acting in “good faith” and accused officials of intentional noncompliance with their obligation to produce information.

            JB Pritzker greeted Rep. Maggie Goodlander with a joke. Answering his own question about how the New Hampshire congresswoman's first few months in office have been, the Illinois governor laughed: “Awful, right?” But the conversation immediately became a mini-huddle about the debates they've each been having with friends at law firms over conceding to President Donald Trump's demands and the conversation Pritzker had with his sister, Penny, as she leads the Harvard Corporation in its own fight.
    


            “This is the way the world ends,” Goodlander said, after they turned and smiled for their photo.
    


            Pritzker raised his eyebrows, clenched his lips together in a grimace that looked like he was maybe about to blow a trumpet and gave a slight nod.
    


            He has been making that face a lot these days.
    


            “There is certain momentum where people are now feeling like — well, the politicians are feeling like, ‘Oh there's a political reason why I should now speak out and be a fighter.' I don't care why you're joining the fight at this point, we just need everybody out there, right?” Pritzker told CNN in an interview a few minutes later. “And then there are others who are joining the fight because they're coming to a real realization that, ‘This is much worse than I thought it would be and it's getting worse.' And then I look at some of the people who have capitulated and I wonder in the end, is this how you want people to think of you?”

            There was nothing subtle about Pritzker's trip to New Hampshire, the state where politicians go to spark chatter about potential presidential runs. Nor was there much subtlety with his intense speech chiding his own party for “simpering timidity” and demanding a stronger, prouder response to what he sees as the “tyrants and traitors” among the Republicans, woven with lines designed to be easily clipped on social media.
    


            All that, along with Pritzker's speeches comparing Trump to the rise of Nazis and the governor's calendar of similar Democratic event appearances  around the country are the visible, visceral part of what he's doing to push his party now and stoke talk about 2028, even as he repeats that Democrats should focus on the 2026 elections.
    


            Pritzker and his team are making a bet about where the country is, and where it's going. The existential bet is that things are going to get much darker and more authoritarian. The political bet is that Democrats will remember deep in their cores who was out front first.
    


            As a man who was one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors long before he was a governor bracing his state against Trump's actions or a potential presidential hopeful, Pritzker is in a unique spot. Most expect if he runs in 2028 he would largely self-fund his campaign, as he has done in Illinois. The Hyatt hotel fortune made the family so rich that several heirs are billionaires.
    


            Now, on top of his official duties, his days can range from calling up Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler to say he hadn't seen enough yard signs while driving through his neighboring state and asking how much money they needed to fix that, to calling executives he knows from before his time in office to urge them to think how history will see their administration-friendly moves now, to calling Maine Gov. Janet Mills after the president threatened to strip funding from her state during an event at the White House in February.
    


            The Democratic Governors Association's aghast statement after Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was because Pritzker, along with frequent phone buddy Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, insisted on it, according to aides to both. Pritzker and his aides are initiating calls to other governors, state legislators and activists urging them to follow Illinois' lead in anticipating Trump's next moves.

            Pritzker has his own plane, so it wasn't travel logistics that kept him from this year's National Governors Association meeting in February in Washington, but an unspoken statement about how feckless he has found the Republicans in the group in standing up for their states against Trump and how disappointingly docile he has found too many of his fellow Democrats.
    


            In the interview, Pritzker compared this moment in America to what he sees walking through the exhibits of the Holocaust museum he helped get built outside Chicago. He likened it to the point when Nazis were on the rise, everyone was writing them off and only looking back “where you can feel, you know it, you can see and absorb what was happening in 1933, 1934.”
    


            Others, including fellow governors, see opportunism, or at least the convenient freedom that he has as a rich man in a solidly blue state so comfortable in his standing and wealth that he spent millions in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary to get a weaker candidate he could run up the score on. Unlimited money means unlimited new groups and organizations he can fund that don't do much except provide new avenues for press releases and TV bookings.
    


            Now Pritzker's Think Big PAC, formed after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision to boost abortion protection ballot measures across the country, is preparing to expand both geographically and on issues, with plans to support efforts to protect Medicaid and Head Start programs, according to people familiar with the plans.
    


            “The people who are fighting against the things that are so important to working families and the fundamental values of Democrats have all the money, or most of it,” Pritzker said. “And so when I have an opportunity, I step up.”
    


            His fortune means Pritzker has the dollars, but also the entre with other major donors to serve as a sort of angel investor in ways that are known among Democratic insiders but not immediately apparent. Sometimes that's through drawing attention by news of where he's weighing in. Sometimes it's through organizing calls with others in their own mansions to say where he's giving to prod them to match.
    


            Stacy Pearson, an Arizona consultant who helped run last year's successful campaign to pass abortion protections in the state, told CNN that unlike other big donors who have not actually helped, Pritzker's efforts were so quietly strategic — ranging from chipping in for the legal fees to secure the initiative's spot on the ballot to subsidizing outreach and ads — that she found herself telling the governor right before the election that she couldn't figure out how they'd efficiently spend whatever else he was offering.
    


            “No one ever tells me,” Pearson remembers Pritzker saying with a big laugh, “they don't need more of my money.”
    


            Yet Pritzker is in a party where attacking Elon Musk can seem at times just as popular as attacking Trump, where independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been drawing massive crowds around the country for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and where several operatives already sizing up the prospective presidential field told CNN they're looking forward to making Pritzker's bank account his main weakness.
    


            “The terms that the people use, ‘oligarchs' and ‘billionaires' and whatever, they're talking about values,” Pritzker said. “It's shorthand for everybody to use these words. And I have used the word oligarch, because I think people have looked at like the four tech titans who were sitting next to Trump at the inauguration, and just said, ‘Well, those are the oligarchs.' I think it's an easy word for people to use. I don't take it as an offense to me.”
    


            Asked what he thinks of those who are just suspicious of rich people, Pritzker said, “I get it.”

            That's why, Pritzker said, he spent so much time traveling his state in his first run for governor and participating in dozens of debates and forums, so that “by the end, I think what people said is, ‘He's a normal guy and he cares about people like me.'”
    


            At least in the room on Sunday night in Manchester, that was the feeling many left with.
    


            “I know Pritzker is a billionaire, but I also know he has been consistent in how he's spoken,” said Liz Kotowski, a retired environmental works employee from Manchester.
    


            “If you can't see the difference between JB Pritzker and Elon Musk, you're not listening,” said Lucas Coriaty, a 23-year-old who came from the University of New Hampshire and waited half an hour after the speech to take a selfie and tell the governor he felt inspired.
    


            One measure of the political moment and how Pritzker has placed himself in it: His call for mass protests and disruptions lit up Democrats online and top MAGA personalities, who quickly accused him of an incitement toward violence that was not, in fact, in his carefully worded speech.
    


            Also reposting video from that moment of the speech: Ocasio-Cortez.
    


            Part of Pritzker's speech in New Hampshire included blasting Trump for subverting Jewish values in the name of combatting antisemitism through the administration's war with elite universities. This is less from being an active member of his synagogue than from reading his great-grandfather's book.
    


            Every Pritzker gets a copy at 13 years old — a bar or bat mitzvah present for those in the family who have them, or just a birthday present. It's the story of escaping pogroms in Ukraine, of arriving penniless as a refugee, of sleeping on the streets and then of starting what would become one of America's biggest family fortunes.
    


            Pritzker didn't really read much of it when he was 13. He's read it several times since. Now he keeps one copy on the shelf in his home office, another on a shelf in his gubernatorial office.

            “It's our family ethos that's kind of wrapped up in this thing. He was an enormously ethical person who cared deeply about this country and the fact that we were really saved by this country had we not had the ability to have safety and security. And the ability to thrive.”
    


            Pritzker has clocked how New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who set out to charm Trump over dinners at the president's Bedminster golf club during the height of Covid-19 and was one of the first to call the president after last year's assassination attempt, still ended up with Trump's former lawyer — via her new perch as an interim US attorney — investigating him over his handling of immigration enforcement. Or that Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, fiercely loyal since she was Trump's press secretary, had to go public after being denied federal recovery aid following recent storms in her state.
    


            “He's vindictive to every state, it appears to me. Yes, he doesn't like his enemies and he goes after his enemies. But I was going to suffer that either way,” Pritzker said. “It's not like he hasn't had words about Chicago.”
    


            In 2017, at the same New Hampshire Democrats dinner on the last Sunday in April, at the same Manchester hotel, Joe Biden was the featured speaker. He also gave a speech urging Trump-stunned Democrats to rediscover themselves, then declared into the microphone, “I'm not running.”
    


            Pritzker didn't bother with a line he knows isn't true, though in the interview before the speech he stuck to saying he hasn't even decided whether to launch the campaign for a third term as governor that aides are already planning, teasing more speeches around the country, and giving on-brand line: “This is a time for people to stand up and fight.”
    


            Several party operatives working their way around the weekend's White House Correspondents' Dinner events were gaming when to reach out about signing up with him, while focus group research has already quietly been passed around about whether the governor's weight is a positive or negative with voters, according to people who've seen the findings.
    


            The Democratic diehards in the longtime first-primary state on Sunday night responded with a 40-minute clump waiting to thank Pritzker and take their own photos, or to lean in with a version of how state Rep. Zoe Manos said goodbye: “When are you coming back again?”

            Donald Trump was supposed to destroy establishment centrists with an anti-woke global populist revolt. But his wild second presidency may be doing the opposite.
    


            Many Western democracies are experiencing the same intractable political issues that lifted Trump to his stunning electoral comeback last year, including high prices, affordable housing crises and difficulties controlling their borders.
    


            So not long ago, Trump's 2024 blueprint looked like a roadmap for populists everywhere. But his power grabs, attacks on US allies and tariff wars have swiftly brewed resentment. Foreigners might be cynical about their own leaders, but many look at Americans and think, “We don't want what you've got.”
    


            That's why Mark Carney is still prime minister of Canada.
    


            The Liberals' late sub-in is celebrating an astonishing election victory after pulling his party from 25 points behind in a couple of months. But he wouldn't even be in politics if it weren't for Trump, whose demands that Canada become the 51st US state and tariffs that could be existential for its economy doomed the opposition.
    


            “The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has echoed a lot of Trump's language for years,” said Matthew Lebo, a political scientist at Western University, Ontario. “To sound Trumpy at a moment when all of Canada's attention turns to Donald Trump and sees the damage of it – it was just awful timing for Poilievre.”
    


            Trump might be the scourge of globalists. But you don't get much more establishment than a prime minister who studied at Harvard and Oxford and ran two central banks. “Mark Carney just looked made for this moment,” Lebo said.
    


            The next chance for an anti-Trump wave is in Australia, which holds a general election this weekend. Weeks ago, Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seemed headed for defeat. But he's surged in the polls amid fury among voters over US tariffs, and the opposition conservative coalition, led by Peter Dutton, another anti-woke culture warrior, has stalled.
    


            It's impossible to predict what voters might decide. But if Albanese's once-unpopular government survives, Dutton will face the same questions about political positioning as Poilievre. (Impressions that Dutton is accident-prone solidified early in the campaign after he punted an Australian football at a cameraman's head during a disastrous photo-op.)
    


            Even leaders who aren't facing elections have had to recalibrate to deal with Trump's raucous second term. The US president is deeply disliked abroad, and his bombast and insults have fostered anti-Americanism that creates dilemmas for leaders who must deal with him.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for instance, struggled for traction after his landslide election victory last year. But his approval spiked over his unflappable dealings with the Trump and support for Ukraine as the US began to turn its back. Still, Starmer's greatest test lies ahead, with the president's state visit with King Charles III looming – an act of flattery by pageantry that many Britons oppose.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron has been struggling almost since his reelection win and was instrumental in the collapse of his own government after disastrously calling National Assembly elections last year. But suddenly he looks prescient. He's been warning for years that Europe needs to take care of its own defense needs – and Trump's attacks on allies have allowed him to relaunch his perennial unofficial campaign to be the EU's indispensable leader.
    


            Germany's elections earlier this year seemed to buck the trend, since the far-right populist AfD party doubled its vote share after being openly backed by Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk. Still, some analysts believe that alarm among voters about a US-style right-wing tide put a ceiling on the AfD's rise.
    


            Elsewhere in Europe, Trump's “America first” attitude has changed the game for right-wing parties that look to him for inspiration. Anger over tariffs could blunt far-right leader Marine Le Pen's bid to use Trump-style tactics to brand her conviction for embezzlement as election meddling ahead of France's 2027 presidential vote.
    


            Even Brexit architect Nigel Farage, who critics accuse of spending more time at Mar-a-Lago than with his constituency in a faded English seaside town, distanced himself from Trump's Ukraine policy. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose anti-democratic playbook made him a MAGA hero, is increasingly unpopular ahead of elections next year.
    


            Populists aren't on the retreat everywhere. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who won office on Trump-style immigration policies, remains popular and is promoting herself as a bridge between her friend in the Oval Office and Europe. She pulled off a consummate balancing act during a Washington visit this month.
    


            More broadly, Trump's sudden political earthquakes are looming over other campaigns. Both South Korea and Japan have key elections this year that will be shaped by the trade wars. Leaders of both US allies are under pressure to do quick deals to mitigate economic damage that could hurt their voters.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday rejected the idea that Japan's general election in July and South Korea's presidential vote in June will clog up talks on trade deals Trump needs to show his strategy is working.
    


            “I think from our talks that these governments actually want to have the framework of a trade deal done before they go into elections to show that they have successfully negotiated with the United States,” Bessent said.
    


            “So we are finding that they are actually much more keen to come to the table, get this done, and then go home and campaign on it.”
    


            That's one way of looking at it. But trade deals involve painful compromises that can alienate key voting blocs – hardly what politicians need before tough elections. This could also limit the scope of agreements that Trump insists will include spectacular concessions to the US.
    


            Carney knows what got him elected. And he's not letting up.
    


            “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” he warned. “But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never, that will never ever happen.”
    


            His crowd cheered. But his words pose a question that applies not just to Canada but to other foreign democracies. Will an anti-Trump message work as long as the 47th president stays in the White House?
    


            It might, since there's no sign Trump will tone down his act. But the world is full of disgruntled electorates and the West has deep political problems. In fact, voters repeatedly send clear messages that they want change, but their new governments often struggle to deliver. And big political wins can quickly fade under the weight of intractable issues – just ask Starmer.
    


            The heat on Carney to deliver is immense.
    


            He must defuse the trade war with Trump, which threatens to cause an economic crisis and destroy millions of Canadian jobs. He must find new markets and revenues for his country now that the US is no longer a reliable partner. And he's under pressure to finally get Canada up to NATO spending minimums.
    


            And voters will sooner or later demand progress on other issues – health care, housing, high prices, homelessness, substance abuse and unemployment. And the prime minister doesn't have much room to maneuver.
    


            Voters might have picked him as the best bet to stand up to Trump. But they didn't hand him a wide mandate, saddling him instead with a minority government. He'll need smaller parties to pass legislation that could entail tough political choices. This is an inherently unstable situation in which to build trust and a record that could convince voters in a few years to hand him a majority.

            And while they were stung by defeat, Conservatives weren't wiped out. Their promises to fight crime and lower taxes resonated with some voters, and they may fancy their chances of winning in a few years – perhaps under a new leader like Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who's a populist himself but made the wise choice to confront Trump rather than trying to emulate him.
    


            Carney's Liberals understand they need to demonstrate change. They appeased angry voters by brutally ditching unpopular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a desperate Hail Mary to keep power. They picked a non-politician in Carney to lead them. And as soon as he was interim leader, he jettisoned Trudeau's most unpopular positions, including a carbon tax. This removed one of Poilievre's best arguments.
    


            But in an era of grumpy voters and leaders struggling to deliver, even big electoral wins don't guarantee success.



            America, after all, is experiencing its third straight one-term presidency – assuming Trump obeys the Constitution and goes home in January 2029. And after snapping up all the swing states last year, Trump has the worst polling numbers of any president at the 100-day mark in decades.
    


            And politics is never static. Starmer's Labour Party landslide last year will count for nothing on Thursday, when Farage's far-right Reform Party is expected to claim huge wins in local elections that could portend its eclipse of Britain's most successful election machine, the Conservative Party, in the next general election.
    


            Is it too soon to predict a populist revival?

After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion.

Hulk Hogan felt sure he was onto something.

After watching the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, he was absolutely certain.

Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion.

Then, it happened. Last month, Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Minnesota's Gable Steveson — an Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo — with a late takedown to claim the national title at heavyweight.

Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump after his victory last month in Philadelphia. Then, with a United States flag draped over his shoulders, the Air Force second lieutenant walked over and shook Trump's hand and hugged him.

Hendrickson's dramatic win and the moments that followed vaulted freestyle wrestling into the mainstream and made the timing perfect for Hogan to help launch Real American Freestyle. He'll be commissioner of a league that announced its plans on Wednesday.

Hogan wants the league to provide more earnings opportunities for a sport that historically has lacked them. And after Hendrickson's big moment, he feels the time is now.

“When I saw that happen and I saw our President hug him, I went, OK, we are on point, we're ready to go and instincts have prevailed and I smell victory,” Hogan said. “I think we're right on track, brother.”




Hogan, who at 71 still has those massive arms and the charisma to match, initially was a bit worried that the freestyle wrestlers might not have the personality to sell tickets. He changed his mind as he began to connect with them.

“Dude, they've all got that edge,” he said. “These kids are young, they're smart. They're watching TV. They know about branding, they know what sells. And they've all got that little Conor McGregor swag.”

Real American Freestyle events will feature single matches at eight men's and four women's weight classes. The first event is scheduled for Aug. 30 in Cleveland, with other sites to be named in the coming months.

Freestyle wrestling has been hot in the United States in recent years. The women's U.S. Olympic freestyle team earned four medals in six weight classes in 2024, while the men claimed three medals. And according to the National Federation of High Schools, wrestling set participation records for boys and girls in 2023 and 2024.

Hogan said Kennedy Blades, an American who earned a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will be the face of the women's division. Zahid Valencia and Ben Askren have agreed to participate on the men's side.

Hogan said Hendrickson and Steveson are possible additions, and his eyes lit up when the subject of a possible rematch came up.

“How much can we say,” Hogan asked his advisors. “It's on the radar.”

Hogan's Real American Beer serves as the title sponsor, and he has plenty of support. Chad Bronstein is the co-founder and president. Left Lane Capital, which has backed Gerard Piqué's Kings League, Shaun White's Snow League and League One Volleyball, among other things, has added this to its list of ventures. Cassius is another sponsor.

Hogan knows some fans will be shocked that his next step does not involve pro wrestling, but he's confident in his decision.

“The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,” he said. “People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.”

Because of name, image and likeness deals, college athletes will be able to participate, though Hogan said the league won't interfere with college, national and international competitions.

Hogan did bring in one connection from his pro wrestling days. Eric Bischoff, who ran World Championship Wrestling in its heyday in the late 1990s and created the famous New World Order storyline, will be the chief media officer.

“Eric jumped in with both feet, and he's doing a lot to guide this ship right now, brother,” Hogan said. “He's setting so much stuff up production wise — just moving us forward, light years ahead of where we could have been on our own.”

Israel Martinez is the chief operating officer. He is an accomplished wrestling coach who has helped build champions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the wrestling coach for Jon Jones and he coached Holly Holm when she upset Ronda Rousey. Hogan said Martinez played a key role in getting USA Wrestling's blessing.

Hogan considers the new league an alternative to pro wrestling.

“I see this as an opportunity for me to get involved,” Hogan said, “to get back, quit sitting on the couch, to get involved with a bunch of powerful athletes that I can relate to as far as championship material, guys that are on top of their game, and I just — I couldn't pass on it.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is ready to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. access to its valuable rare minerals in the hopes of ensuring continued American support for Kyiv in its grinding war with Russia, senior Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.

Ukraine's economy minister and deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal, according to two senior Ukrainian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.

“Truly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Ukrainian television. “This is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.”

U.S. President Donald Trump indicated in February that he wanted access to Ukraine's rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the war, describing it as reimbursement for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has given to Kyiv. But talks stalled after a tense Oval Office meeting of U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, and reaching an agreement since then has proven difficult and strained relations between Washington and Kyiv.

It wasn't immediately clear if the Trump administration was also ready to finalize the deal Wednesday.

The U.S. is seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.

After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.

According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine's path toward European Union membership — a key provision for Kyiv.

The Ukrainian Cabinet was expected to approve the agreement's text before it could be signed in Washington. The deal would then need to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it could take effect.

The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.

Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, “but before it's done, it's necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.

“We realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.

Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

Trump has chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for steps that he said were prolonging the killing, and he has rebuked Putin for complicating negotiations with “very bad timing” in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.

Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.

“We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,” department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.

Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine's mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.





Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.

Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.

The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.

Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia's Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — A coalition of survivors of clergy sexual abuse demanded Wednesday that cardinals entering the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis pick a pope who will adopt a universal zero-tolerance policy for abuse and himself has a clean record handling cases.

The group End Clergy Abuse issued an open letter to the cardinals who are meeting informally this week before the start of the May 7 conclave. SNAP, the main U.S.-based survivor group, also identified cardinals who themselves have problematic records in a new database, highlighting a new level of scrutiny of all possible contenders for the papacy.

The developments come amid real questions about how prominent the abuse scandal is featuring in the discussions about finding a new pope. After two decades of unrelenting revelations about abuse and cover-up that have discredited the Catholic hierarchy, many church leaders would like to think the issue is in the past, the survivors said.

“The sexual abuse crisis is not a matter of the past. It is present. And nowhere is its devastation more visible than in the Global South,” the survivors said in the open letter.

ECA and SNAP have called for the Catholic Church to adopt a zero-tolerance policy that a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established according to church law. That is the policy in the U.S. church, adopted at the height of the U.S. scandal in 2002, but it is by no means embraced elsewhere.




The issue is playing out in real time in Rome as the cardinals gather: Peruvian Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, 81, has been seen in full cardinal garb entering and exiting Vatican City, despite being under Vatican sanction for allegedly abusing a minor. Cipriani is not allowed in the conclave itself because he is over 80, but he has been participating in the pre-conclave meetings this week.

The Vatican in January confirmed that disciplinary sanctions were in effect against Cipriani, the first-ever cardinal from Opus Dei, following accusations of sexual abuse. The sanctions included requiring him to leave Peru and included restrictions on his public activity and use of insignia. The Vatican said he was allowed to deviate from them on some occasions.

Asked why Cipriani was presenting himself as a cardinal and participating, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the Vatican regulations concerning the pre-conclave meetings are clear. The rules, he said, all cardinals must participate unless they have “legitimate impediments,” which involve “personal or physical questions.”

Cipriani, who lives in Madrid and Rome, has called the allegations “completely false.”

Bruni said the issue of abuse was discussed this week by cardinals in the pre-conclave discussions, among other challenges facing the church.

SNAP earlier this year launched an online initiative, Conclave Watch, to provide information about individual cardinals and their records. The group says since the launch, survivors from Fiji, Tonga, Belgium, France, South Africa, Malawi, France, Italy, Canada and the U.S. have gotten in touch with additional information.

The initiative vets cardinals who are considered contenders for the papacy on their records handling sexual abuse cases, including whether they were involved in covering up cases, as well as their acceptance of a zero-tolerance law that SNAP and ECA have proposed.

“Abuse survivors do not want to see another conclave that elects a pope who has shielded and covered up for clergy offenders,” said Sarah Pearson, a SNAP spokesperson.

NEW YORK (AP) — A former TV production assistant told a jury Wednesday that Harvey Weinstein held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her after she told him: “No, no — it's not going to happen.” 

Dabbing her eyes, Miriam Haley recalled what ran through her mind during the alleged July 2006 assault: “The unthinkable was happening, I just thought any unthinkable thing could happen. I just didn't know where it ended.” 

Weinstein, sitting between his lawyers, shook his head as she spoke.

Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is the first of the ex-Hollywood honcho's accusers to testify at his rape retrial. It's happening because New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction. 

The 73-year-old former studio boss has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone. 

Haley testified at the original trial and was candid last year about her mixed feelings about repeating the experience. 

Weinstein's attorneys haven't yet had their chance to question her and potentially try to poke holes in her account. But the defense has sought vigorously — if often unsuccessfully — to rein in the scope of Haley's testimony by objecting to prosecutors' questions, such as multiple queries about whether she had any sexual interest in Weinstein. Haley said she did not.

The defense has argued that all of Weinstein's accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business. 




Haley began her testimony Tuesday by describing how she got to know Weinstein, briefly worked as a production assistant on his company's reality show “Project Runway” in June 2006 and had a series of interactions with him that were sometimes inappropriate and suggestive, but other times professional and polite. 

Throughout, Haley said, she was only looking for professional opportunity — not sex or romance — with the then-powerful producer of such Oscar winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Gangs of New York.” 

Weinstein's retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.

He's also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.

Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.

The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.

Before games, Dallas forward Matt Duchene relies on the same, tried-and-true routine. He blocks out a two-hour window for a nap, eats an identical meal — pasta and salmon — and spends time reviewing notes he's made in his journal.

Like many NHL players and coaches, Duchene is a creature of habit. Little pregame rituals and routines help them slip into the proper frame of mind for the next big game.

These familiar patterns can be sleep- or food-related. Or revolve around how they get dressed for a game. Or the way they warm up. Or how they tinker with their hockey sticks. Or be as simple as taking their dog for a walk.

Be careful, though, to lump these in with superstitions like Patrick Roy talking to his goalposts or Brendan Shanahan listening to Madonna. 

“I have a routine, but I don't think that means you're superstitious,” Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson explained. “Lots of guys have routines.”

Food seems to be a common theme. Many have their go-to menu on game day.

For Vegas forward Pavel Dorofeyev, it's pasta with alfredo sauce and chicken, while Stars forward Mikko Rantanen prefers chicken, pasta and sweet potatoes. Vegas forward Tomas Hertl has the same breakfast every morning — scrambled eggs with mushrooms, ham and onions. 

It used to be 13 meatballs with lingonberry sauce and mashed potatoes with gravy for Minnesota Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson. But he's changed it up this season.




“Went to a restaurant instead,” Gustavsson said. “It makes it a little easier.”

On the ice, Avalanche goaltender Scott Wedgewood follows the same steps before each period. He taps the crossbar, the right post, left post, back to his blade and the crossbar, each pad twice and then his gloves.

“That's just been a game-on, turn-the-engine-on, type thing,” said Wedgewood, whose pregame meal is usually chickpea pasta with marinara sauce, two chicken breasts and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. “If I didn't do it, I don't think it would mentally screw me up.” 

Coaches aren't immune to their routines, either.

Over the years, Stars coach Pete DeBoer has taken to walking through downtown Denver to get to the arena (the Stars and Avalanche are meeting for a second straight postseason). It's become a tradition for him.

“I'm probably going to get mugged now that I'm telling you this,” DeBoer cracked. “It's a nice walk to the hotel.”

Sometimes, he even stops along the way at a pizza joint for a slice.

“They have a jalapeno-popper pizza with grape jelly,” DeBoer said. “Sounds crazy, but may be the best thing I've ever tasted.”

All routines are subject to change. Unless, of course, it involves how players put on their uniform.

“I always dress (the same) — left skate, left shin pad, left elbow (pad), but I don't even think about it,” Hertl said. “I just do it.”

Same with Vegas defenseman Ben Hutton: “I kiss the inside of my jersey when I put it on,” he said.

One frequent requirement — sneaking in a pregame nap. If they can't sleep, at least they log some chill time.

“I nap around the same time, that's just routine more than ritual. I was a little bit more (superstitious) when I was younger, but with my life the way it is, I've kind of had to change my schedule on the fly with a busy household,” said Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo, who has four kids, including triplets. “I try not to overthink it.”

Following morning home skates, Carolina forward Mark Jankowski typically takes Lucy, his 6-year-old golden retriever, for a stroll.

“Get some sunlight,” said Jankowski, who was acquired by the Hurricanes in March. “Get the legs moving a little bit.”

Then, a pregame meal for Jankowski, followed by slipping on a pair of Normatec boots — compression therapy to enhance circulation. He naps (60-90 minutes) before taking off for the rink.

Washington goaltender Logan Thompson used to have numerous superstitions, including not stepping on cracks. It got to the point where, “if I would mess one up or if I would do something wrong, I think it would throw off my whole game,” he explained.

“Over the last two years just switched it up of making sure my body feels good and just keeping it loose,” Thompson added. “I feel like when you overthink too much, that's when issues happen.”

For keeping it loose, he credits “sewer ball,” a game played in some corner of a hockey arena all over. Players form a circle and try to keep a ball from hitting the ground. If a player can't, they're out. The exact rules are always subject to debate.

“A good way to keep my mind off the game,” Thompson said.

As part of his pregame routine, Hertl cranks up the tunes. These days, his playlist is heavy Czech music because it's been setting the proper goal-scoring mood. 

“I'm the kind of guy who can listen to everything,” Hertl said. “I like just the songs I kind of know I can sing along. I have a terrible voice, I can't sing, but this I do by myself.”

Other ways that players loosen up for a game: Gustavsson, like many, kicks around a soccer ball, while Vegas defenseman Noah Hanifin takes a cold plunge. Hanifin's teammate Brayden McNabb chomps on gum (peppermint) in warmups. 

Players spend all sorts of time making sure their equipment is as prepared as them. Avalanche forward Jonathan Drouin spray-paints the bottom of his sticks to add a little extra weight. Stars forward Mason Marchment makes sure his stick is stiff and newly taped.

Duchene slightly tweaks his routine depending on if it's a road or home game. On the road, he includes rice with his pasta and salmon. At home, it's salad. He also naps in a hyperbaric chamber before home games.

“As a younger player, I was extremely superstitious, and I hated it,” said Duchene, who writes the title of a song — “Jim Bob” by Hardy — on his stick. “I did everything to the minute before a game. I was almost obsessive about it. I got away from it a few years back.

“My biggest thing is you do what you do to get prepared, and then you just throw the gear on and go play,” he added. “That's the most pure form of playing hockey. That's how you do it your whole life. You don't need to do ‘A-through-Z' to get ready.”

Michael Bolton refuses to go down without a fight.

Over the past year and a half, the two-time Grammy Award winner has been battling glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer, People magazine reported Wednesday in a cover story. The singer was diagnosed with glioblastoma in December 2023 after undergoing emergency surgery.

According to the outlet, the 72-year-old's short-term memory, speech and mobility have been impacted by his treatment. The outlet reported that Bolton ""has purposely not been given a prognosis."" Still, he's optimistic.

""You're reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought,"" the father of three told the outlet. ""Succumbing to the challenge is not an option. You're really quickly drawn into a duel. I guess that's the way you find out what you're made of.""

According to the outlet, doctors were able to remove Bolton's brain tumor in its entirety during his 2023 surgery. Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 following an infection. He finished radiation and chemotherapy treatment in October of that year. He now undergoes MRIs every two months to ensure his tumor hasn't returned.

Bolton first shared news of his illness with fans on Instagram in January 2024. At the time, he announced that he was taking a break from touring as he focused on his recovery. Bolton's website shared that the musician was expected to start his tour in February of that year with shows throughout 2024.

""It is always the hardest thing for me to ever disappoint my fans or postpone a show, but I have no doubt I am working hard to accelerate my recovery and get back to performing soon,"" he wrote at the time.

People revealed that Bolton's most recent scan took place in April – it was clear. Now it's all about monitoring. According to the Glioblastoma Foundation, the recurrence rate for the disease is about 90%.

Still, his battle goes on with ""grace and humor.""

On Christmas Day, Michael Bolton shared a new photo of himself with his family enjoying the holiday season. ""Sending warm wishes for a holiday season filled with peace, love, and joy,"" the star captioned the post. ""May the New Year bring health, happiness, and countless moments to cherish. Here's to fresh starts and beautiful moments in 2025!"" (Facebook)

""Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you're not alone going through it is a big deal,"" said the star. ""It actually helps people to know. It reminds them that they're not alone.""

Bolton has turned to family for comfort. He's been healing at his home in Westport, Connecticut, where he's lived for more than 30 years. 

The outlet shared that he spends much of his time with his daughters, whom he shares with his ex-wife Maureen McGuire. He also dedicates his time to his six grandchildren: Amelia, 14, Olivia, 13, Dylan, 11, Grayson, 10, River, 9, and Jack, 8. They especially enjoy family trivia night, which takes place regularly.

Bolton also finds comfort in pursuing his love of music. He takes voice lessons and voice therapy with a coach online. He also keeps busy meditating daily, playing golf and working out with a personal trainer.

""I find comfort in general more easily,"" Bolton explained. ""[The whole experience] gives me a heightened sense of appreciation. It's unthinkable for it to be OK not to make the most of your life. I think we develop capabilities and problem management, and we learn how to make the best out of a bad situation.""

""You have to be a cheerleader for yourself,"" he stressed.

The outlet shared that Bolton now looks at his legacy differently. Before, it was about his lasting career as an artist. Throughout his 50-year reign in music, he's sold more than 75 million records. But now, it's about preparing his daughters for the future and sharing plenty of life lessons along the way. Family will always come first.

""How do I give things that they can take forward?"" said Bolton. ""Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give [them] – I want to be on the right side of that, so they feel great about who they are. It's a reality of mortality. Suddenly, a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?'""

""I want to keep going,"" Bolton continued. ""I feel there's still a lot to do on the fight side. I got a title for a song – ‘Ain't Going Down Without a Fight.'""

""I got a title for a song: ‘Ain't Going Down Without a Fight,'"" said Michael Bolton to People magazine. (Craig Barritt/Getty Images)

In 2023, Bolton told People magazine he deeply values his relationships with his daughters and other loved ones within his circle.

""I'm filled with more love and pride in my girls as they raise their own families,"" he said at the time. ""Watching them parent, watching them speaking to their kids. I'm just so proud of them.""

""Time brings wisdom,"" he reflected. ""Experience brings wisdom. And the important things never really change. Love is the center of the universe.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House Monday that illegal immigration is not a ‘victimless crime.'

FIRST ON FOX: A plane full of Central Asian illegal immigrants is on its way from the U.S. to Uzbekistan at no cost to Americans under a deal brokered between the two governments, Fox News Digital has learned. 

Over 100 unlawful immigrants are flying back to Uzbekistan on Wednesday as part of the agreement, and Uzbekistan is paying for the chartered deportation flight, the first such agreement by a foreign government since President Donald Trump took office. The flight, which took off this morning, had 131 migrants on board. 

People from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan were on board the flight, and Kyrsgystan and Kazahkstan nationals are expected to continue on to their home countries from Uzbekistan.

The deal, which the Trump administration says is a model framework for how it wants other nations to engage with the U.S. on immigration, is the result of months of diplomatic engagement between State Department officials, DHS officials, the White House and the National Security Council with their counterparts from Uzbekistan.

The deal ""underscores the deep security cooperation between our nations and sets a standard for U.S. alliances,"" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement.

""We commend Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev for his leadership in sending a flight to return 131 illegal aliens back to their home country,"" said DHS  Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing to work together with Uzbekistan on efforts to enhance our mutual security and uphold the rule of law.""

Uzbekistan, with its more than 37 million people, is a security partner of the U.S. in Central Asia, situated in the neighborhood of Iran, China and Afghanistan.

The arrangement follows a deal brokered by the Trump administration after a showdown with Colombia, by which the South American country agreed to accept its nationals, including those on military planes, after President Gustavo Petro originally rejected two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying unlawful migrants. 

It also follows an agreement with El Salvador, by which President Nayib Bukele agreed to receive not only his own nationals but those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. Many of the immigrants are suspected of gang ties and are being held in El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested 66,463 illegal immigrants and removed 65,682 of them.

Border encounters dropped to an average of 11,363 per day in February and March, Trump's first two full months in office, compared to an average of nearly 160,000 during the Biden administration.

Travel expert Colleen Kelly shares the hottest travel destinations for this summer and provides tips for travelers planning a cruise.

As summer travel quickly approaches, cruise lines are steering clear of a Caribbean island due to safety concerns.

Royal Caribbean recently altered its sailing itineraries to exclude Labadee, a picturesque peninsula on Haiti's northern coast, which has long been a highlight of Royal Caribbean's Western Caribbean itineraries.

""Out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily paused our upcoming visits to Labadee,"" Royal Caribbean said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The cruise line informed guests directly of the change in their itineraries, the spokesperson said. Sister brand Celebrity Cruises had already removed the stop on its cruises in recent weeks, the Miami Herald reported.

Chris Grow, a security consultant with more than 38 years of international experience in travel risk management and the co-author of ""A Step-by-Step Guide to Essential Travel Safety Considerations,"" discussed cruise travel safety with Fox News Digital.

""Some of these islands are very touchy with what's happening, and their politics can change from day to day,"" he said. ""One minute you're OK and the next minute it's time to get on the boat and leave.""​

Grow advised travelers to remain aware of where the U.S. consulate or embassy is located, to keep digital and physical copies of their passport and be aware of local political and social climates that can change rapidly.

""This isn't to present fear,"" he said. ""You want travelers to have fun, but please understand there's a reason we say these things.""

John Lovell, the president of Travel Leaders Network, told Fox News Digital that since the situation in Haiti is deteriorating, it was wise of the cruise behemoth to consider alternative routes.

""The good news is that Royal Caribbean has another place in the Caribbean exclusively for their guests: Perfect Day at CocoCay in The Bahamas. It has several beaches, the Caribbean's largest freshwater pool, a water park and more,"" he said.

GANG VIOLENCE IN HAITI AT RECORD LEVELS AMID CRITICISM US HAS NO ‘CLEAR STRATEGY'

""I hope that things will settle down and that ships will call on Labadee again. Not only is the beach incredibly beautiful, but it provides employment to Haitians at the resort and support to entrepreneurs with the onsite Haitian straw market.""

Just days before Royal Caribbean's announcement, the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince issued a fresh security alert warning of ""widespread protests with potential for violence between police, protestors, and criminal gangs."" 

Haiti is currently rated at Level 4 by the U.S. Department of State's travel advisory ""due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care,"" which means the U.S. government recommends travelers not go to the country.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS US CITIZENS TOLD NOT TO TRAVEL TO HAITI, BUT AMERICANS ARGUE AIRPORT, EMBASSY REMAINED OPEN

""The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and other first responders often lack the resources to respond to emergencies or serious crime,"" the U.S. travel advisory states.

It remains unclear when or if Labadee will return as a regular port of call. While Royal Caribbean has emphasized the ""temporary"" nature of the suspension, no timeline of a return has been communicated.

Gangs in Haiti killed at least 5,600 people last year, according to a new United Nations report. The report from the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights said an additional 3,700 were injured or abducted.

Just a year ago, the streets of the Caribbean nation were overtaken by violence. On March 4, 2024, Port-au-Prince's Toussaint Louverture International Airport was taken over by armed gangs.

Following the gang takeover, Haitians and Americans were left trapped. Fox News Digital previously reported that, in 2024, gangs controlled 85% of Port-au-Prince and all the roads and highways in and out of the capital.

In early December 2024, at least 207 people were massacred in Port-au-Prince by the Wharf Jérémie gang. The victims, many of them elderly, were accused of using voodoo to harm the gang leader's son. Their bodies were mutilated and burned and others were thrown into the sea.

Christie Brinkley on aging gracefully 

Christie Brinkley has Beverly D'Angelo to thank for not going topless in ""National Lampoon's Vacation.""

The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model appeared in the 1983 comedy as the flirty ""Girl in the Ferrari"" opposite Chevy Chase. Viewers witnessed how Chase's character, Clark Griswold, struggled to keep his eyes on the road as the blonde bombshell in the sports car beside him zoomed between lanes. Meanwhile, Griswold's wife Ellen [D'Angelo] was asleep in the passenger seat.

In Brinkley's new memoir, ""Uptown Girl,"" the pinup described how the producers of the film asked her to go topless for a scene, but she refused.

""The most memorable part of filming was the scene where I bump into Chevy's character at a motel pool and talk him into going skinny-dipping, which we shot at two in the morning,"" wrote Brinkley in an excerpt obtained by Fox News Digital.

""That's when the production team asked me to go topless for the shot, but I wasn't comfortable with it: I knew very well by then that part of my appeal as a model was that men had to imagine what was underneath my swimsuit, and I wasn't about to give that away for what I thought would be a small, goofy movie. (None of us at the time ever suspected ‘National Lampoon's Vacation' would take off the way it did).""

""When the production team asked again about the possibility of nudity — and I couldn't blame them for trying — Beverly walked out onto set in the nick of time. ‘I'll do it,' she said. ‘I'll be the one to go topless! You'll get your t---ies.' I couldn't have loved her more [at] that moment. And in my opinion, the scene between Chevy and me is funnier and cleverer because I throw my bra and panties at him from off camera, and all that the viewers can see are his oversized facial expressions.""

Brinkley, 71, told Fox News Digital she was thankful to have D'Angelo, 73, step in and save her that day.

""I was so grateful from day one when I got there,"" she said. ""I arrived at the location, and I wasn't really sure what to do with myself. I was in this motel in the middle of nowhere, and then I got a call from Beverly right away saying, ‘Hey! Welcome. We're all going to head out and grab a bite to eat. Why don't you come with us?' That's the kind of thing that just puts you at ease and lets you feel like, 'I can relax. I've got a friend.'""

""[He asked] me for my ‘beauty secrets' in his own hilarious way: ‘Christie, you gotta give me tips to make my hair look thicker!' she wrote. ""As funny as he was, he was also shy, a combination I found endearing, and we quickly developed a playful chemistry that translated on-screen.""

Brinkley has been photographed on six continents, in more than 30 countries and has appeared on more than 500 magazine covers worldwide. But in the five decades she's been modeling, Brinkley has never posed nude.

""I really knew that I wanted to be a mom, and I didn't want [my children] to go to school and have some kid go, 'There's your mom! I see your mom!'"" the star told Fox News Digital. 

""And so, I just made that decision. And then I think people knew. I think there was something about me that I didn't attract that kind of… I didn't have photographers saying or trying to get me to strip down all the time. It just didn't happen.""

In her memoir, Brinkley emphasized that she never posed in her birthday suit.

""To be clear… if anyone asked me to pose nude, which they eventually did, I said no,"" Brinkley wrote. ""To this day, I have never done a nude shoot — not because I'm a prude, but because I've always wanted to be a mom, and I never wanted my kids to be embarrassed by nude photos of their mother circulating somewhere in the magazine world. Plus, I think it's much sexier to suggest than to show it all.""

SUPERMODEL CHRISTIE BRINKLEY SHARES BEAUTY SECRETS

""I've refused to do other things as a model, too, most notably when, a few months into my career, a client asked me to fly to the South of France to accompany a group of men on a yacht in the Mediterranean,"" Brinkley wrote.

""The job, they said, would be to be nice to everyone on board, because everyone on board could be beneficial to my career. The trip would include an overnight, but in the morning, I could fly back to Paris — no harm, no foul.""

""I may have been a naïve kid from Malibu, but nothing about the trip sounded right to me,"" she shared. ""Where, after all, was the modeling part? I heard rumors that other models with more successful careers at the time had taken the same trip and come back with fancy cars, jewelry, and a new magazine cover, but none of that mattered to me. If I was going to get ahead in the industry, I wanted to do it on my own terms, not underneath someone else's.""

""That proposed trip was the only time in my career I was ever asked, directly or indirectly, for a sexual favor,"" Brinkley continued.

""I know that makes me one of the lucky few, and I like to think that once you declare your worth, no one questions it again, but I know that's not true, either. Instead, you have to declare your worth over and over again, if not in one way, then in another — especially in an industry like modeling, where fame, money, and misconceptions can run wild. 

""But as long as you believe in yourself, it doesn't really matter what other people want or ask you to do. You write your own script… And as long as I'm writing my own script, I'm also going to call my own shots, no matter which side of the camera I'm on.""

Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, joins ‘The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss the Trump administration's southern border strategy and Democratic support for suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

As President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigrant gangs, a priority for his administration during his first 100 days in office, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official says violent foreign gangs like MS-13 are feeling the heat. 

""These gangs are getting increasingly desperate,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. ""Designating MS-13 and other gangs as terrorists is certainly helpful. That just gives us broader authorities … as far as deportations go.""

Immediately upon taking office, McLaughlin said, the Trump administration began partnering with local law enforcement as part of the 287(g) program, specifically because of their knowledge of the local gang scene.

THREE FBI MOST WANTED FUGITIVE ARRESTS IN TWO MONTHS SIGNAL RETURN TO ‘PREMIER' AGENCY: FORMER AGENT

""Part of the reason we're deputizing state and local law enforcement is, of course, we need more law enforcement bodies, but also they know their localities, and they can help us really target these guys and get them out of the country,"" she said.

McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that, so far, 2,394 illegal immigrant gang members have been arrested since Trump took office, adding that this is just the tip of the spear of what the administration intends to accomplish. 

""This is just the beginning,"" she said. ""This is just 100 days. We want to get these arrest numbers up. We want to get MS-13, Tren de Aragua — these really bad actors — out of our country. And that's what we're going to deliver on.""

""Self-deportation is definitely happening. I mean, we see it in our app, the CBP Home app,"" McLaughlin said. ""And that's what we want because it's a lot cheaper. An average deportation and arrest is like $17,000. It's incredibly expensive, and that's probably on the conservative side.""

McLaughlin noted that when illegal immigrants self-deport, it also reduces the danger to law enforcement authorities who risk life and limb arresting dangerous criminals.

One of the Trump administration's major victories in the war on MS-13 came at the end of March, when the FBI teamed up with the Prince William County Police Department, the ATF, ICE and the Virginia State Police to arrest one of the gang's top leaders in the United States, 24-year-old Salvadoran national Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos.

Nearly two dozen states have sued the Trump administration over large cuts at AmeriCorps, a volunteer service agency.

The lawsuit was led by Democratic state officials who are also suing the administration over canceling millions in grant funding.

“In an attempt to dismantle the agency, the Trump administration and its DOGE demolition team made abrupt and drastic cuts to staff and volunteers and terminated grants,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement to the Associated Press. “We are suing to stop this illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps and preserve the spirit of community service in our state and nation.”

Approximately 85% of AmeriCorps staff were put on administrative leave this month, the complaint says.

AmeriCorps sends thousands of volunteers to serve in communities around the country and supplies money across the states.

The lawsuit alleges that President Donald Trump and the administration's Department of Government Efficiency stripped the agency down illegally and reneged on grants funded through the AmeriCorps State and National program, which Congress budgeted $557 million for this year.

“AmeriCorps volunteers serve our communities every single day, and we will stand up for the critical programs AmeriCorps supports,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement. “We will fight this senseless move and look forward to seeing the Trump Administration in court.”

The White House has said AmeriCorps issued improper payments totaling over $40 million in 2024, citing insufficient documentation from grantees, calculation errors, and miscoded expenses.

“President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, told the outlet.

Notices that grants were being terminated were reportedly sent late on Friday, detailing that “the award no longer effectuates agency priorities” and directing grant recipients to immediately cease the projects.

WHAT IS DOGE? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY

Rachel Bruns, chief engagement officer with America's Service Commissions, said commissions in Wisconsin, Alabama, Wyoming, Oregon, and Maine have reported that their entire portfolios for the AmeriCorps State and National grant program have been cut.

Projects such as after-school programs, services for veterans, food pantries, efforts to prevent child abuse, and home building have been affected.

“We don't know what this means for these services in some of these communities that were impacted,” Bruns said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is renewing GOP divisions over trade as the Senate prepares to vote on the repeal of President Donald Trump's global tariff emergency.

The Senate will vote as soon as Wednesday on a resolution that reverses the “Liberation Day” tariffs Trump announced on April 2, even after the White House paused those duties for 90 days in the face of a market crash and turbulence in the bond market.

Republicans have nervously given Trump leeway to negotiate a raft of trade deals, with the reimposition of tariffs serving as leverage, but Paul and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the Democratic co-sponsor, still want a vote.

The resolution is considered privileged, meaning GOP leadership, who can lose three Republicans on any party-line vote, are unable to stop their request.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) acknowledged the measure stood a strong chance of passing, citing an earlier effort by Senate Democrats to repeal more narrow tariffs on Canada. In that vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats to end the national emergency Trump declared to give himself tariff authority.

“I mean, you saw the last one. They had the votes last time. So, we'll see,” Thune said. “I mean, my expectation is it could be similar in terms of, kind of what the vote count is on that.”

The resolution went nowhere in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has passed language to prevent Democrats from challenging Trump's tariff authority. But the vote amounted to a symbolic rebuke of the Trump administration and divided a party that traditionally prides itself on free trade.

“Obviously, it's a, you know, opportunity for the Democrats to put something on the floor that they think puts Republicans in an uncomfortable position, but I don't think most Republicans at this point see it that way,” Thune said of this week's resolution, describing the mood of his conference as “wait and see.”

“I think a lot of our members are willing to give the administration some time and some space to get some deals,” he added.

Beyond Democrats, the universe of potential “yes” votes lies in the seven Republicans who co-sponsored a separate bill that would sunset any tariff not approved by Congress after 60 days.

Paul and three of those Republicans — Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME) — voted for the Canadian resolution and could be expected to do so again. But Paul conceded additional support is unlikely.

He told the Washington Examiner that the sunset legislation, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) this month, is the way Republicans are choosing to “show displeasure” with the administration, with some not wanting to antagonize the White House further.

“I think it'd be a similar response,” Paul said. “It'd be interesting if we could get another person or two, but I think the Grassley bill sort of has become the off-ramp.”

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a co-sponsor of the Grassley bill, confirmed that he will not vote for the tariff repeal, calling it a partisan “shirts and skins exercise.” Several other co-sponsors were noncommittal or unaware the vote had been scheduled.

Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) declined to preview his vote but also described it as a “messaging” effort that had no chance of becoming law. On Monday, the White House promised to veto the resolution should it arrive on Trump's desk.

Paul, a libertarian, has been careful to describe his resolution as a matter of principle and not an attempt to needle Trump. The two men have periodically clashed on policy, but Paul has warmed to the president over his agency-slashing Department of Government Efficiency and Cabinet picks like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“I'm still supportive of Donald Trump. I voted for him, support him, love a lot of the things he's doing, but we shouldn't have a country ruled by emergency,” Paul said of the powers Trump is using on trade. 

McConnell, the former majority leader and home state colleague to Paul, made similar remarks at a business forum last week, noting that Kentucky relies heavily on international commerce, with its bourbon exports particularly vulnerable to a trade war.

“It's not an anti-Trump thing, in my opinion, but a structural thing,” McConnell, whose relationship with the president soured after the Jan. 6 riot, said. “Should the president have 100% of the authority in this particular area? And I think some of us think Congress probably ought to have some impact on that.”

Still, their vote against the Canadian tariffs on April 2, which came hours after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” duties, was viewed as the first legislative blemish of his second term. Trump subsequently chided all four Republicans who defied him, accusing them of playing “right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats.”

Republican anxiety has calmed some since Trump imposed those tariffs. The administration has been eager to show progress in trade talks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling reporters on Tuesday that 17 deals with major partners are in “motion.”

Trump has also taken steps to ease the tariffs' impact, signing an executive order on Tuesday that prevents overlapping duties on the auto industry.

There is nonetheless an undercurrent of concern that Trump is harming the economy the longer the tariffs, some of which fall outside the 90-day pause, remain in place. On Wednesday, Trump dismissed the idea that his tariffs caused a slowdown of the economy in the first quarter, instead blaming former President Joe Biden.

SCHATZ LINES UP WHIP SUPPORT WITH NO SENATE COMPETITORS

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attempted to smooth over those concerns in a Tuesday lunch with Senate Republicans in which he briefed the conference on the state of negotiations, while congressional leaders are urging unity on the resolution vote.

The administration had previously stoked confusion over whether Trump wants the tariffs to be a temporary bargaining chip or a permanent trade barrier. The latter possibility, suggested by some of his advisers, prompted open pushback within a broader segment of Senate Republicans.

The uncertainty also spilled into Trump's relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Tuesday after reports that the retail giant would begin listing “import charges” on its website.

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student from the West Bank, after Mahdawi spent more than two weeks in immigration detention following his abrupt arrest during a naturalization interview.

The 34-year-old permanent U.S. resident was detained by armed Department of Homeland Security agents on April 14 while seeking U.S. citizenship in Vermont. Mahdawi has been held since then at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, and his case has drawn national attention over the Trump administration's targeting of pro-Palestinian student activists.

“The two weeks of detention so far demonstrate great harm to a person who has been charged with no crime,” said U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, according to ABC News. “Mr. Mahdawi, I will order you released.”

Crawford's order allows Mahdawi to be released on bail, pending the final outcome of his case in federal court.

The government cited national security concerns in seeking to keep him in custody.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the arrest in a DHS notice, stating Mahdawi's “presence and activities” in the United States would pose “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”

Prosecutors also alleged Mahdawi had expressed support for antisemitic violence and had “an interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose,” according to sealed government filings seen by NBC.

Originally from the al Fara'a refugee camp in the West Bank, Mahdawi immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and began studying at Columbia in 2021.

“I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said outside the courtroom after his release, according to NBC News.

The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement actions against Middle Eastern students tied to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Mahdawi is the second Columbia student in recent weeks to face detention. 

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T HAVE ARREST WARRANT FOR MAHMOUD KHALIL, CITING ‘FLIGHT RISK'

Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led protests against the war in Gaza, was arrested at his New York apartment on March 8. A judge ruled on April 11 that Khalil can be deported, though he remains in custody while appealing the decision.

“Even if they don't agree with everything he's doing, he's doing something.”

Earlier this month, after it became clear that the Trump administration would not be facilitating the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a Salvadoran megaprison, I texted a close childhood friend. He'd voted for Donald Trump in each of the past three presidential elections, and I asked for his evaluation. “Trump might be taking it too far,” my friend replied. “But then again,” he added, “he's a man of action and we wanted change.”

Someday in the future, historians might well point to April 2025 as the first sign of an enduring erosion in Trump's popular support. In just the first week of this month, America witnessed another mass expulsion of federal workers, in this case from several health agencies, followed by a tariff rollout that sent 401(k)s plunging like a Six Flags log flume. Even with stocks partially rebounding, feedback from riders has not been great for the president: Poll after poll has registered a drop in overall support for Trump, with many voters citing economic uncertainty. Trump's numbers on immigration, long a strength of his, are also beginning to slip. Another recent survey suggests that Trump has the lowest approval rating of any newly elected president in at least 70 years.

But even as Trump's critics cheer the apparent change of heart among some of his supporters, they face an inconvenient reality: Many of his voters are jubilant. For these happy millions, the first 100 days of Trump's second presidency have been a procession of fulfilled campaign promises—and have brought the country not to the precipice of economic ruin or democratic collapse, but to a golden age of greatness. They see Trump as ushering in a new era of action, according to my conversations with several Trump supporters and pollsters in recent days. “Even if they don't agree with everything he's doing, he's doing something, and something is better than nothing,” Rich Thau, the president of the nonpartisan qualitative-research firm Engagious, told me.

Despite the relentless stream of shocking deportation stories—Abrego Garcia; the Venezuelan makeup artist; the Honduran child with Stage 4 cancer—many Trump voters see the president's handling of immigration as a highlight. The new administration says that ICE has so far carried out 66,000 deportations, a rate that is lower than that of previous administrations but that is partly the result of historically low border crossings.

“It's a night-and-day difference” from the Biden administration, Ben Cadet, a 24-year-old college student from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told me. Cadet voted for Joe Biden in 2020 but switched to Trump in 2024, partly because he felt that Democrats had moved too far left and partly because he thought that Biden simply hadn't done enough to address illegal immigration. Trump's “immediate action is something I would have appreciated from a Democrat,” he said. In the early days of the new administration, Cadet regularly called a friend to discuss Trump's executive orders on immigration, foreign policy, and “the culture war,” he told me. The two would joke that they should cancel their Netflix subscriptions and tune in to Trump instead “because watching everything he does is kind of hilarious.”

Read: Donald Trump is very busy

Thau, who conducts monthly focus groups of swing voters who supported Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024, told me that half of the participants in any given group cannot name a single thing that Biden achieved while in office. For many of them, the past 100 days—including Trump's deportations but also his tariffs, reams of executive orders, college shakedowns, and targeting of the political press—have seemed like “an incredible flurry of activity by comparison to the guy who came before,” whom they'd already considered old, infirm, and not really in charge. “I see a lot of politicians that they run and say a lot of things they're going to do, and they don't do any of them,” a woman named Mary told Thau in one of his recent focus groups about Trump (Thau identifies participants by their first name only). “But I see him, and I approve.”

If Democrats want to win back voters they lost to Trump, it would help them to first comprehend his appeal. That appears to be the conceit of the Working Class Project, a series of focus groups recently launched by the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century that attempt to understand why working-class voters have left the Democratic Party. In one of those recent focus groups, a Latino voter in New Jersey described his feelings this way: “Trump just puts his foot down, and whatever he says, it just happens.” My own interviews reflected a similar sentiment. “How many presidents have tried to implement everything they said they wanted to accomplish instead of backpedaling?” Timothy Hance, a 34-year-old manufacturing assembler from Ottumwa, Iowa, told me.

For some Trump voters, this yearning for action makes them willing to indulge more authoritarian impulses. Self-identified MAGA Republicans are about twice as likely as Americans overall to say that detaining legal residents by mistake is “acceptable,” according to a new CBS poll. And although most of the Trump supporters I interviewed were not keen on the possibility of sending American citizens convicted of crimes to jail in another country, as Trump has suggested he might do, one voter liked the idea. “They're hardened criminals. If we can't put them to death, the humane thing would be for us to send them away,” Hance told me. (He also suggested that Trump should plow through the court orders from “activist judges” holding up deportations. “It's like, just do it,” Hance said. “Ignore them.”)

For the many Americans who are happy right now, Trump's tariffs represent another exciting paradigm shift. “The dream of globalism is going by the wayside,” Joe Marazzo, a 29-year-old property manager from Jacksonville, Florida, told me. “It might not work, but at least we're trying something.” Sure, the president has retreated from his original plan to slap enormous import taxes on 90 countries, including the winged populace of Heard Island and McDonald Islands. But the still-high tariffs on Chinese goods are an important course correction and worth any discomfort they might cause, some Trump supporters say. “It'll take a year. You can't build car plants in two days,” Jerry Helmer, the chair of the Sauk County Republican Party, in Wisconsin, told me. Theodore John Fitzgerald, the leader of a pro-Trump grassroots group in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, likened the short-term pain from the tariffs to subsisting on ramen noodles in college—or switching to a healthier diet. “I have diabetes,” Fitzgerald told me. “There's a little pain and suffering to make sure I don't lose any more toes.”

Some of Trump's staunchest defenders acknowledged to me that they might reassess their loyalty if a forthcoming trade war results in an untenable increase in their cost of living. Others, though, said that they find it difficult to even fathom such a red line. “My hobby is hot-air ballooning,” Hance, from Iowa, told me with a chuckle. He'd rethink his support for Trump “if that was banned.”

Of course, Trump and his Republican allies cannot afford to make appeals to only their most ardent supporters. Not everyone is interested in the belt-cinching that tariffs might require. Overall, Americans are unhappy with the nation's economy, and 59 percent of the public now say that Trump has made economic conditions worse, according to a CNN survey released on Monday. “Even folks who like him and think that he has good ideas tell us in focus groups that they hope they don't have to pay a lot in tariffs,” Margie Omero, a pollster at the Democratic research firm GBAO, told me. In a recent focus group that Omero conducted of 13 independents who had voted for Trump in the 2024 election, most participants gave the president a B or C grade, although none of them regretted their vote.

With roughly 1,300 days left in Trump's presidency, many of his critics are hopeful that his recent dip in approval marks an inflection point, like the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that sparked Biden's own backslide in public esteem. Communication is key to keeping Trump's unfavorables high, Omero told me. “Some voters still aren't getting the message” about Trump's actions, she said. Many Americans believe that Trump has been too aggressive with his use of executive power, and in order to defeat him and his political allies, Omero argued, Trump's opponents need to help more Americans understand “that what he's doing is unprecedented and is going against the Court.”

Omero is right that many Americans probably haven't paid much attention to the details of Trump's first 100 days. But it's also true that, if and when they eventually tune in, some of them are going to like what they hear.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Millions of Americans are inhaling e-cigarettes illegally imported from China. Because of tariffs, they're about to get a lot more expensive.

The EBCreate “Miami Mint”–flavored vape is truly a wonder. The device is not particularly technologically advanced; the electronic components inside consist of little more than a battery and a heating coil that turns liquid into mist. The vape smells like a mojito that's gone a bit sour. But for $25 at my local vape shop, I got this tiny trinket that, by one estimate, contains the amount of nicotine found in 25 packs of cigarettes.



Along with nearly every other flavored vape, it's also illegal. Though these products are popular and easy to find, they haven't received the regulatory approval necessary to be sold in stores. Health officials have been unsuccessful at cracking down on these e-cigarettes in large part because they are made overseas and then smuggled into the country. Without government oversight, these devices can be unsafe: Vaping is essentially the equivalent of inhaling a pharmaceutical drug from an unregistered factory, and the devices risk hooking teens on nicotine. But the tricky thing about vapes is that eradicating them might not be in the interest of public health. As I've previously written, they're a helpful off-ramp from smoking for adults who aren't ready to kick nicotine. Because they don't burn tobacco, vapes are much safer than cigarettes yet still deliver a similar high.



Read: Public health as a blueberry-banana problem



Soon, however, flavored vapes could get much less affordable. The overwhelming majority of illicit vapes are made in China—including mine, which, according to its packaging, was manufactured in Hong Kong. That means these devices are now caught up in President Donald Trump's tariffs. Chinese-made vapes are subject to a 170 percent tax when they enter the U.S., which will “end up being reflected in the form of higher prices that consumers pay,” Mike Pesko, an economist at the University of Missouri who studies vapes, told me. By most accounts, Trump's trade war with China is incredibly reckless and shortsighted. But on the issue of vapes, it may actually inject some reason into the chaos.



Exactly how vapes make their way from Hong Kong to smoke shops in Brooklyn or Tuscaloosa is convoluted. At times, the industry can be gallingly lawless. Consider my Miami Mint vape. The brand that made it, EBCreate, used to be called Elf Bar. Its products were especially popular with kids, so the company quickly landed in the crosshairs of FDA regulators. The agency has sent warnings to the companies distributing these products on behalf of Elf Bar, it has fined the shops that sell them, and regulators have even attempted to ban their import into the United States. And yet, the company continues to operate and regularly ship its products here; the name change from Elf Bar was reportedly an attempt to evade the recent import ban. (EBCreate did not respond to a request for comment.)



Because Chinese vapes are illegal, many of the larger chains that sell cigarettes refuse to stock them. So specialty vape shops and smaller convenience stores have taken on all the risk. Exactly how tariffs on vapes will play out isn't yet clear. For now, prices haven't budged, but expect price hikes. One retailer has published a blog post warning that “the price of e-cigarettes will definitely increase significantly.”



Although Chinese vape manufacturers have reportedly been known to purposefully mislabel their products as battery chargers or flashlights, the fact that Trump's tariffs are applied to all goods from China will make it “very hard for the Chinese manufacturers just to mislabel an e-cigarette” in an effort to avoid a tariff, Donald Kenkel, an economist at Cornell, told me. Most vape shops are not massive corporations that can afford to absorb a tariff and sacrifice profits to keep customers happy, so they might have little choice but to raise prices. Paying $50 for a Miami Mint e-cigarette might seem worth the cost to someone who is hooked on nicotine, but when vape prices go up, research suggests that some consumers stop buying. If the tariffs persist in their current form, the price hikes could be steep enough that vape stores go out of business.



Considering that more than 1.6 million American kids are regularly vaping, the mass closure of smoke shops might feel a bit like fumigating an infestation. Higher prices come with a trade-off: When vapes get more expensive, some people turn back to cigarettes. Still, tariffs could simultaneously help root out the most concerning aspects of vapes while maintaining much of their promise. Adults who want to vape have a few legal options. Three vape companies have received FDA authorization to sell their products, and you can find them in major convenience stores such as 7/11. But they are struggling to compete with their illegal counterparts. Doug Kantor, the general counsel of the National Association of Convenience Stores, a lobbying group, told me that many of his association's members “have lost customers and a lot of sales to people who are willing to carry illegal products.”



Part of the problem is that the legal vapes come in just two flavors: menthol and tobacco. (Smokers can find more flavors in nicotine pouches such as Zyn, which is currently available in 10 different flavors, including cinnamon, citrus, coffee, and whatever “Chill” is.) The Chinese-made versions also just offer far more bang for your buck. A legal product like R. J. Reynolds Vuse Alto appears at first glance to be cheaper than its Chinese competitors—my local 7/11 charges $18.99 for a single “All-in-one kit.” But that vape contains only 1.8 milliliters of nicotine vape juice. For just a few dollars more, you can choose from many Chinese alternatives that contain seven times the amount of nicotine. In January, the tobacco giant Altria, which sells the e-cigarette Njoy, warned investors that its vape business wasn't growing as expected, because “the illicit e-vapor market has grown to a size and scale beyond our expectations.”



Tariffs could give an edge to legal vapes. Unlike those of their Chinese competitors, their bottom lines will not be seriously hurt by the trade war. A spokesperson for Reynolds American told me in a statement that the company has “diversified some of our production to locations outside of China, so we feel that we are well-positioned” to weather the tariffs. Yesterday, Altria noted on an earnings call that it is “predominantly a U.S. company with a U.S.-focused supply chain.” It's hard to get excited about a trade policy that ends up propping up the likes of Altria and Reynolds American, both of which sell billions of deadly cigarettes each year. But hiking the price of illegal vapes will likely improve public health. Yes, a portion of vapers will go back to smoking because of the tariffs, but others will turn to products that have actually been vetted by regulators for safety. And the more expensive the vape, the less likely kids are to pick it up.



Trump's tariffs are akin to performing surgery on the economy with a sword rather than a scalpel. But in the case of vaping, none of the precision policies has worked. Millions of Americans are inhaling an addictive substance into their lungs that is being illegally sold in stores with no oversight. Tariffs, for all their faults, might finally offer a solution.

Americans must insist on academic freedom, or risk losing what makes our nation great.

Today the concept of academic freedom may seem obvious to Americans. But the roots of academic freedom, which can be traced back to medieval European universities, were never certain. Back then, when scholars demanded autonomy from Church and state, they were often rebuked—or worse.

What began as a slow-burning fuse eventually led to the concept of the modern research university a few centuries later, found in the writing of the English philosopher Francis Bacon and his 1627 novel, New Atlantis. There, Bacon envisioned a college called Salomon's House, in which scientists and others worked in an atmosphere of generosity and freethinking. This college came to be known as “the noblest foundation (as we think) that ever was upon the earth; and the lantern of this kingdom,” as the Governor of Bacon's fictional utopia put it. “It is dedicated to the study of the works and creatures of God.”



Twelve of the resident fellows, called “merchants of light,” sailed to foreign countries to bring back books and knowledge from other lands. Several devised experiments in both the “mechanical arts” and the “liberal sciences,” eventually creating such technologies as microscopes and hearing aids. Invention flourished in an ethos of imagination and unfettered investigation. Bacon was a forerunner of the Enlightenment. After centuries of intellectual progress, Americans must face a terrible question: Are we now descending from light into dark?



Since April 22, more than 500 leaders of America's colleges, universities, and scholarly societies have signed a statement protesting the unprecedented interference of the Trump administration into higher education, interference that included external oversight of admissions criteria, faculty hiring, accreditation, ideological capture, and, in some cases, curriculum. As the statement says, higher education in America is open to constructive reform. However, “we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.”



Especially targeted by the administration have been international students.

At my university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at least nine members of our community—students, recent graduates, and postdocs—have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked. MIT's president, Sally Kornbluth, recently sent a letter to our community, part of which read:



“To live up to our great mission, MIT is driven to pursue the highest standards of intellectual and creative excellence. That means we are, and must be, in the business of attracting and supporting exceptionally talented people, the kind of people with the drive, skill and daring to see, discover and invent things no one else can. To find those rare people, we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the United States and from around the globe.” In the past, MIT and the many other institutions of higher learning in America have been Bacon's “merchants of light.”



Both tangible and intangible benefits flow from academic freedom. First, the tangible. The business world should be alarmed by the proposed jamming of the greatest engine of invention, innovation, and economic prosperity in our nation. To name just a few examples: The internet, in the form of the ARPANET, was developed by researchers at UCLA, Stanford, and MIT under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s and '70s. Key concepts and materials for lithium-ion batteries were developed at the University of Texas and the University of Oxford. The first artificial heart was developed by Robert Jarvik and colleagues at the University of Utah. Google originated as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford. Natural-language processing, neural networks, and deep learning—all fundamental parts of AI—came out of research at MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Toronto. Pivotal work in CRISPR gene editing was done by Jennifer Doudna at UC Berkeley. (She received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.) Many other technological inventions, although not directly produced in our universities, were nurtured by the training and knowledge gained in them: computers, vaccines, smartphones, social-media platforms, Global Positioning System (GPS), insulin synthesis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lasers.



Of course, the intellectual and creative freedom in America has enabled great productivity far beyond the precincts of science and technology. Exemplars include William James in philosophy and psychology, Toni Morrison in literature, Noam Chomsky in linguistics and cognitive science, Hannah Arendt in political theory, Martha Nussbaum in law and ethics, Margaret Mead in anthropology, W. E. B. Du Bois in sociology, John Rawls in political philosophy, Susan Sontag in cultural criticism, John Dewey in philosophy and education, and many, many more.



Our country, a relatively young country but a country weaned on freedom dating back to the American Revolution of 1775, has helped build the modern world, has helped human beings reach their fullest capacity and creativity. Academic freedom is what has made America great.



By contrast, invention has been suffocated in authoritarian countries with choke holds on academic freedom. In China, despite major investments in research and higher education, topics such as political reform, Tiananmen, and human rights are taboo. These restrictions have limited open inquiry in the social sciences and humanities. In Iran, restrictions on gender studies, religious critique, and internet freedom have weakened its academic institutions and discouraged global collaboration. In Russia, the crackdown on academic freedom since 2010 has driven out many independent thinkers and scientists, weakening innovation and policy critiques. Talented academics and researchers frequently leave for countries with more freedom, taking their expertise and innovation potential with them, as illustrated recently by the very public departure of the Yale University professor Jason Stanley, who is leaving the U.S. for Canada.



Where restrictions have been lifted, flowers bloom. South Korea was a military dictatorship up to the 1980s, and then became a democracy. In the authoritarian era, universities were tightly controlled, with crackdowns on student protests and censorship in curricula. After the removal of these restrictions, South Korea quickly became a global leader in technology and innovation, home to companies including Samsung and LG. Taiwan transitioned from martial law under the Kuomintang to a liberal democracy in the 1990s. The humanities and social sciences, previously constrained by anti-communist ideology, expanded significantly. Taiwan developed a strong knowledge economy, with competitive universities and thriving biotech and electronics industries. In particular, Taiwan is the home of the world's leading semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.



What exactly is academic freedom? It is the freedom to express and debate ideas without fear of censorship or reprisal. It is the freedom to explore. It is the freedom to let the imagination wander. It is the freedom to exchange knowledge with colleagues and others. It is the freedom to question authority and received wisdom. It is the freedom to test ideas against experiment and to reject those ideas that fail the test. It is the freedom to be honest, even if that honesty challenges prevailing views. It is the freedom to be one's true self.



Academic freedom is the oxygen and the light of higher education. Growing things need both. Aren't colleges and universities the nurseries of faculty, students, and their surrounding society? We need air. Instinctively, we seek light, just as some plants will change their pattern of growth in order to receive the sunlight needed for growth. It's called phototropism. The petals of sunflowers actually track the movement of the sun throughout the day, changing their direction to point toward the sun.



I have served on the faculties of several universities in America and visited a hundred more. And I have felt intellectually safe in all of them. More than safe, I have felt encouraged to express myself and to listen and debate and question. The ethos of academic freedom is subtle. It is a kind of liberation, a buoyancy of the spirit, a nourishment of the mind. It is a basking in the light.



Academic freedom is the greatest lesson we can give to our students. Our young people are shaping the future. Do we want them to be afraid to express their ideas? Do we want them to be afraid to explore, to invent, to challenge the status quo? Do we want them to be afraid of being who they are?



We set examples for our young people and students, moral as well as intellectual. Do we want them to see us restrict what we teach because of the rules imposed by some outside authority? Do we want them to see us hide evidence that challenges a prevailing viewpoint? Do we want them to see us deny admission to other qualified students because of quotas or ideological litmus tests or country of origin? Do we want them to see us conform to outside decrees that undermine our values? Do we want them to see us prioritize money above all other things? Do we want them to see us as cowards, lacking the courage to stand behind our values and convictions?



The surrender of academic freedom in America and, in fact, freedom of all kinds may happen gradually, little by little. First with the disproportionate power of money and the wealthy who have it, then with attacks on the free press, the control of information, the weakening of checks and balances, the suppression of dissent, the surveillance of the population, and finally the normalization of repression. In George Orwell's novel 1984, a superstate called Oceania is ruled by a dictator called Big Brother, who is supported by his personality cult and the Thought Police. The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, works for the state, at the Ministry of Truth, but he secretly hates the ruling regime. He joins what he thinks is a resistance group called the Brotherhood but which turns out to be part of the state apparatus. Smith is then arrested and subjected to months of brainwashing. Eventually, he is released and comes to believe that he loves Big Brother after all. This is what happens when darkness replaces light, when the freedom to think, dream, and invent is squashed. We cannot let that happen to us in America.

A new sign that AI is competing with college grads

Something strange, and potentially alarming, is happening to the job market for young, educated workers.

According to the New York Federal Reserve, labor conditions for recent college graduates have “deteriorated noticeably” in the past few months, and the unemployment rate now stands at an unusually high 5.8 percent. Even newly minted M.B.A.s from elite programs are struggling to find work. Meanwhile, law-school applications are surging—an ominous echo of when young people used graduate school to bunker down during the great financial crisis.

What's going on? I see three plausible explanations, and each might be a little bit true.

The first theory is that the labor market for young people never fully recovered from the coronavirus pandemic—or even, arguably, from the Great Recession. “Young people are having a harder time finding a job than they used to, and it's been going on for a while, at least 10 years,” David Deming, an economist at Harvard, told me. The Great Recession led not only to mass layoffs but also to hiring freezes at many employers, and caused particular hardships for young people. After unemployment peaked in 2009, the labor market took time to heal, improving slowly until the pandemic shattered that progress. And just when a tech boom seemed around the corner, inflation roared back, leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and cool demand across the economy. White-collar industries—especially technology—were among the hardest hit. The number of job openings in software development and IT operations plunged. The share of jobs posted on Indeed in software programming has declined by more than 50 percent since 2022. For new grads hoping to start a career in tech, consulting, or finance, the market simply isn't that strong.

Read: The job market is frozen

A second theory points to a deeper, more structural shift: College doesn't confer the same labor advantages that it did 15 years ago. According to research by the San Francisco Federal Reserve, 2010 marked a turning point, when the lifetime-earnings gap between college grads and high-school graduates stopped widening. At the same time, the share of online job postings seeking workers with a college degree has declined.

To be clear: College still pays off, on average. The college wage premium was never going to rise forever, and the fact that non-college workers have done a little better since 2010 isn't bad news; it's actually great news for less educated workers. But the upshot is a labor market where the return on investment for college is more uncertain.

The third theory is that the relatively weak labor market for college grads could be an early sign that artificial intelligence is starting to transform the economy.

“When you think from first principles about what generative AI can do, and what jobs it can replace, it's the kind of things that young college grads have done” in white-collar firms, Deming told me. “They read and synthesize information and data. They produce reports and presentations.”

Consider, then, a novel economic indicator: the recent-grad gap. It's the difference between the unemployment of young college graduates and the overall labor force. Going back four decades, young college graduates almost always have a lower—sometimes much lower—unemployment rate than the overall economy, because they are relatively cheap labor and have just spent four years marinating in a (theoretically) enriching environment.

But last month's recent-grad gap hit an all-time low. That is, today's college graduates are entering an economy that is relatively worse for young college grads than any month on record, going back at least four decades.

The strong interpretation of this graph is that it's exactly what one would expect to see if firms replaced young workers with machines. As law firms leaned on AI for more paralegal work, and consulting firms realized that five 22-year-olds with ChatGPT could do the work of 20 recent grads, and tech firms turned over their software programming to a handful of superstars working with AI co-pilots, the entry level of America's white-collar economy would contract. The chaotic Trump economy could make things worse. Recessions can accelerate technological change, as firms use the downturn to cut less efficient workers and squeeze productivity from whatever technology is available. And even if employers aren't directly substituting AI for human workers, high spending on AI infrastructure may be crowding out spending on new hires.

From the June 2025 issue: The coming economic nightmare

Luckily for humans, though, skepticism of the strong interpretation is warranted. For one thing, supercharged productivity growth, which an intelligence explosion would likely produce, is hard to find in the data. For another, a New York Fed survey of firms released last year found that AI was having a negligible effect on hiring. Karin Kimbrough, the chief economist at LinkedIn, told me she's not seeing clear evidence of job displacement due to AI just yet. Instead, she said, today's grads are entering an uncertain economy where some businesses are so focused on tomorrow's profit margin that they're less willing to hire large numbers of entry-level workers, who “often take time to learn on the job.”

No matter the interpretation, the labor market for young grads is flashing a yellow light. It could be the signal of short-term economic drag, or medium-term changes to the value of the college degree, or long-term changes to the relationship between people and AI. This is a number to watch.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

His administration is great at breaking things — but they're failing in their bigger goal.

by  Zack Beauchamp

In the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, his administration has proven exceptionally good at breaking things. The Department of Government Efficiency's total demolition of USAID, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s depopulation of America's public health agencies, the total chaos at Pete Hegseth's Pentagon — there is little doubt that the Trump team has accomplished policy vandalism at an unprecedented scale.

Amid this constant barrage, it can feel like Trump has been stunningly successful in achieving his aims. But when it comes to perhaps his administration's most ambitious task — removing checks on Trump's power, transforming democracy into something more like an authoritarian regime — the evidence suggests a surprisingly hopeful conclusion.

Trump is failing — at least, so far.

There is an established playbook for turning a democracy into an authoritarian state, used in countries ranging from India to Hungary. It requires a leader to:

Trump has attempted all of these things. He has taken actions, like unilaterally declaring an end to birthright citizenship, that clearly violate the Constitution. He has targeted alternative power centers, launching an investigation into a Democratic fundraising platform and threatening the press. He has imposed sanctions on prominent law firms and universities in a bid to force compliance, and he has sold it all to the public as evidence he's getting things done.

Yet in each arena, Trump is facing effective and mounting pushback. He is routinely losing in court. He is failing to silence the media. And he is losing support among the elite as his poll numbers plummet.

This failure is, in large part, a result of his team's errors. While their approach broadly resembled foreign authoritarians', it was a poor copy at every level — a strategically unsound campaign, with poorly thought-out tactics that were executed incompetently.

“We should thank [our] lucky stars that Trump chose to do this in the most stupid way possible,” says Lucan Way, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who studies democratic backsliding.

None of this is to say that American democracy is safe. Never before has a president been so committed to breaking the constitutional order and seizing power. We do not know whether America's democratic institutions will hold when the pressure has been mounting for years rather than months. But the events of the first 100 days give us reason to hope.

To understand what Trump is attempting — and why it's failing — it's helpful to understand how Viktor Orbán successfully demolished democracy in Hungary. This is not only because Orbán is perhaps the most effective modern elected autocrat, but also because there is good reason to believe that the Trump team is self-consciously borrowing elements of his strategy.

Orbán was prime minister of Hungary from 1998–2002, when he ruled as a mostly normal conservative in a country widely seen as a post-communist success story. But once out of power, he spent his time out of power developing a plan to secure total control — even consulting law firms about a legal power grab in the event that his Fidesz party won another election. When he returned to office in 2010, Orbán executed that plan flawlessly, turning Hungary from a reasonably stable and healthy democracy into the European Union's only autocracy.

Orbán did not immediately or openly claim dictatorial powers. Instead, he made a blizzard of incremental moves — each one technical and confusing. Individually, these policies might not have seemed like a big deal. Together, they added up to a quietly comprehensive assault on democratic institutions and civil society.

Orbán's first and most impactful moves targeted the guts of democratic society. He neutered the courts, forcing out unfriendly judges and replacing them with his cronies. He attacked the free press' economic foundations, developing financial tools to force independent media to sell to government allies. He began the process of stacking the electoral deck by gerrymandering Hungarian electoral districts. And he did all of this quietly, through obscure legal tweaks and quiet abuses of regulatory powers that even sophisticated observers of Hungarian politics had trouble tracking.

The Trump administration has borrowed elements of the Hungarian approach. They've said so themselves: Key figures in the administration, ranging from Vice President JD Vance to Christopher Rufo, have been describing Hungary as a model for America for years. But it's also evident in their policies. 

Jennifer Victor, a political scientist at George Mason University, recently combed through a database of 2,714 different policies and initiatives from the second Trump administration — looking specifically for attacks on voting rights, the rule of law, civil liberties, and free elections. She found that two-thirds of the events fell into at least one of these categories, with the rule of law and civil liberties the primary targets.

She found few attacks on free elections and almost no efforts to curtail voting rights. But this, she notes, is because of the way authoritarians sequence their attacks: typically going after the rule of law first to pave the way for other violations.

“Consolidating power by overpowering the other branches of government is a necessary step to corrupting elections, compromising voting rights, and restricting civil liberties — in other words, compromising the rule of law is the first step in creating a fully autocratic state,” she writes. 

This is indeed how democracy died in Hungary: Orbán consolidated political power and then wielded it against more and more targets. But the mere fact that Trump is trying something similar does not mean he is succeeding.

In fact, the evidence suggests that he is not.

Trump has certainly had some successes. He has managed to destroy USAID, acting as if he had broad power to redirect congressionally appropriated funds in the process. He illegally sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, and so far has refused to comply with court orders to bring him back.

But Hungary shows that the key question is not whether a would-be authoritarian wins specific fights. Rather, it's whether they can force widespread acquiescence to their policies. Without courts routinely ruling in his favor, or the press on his side, Orbán would not have been able to get away with everything he did.

Trump does not enjoy this kind of consent. At nearly every turn, key alternative power centers are standing up and fighting.

According to data from the legal news site Lawfare, there are currently 255 lawsuits against various Trump administration policies; 108 of those cases have yielded temporary pauses or permanent orders ending Trump administration policies. The Trump administration has only received favorable orders in about 30, with the remainder awaiting decisions. 

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

The rulings against Trump are not small-ball. Courts have blocked Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, ordered him to disburse suspended National Institutes of Health grants, and restored visas to international students targeted for deportations. Each of these orders represented a significant curtailment of Trump's assault on the rule of law. And, as far as we know, the White House has complied with the rulings.

While any lower court ruling might be overturned by the Supreme Court, the conservative justices are not signaling an intent to act like pure partisans. They have already issued two major rulings requiring Trump to pay USAID contractors and to, at least temporarily, cease deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Clearly, Trump has not engineered the kind of compliant judiciary that paved the way for Orbán's rise. 

The story is similar with the press. While he has certainly attempted to intimidate reporters into silence — by, for example, punishing the Associated Press when it refused to use the term “Gulf of America” — it's clear from the headlines that most of the American press is not running scared.

Since Trump took office, there has been a constant stream of negative coverage — including the sort of exposés that are most likely to hurt his standing with the public. Trump has not been able to scare the New York Times and Washington Post away from the sort of hard-hitting stories on the administration they publish daily.

And the same is true for other power centers in the business world and civil society.

In the early weeks, it seemed like Trump might be winning Hungarian-style compliance. Heads of major corporations, including Silicon Valley's biggest companies, attended Trump's inauguration. Columbia University and big law firms like Paul Weiss made major concessions to Trump amid pressure. 

By April, that dynamic had flipped.

American corporations are in the midst of a collective freakout about Trump's tariffs, which pose a major threat to their profits. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists are increasingly angry about the import duties, with prominent pro-Trump venture capitalist Marc Andreessen going radio silent amid the fallout. Both Business Insider and the Financial Times have published stories about finance types turning on the administration. 

Among universities, Columbia's acquiescence is looking like an increasingly lonely stance. Harvard has filed a major lawsuit against Trump's attempt to cut off billions in federal research dollars. The Ivies and other elite schools have formed a collective strategy group for pushing back, and the Big Ten universities have developed a mutual legal defense compact. Over 150 university presidents published a letter denouncing Trump's attempt to bully American colleges.

Law firms, too, are changing their tune. While nine firms have signed deals with Trump to get him to back off, and many of the biggest firms are still on the fence, over 500 signed an amicus brief supporting the firm Perkins Coie's effort to fight Trump in court. The firms that have chosen to cut a deal with Trump are facing internal crises, including attorney resignations and recruitment difficulties.

Orbán's success at grabbing power depended on an ability to force or win compliance from democratic watchdogs and civil society. Trump has tried to the same — and he has failed repeatedly

Orbán-style authoritarianism cannot ignore public opinion: It depends crucially on enough people actually buying what they're selling. In Hungary, that critical mass can be relatively small in number. Election rules are so stacked in their favor that Fidesz can win two-thirds majorities in parliament fairly easily, even while alienating major segments of the population.

But Trump has not yet been able to do rig elections, or win enough support from key institutions to pass laws that would do so. His ability to maintain enough power to keep attacking democracy depends critically on public support. And he is losing it.

Never truly popular, Trump has seen mass discontent in the weeks following his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.

The New York Times poll average shows that his support is weaker than every 21st-century president at this point in their presidency save one — Trump himself during his first term. Another poll average shows Trump, from the data journalist G. Elliott Morris, shows him performing even worse than at this point in 2017. 

While much of this decline is economy-related, his favorability is collapsing on issues across the board. Perhaps most surprisingly, Trump is losing his longstanding advantage on immigration amid Democratic attacks on the Abrego Garcia case. By late April, most polls were showing him in negative territory on the issue.

The latest New York Times/Sienna poll, one of the most respected in American politics, suggested voters are reacting to a perception of overreach. While they may have once looked at Trump's blizzard of executive actions and seen a president getting things done, they now see a president who is dangerously exceeding his powers to make changes they don't want.

“A clear majority of voters say the president has already gone too far — too far toward changing the economic and political system, too far with the tariffs, too far with the spending cuts, too far on immigration enforcement” the Times's Nate Cohn explains. “Just 31 percent of voters approved his handling of the Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia case — his lowest approval rating in the poll — and he would find himself on even weaker footing should he push further.”

The tariffs have also played a central role in his collapsing support — among both business elites and the mass public. Threatening to tank the economy does tend to produce a political backlash.

This damage can be seen as a kind of byproduct of Trump's authoritarian vision. Trump has a bizarre view of tariffs' effects on the economy, one that he could not fully implement in his first term. Now, as he pushes the limits of his power, he could indeed put this reality into power — following other elected autocrats, like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose idiosyncratic economic policies created major problems for their regime down the line. 

In essence, Trump's authoritarianism is sowing the seeds of its own failure.

Why are things going so poorly for Trump? Simply put: Trump is doing Orbánism all wrong.

Most Hungarians in 2010 wanted their country to be a democracy; recent polls suggest they still do. Had Orbán simply announced an intent to go after the press' financial independence or get rid of unfriendly judges, he would have encountered mass opposition — not just from the public, but also from Hungarian elites and the European Union.

Instead, his aim was to neutralize potential threats before they even realized they were under threat. Once that realization arrived, the free press was already shrunken and the courts were on his side.The business world was so corrupted that if a wealthy Hungarian challenged the state, the state destroyed him. Even today, at a moment where support for a charismatic new opposition leader is rising, the electoral system is so compromised that he may not have any real chance to unseat Orbán.

Trump's weakness can be exploited — but that depends solely on American society's commitment to doing so.

Trump has not displayed the patience or strategic acumen for such a subtle accumulation of power.

Instead of taking the time to quietly weaken the courts and systematically marginalize the press, he bull-rushed ahead with flamboyant moves like stripping billions in research dollars from Ivy League schools and sending alleged criminals to a Salvadoran gulag. He was acting as if he had already attained absolute power; that nothing the courts, the press, or the Democrats could say or do mattered.

This big-picture strategic error — a version of putting the authoritarian cart before the horse — was compounded by poor tactical choices.

“A lot of the plans are rushed and poorly thought out,” says Robert Mickey, a political scientist at Michigan who studies anti-democratic politics in America. “Given that public opinion and the midterms have a big effect on at least short-term successes, it hurts his authoritarian goals.”

You can see this clearly in the way that his war on law firms and universities is increasingly going south. At first, threatening punishments produced compliance. But then the Trump administration began making additional demands — threatening to reimpose sanctions if the targets did not submit. This made Trump look unreliable, and resistance appear a more reasonable option.

“The Trump administration is playing its hand very badly,” the political scientist Henry Farrell writes. “If Trump had been more willing to accept defectors into his camp, by sticking to deals that gave them something worth having, he would be in a much stronger situation than he is at the moment.”

There is also a problem of simple incompetence. Reportedly, Harvard's leadership desperately wanted to make a deal with the Trump administration along the lines of Columbia's concession. But then the Trump administration sent them a list of demands so extreme, amounting to putting the university under direct federal control, that Harvard had no choice but to fight.

So, if all this is true, does that mean that everything will sort itself out? American democracy is saved?

No, of course not.

It's possible — perhaps not likely, but possible — that Trump could become more savvy as the term goes on. He could correct some of his own most obvious errors, by (for example) fully backing down on the tariffs. There's also a possibility that he makes a naked bid for power, like open defiance of a court order, and it works. 

The failure of Trump's assault on democracy is not inevitable. Its current troubles are a result, in large part, of American society's willingness to fight: its sense that resistance is not only feasible but necessary. His weakness can be exploited — but that depends solely on American society's commitment to doing so.

Fewer people are dying from opioid overdoses. Trump threatens that progress.

by  Dylan Scott

Just two years ago, the US was suffering through the worst stretch of its long-running drug overdose crisis. More than 110,000 Americans had died in the previous 12 months from an overdose — almost twice the number of people who died in all of the Vietnam War.

But late last year, the country got some unexpected good news: Overdose fatalities had fallen by 10 percent. It was the first drop of any kind since 2018, but here's the really good news: While in 2018, deaths only plateaued for a few months before rising again, the current decline appears to be sustaining and even accelerating. According to the most recent national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deaths in 2024 were down a whopping 26 percent, to less than 81,000 over the preceding 12 months. New county-level CDC data reveal some communities in the states hit hardest by the opioid epidemic — such as West Virginia, New Hampshire, and Ohio — have seen deaths fall by 40 percent to 50 percent over the past year.

Too many people are still dying preventable deaths, but the decline nonetheless represents a significant improvement in a problem that has bedeviled public health officials since the opioid epidemic began to take off in the 2000s.

Nobody is quite sure — and several of the experts I spoke to fear the downturn could be temporary. But there are a few plausible explanations. 

First, the pandemic is over. Overdose deaths rose sharply during 2020 and 2021, likely for a combination of reasons. People were more isolated, for one, and health care providers were overwhelmed. That's no longer the case.

People who use opioids and other deadly drugs also now know about the particular risks of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids and are being more cautious. There is the contentious theory that the pool of potential victims has shrunk: More than 1.5 million Americans have died from overdoses since 2000, and many of the people who were most vulnerable to becoming dependent on opioids and overdosing may have, sadly, been among that group. It is also possible that people are shifting away from opioids like heroin and fentanyl and toward other drugs that are less deadly. More people are taking nonlethal drugs such as cannabis and psychedelics, and the use of cocaine and other illicit stimulants has also been growing; they still present a public health risk, especially with reports of cocaine laced with fentanyl, but these substances lead to fewer deaths on average. 

The US has also invested billions of dollars into public health campaigns to reduce overdose deaths. We are not only increasing users' awareness about fentanyl, for example, but some public health departments have also provided millions of free testing strips so people who use opioids can easily check whether what they are using could quickly and unexpectedly kill them. Access to opioid addiction treatments like methadone and buprenorphine, too, has been greatly expanded through government and philanthropic investments.

And perhaps most importantly in the prevention of unnecessary overdose deaths, naloxone — Narcan, the nasal spray that rapidly reverses opioid overdoses — is omnipresent. You can find it in vending machines in police stations, libraries, and public schools around the country. Nearly 70,000 lifesaving doses were administered in 2021 by emergency responders.

“Increased naloxone distribution has saved countless lives by reversing opioid overdoses in real time,” Jessica Hulsey, founder of the Addiction Policy Forum, told Vox.

This was a hard-fought public health victory: While some people have at times objected to placing a drug overdose treatment in a public health setting, the harm-reduction argument that we should make these interventions widely available to save as many lives as possible has largely won out.

Even as the good news rolls in, President Donald Trump's health department is currently working on plans to reduce federal spending on opioid treatments by millions of dollars. 

A draft budget, recently obtained by several news organizations, including Vox, would specifically terminate programs that supply Narcan to health centers, doctors, and first responders, as well as programs to train first responders on how to use the drug during an overdose emergency. Other programs focused on drug abuse treatment and support would also be eliminated, according to the document.

To be clear, this is only a draft document, and the president's budget, even when finalized, is rarely adopted exactly as it is written. Congress will have its say, and lawmakers have shown support for substance abuse treatment in recent years.

But the proposal nonetheless raises the risk that the US will take a step backward after finally making progress in reducing the toll of opioids. If the programs were to ultimately be eliminated, some day, a health center might not have Narcan on hand when a patient comes through the front door experiencing an overdose. Or an EMT might find their supply runs out, and they don't have any naloxone spray available when an overdose call comes in.

The move by the Trump administration to cut these successful programs would seem to undermine their own goals to curb the opioid crisis. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spoken openly about his own heroin addiction, said just days ago that “we need Narcan” — even as his department drafts plans to cut it. 

In his first term, Trump promised to end the opioid epidemic, and he signed some of the first significant legislation to provide federal funding to combat it before the pandemic sent overdose deaths soaring. Now, within the early days of his second term, Trump framed his tariff policy around the goal of stopping fentanyl or its ingredients from being smuggled into the US. 

“The recent drop in overdose deaths is extremely welcome news, yet there is still a colossal amount of work to be done,” Andrew Kessler, the founder of Slingshot Solutions, a consulting firm focused on mental health and substance abuse, told Vox. “Just as with HIV, Covid, or any other public health emergency, the keys are investments in research, practicing prevention, and evidence-based treatment. It is a tried-and-true formula that should not be deviated from.”

Could it make a real war more likely?

by  Joshua Keating

When it comes to the escalating trade war with China, the most obvious historical analogy for the US launching an all-out economic assault on a rising military power in East Asia is not an encouraging one. 

Starting in 1940, the US, alarmed by Imperial Japan's invasion of China and burgeoning alliance with Nazi Germany, began passing a series of increasingly severe restrictions on exports of the raw materials needed by the Japanese military. These eventually culminated in a complete freeze on Japanese funds and assets held in the US and an embargo on oil exports. The hope was that this would force Japan, overwhelmingly dependent on energy imports, to curb its military ambitions. 

Instead, believing war with the United States to be inevitable, the Japanese launched a preemptive strike on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. 

We're not quite there yet, but it's worth keeping in mind that the trade war between the world's two most powerful countries is taking place within the context of growing military tension. Just as President Donald Trump was first announcing his tariffs at the beginning of April, the Chinese military was wrapping up its latest live-fire drills around Taiwan. Though demonstrations like these have become relatively common as tensions have grown in the Taiwan Strait, the latest drills were significantly larger and, some analysts believe, revealed significant details about the tactics China is likely to use to take the island. 

Those drills came along with recent reports of “invasion barges” China may use to bring troops ashore on Taiwan, accusations that Chinese ships are intentionally severing undersea internet cables, and a host of flare-ups in long-running territorial conflicts involving China's neighbors Japan and the Philippines. 

The juxtaposition of these shows of military dominance with Trump's “Liberation Day” — led by a 54 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which has since risen to 145 percent as China has retaliated with tariffs of its own — is a reminder that the trade war can't be separated from wider geopolitical tensions. 

Though they're sometimes discussed as somewhat separate issues in the US, the Chinese government has made clear it sees little distinction. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,” China's foreign ministry posted on X after the White House announced the first round of tariffs in March. 

While recent comments from the White House and reports from Beijing suggest the two sides may be looking to cut back on at least some of the tariffs, it's hard to imagine that the world's most important economic relationship will return entirely to normal or that the tension won't spill over into noneconomic areas. 

“Trump clearly thinks that he can separate economics and security issues, and I think the Chinese will want to demonstrate that that's not the case.” said Zack Cooper, a senior fellow studying US-China competition at the American Enterprise Institute. 

Cooper says experts were already concerned about China testing the new administration's response to a regional provocation, and that the atmosphere of mistrust and uncertainty created by the tariff war adds to the risks of a crisis spiraling out of control.

In short, we're forced to confront the question of whether the trade war could make a real war more likely. 

Many of the officials Trump has appointed to senior positions — including his secretary of state and national security adviser — are considered China hawks, but a notable feature of the president's second term has been the relative lack of focus on competition with China outside of trade policy. “China hawks are losing influence in Trumpworld,” ran the headline of a recent Economist article, which notes that even some of the most hardline voices in the administration have recently moderated their tone, saying Taiwan is not an “existential” issue for the US, for instance. 

Trump himself has been equivocal about whether the US should defend Taiwan, has threatened to withdraw troops from US allies like South Korea and Japan as leverage in trade talks, and the US military has actually moved some valuable military resources out of East Asia. The contrast between Trump's rhetoric and that of Joe Biden — who made competition with an axis of autocracies led by China a central motif of his presidency — is striking. The only mention of China in Trump's inaugural address was in the context of Panama.

This doesn't mean Trump has de-escalated. China remains the “pacing challenge” for the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Hegseth himself recently visited Japan and the Philippines to discuss bolstering alliances to counter an increasingly assertive People's Republic. The latest House Republican defense spending proposal contains $11.1 billion for Pacific deterrence. But there's no indication that Trump is looking for a military conflict with China — or that China is interested in one with the US. 

Trump's advisers say he's interested in sitting down for “man-to-man” talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that could encompass trade as well as other issues, such as nuclear security. But the Chinese, confident in their ability to weather the tariffs, have shown no interest in leader-to-leader talks, instead launching a diplomatic offensive to attempt to dissuade other governments from cutting their own deals with Washington. 

The Chinese government has a longstanding and deeply held belief that US military and economic policy are aimed at preventing China from achieving its rightful status as a regional and global military power. And Trump's tariffs are no exception. 

“The Chinese view the trade war as a means to suppress their economic development and to isolate them from global trade,” said Amanda Hsiao, China director at the Eurasia Group. 

Most experts don't believe China would use military force as a direct response to trade policy. China is not going to invade Taiwan to get Trump to abandon his tariffs, in other words. But the tariffs raise the likelihood of miscalculation.

“What I worry about is that Chinese respond to some action we've taken on Taiwan that gets misinterpreted as a response to an action to the trade war,” said Evan Medeiros, former senior director for Asia on the White House National Security Council, during a panel discussion last week. “In a situation like we have today, where communication channels are almost zero, the prospects for a serious strategic miscommunication leading to a military action is very, very serious.”

Senior US and Chinese military officials held their semiannual talk in Shanghai meant to address just those sorts of miscalculations on April 3, the day after the tariffs were announced. Hsiao said that whether more talks like these are held going forward will be a good indication of whether the tariffs have had a serious impact on the security relationship. The regular meetings had been suspended by China — along with a range of other forms of cooperation, including talks on climate change and fentanyl — as a reaction to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan in 2022. 

One reason that it will be difficult to entirely compartmentalize the tariff war and military competition is that — despite its best efforts — US military supply chains are still dependent on technology and raw materials from China. In recent days, senior US officials have reportedly been scrambling to address the fallout from China's new restrictions on the export of so-called rare earth metals — vital for a number of industries, including the defense contractors that manufacture drones and other cutting-edge systems for the US military. 

The fact that the US may be at least partly reliant on China to build the drones it wants in order to potentially fight China highlights the most bizarre difference between the US-China relationship and previous instances of superpower competition: Never before have two military rivals been this economically dependent on each other. Perhaps no one sums up this contradiction more than Trump's billionaire ally Elon Musk, who has made himself an invaluable component of the US military-industrial complex even as his business empire is deeply reliant on China.

America's economic reliance on a country that poses a potential major military threat is one reason both Republican and Democratic politicians have called for “decoupling” the two economies, or at least “friendshoring” — encouraging US companies to deepen their ties with US allies rather than adversaries. 

This now appears, to a large extent, to be happening. In one dramatic development this past week, Apple announced that it will shift assembly of US iPhones — an emblem of US-Chinese economic integration if there ever was one — to India. 

But are there downsides to decoupling? Economic interdependence has also created more points of dialogue between the US and China — at the government, business, and civil society levels — and quite literally raised the costs of increasing tension. 

“If the tariff war continues in its current format, most likely we're looking at the decoupling of the two economies, and that will give the two countries potentially less incentive to try to work out issues together,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center. That will lead to a situation, she said, where “the only thing to prevent the US and China from going to war is war itself.”

The horror of war itself, she noted, is still a pretty serious incentive to avoid war. After all, the US and Soviet Union avoided war for 40 years, not because they were concerned about the global economy but because it could have been literally apocalyptic, as they could be with a US-China war today. But given the stakes of a potential miscalculation, the dangers of losing some of the few remaining points of contact between the two sides should not be dismissed. 

The idea that trade can prevent war, or at least make it less likely, is not a new one. “It is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete, by strengthening and multiplying the personal interests which are in natural opposition to it,” philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote in 1848. 

Obviously, this prediction was a bit premature, and the “capitalist peace” theory has always had a few exceptions. Contra Thomas Friedman's famous “Golden Arches” theory, a number of countries with McDonald's have, in fact, gone to war with one another, most recently in Ukraine. 

But it's also hard to believe it's a coincidence that international wars — as opposed to internal civil conflicts — became exceedingly rare in the last few decades of the 20th century, just as economic globalization in tandem with the exponential growth of international trade.

Trump's assault on the international trading system comes at a time when the number of conflicts, including international ones, are starting to creep up again, and tensions between the world's superpowers are already at a worryingly high level. 

“We are in terra incognita a bit,” said Medeiros. “The US hasn't had this kind of trade war with any country since the 1930s, so we're all sort of walking around in a very dark room trying to understand how the actors are going to behave.”

Advice author Lysa TerKeurst has a devoted Christian audience, a dozen bestselling books — and she's divorced.

by  Aja Romano

For decades, Christian relationship advice has trended toward regressive ideas about gender: namely, that women should be submissive to their husbands, who in turn are the head of the household. Those ideas arguably penetrated the mainstream with the rise of the tradwife and the idyllic image of the monogamous home life she represents. 

Yet the romantic lives of modern Christian advice-givers are often a lot more complex than the traditional marriage roles they espouse. Millions of Christian conservative women who follow these authors seem to recognize that the writers' imperfections are part of a longer journey toward self-improvement — a journey that might also reflect their own.

Nowhere is that contradiction more evident than in mega-successful Christian author and influencer Lysa TerKeurst. 

On her way to amassing 3 million followers across social media, writing half a dozen New York Times bestsellers, and launching her own media network, TerKeurst has made messy confessionals a core part of her brand. TerKeurst spent most of the 2010s building her brand out of affirmative, Instagram-ready self-help advice, leaning heavily on the wholesome image of her family and her 25-year marriage. But then, something happened that might have been a dealbreaker for other Christian authors: TerKeurst got a divorce. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Similar episodes have damaged the careers of Christian celebrities who were branded “false teachers” and could not overcome perceptions of having sinned. TerKeurst, however, not only acknowledged her own failed relationship — she mined it for further wisdom, placing her among a new wave of Christian self-help authors, who are writing more candidly about their struggles. TerKeurst's audience has responded by making her one of the most successful authors in the genre: She currently has not one, not two, but five books concurrently on the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Christian bestsellers list. 

TerKeurst's popularity appears to demonstrate a longing for a less rigid, more forgiving view of Christian relationships, even as her fans continue to revere the idea of a traditional marriage.

For decades, the average Christian self-help book has framed marriage as a divinely ordained arrangement that's ultimately about serving God and reifying gender roles. Classic texts like 1963's Fascinating Womanhood and 1984's Passion and Purity that are still popular today forward antiquated views on women (for example that man is “the initiator,” woman “the responder” and “helper”), while the purity culture that dominated the books of the '90s continues to influence today's authors. 

From the beginning, TerKeurst was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers.

The theme of women's submission to men was and is ubiquitous. To get a flavor, just read a passage from Stormie Omartian's 1996 bestseller The Power of a Praying Wife: “Lord, help me to be a good wife,” she writes. “Take my selfishness, impatience, and irritability and turn them into kindness, long-suffering, and the willingness to bear all things.”

It was into this crowded, archaic environment that TerKeurst, in the early 2000s, launched her long and determined writing career, peddling general advice aimed mainly at Christian women. From the beginning, she was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. 

In 2002, for example, she published a pair of guides, one for men and one for women, in which she outlined her marriage philosophy. She parroted the usual evangelical tropes about submission and gender difference (one chapter of her women's guide is titled “Boys will be boys”), but she also pointed out to men that “Your wife needs you to be her teammate in raising the kids and taking care of the home.”

TerKeurst also blogged incessantly, gradually building a following by focusing on lifestyle and dieting advice. Among her key attributes was vulnerability: In 2008, she wrote about getting an abortion a few months after she began dating her husband, and how the accompanying guilt and shame subsequently impacted her marriage. 

Her breakout success didn't come until her 14th release, 2011's Made to Crave: Satisfying Your Deepest Desire With God, Not Food. TerKeurst's spin on diet culture, and the divine stamp she put on the pressure to be thin, proved popular. The book wound up hitting the New York Times bestseller list, reportedly selling 200,000 copies in nine months. From there, TerKeurst became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today, helping her reach a wider audience. 

Her bite-sized, memorable aphorisms around the messages of self-image and empowerment (e.g. “those who constantly try to impress others will depress themselves”) were tailor-made for the early years of Instagram and other social media, alongside a perpetual barrage of family photos with attractive filters of her husband and their five kids. While her blog frequently embraced her struggles as a mother and wife, her social media image was a pastel montage of a cozy life of family, fabulous vacations, and famous friends, as well as loving tributes to her husband, businessman Art TerKeurst. 

From the start of her writing career, TerKeurst wrote about ongoing issues in her marriage; in 2002's Capture Her Heart, she wrote about starting off the marriage with a host of issues and seeing multiple couples counselors without success. A decade and a half later, in a since-deleted 2017 blog post, TerKeurst revealed that her husband had been having an affair for several years, as well as experienced substance abuse. “I've always encouraged women to fight for their marriages and to do everything possible to save them when they come under threat,” she wrote. “So, for the past couple of years I have been in the hardest battle of my life trying to save my marriage.” 

The news drew shocked reactions, but many of TerKeurst's fans were sympathetic. “Art and Lisa TerKeurst are a fairly ‘famous' Christian family,” one Christian blogger wrote after TerKeurst's post announcing her divorce. “Now, through her transparency in the demise of her marriage, I have learned something about my marriage ... At some point, Art TerKeurst made one bad choice that led to a slew of others. And so can I. And so can my spouse. And so can you and yours.”

Despite her intent to get a divorce, the following year the couple renewed their vows instead in a high-profile ceremony. That new recommitment didn't last, however; in 2022, TerKeurst detailed in an Instagram post that despite ongoing efforts to repair her marriage, her husband had continued to cheat, ultimately firming her resolve to choose divorce. 

“I've had to learn the hard way there's a big difference between mistakes (which we all make) and chosen patterns of behavior that dishonor God and the biblical covenant of marriage,” she wrote.

TerKeurst wasn't the only high-profile Christian advice author who was caught up in a divorce scandal through this period; Christian blogger Glennon Doyle had a similar experience in 2016, only to swiftly fall for another woman, break with evangelical culture, and start a hit liberal podcast. 

TerKeurst, though, chose a less rebellious path: She continued to publish her relationship advice to her audience of Christian women looking for love in a so-called traditional marriage — only now her emphasis shifted to processing the trauma of a failed relationship. Rather than sticking out a toxic situation at all costs, she now leaned into the idea of letting God help her and her audience heal from heartbreak and betrayal while learning to set boundaries. 

“We can't enable bad behavior in ourselves and others and call it love,” she wrote in 2022's Good Boundaries and Goodbye. “We can't tolerate destructive patterns and call it love.” And in 2024's I Want to Trust You, but I Don't: “Rebuilding trust requires a combination of three things: Time, believable behavior, and a track record of trustworthiness.” 

This message of empowerment and insistence on the right to exit a floundering relationship is a far cry from the vast majority of Christian advice literature, with its emphasis on submission and staying in the marriage at all costs. But it's increasingly a part of the literary and social media diet of Christian women.

“Christian women authors, as with many mainstream women authors, derive a lot of their authority from their vulnerability,” journalist Katelyn Beaty, author of Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church, told Vox in an email. “Self-disclosure in the form of storytelling is a kind of credentialing.” 

Writers like Rebekah Lyons and Ann Voskamp, for example, have opened up about their mental health struggles, while others like Jennie Allen have been painfully honest about their relationship struggles, such as Allen's husband's ongoing depression. 

Overly idealized social media feeds and stories from influencers have even drawn backlash from audiences for presenting a false view of Christianity. Women are now gravitating toward influencers like TerKeurst who offer a less glossy version of their lives. 

“Christian women want to feel that their favorite authors and Instagram follows are as flawed and ‘broken' as they are,” Beaty said, “even if they still appear on social media with perfect hair, beautiful families, and fashionable clothing.” 

“Christian influencers and self-help experts are still held to a high moral and spiritual standard,” she added, citing influential figures like Carl Lentz, who was fired from Hillsong Church after an affair and allegations of abusing his staff. “But authors may be held to a lower standard than people in official church and ministry leadership positions…Christians can relate strongly to a story of confessing sin, admitting brokenness, and seeking forgiveness and change.” 

While TerKeurst's embrace of her own relationship difficulties has only boosted her marketability, she isn't without controversy. Her conservative detractors have claimed that she's too liberal, while others have accused her of forwarding various “non-Biblical claims,” including “instructing men,” and for allying with proponents of the controversial prosperity gospel. Other critics have pointed out that her media company, Proverbs 31 Ministry, accepted $690,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loans following the pandemic, despite her lucrative income; her speaker fees alone reportedly range from $20,000 to $30,000.

In 2024, about two years after TerKeurst's divorce announcement, she remarried and restarted newlywed life. Her books, however, are still looking backward: Her next release, due this fall, is titled Surviving an Unwanted Divorce. 

TerKeurst has managed to develop a deep bond with her readers and constructed a durable fan base by strategically sharing bits of herself, knowing she wasn't alone in her experiences. “This beautifully honest, candid and encouraging book has been a therapist, a nurse and a friend to me throughout the darkest winter of my life,” one reviewer wrote of the 2023 devotional collection You're Going to Make It. “Thank you Lysa. By sharing your journey, you eased mine. I am very grateful.”

What happens if you get a life-changing device implanted…and the company that maintains it goes bankrupt?

by  Julia Longoria

After Jennifer French, a young professional in consumer tech, fell down a ski slope and broke her spine in 1998, she couldn't tell you what exactly happened next. The next few months passed in a blur; she hadn't yet fully accepted her prognosis — paralysis for life — when she came across a clinical trial that promised to help her walk again. 

In a surgery that lasted over seven and a half hours, researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, implanted electrodes in her muscles that would allow her to move her legs via an external remote control. These electrodes were kind of like a system of artificial nerves. Nearly two years after her accident, French was able to stand on her own, using what she calls her “RadioShack box” to “turn on” her muscles.

Case Western's clinical trial initially only promised a temporary cure. But a company, Neuro Control, had already signed on to commercialize the device, so French was under the impression that she was on the road to keep the device long-term. So in 2001, when French got the news that the company was struggling, she was distraught, unsure what would happen next. Would she be paralyzed all over again, with electrodes abandoned inside her body?

Abandonment is a phenomenon experienced by hundreds of neurotech implant patients across the globe. Journalist Liam Drew, a former academic neuroscientist, has been reporting on the phenomenon for about eight years and originally followed French's story for a 2022 piece in Nature. He says French is one of the lucky ones — Case Western researchers have been able to find a way to support the device for patients like French over the last 20 years. But Drew talked to patients who'd had a life-changing technology implanted in their bodies only to have it completely abandoned. 

On the latest episode of the Unexplainable podcast, host Julia Longoria learns about these patients' stories and how a now burgeoning neurotech industry might prevent others from getting abandoned in the future. Listen below, or in the feed of your favorite podcast app.

In a recent interview, Harvard University dropout Mark Zuckerberg said that he's not sure if colleges are preparing students enough for today's job market.

""I'm not sure that college is preparing people for like the jobs that they need to have today,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with comedian Theo Von published on Monday. ""I think there's a big issue on that and like all the student debt issues are like really big issues.""

The Meta CEO said that college could be a formative ""social experience"" for students, as many leave home for the first time. Still, some people will have to decide whether higher education is worth going into debt.

""It would be one thing if it were just kind of like a social experience,"" he said. ""If it's not preparing you for the jobs that you need and you're kind of starting off in this big hole, then I think that's not good. That I think there's gonna have to be a reckoning with and people are gonna have to kind of figure whether that makes sense.""

According to data from CollegeBoard, the average student loan debt for those who graduated in 2022-23 was $29,3000 per borrower. Gen Z graduates this year face a tough job market amid layoffs in the tech and government sectors.

One 2024 study from Deloitte showed that a third of Gen Z and millennials opt out of higher education due to costs and career choices that don't require a degree.

""It's sort of been this taboo thing to say of like, maybe not everyone needs to go to college because there's, like, a lot of jobs that don't require that,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But I think people are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe like 10 years ago.""

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in 2005 while a sophomore to focus on growing Facebook. Twelve years later, he received an honorary degree.

The CEO said in the interview that he met many people in college ""who are really important in my life,"" including his wife, Priscilla Chan, Facebook cofounders, and people who are still close friends.

""It was good, I feel like you need some time kind of away from home a bit before you like, fully go out,"" he said of his time at boarding school and college.

When asked if students should be learning about artificial intelligence in middle or high school, Zuckerberg said technology changes a lot and that he's not using the same skills he learned when he was 15. Still, he added that there could be value in ""understanding the technology and understanding how to use it.""

Zuckerberg also said having good mentors or teachers is valuable, regardless of the class.

""When I was in boarding school, I really liked studying Latin and Greek, and that's like, not useful for any practical thing,"" he said, ""But it's fun.""

A Meta spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Google is making changes to its compensation structure in a bid to incentivize higher performance from staff.

The company announced on Tuesday that it would change how employee performance ratings work. The change gives more staff the opportunity to achieve one of the highest scores in their annual review and, therefore, higher compensation, while lower performers receive smaller bonuses and equity.

In an email to staff with the subject line ""Strengthening our performance culture,"" John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, said managers would be able to allocate the ""Outstanding Impact"" score to more employees than previously.

""This means more Googlers will have the opportunity to achieve that rating during annual reviews, and their bonus and equity award will be modeled using the O's individual multiplier in 2026,"" he wrote in the email, which was seen by Business Insider.

Googlers' performances are rated once a year using an internal system known as Googler Reviews and Development, or GRAD. An employee's impact is scored on a scale, with ""Not Enough Impact"" being the lowest and ""Transformative Impact"" being the highest. The ranking a Googler is given usually determines their bonus and equity.

Most Googlers fall into the third-highest bracket, ""Significant Impact."" The ""Outstanding Impact"" bucket captures a smaller number of higher performers, while the ""Transformative"" bucket is reserved for a very small number of excelling Googlers. A fifth bucket, ""Moderate Impact,"" falls between Significant and Not Enough.

Casey said Google would also increase the discretionary budget it gives to managers so they can dish out more rewards to high performers who fall within that ""Significant Impact"" bracket.

He added that the changes would be ""budget-neutral,"" meaning employees with lower ratings could receive smaller bonuses and equity in their compensation packages as more of the budget is allocated to the higher brackets.

""We want to be upfront that to fund this we'll be slightly reducing the bonus and equity individual multipliers for Significant Impact and Moderate Impact ratings,"" Casey told staff. ""It's important to note that Significant Impact will remain a strong rating — achieving it will still get you more than your target bonus.""

A Google spokesperson, Courtenay Mencini, told Business Insider in a statement, ""We're making these changes to further reward top performers and continue our momentum across the company.""

The changes at Google have come amid a broader shift across Big Tech to run their businesses more efficiently and push employees to perform better. Microsoft recently rolled out new policies focused on dialing up performance pressure on employees, while in January, Meta announced it would cut 5% of its workforce, focusing on low performers.

While Google hasn't gone to such lengths itself, the changes to its performance ratings are designed to push staff to work harder and aim higher.

""High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set,"" Casey wrote in the email to staff, adding that the changes were being made to ""further reward top contributors"" at the company.

Snap's stock has taken a series of beatings. Now, it's another victim of President Donald Trump's wave of trade restrictions.

On Tuesday, Snap plunged 14% after hours after the social media company reported first-quarter earnings. Revenue and user growth, an important metric for media companies, were roughly in line with expectations. But the company's chief financial officer, Derek Andersen, made one remark that spooked investors.

""Given the uncertainty with respect to how macroeconomic conditions may evolve in the months ahead, and how this may impact advertising demand more broadly, we do not intend to share formal financial guidance for Q2,"" Andersen said on the earnings call.

Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Snap get a lot of their business from Chinese advertisers trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs and other trade restrictions make items expensive and less appealing for Chinese companies to advertise on US platforms.

The CFO also said there will be ""headwinds"" from changes to de minimis, a loophole that lets goods valued at less than $800 enter the US duty-free. As of May 2, de minimis shipments of China-made goods will no longer be allowed.

""We've heard from a subset of advertisers that their spending has been impacted by the changes to the de minimis exemption,"" Andersen said.

In a post-earnings note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson called the results ""challenging"" and highlighted that the company won't provide revenue guidance.

On Tuesday, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino wrote that while Snap's investments in augmented reality and artificial intelligence have helped results, the absence of second-quarter guidance ""is not sitting well with investors"" and likely led to Tuesday's share slide.

Zino added that smaller platforms like Snap are ""potentially more vulnerable"" to tariffs than larger competitors like Meta and Google.

The Snapchat owner has had its share of problems long before Trump's tariffs. It faces stiff competition from Meta products and TikTok and has been posting inconsistent earnings results, sometimes falling short of Wall Street estimates for revenue. Over the past few years, investors have been wary of slowing user growth in important markets like North America and Europe and high spending on machine learning and call-to-action advertising.

Its stock is down close to 40% over the last year and it has lost 66% of its value since its 2017 initial public offering. Then valued between $20 billion and $25 billion, it was, at the time, the biggest IPO on a US exchange since Alibaba debuted in 2014 at a value of $168 billion.

Snap reported first-quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, a 14% increase compared to last year. It reported a net loss of $140 million, compared to a loss of $305 million in the year before. It reached 460 million daily active users, a 9% increase from last year.

How much water should you drink per day?

The answer varies, but it's always way more than six ounces.

So it's puzzling that Hydro Flask — one of the largest water bottle brands in the world — would start selling teeny tiny bottles that are smaller than the average iPhone.

Don't judge the micro bottles by their size, though. Some fans tell Business Insider that they might just be worth the hype.

Reusable water bottles are getting smaller.

Thin Owala bottles usurped Stanley tumblers in 2024, then shorter, thicker Bink bottles had a moment in 2025.

Hydro Flask has taken things a step further — or should I say, smaller.

The brand announced in late February that it was launching the $19 Micro Hydro: a 6.7-inch bottle made in collaboration with Hydro Flask Japan that holds just a few sips of your favorite drink.

That's about 10 ounces less than the average plastic water bottle, and 25 ounces less than the trendy but bulky tumblers that have become standard.

The online-only launch quickly sold out, leading to the brand releasing new colorways in late March. That inventory didn't last a day in its online store, and the product hasn't been restocked.

Currently, Micro Hydro Flasks are only available on resale websites for between $50 and $100 each.

Heidi Ng, a 32-year-old from San Francisco, is a self-described ""water bottle girl."" She's tried options from Stanley, Hydro Flask, and Yeti, and even follows the brands on social media.

That's where she first encountered Micro Hydro Flasks, which she said instantly reminded her of the small water bottles she regularly saw people carrying during her past travels in China.

""It's only here in America that we've popularized 40-ounce bottles,"" she said. ""When I'd visit relatives in Hong Kong, I'd bring my reusable bottle. They would laugh and say: Isn't that heavy? Why do you want to carry that?""

""So I wasn't totally surprised by the size, as maybe some people are,"" she added.

Not everyone understands the product.

On Instagram, some Hydro Flask shoppers have asked why anyone would buy such a small bottle.

In most responses, water wasn't mentioned. Instead, people said they've used their micro bottles to measure small pre-workout drinks, to keep soup hot, and as flasks for alcohol.

Then there's Haley Carter, 28, from Tennessee. She told BI that she's used her micro bottle as ""an emergency milk stash"" to keep the drink cold for her 1- and 3-year-old children on the go.

Geneveive Kelley, a 25-year-old from California, told BI she uses her micro bottle ""for everything"" — but she especially loves using it to carry matcha.

""I have to have a little sweet drink or something like that each day,"" Kelley said. ""So sometimes, I'll put some matcha that I already made…so I can have it later.""

When some fans use the small product to carry water, they're using it because of its convenience.

""It fits in pretty much every single purse that I have, and it fits in my jacket pockets,"" Ng said. ""It actually can be really useful if I'm going out to brunch or somewhere I don't want to carry a full water bottle, and we're walking and talking and I suddenly need a sip.""

Kelley, a big Disney fan, said it's also helped her stay hydrated at Disneyland.

""I hate bringing anything heavy into the park,"" she told BI. ""I wanted something light, and because they have refill stations everywhere, [the Micro Hydro Flask] is really convenient.""

When Hydro Flask restocked its micro bottles in March, Ng said that buying them was like ""getting concert tickets."" She waited in line for 25 minutes to get the item, and at the checkout page, she said her payment wouldn't go through. It just kept processing — a common complaint from people who tried to purchase the micro bottles.

While Ng was lucky enough to secure her purchase eventually, countless fans have shared online that they never made it past that page. The number of people trying to buy the same bottles was just too high.

What all three women — and other shoppers who have posted about the bottle on social media — agree on is that Micro Hydro Flasks aren't necessities. They're just convenient and cute hydration tools.

""People think that I'm replacing my 32-ounce Hydro Flask with a 6.7 Micro Hydro as my form of hydration. That's not happening,"" Kelley said. ""I'm still drinking my normal intake of water. I just happen to have a little accessory that goes with me everywhere.""

President Donald Trump said voters should have expected him to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on the world when they chose to back him in last year's presidential election.

""Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,"" Trump said of the tariffs during an interview with ABC News that aired Tuesday.

""We've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before,"" Trump said.

On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 180 countries. A 10% baseline rate took effect on April 5. A higher set of tariffs, which varied by country, went into effect on April 9 before Trump announced a 90-day pause on the same day.

Trump's on-and-off-again tariff announcements sparked a massive market sell-off and were also criticized by economists and business leaders.

Trump, however, said his tariffs on America's trading partners were a necessary measure.

""I could have left it that way, and at some point, there would have been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it,'"" Trump told ABC News. ""I have wanted to do this for many years.""

Trump has defended his tariff policy on multiple occasions. On April 20, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that business leaders who were against his tariffs didn't appreciate what he was doing for them.

""THE BUSINESSMEN WHO CRITICIZE TARIFFS ARE BAD AT BUSINESS, BUT REALLY BAD AT POLITICS,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Easter Sunday.

""THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OR REALIZE THAT I AM THE GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!"" Trump continued.

Christopher Tsai, the president and chief investment officer of the investment management firm Tsai Capital, told Business Insider that businesses would probably not have enough time to adjust to Trump's tariffs, even with the announced 90-day pause.

Tsai said the tariffs could hurt America's small and midsize businesses and tip the country into a recession. Small businesses make up about 44% of the US GDP, according to the US Chamber of Commerce.

""This is a lot more than numbers. People's jobs are at stake, and businesses that have been thriving and contributing to the economy for years are all of a sudden in an extremely different situation. That's worrisome to me,"" Tsai said.

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment from BI.

BYD is building a massive factory in Hungary as it looks to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla in Europe.

The 300-hectare site on the outskirts of Szeged, Hungary, is expected to have a maximum capacity of around 200,000 vehicles a year, and satellite images provided to BI by Planet Images show how the factory is rapidly taking shape.

Construction of the site began last year, with a Hungarian official confirming last November that the first BYD EV is expected to roll off the line in the second half of 2025.

The estimated €4 billion ($4.5 billion) investment is the latest step in BYD's quest for European domination.

Having conquered China's brutally competitive electric vehicle market, the Chinese EV giant is eyeing overseas expansion, exporting a record number of electric vehicles and hybrids in the first quarter of 2025.

BYD is barred from the US market thanks to high tariffs and faces a 17% import tax in Europe, leading the company to invest in local factories such as the one in Hungary.

The Chinese automaker is also set to break ground on a factory in Turkey in the coming years, and executives at the Warren Buffett-backed automaker have said that plans for a third European factory are under consideration.

That poses a huge threat to Tesla, which has a gigafactory in Germany and counts Europe as its third-biggest market.

Elon Musk's carmaker sold 327,000 vehicles in Europe last year but has seen sales collapse in 2025 amid intense backlash over Musk's interventions in European politics and support for the German far-right AfD party.

Tesla's sales in Europe have fallen 37% in the first three months of the year, while BYD's have surged by nearly 300%.

Hungary has proven to be a welcoming environment for Chinese companies looking to put down roots in Europe.

Battery giant CATL, which is the world's largest manufacturer of EV batteries, is also building a $7.6 billion factory in the country as it seeks to tighten its grip on the continent's battery industry.

The presence of Chinese companies has sparked tensions with the European Union, which counts Hungary as a member.

Last month, The Financial Times reported that the EU was investigating whether BYD's Hungarian plant had received unfair subsidies from the Chinese government.

Target made its first-ever donation to a presidential inauguration this year, contributing $1 million to President Donald Trump's 2025 Inaugural Committee on January 10, according to a recent Federal Election Commission filing.

First reported by The Minnesota Star Tribune, the Minneapolis-based retailer is one of the three major retailers that contributed to Trump's 2025 inauguration, alongside Walmart and e-commerce giant Amazon.

Trump's inauguration received donations from the tech sector as well as from retail. Based on FEC filings, the Trump-Vance inaugural committee raised more than $239 million, a figure that more than doubles what Trump received for inauguration in 2016 and far exceeds the $62 million Biden received in 2020.

Aside from oil companies that donated heavily to Trump's inauguration, large Silicon Valley companies like Google, Meta, and Uber also each contributed $1 million, and individual tech CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook and Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi also made personal donations of similar sums. These companies also watched their shares plunge due to Trump's tariff policies.

Target is likely feeling the sting of Trump's trade policies. Roughly half of the retailer's merchandise is imported, according to what Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer of Target, said in the company's fourth quarter earnings of 2024. In March, Target forecast that its full-year comparable sales could come in below estimates, and said that uncertainty around tariffs as well as consumer spending could weigh on first-quarter profits.

Walmart and Target's respective CEOs also met with Trump last week to discuss the impact of tariffs on consumer prices and on retail supply chains that could lead to product shortages.

Supply chain experts have also previously told Business Insider that while companies like Walmart are heavy on groceries that are predominantly domestic, Target is less insulated from tariffs because it relies heavily on merchandise like apparel, housewares, and beauty products, most of which are imported. Meanwhile, food and beverages accounted for less than a quarter of Target's sales in 2024.

Target shares prices were down by around 40% on April 29 compared to the same day a year ago, and down by over 50% since their 2021 peak.

The inauguration donation followed a year of change for Target. In May of last year, Target said only a fraction of stores would carry Pride merchandise the following month. The decline came after years of prominent Pride displays. The company said in a memo obtained by Business Insider that it would offer a collection online and in certain stores ""based on historical sales performance.""

The same week Trump was inaugurated, the company said it was rolling back its DEI initiatives, such as its DEI goals, investments in Black-owned businesses, and an end to all external diversity surveys. It joined a list of other companies that did away with their DEI initiatives after Trump ordered the end of DEI programs at federal agencies.

An Atlanta pastor named Jamal Bryant called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback, which drew wide participation.

Target and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The latest eye-popping headline in the hedge fund industry's talent war is Steve Schurr's move from Balyasny to Millennium and the $100 million pay package it took to poach him.

Schurr, a former financial journalist at the Financial Times and short-seller who worked with legendary investor Jim Chanos, was a key part of the equities rebuild that $23 billion Balyasny has undergone. He worked alongside the firm's founder and executives, like Archana Parekh, head of Asian equities.

Speaking with Business Insider at the end of 2024 about the firm's thinking about equities investing, Schurr said Balyasny tapped him to build a centralized research function for stockpicking teams that focused on primary research in addition to managing a large portfolio.

Now, he'll be taking his talents to Izzy Englander's $73 billion manager after he sits out a year to comply with the non-compete clause in his contract. His pay package includes incentives that will take years to pay out, according to a person familiar with the matter. Schurr's hire was first reported by Bloomberg. 

Unlike other multistrategy portfolio managers, Schurr didn't want to use alternative data like credit-card receipts to focus on ""triangulating and calling quarters"" by estimating a company's earnings before they're released, calling the popular investing process ""a strategy of diminished expected returns"" when he spoke to BI last year.

In a presentation at a conference at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business this March, Schurr went into greater detail about how he finds opportunities and researches potential investments.

In a recording of his presentation viewed by BI, Schurr described how he applies a short-seller's lens to long bets in his book.

""You turn a situation upside down,"" he said, noting that ""Wall Street is a perpetual optimism machine"" that forces investors to dig deep to find the real valuation of a stock, not just the ""narrative.""

He also used his experience as a short-seller to identify three buckets of stocks with ""certain types of things we should never short.""

Those buckets are:

""I thought of the research process as an extension of the work I did as a journalist,"" he said, noting that ""there's not a secret trove of information that no one else has access.""

""The best thing you can do is doing the research yourself,"" he said, recommending industry conferences and expert networks over sell-side-organized events and meetings with company executives and investor relations teams. He recommended data providers such as 280first, Zion Research, and BamSEC to augment the process.

""Wall Street is an echo chamber,"" he said, and good investors look outside of the normal channels. He pointed to YouTube reviews of consumer products and Reddit forums dedicated to a specific company as places where investors could glean insights from.

On a slide titled ""How We Maintain Performance,"" Schurr outlined that his teams ""thrive in obscurity"" and look for stocks with less than three teams covering the name. Companies with market caps between $1 billion and $5 billion market cap have been a sweet spot for them.

But duration is also critical. The ability to hold a stock through volatile markets is important, Schurr said, telling the students in attendance that ""all the money to be made"" is going to come from yearslong positions, not quarterly wins.

""The market is going to change constantly over the next 20 years,"" he said, and tools like alternative data and artificial intelligence are ""commoditized very quickly.""

""What is durable is deep fundamental equity research,"" he said.

Donald Trump signs an executive order proposing new tariffs at the White House in Washington on Feb. 13.

The Trump administration asked the US trade court to reject a lawsuit by small businesses challenging the president's global tariffs, arguing that judges don't have the authority to review the national emergency he invoked to justify the sweeping levies.

The businesses are improperly questioning the veracity of President Donald Trump's assertion of a national emergency, “inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment,” the Justice Department said in a filing late Tuesday in the US Court of International Trade.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The economic contraction last quarter should make policymakers cautious about an extended trade war.

The trade difference.

Photographer: Eric Thayer/Bloomberg 

The US economy contracted at a 0.3% annualized pace in the first quarter, slightly worse than economists surveyed by Bloomberg had projected. At a high level, the numbers show that the economy is in no position for the White House to forge ahead with its self-sabotaging global trade war that will hurt consumers and businesses. But there's still time to right the ship, and it doesn't mean that a recession is inevitable.

The latest numbers were overwhelmingly dragged lower by a surge in imports, apparently the result of firms trying to front-run Donald Trump's tariff agenda, the most shocking part of which — the so-called “Liberation Day” levies — was unveiled two days after the end of the quarter. GDP math seeks to measure the total production within a country's borders, so statisticians add exports and subtract imports, and the trade figures can make the data seem volatile from quarter to quarter.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

US consumer spending jumped in March while a key measure of inflation decelerated, a welcome reprieve before tariffs are expected to broadly drive up prices.

Inflation-adjusted consumer spending climbed 0.7% last month, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data out Wednesday.

On this episode of Trumponomics, we discuss why India stands to gain from the US trade war with China and the rest of the world.

India's global supply chain role is expanding fast, with companies like Apple seeking to import most of the phones it sells in the US from India rather than China.

Despite the global economic uncertainty unleashed by US President Donald Trump, one country seems to be weathering the turbulence better than most: India. Indeed, investors are even looking at it as a “safe haven” as heightened tensions with Pakistan raise fears of further conflict between the two nations.Both Indian and US officials have hinted at sealing the first part of a trade deal later this year. India's global supply chain role is expanding fast, with companies like Apple seeking to import most of the phones it sells in the US from India rather than China, and the Indian stock market is one of the very few to rally since Trump announced his “reciprocal” tariffs. While the US and other large economies stare down potential recessions in part as a result of Trump's actions, India is expected to grow more than 6%—slower than last year, but still the fastest of other major nations. On this week's episode of Trumponomics, host Stephanie Flanders speaks about this first potential deal tied to Trump's trade war with Bloomberg senior editor Chris Anstey and reporter Shruti Srivastava, as well as Bloomberg Economics senior India economist Abhishek Gupta. They look at how India has been able to pull ahead of rivals as the US roils the world, and specifically whether the Republican in the White House may unintentionally be boosting the South Asian nation's long-term ambitions to replace China as the “factory of the world.” ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro brushed off concerns Wednesday about the unexpected drop in U.S. gross domestic product last quarter, saying, 'We really like where we're at now,"" and pointing to a surge in new domestic investment.

""I got to say just one thing about today's news, that's the best negative print I have ever seen in my life,"" Navarro said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" after the Commerce Department reported that GDP fell at a 0.3% annualized pace in the first quarter of 2025.

""The markets need to, like, look beneath the surface of that"" figure, said Navarro, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

""We had a 22% increase in domestic investment,"" he said.

""That is off the charts when you strip out inventories and the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs, you had 3% growth,"" Navarro said.

""So, we really like where we're at now,"" he added.

Major stock market indices were down in morning trading on the heels of the GDP report, which captured economic data from the first two full months of Trump's second term in the White House.

This is not the first time that Navarro has dismissed concerns about the damaging effect of Trump's policies on the U.S. economy.

Earlier this month, Navarro described a massive April 10 market drop that was fueled by fears Trump's broad new tariffs as ""no big deal.""

That day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points and the benchmark S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks lost 3.46%.

So far this year, the S&P 500 is down more than 7%.

In this article

Snap shares fell more than 15% Wednesday after the social media company withheld second-quarter guidance due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment.

""While our topline revenue has continued to grow, we have experienced headwinds to start the current quarter, and we believe it is prudent to continue to balance our level of investment with realized revenue growth,"" the company said Tuesday, adding that macro conditions could impact advertising demand.

Snap's finance chief Derek Andersen said during an earnings call that some advertisers are already seeing an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption. The loophole, which ends Friday, currently allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.

President Donald Trump's shifting tariff plans have created an unsettling backdrop for companies this earnings season. Fears of a weakening economy have also fueled concerns that companies could ease up advertising spending, where Snap makes a key component of revenues.

The company said ad revenues grew 9% year over year to $1.21 billion during the quarter.

Despite holding back on guidance, Snap reported 14% revenue growth, up from $1.19 billion a year ago to $1.36 billion. Snap's loss also narrowed 54% to $140 million, or 8 cents per share, from about $305 million, or 19 cents, last year. The loss was due to a $70.1 million charge related to cash severance, stock-based compensation expenses and other costs associated with a 2024 restructuring.

Snap also signaled ongoing user growth. Daily active users grew to 460 million, up from 453 million the previous quarter. The company said it hit 900 million monthly active users, up from 850 million in August, the last time Snap provided that stat. DAUs fell to 99 million from 100 million in North America during the period, but Snap says it doesn't expect more declines this quarter.

Many on Wall Street expect the company's lack of visibility into the second quarter and macro backdrop to weigh on shares and adjusted price targets to account for it.

""While [price-to-sales ratio] is nearing a historical bottom and could support stock, we reiterate our neutral rating as Snap has been pressured more than peers in prior macro downturns,"" said Bank of America's Justin Post.

Other social media companies saw shares move lower, including Pinterest and Reddit, last down 4% and 8%, respectively. Meta fell more than 2%.

The most anticipated part of Apple's Thursday earnings won't be iPhone sales or Mac forecasts – it'll be CEO Tim Cook's comments on how the company is dealing with President Donald Trump's tariffs. 

Apple is one of the most exposed companies to Trump's tariffs and expected retaliation. It makes about three-quarters of its overall revenue from physical goods — iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches — mostly made in China or elsewhere in Asia. And the U.S. is its largest market.

""It's how Apple responds to 'everything else' that will set the tone for post-earnings sentiment,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a Monday note.

He has an overweight rating on the stock, and wants to hear what Cook and Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh have to say about how the company is mitigating supply chain and tariffs risks, if Apple will raise prices or eat costs, and the status of Cook's relationships with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Apple hasn't commented on the hefty tariffs Trump announced for every country in the world on April 2, but they represent a deep threat to the iPhone maker's supply chain and sent the company's share price down 9%. 

""We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that,"" Cook said during Apple's January earnings call. Those were the company's most recent comments on Trump's trade policy.

Apple is perhaps the highest-profile example of a company that's gotten caught up in Trump's trade war. 

It's the most valuable U.S. company, hundreds of millions of Americans own iPhones and Cook built his reputation in Silicon Valley as an operations expert who keeps Apple's inventory low and its logistics tight.

But Apple and Cook have stayed tight-lipped publicly even as Trump administration officials called for the company to move iPhone production to the U.S., imagining millions of Americans ""screwing in little screws"" to build the devices.

The White House suggested that Apple was capable of building iPhones in the U.S., something that many analysts said is impossible at worst and would result in a $3,500 iPhone at best. 

""I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business,"" Trump said in an oval office briefing earlier this month after he delayed the highest-tariffs on non-China nations for 90 days. It was a move that boosted Apple stock. Cook has maintained a line of communication with the Trump administration, according to Trump, dating back to his first term.

Now it's time to hear from Apple itself. 

The tariffs are a material issue that will eventually affect the company's financials. TD Cowen predicts that the current tariffs will cost Apple about 6% of its annual earnings this year. Apple reported about $94 billion in profit in its fiscal 2024.

It's not just investors that want a peek into Apple's thinking — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questioned Cook about what he discussed with the Trump administration ahead of the president's decision to pause tariffs on non-China nations.

Apple's share price remains lower than it was on April 2, even though analysts have said the pause will give Apple some flexibility to avoid the highest tariffs, thanks to its production locations in India and Vietnam.

Several recent reports have said that Apple will try to source as many iPhones as possible from from India, which only faces a 10% tariff, to avoid the highest 145% tariffs on China. But although Apple has been ramping up iPhone production in India since 2017, the company has only recently begun to ship commercially significant quantities in recent years, and Apple hasn't confirmed the pivot to India or discussed its Indian production capabilities.

""While it's possible for all 25 million of India capacity to be allocated to the US near-term, we think it could take approximately a year for production to double to 50 million overall,"" TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote Monday, saying that Apple is expected to sell between 65 million and 70 million iPhones in the U.S. this year.

Apple declined to comment on sourcing iPhones to the U.S. from India.

Another closely-watched metric will be Apple's China revenue, which could indicate if rising nationalism will hurt iPhone sales in the company's third largest market, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Some analysts have noted that the smartphone owners in China are more likely to switch phone brands than Western consumers. There's concern that now those Chinese consumers could take cues from media and government officials and buy Chinese phone brands, such as phones made by Huawei.

Dipanjan Chatterjee, principal analyst at Forrester, said that if Apple were to move a lot of production out of China, it would also have to consider if that could upset the Chinese consumer.

""If Apple is going to pull production out of China, that's not going to go down well in that market,"" Chatterjee said. ""They're going to hedge. You're going to see a lot more saying and a little bit of tinkering and not a whole lot of doing.""

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Apple to report $1.62 in earnings per share on $94.19 billion in sales, which would be an almost 4% revenue increase on an annual basis.

In this article

Microsoft President Brad Smith says the U.S. tech giant is committed to respecting European laws — even though it may not always agree with them.

""Like every citizen and company, we don't always agree with every policy of every government. But even when we've lost cases in European courts, Microsoft has long respected and complied with European laws,"" Smith said in a blog post Wednesday.

Smith's comments are part of a charm offensive Microsoft is making in Europe this week, after tensions between the United States and European Union ratcheted up in recent weeks over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Trump's trade war with U.S. trading partners — including the European Union, China and others — has raised fears that the EU could use its regulatory crackdown on America's technology giants as a tool to counter trade restrictions.

The EU has for years been trying to tame U.S. Big Tech firms over competition issues. The bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which became enforceable last year, aims to tackle the market power of large so-called ""gatekeeper"" firms such as Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft.

Last week, the European Commission — the executive body of the EU — fined Apple 500 million euros ($568.5 million) and Meta 200 million euros ($227.4 million) for DMA breaches.

""We understand that European laws apply to our business practices in Europe, just as local laws apply to local practices in the United States and similar laws apply elsewhere in the world. This includes European competition law and the Digital Markets Act, among others,"" Smith said Wednesday.

""We're committed not only to building digital infrastructure for Europe, but to respecting the role that laws across Europe play in regulating our products and services.""

Trump has previously cited the EU's regulatory actions against America's tech giants as a reason to hit the bloc with tariffs. In February, he threatened the bloc with duties to tackle ""overseas extortion"" of U.S. tech firms through digital taxes and fines.

Swiss giant UBS on Wednesday beat bottom line expectations amid sharp returns in investment banking while warning of the global trade impact of sweeping U.S. tariffs as it seeks to rein in steep share declines.

Net profit attributable to shareholders hit $1.692 billion in the first quarter, compared with a mean forecast of $1.359 billion in a LSEG poll of analysts. Group revenue over the stretch stood at $12.557 billion, versus analyst expectations of $12.99 billion.

Other first-quarter highlights included:

The lender said it delivered a 32% year-on-year hike in revenues of the global markets unit of its investment banking arm, largely driven by ""higher client activity in equities and FX with gains across all regions."" It also achieved a 15% hike in transaction-based hike in income in its key global wealth management unit.

Speaking to CNBC's Carolin Roth on Wednesday, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti recognized a ""challenging environment"" in the first quarter, with a spate of ""definitely extremely volatile"" first few weeks in April that underpinned spikes in the volume of transactions that at times exceeded Covid-19 levels by 30%.

Critically, the lender posted $1.629 billion in its net interest income (NII) — the difference between earnings from loans and investments and the payments on deposits —  down 16% year-on-year and 11% from the fourth quarter, guiding for further declines in the June quarter.

""In the second quarter we expect net interest income (NII) in Global Wealth Management to decline sequentially by a low single-digit percentage, and we see a similar decline in Personal & Corporate Banking's NII in Swiss francs. In US dollar terms, Personal & Corporate Banking's NII is expected to increase sequentially by a mid-single-digit percentage, based on current foreign exchange rates,"" UBS said.

Investors are keenly watching these metrics as European banks transition to an environment of monetary easing, particularly in Switzerland, which has been combating a strong franc and depressed inflation with interest rates as low as 0.25%.

Ermotti said he is ""not overly concerned"" about interest rate movements.

""I think that we are now in a situation where it's almost like a neutral, fairly boring zone,"" he noted. ""If rates go up or down from here in Swiss francs, then we're going to see a potential pick up in NII. But it's premature to talk about if and when this will materialize.""

Separately, UBS on Wednesday confirmed it had completed $500 million in share buybacks and intended to press ahead with a $2.5 billion repurchase plan for the remainder of 2025.

""Overall a decent set of results, albeit boosted by non-core gains and heightened trading activity in both IB and GWM, all of which may not be sustainable, whereas NII has missed expectations again,"" Citi analysts said in a Wednesday note after UBS reported.

The lender's Swiss-listed shares closed down 0.3% on Wednesday.

Deposed this month as continental Europe's largest bank by market capitalization by Banco Santander, UBS has suffered share declines of roughly 10% in the year to date, with the brunt of losses logged after the White House's imposition of tariffs on global trade partners on April 2.

Switzerland faces a 31% duty if it fails to agree a more conciliatory trade deal by the end of Washington's 90-day reprieve in early July. Comparatively, the European Union was hit with 20% in U.S. levies.

Tensions with Washington and a potential recessionary outlook for the world's largest economy spell trouble for the Swiss banking giant and its money-spinning global wealth management division, with around half of UBS' invested assets concentrated in the broader Americas region last year.

""Rapid and significant changes to trade tariffs, heightened risk of escalation and significantly increased macroeconomic uncertainty led to major market volatility in the first weeks of April,"" UBS said Wednesday. ""With a wide range of possible outcomes, the economic path forward is particularly unpredictable. The prospect of higher tariffs on global trade presents a material risk to global growth and inflation, clouding the interest rate outlook.""

It flagged the possibility of ""further spikes in volatility"" as markets remain sensitive to new tariffs-led developments, noting that ""Prolonged uncertainty would affect sentiment and cause businesses and investors to delay important decisions on strategy, capital allocation and investments.""

""You look at the last 10 days or so, I think there is a little bit of fatigue coming in. I think that investors are now waiting in a wait-and-see mode. Markets have settled down … people are waiting for significant news,"" UBS' Ermotti told CNBC. ""But I do expect spikes of volatilities to come back as positive or negative news unfold.""

The picture of UBS' long-term profitability remains darkened by questions over potential new — and more draconian — capital requirements from Swiss authorities, which have questioned the Swiss titan's ""too big to fail"" status since its absorption of collapsed domestic rival Credit Suisse. The transaction — which one politician at the time dubbed the ""deal of the century"" — has propelled UBS down the path of maximum resistance against further restrictions, which it argues would undermine its competitiveness as an already adequately capitalized entity.

""UBS's lobbying is both visible and unmistakable. It's clearly resonating in various places. But once again: the Federal Council cannot be intimidated by lobbying, but must also represent the interests of taxpayers,"" Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter told broadcaster SRF last month, according to a Google translation.

""The Federal Council has one goal: that in the event of a crisis, a UBS that is systemically important is resolvable. This means that the systemically important parts of the bank can be separated in Switzerland. That must be the goal of the Federal Council and the new legislation.""

UBS is expected to engage with the Swiss Federal Council over any proposed capital requirement changes in June.

Speaking about UBS' odds of competitiveness in the broader Swiss regulatory environment, Ermotti said, ""We are not magicians. We are not going to be able to be competitive and provide and be an engine of growth for the financial center, but also for the economy, if the regulatory framework is not competitive.""

In this article

Etsy shares plunged on Wednesday after the company posted mixed results for the first quarter.

Here's how the company did:

Shares of Etsy tumbled more than 9% in afternoon trading, as stocks fell broadly after new economic data showed a contraction of 0.3%. The data spurred fears the economy was headed toward a recession from President Donald Trump's abrupt policy shifts, primarily around trade.

The e-commerce company reported a net loss of $52.1 million, or a loss of 49 cents per share, compared with a profit of $68 million, or 48 cents per share, a year ago.

Etsy said the results reflected it taking a $101.7 million impairment charge from the sale of Reverb. The company announced earlier this month it will sell off the musical instrument marketplace it acquired in 2019 to focus on its core marketplace and secondhand platform Depop, which it bought in 2021.

Revenue for the quarter was up about 1% to $651.2 million, beating analysts' projected $643 million.

Etsy operates an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers with mostly handcrafted goods. Like many other retailers, the company is digesting the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs, though CEO Josh Silverman said in February that the company is ""vastly less"" dependent on products from China, which was hit by aggressive levies of 145%.

Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said Wednesday that the company is ""staying nimble in the face of uncertainty"" around the tariff announcements and ""the fluid state of consumer confidence in our core markets.""

The company said it also established a ""small operational task force"" to address the tariffs, which has provided buyers and sellers with guidance on shipping timelines, along with other information. Earlier this month, Etsy began highlighting products from domestic sellers on its site as a way for shoppers to circumvent the extra costs associated with Trump's tariffs.

Approximately 90% of sellers source their products domestically, Silverman said on a call with investors.

""We are, of course, monitoring the ricochet impact of higher global tariffs on consumer spending in our core markets, particularly with regard to the cost of items people purchase every day and how this may impact demand for consumer discretionary items,"" Silverman said.

Gross merchandise sales, a key metric that measures the total volume of goods sold on the platform, fell 6.5% year over year to $2.79 billion, which was in line with consensus estimates, according to FactSet.

For the second quarter, Etsy forecast GMS to decline at a rate similar to or ""potentially slightly better than"" the 6.5% rate it saw this quarter.

Active sellers on the platform fell 11.3% year over year to nearly 8.1 million, marking four straight quarters of declines. Active buyers also declined for the second consecutive quarter to 94.8 million. Both figures include sellers and buyers across the core Etsy marketplace, Depop and Reverb.

Etsy has been working to strengthen its image as a destination for unique gifts and products as it looks to return to growth and combats a fiercely competitive e-commerce market dominated by Amazon and, more recently, Chinese online retailers Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.

CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that Etsy's earnings for the quarter were 46 cents per share. A previous version of this story stated an incorrect amount.

In this article

Treasury yields were flat on Wednesday as investors digested key economic data that showed hot price pressures and an unexpected contraction in the U.S. economy.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was little changed at 4.173%. The 2-year Treasury yield dipped more than 3 basis points to 3.625%.

One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields move inversely to prices.

Gross domestic product, a sum of all the goods and services produced from January through March, fell at an annualized pace of 0.3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 0.4% after GDP rose 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Traders seemed to focus on the inflation readings in the GDP report. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, posted a 3.6% gain for the quarter, up sharply from the 2.4% increase in Q4. Excluding food and energy, core PCE was up 3.5%.

The Commerce Department reported later in the morning that the PCE price index in March was little changed. The headline annual inflation reading was 2.3% for the month, slightly higher than expected, while core was at 2.6%, as forecast.

Investors have also been monitoring the latest tariff developments with some relief as President Donald Trump appears to be willing to negotiate on tariffs with trade partners.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the White House would soon announce a trade deal, but the country wasn't named. Trump also said later that tariff negotiations with India are ""coming along great"" and a deal would be reached soon.

Trump also softened automotive tariffs, signing an executive order on Tuesday that would reduce the overall level of duties on vehicle imports that had been affected by separate levies ""stacking"" on top of one another.

Bitcoin (BTC) is extending its consolidation streak to five consecutive days, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as investors await a decisive breakout. A K33 report highlights two key events to watch this week: MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 

Institutional demand for Bitcoin remains strong, supporting a bullish thesis, as US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the positive trend seen since April 17.

The K33 report speculates that positive news will emerge from MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings presentation on Thursday, as the company nearly depleted its $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) shelf offering this week. The analyst explains that the massive $21 billion ATM announced by MSTR on October 30, 2024, is now practically emptied after another BTC purchase on Monday.

Six months after this announcement, $128.7 million remains of the original $21 billion ATM offering. Nonetheless, other funding sources, such as convertibles and perpetual preferred stock offerings Strife (STRF), have moved slower. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman “Michael Saylor seems more than determined to deploy as much capital as frequently and aggressively as possible to grow the company's BTC treasury,” the analyst says.

Given the continued solid MSTR premiums, the analyst views a new ATM announcement as a likely scenario during the earnings call – similar to the 21/21 plan announcement during Q3 earnings. Such an announcement would likely benefit the BTC price.

The second event to watch this week is the 60-day deadline of Trump's executive order regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, set for May 5. The order from March 6 gave the US Treasury a 60-day deadline to deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Official communication ahead of this deadline has been very limited, with little discussion of the matter among the public. However, the analyst expects this to change as the date approaches. 

Bitcoin institutional demand remained strong so far this week. According to the data from SoSoValue shown below, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the trend of inflows since April 17. If these inflows intensify, Bitcoin prices could rally further.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% through Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and has hovered around this level in the last four days. 

If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions.

However, if BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological level.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price is extending its consolidation streak, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as traders await a decisive breakout. MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have the potential to move BTC price.

Chainlink's supply outside exchanges has surged to 803.38 million from 778.87 million in under two months. LINK network activity declines, with new and active addresses falling from a recent peak.

Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further. If XRP holds above the immediate support at $2.21, a reversal could soon ensue.

THORChain announced on Tuesday that its stagenet development of its Ripple (XRP) integration is nearing the final step, with mainnet activation imminent. This integration enhances THORChain's economic model by increasing swap activity and protocol fees. 

Bitcoin price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week. This week's rally was supported by strong institutional demand, as US spot ETFs recorded a total inflow of $2.68 billion until Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Price (BTC) News: Lower Alongside Stocks Following GDP, ADP Data","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/30/stagflationary-data-puts-pressure-on-bitcoin-stocks-early-in-u-s-day","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:35:47 GMT","

What one hour ago was looking like another positive day in markets has turned decidedly negative as the latest economic data fueled growing stagflation fears.

First up was ADP jobs numbers for April. Coming two days ahead of the government's own employment data for April, the ADP report showed just 62,000 private sector jobs created this month, well shy of estimates for 108,000 and March's 147,000. It was the weakest print since July 2024.

Next was the government's first estimate of first quarter GDP growth, which came in at negative 0.3% against estimates for positive 0.2%. While the quarter ended in March, economic actors — fully aware of coming tariffs — front-loaded imports early in the year. Going back to Econ 101, rising imports (absent a corresponding gain in exports) are a drag on GDP growth. 

Indeed, the export-import imbalance cut GDP growth by nearly 5% in the first quarter. Also at work was the Trump administration's DOGE efforts, with government spending a drag on GDP for the first time since 2022.

Turning to inflation, the Core PCE price index embedded within the GDP report rose 3.5% versus estimates for a gain of just 3.1%.

It's all adding up to a big drop in U.S. stocks, with the Nasdaq lower 2% and S&P 500 by 1.5%. That's hitting bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped about 1% alongside to $94,300.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest digital asset by market value, recently held steady as President Donald Trump's trade war spurred a shift away from U.S. assets.

The so-called decoupling reinforced the belief of crypto advocates that BTC is as a safe haven and a low-beta play relative to equities.

BlackRock's Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchinik, believes the cryptocurrency could actually evolve into a permanent low-beta play reflexively.

""It makes no fundamental sense, and yet when it's repeated enough, it can actually become a little self-fulfilling, right?"" Mitchnik said during a panel discussion at the Dubai Token2049 conference on Wednesday. ""It is something that can happen reflexively because enough pundits and research outlets and other commentators have said that it would.""

Investors aggressively dumped the U.S. assets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and the S&P 500, early this month as the escalating U.S.-China trade tensions spurred recession fears. BTC, however, held relatively steady, so much so that on a seven-day basis, the cryptocurrency looked less volatile than the S&P 500.

That short decoupling reinforced the crypto community's belief in an asset known to be detached from the economic, political and monetary risk of a particular country, spurring renewed capital inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, Mitchnik explained.

Investors have poured in at least $3 billion in the spot ETFs in the last ten trading days, with BlackRock's IBIT receiving the most inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.

Mitchinik added that part of the recent decoupling could be due to the transfer of BTC from the less stable hands to more long-term fundamental-driven holders. The shift is ""definitely happening,"" he said.

Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, while speaking at the same panel, said he would like to see bitcoin revert to the pre-2020 period when it was an uncorrelated asset.

The institutionalization of BTC after the Covid crash in 2020 and since the debut of ETFs early last year has led to the cryptocurrency developing correlations with tradfi assets, mainly the Nasdaq index. That has led to BTC losing its appeal as a portfolio diversifier.

Jan van Eck explained that traders would be inclined to hold more BTC if the correlations weaken.UPDATE (April 30, 09:19 UTC): Adds 'Reflexively"" to headline.

Scroll said Monday it has become the first Ethereum Layer 2 using zero-knowledge proofs to reach a critical development stage, allowing users to post transactions without relying on a central operator.

In a post to X, Scroll touted its advances in security, scalability, and decentralization after claiming the project had reached “Stage 1” in its development.

“While Scroll has always had a fully functional zk proof system, users previously had to trust the centralized sequencer to avoid censorship or downtime,” it said. “That's no longer the case.”

Scroll used to require users to trust a central system to process their transactions without blocking or delays—now, even if that system fails or censors, transactions can still go through, according to the project.

Scroll's Euclid upgrade, which users voted to approve earlier this month, keeps the system running even if the primary operator stops or tries to block user actions.

Rollups typically start at Stage 0 with full team control, move to Stage 1 where smart contracts take over but a safety council can step in, and reach Stage 2 when the system runs entirely on code with no central authority.

If the operator blocks a user or shuts down, the transaction can still be included and sent to Ethereum. This fixes a big problem for tools like Scroll.

They need to create proofs for each group of actions, but these proofs could only be so big. If a user sends a sizable action, it could end up disrupting the whole system.

Working with Axiom—a project that helps smart contracts verify past blockchain data—Scroll built a new tool called OpenVM, which breaks down large actions into smaller, provable pieces.

Instead of being at risk of failing, larger proofs could ""just take longer to prove,"" Scroll explained in its post.

To keep users safe, all system changes must be voted on and then wait three days before they apply. This gives users time to exit if they don't like the changes.

The Euclid update establishes a 12-person safety team called the Security Council, which mandates strict rules.

At least nine members must agree to do anything, and at least seven of them must not work for Scroll. Only two council members from Scroll are permitted to sit on the council.

Despite the improvements, Scroll has had its fair share of problems. Launched in 2023, it went to market later than competitors like zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM.

Still, Scroll says it's now ""looking forward"" to Stage 2, which would limit what any one group can do in an emergency, even the Security Council.

Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around $95,000 at the time of writing on Wednesday, and a breakout suggests gains toward $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) followed BTC's footsteps and hovered around their key levels. The technical outlook suggests a breakout of these coins above the key resistance level could pave the way for a bullish run, targeting $100,000 BTC, $2,000 ETH, and $3 XRP.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and hovered around this level in the last four days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to stabilize around the $95,000 level.

If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological importance level.

Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on April 22 and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. However, ETH retested the daily resistance level at $1,861 the next day and declined slightly. ETH has been consolidating around $1,740 for the past two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to hover around $1,800.

If ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 55 above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

XRP price broke above the 50-day EMA level at $2.20 on Sunday and rallied by 4.77%, surpassing the daily resistance level at $2.23. However, it declined slightly on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is retesting its support level at $2.20.

If the support level at $2.20 holds, XRP will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 55 above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.



XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around the $2.20 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price is extending its consolidation streak, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as traders await a decisive breakout. MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have the potential to move BTC price.

Chainlink's supply outside exchanges has surged to 803.38 million from 778.87 million in under two months. LINK network activity declines, with new and active addresses falling from a recent peak.

Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further. If XRP holds above the immediate support at $2.21, a reversal could soon ensue.

THORChain announced on Tuesday that its stagenet development of its Ripple (XRP) integration is nearing the final step, with mainnet activation imminent. This integration enhances THORChain's economic model by increasing swap activity and protocol fees. 

Bitcoin price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week. This week's rally was supported by strong institutional demand, as US spot ETFs recorded a total inflow of $2.68 billion until Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik Buterin outlines vision as Ethereum ecosystem addresses hit new high","https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-shares-ethereum-vision-as-addresses-hit-record-high","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:35:04 GMT","

 Vitalik Buterin outlined his 2025 Ethereum development priorities, including single-slot finality, statelessness, enhanced privacy and decentralized infrastructure. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released another update on what he believes the future of the network should entail.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.

The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

Buterin recently argued that privacy should be a top priority for developers and proposed solutions to boost privacy on Ethereum. Earlier in April, he also published a short-term privacy roadmap for Ethereum, detailing technical solutions to the network's transparency.

Buterin's focus on forward-looking research follows changes at the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit organization developing the Ethereum ecosystem. Earlier this month, the Ethereum Foundation co-executive director, Tomasz Stańczak, said that Buterin now has more time for research and exploration.

“Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long‑term breakthroughs,” he wrote.

In today's post, Buterin said that this year, he would be researching single-slot finality on Ethereum. This proposed upgrade would allow blocks to become final in a single slot within 12 seconds. This would significantly reduce the time needed to confirm transactions irreversibly and improve user experience.

Another area of focus would be making Ethereum stateless. This would lead to nodes no longer storing the full state (account balances, contracts, etc.) but instead requiring users to provide the necessary state data (witnesses) with each transaction. This could potentially improve scalability and decentralization.

Buterin also expects to study ways to improve the ecosystem's cybersecurity on both the front and back ends, as well as its resilience and decentralization. He set some objectives that he specified should also apply to client software, such as third-party wallets:

Besides working on the Ethereum protocol, Buterin expects to dedicate his attention to improving communication tools, information sharing, and the social layer surrounding Ethereum. This includes governance changes, the network's resources management and open-source development funding.

Buterin explained that this also involves developing better encrypted messaging, software documentation, and leading their adoption in the ecosystem. He also hinted at developing prediction markets and related technology, as well as some potential new types of communication tools.

Other objectives include the lower-level development. Buterin cited the intention to investigate cryptography, operating systems, hardware, physical infrastructure and biological defence without further explanation.

Buterin also cited some areas of development where he is not personally involved, including plans to increase Ethereum's gas limit as a short-term scalability solution, as well as peer-to-peer systems.

BTC stalls at key resistance with bearish signs mounting

Bitcoin continues to struggle just below the $95,000 resistance level, with yesterday's candle showing a lower low under $92K despite closing green. Daily RSI remains overbought above 70, but is trending lower with lower highs and lows. Volume has not exceeded its 30-day moving average since April 25, raising concerns about momentum.

TBT Bearish Divergence Clusters have appeared again on the 4-hour chart, the first since BTC's top at $109K in January. While no TBO Close Long has printed yet, the frequency and clustering of these signals are hard to ignore. The bullish counterpoint is that BTC remains above the daily TBO Cloud for eight straight days, and the macro weekly chart still looks solid. However, the lack of progress and declining strength makes a pullback to $82K the most likely scenario unless BTC can decisively close above $95K.



Altcoin signals diverge as OTHERS.D and TOTAL3 print bullish confirmations

Stablecoin dominance remains weak and rangebound within the TBO Cloud, while Bitcoin Dominance continues strong despite waning RSI. Top 10 Dominance remains bearish, and OTHERS.D is starting to pull back, risking a break of ascending RSI support. However, historical precedent from November 2024 suggests some chop may occur before any major push higher.

TOTAL3 confirmed a TBO Open Long yesterday—its first since September—signaling the end of bearish control and the start of a new uptrend. OTHERS market cap is also in the process of printing a TBO Open Long, supporting a broader altcoin recovery. These signals, though early, are encouraging and reminiscent of pre-pump setups seen in late 2024.

Market structure resembles pre-November 2024 rally

BVOL7D, which measures BTC volatility, is oddly falling back into the Bounce Zone, mirroring its behavior before the last big market rally in October 2024. Multiple correlations to past market conditions—especially from September to November 2024—are emerging again, reinforcing the idea of a similar bullish breakout pattern on the horizon.

Altcoins show increasing strength with TBO signals lighting up

Ethereum has stalled despite its TBO Close Short last week, while XRP and SOL are flashing 4h TBO Close Longs—reminders to secure profit and watch for trend shifts. Many altcoins are now printing Open Longs on the daily time frame, including VET, POL, TIA, and MNT. Charts like KCS and BERA are showing breakout clusters or early bullish divergence signals.

Most notably, the TBT Forecaster flipped from Bearish to Bullish for ALTs five days ago—its first bullish flip since January. This shift adds another confirmation that altcoin recovery is underway, even if BTC pulls back in the short term.

Conclusion

BTC is at a critical tipping point. Without a close above $95K soon, a rejection and retracement to $82K becomes increasingly likely. However, macro bullish structure remains intact. Meanwhile, altcoins are gaining strength with a growing number of TBO Open Longs and bullish confirmation signals. Traders should stay nimble—protect profits but stay open to further upside, especially as historical patterns suggest that a larger move may soon unfold.

Data-driven Dogecoin price forecasts from CoinCodex and Changelly show that the largest meme coin may struggle to break above the $0.3 resistance this year, posting a modest 55% return.

This mediocre price forecast has prompted DOGE traders to seek greener pastures in new altcoins like Remittix (RTX). This PayFi token is already up over 400% in presale, and crypto analysts posit it might top 2025 crypto gains with a 150x multiplier. Here's why.

Remittix is building a cutting-edge financial infrastructure that connects cryptocurrencies to everyday fiat payment networks across the world. This innovative approach makes it a breeze for the average consumer and businesses to undertake cross-border transactions with the speed benefits of crypto while enjoying the convenience of traditional payment apps.



Users will only need to link their crypto wallet to the Remittix dApp to send same-day crypto-to-fiat payments across borders in 50+ crypto pairs and over 30 fiat currencies at a flat fee. That eliminates the extra hidden costs levied by traditional channels, helping users retain more of their money during transfer.

While cross-border crypto pioneers like XRP and XLM focus on large financial giants, Remittix fills a critical gap in the market by bringing faster, cheaper, and seamless cross-border crypto payments to crypto holders and small business owners.

That's why top market pundits believe Remittix is well-positioned to take a significant slice of the $800 billion market as its addressable market grows due to rising crypto trends in the cross-border payments sector. Controlling even 3-5% of this market will be enough to push RTX into the XRP and XLM league, sparking a 150x moonshot for the altcoin.

After an extended bearish run that pushed the DOGE price to a vital buy zone in the $0.14 region, the meme coin has recently posted bullish price action. At current rates, Dogecoin is over 20% up from the dip, showing signs of growth as buying pressure and trader interest rise.

This has sparked rumors of a potential DOGE bullish reversal amid news of Z Squared and Coepti's merger to expand Dogecoin mining. Sadly, the DOGE has faced crippling resistances in the $0.18 zone, hampering its upward trajectory.

Some analysts, like $Kev_Capital_TA, have put forth insane Dogecoin price predictions of $1.5 or even $3.8. But this crazy target requires the DOGE market cap to exceed $200 billion, which is not an easy feat!

Data-driven Dogecoin price prediction from CoinCodex reveals that the meme coin will likely post sluggish price action in the $0.13-$0.27 zone for the rest of the year. That aligns with Changelly's analysis, which shows that the DOGE may struggle below $0.3 throughout the year.

This underwhelming Dogecoin price forecast has spurred an increasing number of meme coin traders to jump ship, piling into other new altcoins that promise better gains.

At the $0.0757 floor price, the RTX token is already up over 400% from its $0.015 entry price, blessing first movers with 3x gains as the Remittix ICO surpasses $14.6 million. Join DOGE traders and grab your RTX share before the price increases to $0.0781 in the next presale phase.

Discover the exciting opportunities of the Remittix (RTX) presale today!

A closely followed analyst believes that the crypto markets are primed for a corrective move following strong rallies over the past couple of weeks.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks “a dip is going to come soon,” but he doesn't see any reason to be super bearish once the correction takes place.

According to the analyst, a correction should provide an opportunity for investors to enter the crypto market before another leg up.

Should a marketwide pullback materialize, Altcoin Sherpa says he plans to accumulate five altcoins.

“Coins I want to buy:

BONK ($0.00001600s)
Fartcoin ($0.85)
POPCAT ($0.33)
HYPE ($15-$16s)
GUN ($0.055s)

Loads of others too, but those are on my short list for now.” 

Looking closer at the memecoin Fartcoin, the trader notes that FART needs to stay above $1.05 to witness new rallies. Otherwise, he thinks the altcoin could fall to as low as $0.8.

“Fartcoin: wouldn't be surprised to see this pullback a little bit here, but don't forget that hot air rises in the end.

Three different scenarios, all mostly dependent on BTC, frankly. I think this just continues up.” 

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to suggest that FART can rally to as high as $1.40. At time of writing, FART is worth $1.09.

Turning to fellow memecoin Bonk (BONK), Altcoin Sherpa thinks that the altcoin looks really strong.

“The chart itself still looks fire.” 

At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.00002, up over 10% on the day.

 TON ecosystem participant Broxus launches TON Factory, a high-throughput dev platform with a purported 35,000 transactions per second, aiming to scale DEXs, games and DApps. 

The Open Network (TON) ecosystem participant Broxus has unveiled TON Factory, a new platform designed to accelerate the development and scalability of high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and blockchain-based games.

In an April 30 post on Telegram, the project said TON Factory aims to help developers rapidly build and scale projects with modular components, integration tools, and hands-on expert support.

“For OGs already building on TON, TON Factory helps you scale further,” the announcement stated.

The initiative is backed by a team of over 150 engineers with experience delivering production-ready infrastructure in the TON ecosystem, per the announcement. 

“TON Factory will help developers focusing on L2/appchains with TVM tech and ensuring connectivity with TON,” a spokesperson told Cointelegraph. 

They said any TON DApp focusing on scaling its performance while maintaining the strong link with TON network can use the platform.

Related: Venture capital firms invest $400M in TON blockchain

The underlying architecture leverages Broxus' Tycho protocol, which combines the TVM with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consensus mechanism.

This hybrid design is intended to achieve near-instant finality and high throughput, reportedly handling up to 35,000 transactions per second (TPS), a benchmark that could position TON Factory as a serious competitor to other layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions:

Broxus builds key tools and technology for blockchains that use the TON Virtual Machine, or TVM. 

It has created several important decentralized finance (DeFi) products like FlatQube (a decentralized exchange), Octus Bridge (a crosschain bridge) and Ever Wallet. 

In March 2025, the TON Foundation said several venture capital firms invested more than $400 million in the TON blockchain, signaling growing interest in the Telegram messaging ecosystem. 

Sequoia Capital, Ribbit, Benchmark, Draper Associates, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Libertus Capital, CoinFund, SkyBridge, Hypersphere and Karatage participated in the investment by purchasing Toncoin.

At the time of writing, Toncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), is trading at $3.22, down around 1% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

TON blockchain is a decentralized network that supports the development of Mini Apps for the Telegram ecosystem. Although TON was initially developed by Telegram's founders, it now operates as an independent chain.

FIFA Collect, the official digital collectibles platform for the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) soccer organization, will migrate to its own Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible FIFA blockchain—leaving behind Algorand in the process. 

Scheduled to occur no sooner than May 20, the migration away from Algorand does not require any immediate action from FIFA Collect users or NFT owners. 

“As FIFA Collect evolves, we are migrating the platform to the FIFA Blockchain, an EVM-compatible blockchain,” an official FAQ about the migration reads. “This upgrade will support better performance, future features, and improved scalability.”

FIFA Collect launched in 2022 during the lead-up to the last World Cup, minting its soccer-themed digital collectibles on Algorand, a proof-of-stake alternative to Ethereum and Solana that was announced as the official blockchain platform of the soccer organization in May of that year.

In December 2023, the platform minted a collection of digital collectibles on Ethereum scaling network Polygon as well, but a representative for the platform told Decrypt at the time that it was merely expanding its collectible base, not “shifting away” from Algorand. 

Now though, FIFA really is ditching Algorand.

While the core experience for FIFA Collect users is expected to stay the same, support for Algorand wallets like Pera and Defly will no longer exist after the migration. Instead, users will need to use EVM-compatible wallets like MetaMask or Rabby.

The platform plans to share more details about its upcoming blockchain “soon,” according to the FAQ, noting that its creation is meant to “support new experiences, enable wallet compatibility, and provide stronger foundations for future innovation.”

Users who had previously exported NFTs off the platform must re-import them before May 20 in order to have them migrated seamlessly with other FIFA Collect collectibles. 

Algorand previously made headlines for acquiring music sharing service Napster in 2022. The blockchain's native ALGO token is down 5.5% in the last 24 hours to around $0.22, nearly 94% off its 2019 all-time high of $3.56. 

Representatives for FIFA Collect and Algorand did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

 FIFA is launching a new EVM-compatible blockchain, which will host its NFT collections and fan experiences. 

The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) plans to launch a new blockchain network to support its non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles, the organization announced on April 30.

FIFA will launch its “FIFA Blockchain,” with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and aims to provide “better performance, future features, and improved scalability.”

As part of the move, FIFA Collect — its official NFT collection — will migrate from the Algorand blockchain to the new FIFA Blockchain. The migration is scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, FIFA said.  

“At this stage, no immediate action is required. When the migration process begins, we will provide clear, step-by-step instructions on what (if anything) you need to do,” the announcement stated.

The collection's migration will take place “not earlier than” May 20, FIFA said, adding that it will confirm the exact date and provide clear instructions for NFT holders.

Following the migration, external Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will be able to connect to FIFA Collect via MetaMask or other EVM wallets that support WalletConnect.

Other listed collectibles will be automatically listed on the new platform, unless users delist them before the migration date.

FIFA launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia in collaboration with blockchain firm Modex.

In November 2024, FIFA partnered with blockchain gaming studio Mythical Games to launch FIFA Rivals, a free-to-play soccer game for iOS and Android.

The full game is scheduled to be released in the summer of 2025, enabling players to manage their own football clubs and compete against other players in real-time. FIFA Rivals is set to launch a pre-release in May 2025.

The company's CEO, John Linden, said FIFA Rivals could attract over 100 million gamers, given that its NFL Rivals game has already seen over 6 million players sign up from a far narrower audience.

FIFA Collect, a digital platform created by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) that allows football fans to collect, trade, and enjoy digital collectibles featuring iconic moments from football history, announced today it will migrate its NFT platform to a new EVM-compatible FIFA blockchain.

The transition, scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, aims to support enhanced performance, future features, and improved scalability for the platform's digital collectibles ecosystem.

According to FIFA, this change will not affect users' access to their accounts or existing digital collectibles. All assets will remain fully secure and accessible throughout and after the migration process.

The upgrade will bring changes to wallet compatibility, with Algorand-based wallets like Pera and Defly no longer supported post-migration. Users will instead be able to connect using MetaMask or other EVM-compatible wallets that support WalletConnect.

“The FIFA Blockchain was created to support new experiences, enable wallet compatibility, and provide stronger foundations for future innovation,” FIFA stated in its migration FAQ document.

Users who have exported collectibles must reimport them before the migration date to ensure inclusion in the automatic transfer process. After the cut-off date, manual migrations will require additional verification.

USDC balances will remain available for spending until the migration date and can be withdrawn, but not spent, after the transition. Listed collectibles will automatically transfer to the new platform unless users delist them before the migration.

In May 2022, FIFA announced a strategic collaboration with Algorand, naming it the official blockchain partner of the organization. As part of the agreement, Algorand provided a blockchain-supported wallet solution and played a key role in shaping FIFA's digital asset strategy.

Through this collaboration, FIFA explored blockchain-driven innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital wallets, with a focus on transparency, sustainability, and revenue growth.

The partnership led to the launch of FIFA Collect later in 2022. Powered by Algorand, the NFT platform enables fans to collect and engage with iconic football moments in digital form.

ALGO, Algorand's native asset, dropped 3% to $0.2213 on Binance following the news.

Think of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) as the crypto version of a startup asking for funding.

Probably you've been wondering how smart money investors make life-changing profits in crypto while you only manage to earn just enough to stay afloat. You've bought the dips, followed influencers, and even joined various Telegram groups, but somehow, you're still not in on the real action.

One fact most people overlook is that the crypto space moves fast. And those who get in early, before the hype and even before the headlines, often walk away with the biggest wins.

So, how do they do it?

They understand one powerful tool in the crypto playbook: the Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

Think of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) as the crypto version of a startup asking for funding, but instead of selling shares like in the stock market (like with an Initial Public Offering), they sell digital tokens.

These tokens can later be used in the company's project, traded for profit, or held long-term, just like early shares in Amazon or Apple once were.

In simple terms, it's a way for a crypto project to raise money before it officially launches. And for early investors (like you), it's a way to get in before everyone else hears about it.

First, a crypto startup creates a whitepaper – think of it as their pitch deck. It explains what the project is about, how much money they need, how many tokens they'll release, and how those tokens will be used.

Once that's set, the team announces their ICO date, sets a token price, and opens it up to the public.

Investors like you and me can buy those tokens using established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In return, we get the project's tokens sent straight to our wallets.

These tokens could:

Unlike IPOs, though, ICOs aren't always regulated. That means while the profit potential is huge, the risks are real. Some countries require KYC checks, while others have banned ICOs altogether.

So, while ICOs can be goldmines, always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before diving in.

While some ICOs fizzled out, others delivered massive gains. Here's a look at the ones that made early investors seriously rich.

Launching an ICO isn't just about minting tokens and hoping for the best. You need a solid foundation.

Here's what most teams put in place:

It's a mix of tech, trust, and timing. Get it right, and you could raise millions. Get it wrong, and you'll be ghosted by investors.

ICOs have proven to be both golden opportunities and cautionary tales in the crypto space. For early believers, they've turned spare change into small fortunes. But for the uninformed, they've been expensive lessons. The key lies in understanding what you're investing in.

If you're thinking of jumping into the next big ICO, remember this: research is your best friend, hype is your biggest trap, and timing is everything. So, stay sharp, stay curious, and as always in crypto, never invest more than you're willing to lose.

The executive order arrived on a quiet Friday at the end of January and initially felt like a political footnote. In less than two pages, the White House revoked EO 14067, disbanded the “responsible digital-asset” framework created under President Biden, and, most explosively, barred every U.S. agency from issuing, piloting, or even promoting a central-bank digital currency. The text was sparse; the intent unmistakable.

Three months later, the consequences are no longer theoretical. By pulling the Federal Reserve out of Project Cedar, retreating from the BIS-led Project mBridge, and gagging Treasury officials who had been mapping a cross-border dollar pilot, Washington has ceded the initiative to Europe, where policymakers are racing to finalise a “digital euro,” and to Beijing, which is already moving oil money through e-CNY corridors.

President Donald Trump had flirted with the idea of a CBDC moratorium on the campaign trail, casting a digital dollar as an Orwellian “surveillance coin.” January's order made it official. It did more than cancel the Fed's research: it prohibited promotion of any sovereign token and ordered regulators to rewrite crypto policy around private-sector innovation. Within a week, the Treasury had scrubbed CBDC references from its public calendar; Federal Reserve staff reassigned to other payment-system tasks; and BIS working groups quietly replaced American panellists with alternates from the Gulf and Southeast Asia.

The White House framed the ban as a double victory: a defense of civil liberties and a signal to Silicon Valley that private tokens, not state ones, should drive U.S. fintech leadership. The President's advisors also understood the electoral math. Crypto money may be a niche donor base, but its single-issue intensity and the overlap with libertarian swing voters are impossible to ignore. In the same news cycle, the administration suspended the IRS broker-reporting rule, another longtime ask of digital-asset lobbyists.

Yet the order fused two very different fears. One is legitimate anxiety about a government ledger that might track every retail transaction. The other is a more nebulous worry that programmable money, by definition, erodes individual autonomy. European architects of the digital euro, who have built privacy “floorplates” into the design, bristle at the comparison.

Even before Washington's exit, 134 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, were exploring CBDCs. The absence of the world's reserve-currency issuer has super-charged that work.

In Brussels, the European Commission unveiled an almost-final draft of the digital-euro bill on 9 April, then instructed the ECB to pick technology partners by early autumn. Policymakers who once worried about being seen as “too early” now warn that delay could enshrine foreign standards, forcing the eurozone to import payment plumbing just as it once imported U.S. card networks. The target, whispered by several national central-bankers, is a limited consumer pilot in late 2026, roughly the date the Fed might have begun its own sandbox had the ban not intervened.

Beijing scarcely needed extra motivation. The e-CNY already services 260 million domestic users and can settle a retail transaction in under two seconds, fast enough to support metro fares in Shenzhen and red-envelope gifts during Lunar New Year. On the wholesale side, the departure of U.S. observers from mBridge effectively handed China the co-chair. In February Saudi Arabia, hungry for petroyuan optionality, joined the project. Insiders say test nodes in Hong Kong and Shenzhen are now routing limited oil-payment traffic to gauge FX-liquidity dynamics.

London, freed from what one banking veteran described as “Washington's gravitational hesitation,” is leaning in. The BoE's April progress note detailed offline-payment experiments with IDEMIA and Thales and confirmed work on an interoperability layer that could, in theory, dovetail with an eventual digital euro. An official quipped, “If the dollar won't modernise, sterling must, at least enough to speak whatever language the euro chooses.”

Even BRICS finance ministers, gathering in Rio, resumed talk of interlinked CBDCs that might lower dollar dependency. Brazil has retreated from the headline idea of a “BRICS Coin,” but India, the UAE and South Africa have individual projects in motion. The ministers' communique referenced “interoperable public-money platforms” three times - diplomatic code for “we like this direction; let's share code.”

While central banks abroad accelerate, private tokens at home are gorging on the vacuum. Circle's USDC, PayPal's PYUSD and newcomer Mountain Protocol, an SEC-registered 1:1 tokenised Treasury product, hit combined record on-chain volume in March. Exchanges report that more than 90 percent of crypto trades now settle in stablecoins rather than fiat pairs.

Congress is inching toward the first bipartisan stablecoin bill. The latest draft carves a path for state-chartered issuers under a federal floor and offers Fed supervision to nationally licensed entities. If it passes, the U.S. could end up in a peculiar posture: public payments denominated in private tokens, while the rest of the world rolls out public tokens that ride over private rails. The arrangement might please libertarians, but it does nothing to preserve the dollar's privileged role in wholesale finance.

Two numbers matter in cross-border payments: speed and cost. The BIS has modelled multi-CBDC corridors that compress settlement windows from two days to two seconds and shave up to 60 percent off all-in fees. Those gains come from synchronised ledgers, atomic FX swaps and liquidity-saving algorithms that net balances across jurisdictions, features impossible to graft onto SWIFT in its current form.

If digital euros and e-yuans gain traction while the dollar sticks to legacy rails, American corporates will feel it first. A Reuters survey in April found U.S. multinationals already extending FX hedges because tariff volatility under the new administration magnifies dollar swings. Add the cost of converting into CBDC units for counterparties in Asia or Europe, and treasurers could find invoicing in local-currency tokens cheaper and more predictable. Every such invoice marginally erodes dollar demand.

Technology standards amplify the danger. In payments, whoever writes the rules embeds their domestic preferences in code. GSM did that for European telecoms; Bluetooth's early U.S. patents set a royalty stream that still pays Qualcomm. Today, standards bodies from ISO 20022 working groups to the BIS's Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures are hammering out privacy, messaging, and liquidity templates for CBDCs. With the Fed absent, proposals drafted in Frankfurt, Zurich or Hong Kong face less resistance. Once finalised, those templates become the on-ramp for wallet vendors, AML analytics firms, and identity providers. American companies can still participate, but under someone else's rules—and likely after paying licensing fees.

Speak to U.S. bankers in private and the tone oscillates between fatalistic and opportunistic. One New York CTO said his institution is doubling its Real Time Payments budget and building an in-house atomic-swap module that could, someday, bridge tokenised deposits to foreign CBDCs, even if domestic regulators never issue one. Another, at a West-Coast payments processor, is lobbying for a “synthetic CBDC” model: tokenised commercial-bank money 100 percent backed by Fed master-account balances. That, they wager, could comply with the letter of the executive order while offering programmable features that corporations crave.

These tactical hedges share a theme: if the digital dollar does not exist, create functional equivalents. Yet none solve the soft-power challenge. A tokenised deposit, no matter how cleverly wrapped, is still a claim on a single private bank. From a foreign regulator's viewpoint, accepting it as collateral is a bigger leap than accepting liabilities of the U.S. central bank.

Yes, but credibility decays quickly. If a future administration rescinds the ban, the Fed would restart from a cold engine while Europe pilots consumer wallets and China clears oil in e-CNY. Technical catch-up is possible; losing agenda-setting power is harder to reverse. Even a 2028 pilot would leave at least three critical years in which BIS corridor work, European privacy norms and Asian offline-payment standards evolve without U.S. input.

Domestic politics complicate any pivot. Having branded CBDCs un-American, lawmakers would need to perform rhetorical gymnastics. An independent Fed could, in theory, resume research without explicit White House blessing, but senior staff worry about sparking a constitutional fight over monetary powers during an election cycle.

The Broader Stakes

Money is both infrastructure and story. The physical dollar succeeded not only because it cleared debts but because people believed in the institutions behind it. Digital money is likely to obey the same rule: protocols that knit together identity, credit scoring, and real-time settlement shape global commerce far beyond the mechanics of moving bits.

By forbidding a digital dollar, Washington intended to preserve that story: liberty, privacy, entrepreneurial zeal. Ironically, the ban may hand narrative control to jurisdictions more comfortable with state-directed standards. If the next generation of cross-border rails is written in Brussels, Shenzhen or Riyadh, the dollar could be relegated to just one more token on someone else's ledger, accepted out of habit rather than structural necessity.

Closing Reflections

The situation could be likened to the invention of container shipping. The U.S. Navy ruled the waves, but the first international container standard emerged from a small committee chaired by a Swedish port operator, because America was busy elsewhere. Within ten years containers doubled global trade and re-wired supply chains. Nations that adopted the box early gained outsized influence over ports, shipyards and, eventually, data interchange. Nations that dithered played catch-up for decades.

CBDCs may or may not prove as revolutionary, but the logic rhymes: protocol beats product, and presence beats prowess. Right now, the United States is choosing absence. Unless that choice changes, the world will move on - and the dollar's network effects, painstakingly built over a century, could erode not through hostility but through indifference.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

North Carolina House members are expected to vote Wednesday on whether the state can invest a portion of its public funds — for retirement, education, transportation, general spending, and more — in cryptocurrency.

The NC Digital Assets Investments Act, sponsored by 27 Republicans, would permit the state treasury department to place up to 5% of funds' assets in digital currencies like Bitcoin.

The bill applies to more than two dozen funds, including the state's $129 billion pension plan covering firefighters, teachers, police officers and state employees. It also calls for the North Carolina treasurer and the State Bureau of Investigation to study how seized digital assets could be used to establish a digital assets reserve. 

House leaders have adjusted key aspects of the legislation since a smaller group of Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, introduced it two months ago. 

Under the current bill, digital assets can comprise up to 5% of any fund — lowered from an original 10% cap, and a third-party consultant now must assess any crypto investments. The updated legislation also opens the door to more cryptocurrencies, erasing an initial market capitalization requirement (of $750 billion) that had essentially made only Bitcoin eligible. 

Wording around the state treasurer having exclusive knowledge of the “private key” that serves as a passcode to their virtual wallet has been replaced with a rule that virtual currencies be held in a “secure custody solution” platform. 

The state Senate has already backed public cryptocurrency investments. On April 19, the chamber passed a budget which allows for 5% of funds' assets to be digital. 

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has voiced support for a state cryptocurrency investing bill, telling The News & Observer in February that he favored “giving people more authority to do their jobs.”

“That doesn't mean that the treasurer must make those investments,” he said. “But if there are wise investments that can result in a positive, diversified return for the pension fund, then I'm comfortable with the treasurer making that investment.”

At least 40 states have introduced cryptocurrency bills this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, with Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Dakota among those weighing public investments. A pair of states, Wisconsin and Michigan, already allow crypto in their retirement portfolios. And on Tuesday, Arizona legislators advanced a bill to create the country's first state Bitcoin reserve. 

Momentum for Bitcoin investing at the state level has coincided with President Donald Trump's calls for a national digital asset reserve tethered to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Strategic reserves are a stockpile the nation stores for crisis moments, like the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

As of Tuesday evening, the world's top cryptocurrency sold at around $95,500. Bitcoin's price has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, propelled by a huge spike in November following Trump's election victory.

The North Carolina Blockchain Initiative worked with state lawmakers on its cryptocurrency investment legislation. In an X post in February, Hall said the bill aligns North Carolina “with President Trump's vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile” while keeping the state at the forefront of a financial innovation.

Critics of public Bitcoin investing say the 16-year-old currency has been volatile and lacks the oversight of traditional money. 

“When we're talking about the dollar amounts that are in the pension funds, we're talking about the people whose retirements are at risk here,” Rep. Brian Turner, an Asheville Democrat, told The News & Observer. “We should be, I would say, using more proven financial instruments to fund those funds.”

It isn't yet known who precisely will make North Carolina pension decisions — on digital or traditional assets.

Another bill changing how North Carolina handles state investments passed the House on Tuesday, moving the state closer to replacing its sole fiduciary model with a shared governance structure.

House Bill 506 would create the North Carolina Investment Authority, within the treasurer's department. It would be overseen by a five-member board of directors responsible for managing state investments.

Currently, the treasurer's department has an Investment Management Division with more than 20 professionals who oversee operating funds — such as highway dollars — and pension funds, including the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System and the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System. Despite the presence of that team, the state treasurer alone currently holds final authority over investment decisions.

Briner, during his campaign for state treasurer, championed this change. He has continued to do so, arguing that North Carolina is at the bottom for pension plan returns, in part because of its governance structure. 

The state's pension plan returns averaged 5.9% annually over the past decade, below the 7.5% national average, with states like Washington at about 11%, Briner said in mid-April during a committee hearing. For Briner, the state does not need to take as much risk as Washington but does need to take on more.

“I seek to relinquish some of my power to a board of qualified investment professionals to help deliver better returns for this state so that we can get to a better place, not just for our budget, but for our retirees,” he said. 

The bill passed that committee with no dissenting views raised, as it did on the House floor on Tuesday. The sole question on the floor came from Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Greensboro Democrat, who wanted to confirm that crypto language had been eliminated from the bill. A previous version of the bill included language allowing cryptocurrency investments, but that provision was removed.

Under the current bill, the board would include the state treasurer as an ex officio member, plus one appointee each from the House speaker, Senate president pro tempore, governor and state treasurer. Appointees must have investment expertise and would serve staggered six-year terms. 

The board would appoint a chief investment officer, who must have at least 15 years of experience managing pensions, endowments or similar funds. The CIO would be responsible for the day-to-day investing.

 Australia's financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC says it's undertaking a blitz on dormant registered crypto exchanges to weed out scammers. 

Australia's financial intelligence agency has told inactive registered crypto exchanges to withdraw their registrations or risk having them canceled over fears that the dormant firms could be used for scams.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.

The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they'll be told to “use it or lose it.”

“Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” he added.

Businesses wanting to offer Australians conversions between cash and crypto, including crypto ATM providers, must first register with AUSTRAC, which monitors for crimes including money laundering, terror financing and tax evasion.

The agency can cancel a registration if it has reasonable grounds to believe the business is no longer active or offering crypto-related services.

Ten firms have had their AUSTRAC registration canceled since 2019, with the most recent being FTX Express in June 2024, the local subsidiary of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.

Following its blitz on inactive crypto exchanges, AUSTRAC said it will publish a list of registered exchanges to help Australians verify legitimate providers.

Thomas said the goal is to make it harder for criminals to scam people and improve the integrity and accuracy of AUSTRAC's register.

“If a DCE does intend to offer a service, they need to contact us otherwise we will cancel the registration and this information will be added to the register,” he said.

“Members of the public should feel confident that they can identify legitimate cryptocurrency providers that are registered and subject to regulatory oversight and that we are driving criminals out of this industry,” Thomas added.

In February, the Anti-Money Laundering regulator took action against 13 remittance service providers and crypto exchanges, with over 50 others still being investigated regarding possible compliance issues.

Six providers were refused registration renewal on the grounds that key personnel were either convicted, prosecuted, or charged with a serious offense.

Australia has yet to pass crypto regulations. In August 2022, the ruling center-left Labor Party initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework.

In March, the government proposed a new crypto framework regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws ahead of a federal election slated for May 3.

In our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, we estimated that illicit cryptocurrency addresses received $40.9 billion in 2024. At first glance, this appears to mark a decline from the previous year's $46.1 billion. However, our 2024 figures reflect-lower bound estimates based on identified illicit addresses — when accounting for likely undiscovered activity, the true number is closer to $51.3 billion. In other words, crypto crime intensified.



As blockchain adoption accelerates and decentralized infrastructure expands, so does the attack surface. With every new protocol, smart contract, and wallet user added to the ecosystem, the need for robust blockchain security grows more urgent. Innovation has opened the doors to remarkable possibilities, but also to a new era of sophisticated threats.

From smart contract exploits and cross-chain bridge hacks, to phishing campaigns that drain users wallets, the risks facing blockchain technology are evolving in real time. However, with the right tools, many attacks can be stopped before they strike. In this blog, we'll explore the most pressing blockchain security challenges and the steps participants can take now to build more resilient infrastructure.

Keep reading to learn more about the following topics:

Blockchain security refers to the combination of cybersecurity principles, tools, and best practices aimed at mitigating risk, avoiding malicious attacks, and preventing unauthorized access while operating on blockchain networks.

While all blockchains run on distributed ledger technology (DLT), not all blockchains are functionally the same or equally secure. Both public and private blockchains have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, and their security models are fundamentally different due to the open versus closed nature of their networks.

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open, permissionless networks where anyone can join and participate in validating transactions. The codebase of public blockchains is open source — publicly available and continually vetted by developers who review the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. By leveraging the expertise of open-source communities, the security, features, and efficiency of these blockchains are continuously examined and improved. At the same time, hackers and malicious entities also examine code to search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

In contrast, private blockchains are exclusive, permissioned networks with limited access, making them more centralized. Securing a private blockchain is the sole responsibility of the operating entity. The centralized nature of these blockchains means that there is a single point of failure, making it crucial for the institution to implement strong security measures.

Although private blockchains may not benefit as much from the decentralized and security-by-numbers approach of public blockchains, they are generally faster and more efficient due to less computational work required for consensus algorithms. However, because the entity granting permission also has authority over the network, there is a theoretical risk of the network being shut down or manipulated.

Blockchain technology runs on a distributed digital ledger system. A blockchain network is made up of a worldwide network of computers, known as nodes, validating and recording transactions. Every participant maintains a copy of the ledger, so there is no centralized authority or point of failure. Each time a transaction occurs — such as sending or receiving cryptocurrency — it is recorded on a block.

Before a block (made up of a group of transactions that occurred during a given time frame) is added to the chain, it must first be verified by consensus. That's where consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, come into play. In a Proof-of-Work system, miners compete to solve computationally intensive algorithms to validate transactions. In a Proof-of-Stake system, network participants lock up a certain quantity of tokens to run a node to validate transactions. Miners and stakers are incentivized with rewards to secure the network. This process ensures everyone agrees (or reaches consensus) on the validity of each transaction. Once a block is full, it is sealed and linked to the previous block using a cryptographic code, forming a chain. By linking each block using cryptography and distributing the ledger across numerous computers, any attempt to tamper with a block would disrupt the entire chain.

Unlike traditional finance — which operates on permissions to pull funds — a crypto transaction is a push transaction, initiated peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediary. Participants in blockchain networks control their digital assets on the blockchain with a private key — a cryptographically secured method of authentication and access.

Crypto requires you to be deliberate. Because no intermediary is required, personal responsibility becomes much more important when transferring value on-chain. Once transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, they are irreversible. This makes it notoriously difficult to recover funds that are lost or stolen.

The notion that blockchain technology is inherently immune to security threats is somewhat misleading, but several of its unique structural features bolster its intrinsic security:

While these defining characteristics are the reason blockchain technology is considered so revolutionary, there are still vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Paradoxically, some of the traits of blockchain (e.g. immutability) can introduce unique complexities if the system itself is compromised. Next, we'll look at challenges in securing blockchains and some of the most common threats currently shaping the landscape.

A major challenge in securing blockchain systems is that the pace of innovation continues to outstrip the development of security tools. New protocols, features, and use cases emerge faster than they can be thoroughly vetted, leaving gaps that attackers are quick to exploit.

The permissionless nature of blockchain adds another layer of complexity. Anyone can deploy a contract, launch a token, or interact with protocols, creating low barriers for malicious actors to operate at scale. Scams can proliferate with little friction, often faster than detection systems can respond.

Cross-chain activity only compounds the problem. As users move assets across multiple blockchains, visibility into transactions can become fragmented. Monitoring and securing these flows requires coordination across protocols — something the current infrastructure isn't fully equipped to handle.

Finally, one of the most persistent challenges is real-time detection. On-chain behavior can look similar, whether it's part of a legitimate arbitrage strategy or a coordinated exploit. This ambiguity makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between malicious and benign actions before damage is done.

The following threats target applications operating on-chain — such as DeFi protocols, bridges, and phishing tokens — rather than the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself.

Smart contracts are self-executing code that power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But once deployed, a single bug can expose millions in locked assets. Attackers often exploit logical flaws, reentrancy vulnerabilities, or unchecked access controls to drain funds or manipulate protocol behavior. Without code audits, even well-intentioned projects can become exposed.

Between January and November 2024, approximately 8.5% of funds stolen were due to smart contract vulnerabilities and code exploits.

Oracles feed real-world data into smart contracts. If attackers influence or corrupt these inputs, they can trigger faulty contract logic. For instance, manipulating the reported price of an asset could allow an attacker to buy it at a discount or trigger a liquidation cascade. In DeFi, where value is algorithmically tied to oracle data, the consequences can be immediate and catastrophic.

Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains, but they've also become prime targets for attackers. Many bridge architectures rely on complex smart contracts and custodial mechanisms, creating large honeypots of funds. A single vulnerability can be exploited to mint or release wrapped tokens without backing, leading to massive losses.

Not all threats in blockchain are technical. Some of the most damaging attacks are social in nature. Rug pulls occur when developers abruptly withdraw liquidity or abandon a project after attracting user investment, leaving holders with worthless tokens. These schemes often masquerade as legitimate startups, leveraging hype, influencer marketing, and anonymous teams to build trust before vanishing with user funds.

We identified that 3.59% of all launched tokens in 2024 displayed patterns that may have been linked to rug pull schemes. Moreover, approximately 94% of DEX pools involved in suspected pump-and-dump schemes appear to be rugged by the address that created the DEX pool. The other 6% appear to be rugged by the addresses that were funded by the pool or token deployer.

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors in crypto. As we recently revealed in our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, nearly $10 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraud and scams, although we estimate this number is likely closer to $12.4 billion, which would be a slight increase from amounts stolen in 2023.

Whether through fake wallet apps, malicious airdrops, or impersonated support accounts, attackers trick users into revealing private keys or signing malicious transactions. These scams are growing more targeted and convincing, often exploiting community trust and platform UX loopholes.

Preventing cyberattacks before they happen starts with visibility. On-chain data provides an invaluable window into blockchain activity, helping security teams identify red flags early — whether that's unusual transaction patterns, interactions with known malicious contracts, or sudden liquidity movements. Real-time monitoring and transaction analysis are essential for catching threats in motion.

Key components of blockchain analytics include:

Chainalysis plays a critical role in blockchain analytics by connecting activity across chains and platforms, enabling faster detection, deeper investigations, and more coordinated responses. As threats grow more complex, this kind of integrated, data-driven approach is key to building safer blockchain infrastructure.

Cryptocurrency has long faced criticism for its energy use—especially Bitcoin. But now, a growing movement in “green crypto” is aiming to make blockchain sustainable.

The world of cryptocurrency is often associated with dazzling digital fortunes and cutting-edge technology. But beneath the surface, a significant environmental question mark has loomed: the massive energy consumption of some popular cryptocurrencies. For years, headlines have focused on Bitcoin's electricity usage, sometimes comparing it to entire countries. However, a powerful counter-movement is gaining momentum – the rise of “green crypto” and sustainable blockchain initiatives.

Driven by environmental concerns, investor pressure, and technological innovation, developers and communities are actively working to build a more eco-friendly future for digital assets. From energy-sipping technologies to projects that directly fund environmental causes, the crypto landscape is undergoing a green transformation. This article explores this shift, looking at the technologies making it possible, the leading sustainable projects, and how even casual crypto users can get involved.

To understand why green crypto is necessary, we need to look at the technology behind early cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Many operate using a system called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Think of PoW as a complex mathematical puzzle-solving contest. Computers worldwide (called miners) race to solve these puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, a shared digital ledger. The first miner to find the solution gets rewarded with new cryptocurrency. If you're curious about what a “hash” is, this video by Ken Sheriff shows it done by hand, whereas modern miners do this multiple trillions of times a second!

HOW TO MINE BITCOIN BY HAND

While secure, this process requires immense computational power, which translates directly into high electricity consumption. As the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rose, more powerful computers joined the mining network, driving energy demand even higher. Studies, like a 2022 White House report, estimated that global crypto assets using PoW could generate between 110 and 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually – comparable to the emissions of some entire nations. This significant environmental footprint raised alarms among environmentalists, regulators, and even leaders within the tech industry.

The good news is that the crypto world is actively developing and adopting greener alternatives to PoW. The most prominent shift is towards Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

Instead of solving energy-intensive puzzles, PoS relies on a different mechanism to validate transactions. In a PoS system, individuals or groups “stake” their own cryptocurrency as collateral. The network then chooses validators from this pool, often based on the amount staked and other factors, to confirm transactions and create new blocks. Because it doesn't require massive computational power, PoS is dramatically more energy-efficient.

The most significant example of this shift was Ethereum's “Merge” in September 2022. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs, transitioned from PoW to PoS. The result was staggering: Ethereum's energy consumption plummeted by an estimated 99.95% or more almost overnight. This move demonstrated that even major, established blockchains could successfully adopt greener technology.

Beyond PoS, other innovative consensus mechanisms are contributing to the green wave:

Several cryptocurrencies have been designed with sustainability at their core or have made significant commitments to reducing their environmental impact. Here are some notable examples in 2024-2025:

The potential for blockchain to contribute to sustainability extends far beyond just making cryptocurrencies greener. The underlying technology – a secure, transparent, and immutable digital ledger – has applications in various environmental initiatives:

Recognizing the need for collective action, several industry-wide initiatives have emerged:

Even if you're not a developer or a large investor, there are ways to support the shift towards a more sustainable crypto ecosystem:

Despite the progress, the path to a fully sustainable crypto industry isn't without obstacles:

The green crypto movement is dynamic and evolving. Several trends are likely to shape its future:

The narrative surrounding cryptocurrency and the environment is clearly shifting. While the high energy consumption of Proof-of-Work blockchains remains a valid concern, the industry is demonstrating a strong capacity for innovation and adaptation. The transition towards Proof-of-Stake, spearheaded by Ethereum's successful Merge, alongside the emergence of inherently efficient technologies like Hashgraph and the development of novel use cases for blockchain in environmental stewardship, paints a picture of a greener future.

Projects like Cardano, Algorand, Hedera, and others are proving that blockchain technology and environmental responsibility can go hand-in-hand. Initiatives like the Crypto Climate Accord show a growing industry commitment to collective action.

However, challenges like greenwashing and the environmental impact of hardware persist. For individuals interested in crypto, the rise of sustainable options offers exciting possibilities but also underscores the need for due diligence. Understanding the technology behind a coin, verifying its environmental claims, and supporting projects genuinely committed to sustainability are crucial steps.

The green crypto revolution is not just about reducing harm; it's about exploring how this powerful technology can actively contribute to a more sustainable world. As innovation continues, the hope is that blockchain can evolve from an environmental concern into a key tool for building a greener, more transparent, and equitable digital future.

A financial deal was supposed to help launch the MOVE crypto token.Instead, it led to a token-dumping scandal, a Binance ban, and behind-the-scenes infighting. 

Contracts obtained by CoinDesk help explain where it all went wrong. 

Movement, the blockchain project behind the MOVE cryptocurrency, is investigating whether it was deceived into signing a financial agreement that granted a single entity outsized control over the market for its token, according to internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk.

The agreement led to 66 million MOVE tokens being sold onto the market the day after the asset's December 9 exchange debut, triggering a steep price drop and allegations of insider dealing within a crypto project endorsed by World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture backed by Donald Trump.

Cooper Scanlon, Movement Labs' co-founder, told employees in an April 21 Slack message that the company was examining how more than 5% of MOVE tokens earmarked for Web3Port, a market maker, were routed through a middleman named Rentech — “an entity the foundation was led to believe was a subsidiary of Web3Port but apparently is not.” Rentech denies engaging in any misrepresentation.

Movement's contract with Rentech loaned a single counterparty around half of MOVE's publicly held supply, according to an internal Movement Foundation memo. This granted the entity an unusually large degree of control over the fledgling token, experts told CoinDesk.

More worryingly, in versions of the contracts obtained by CoinDesk, “there are incentives basically to manipulate the price to over $5 billion fully diluted value and then dump on retail for shared profit,” concluded Zaki Manian, a veteran crypto founder who reviewed the documents. “Even participating in a discussion where that's on paper is insane.”

Market makers, hired to provide liquidity for new tokens, stabilize prices by buying and selling on exchanges using money loaned to them by a token's issuer. But the role can also be abused, giving insiders a way to quietly manipulate markets and offload large token holdings without drawing attention.

A series of contracts obtained by CoinDesk offer a rare look into a murky corner of crypto, where weak oversight and opaque legal agreements can turn public projects into private windfalls.

While crypto market-making abuses are often rumored about, the details behind them almost never surface to the public.

The market-making contracts reviewed by CoinDesk show Rentech appeared in agreements on both sides of a deal with the Movement Foundation — once as an agent of the Movement Foundation and once as a Web3Port subsidiary — a setup that could theoretically allow the middleman to dictate terms and profit from its position in the middle.

Movement's deal with Rentech ultimately enabled wallets tied to Web3Port — a Chinese financial firm that claims to have worked with projects including MyShell, GoPlus Security, and the Donald Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial — to immediately liquidate $38 million in MOVE tokens the day after the token debuted on exchanges.

Binance, the crypto exchange, later banned the market-making account for “misconduct,” and Movement announced a token buyback plan.

Like stock options at startups, token allocations in crypto projects are typically subject to lock-up periods intended to prevent insiders from selling large stakes during a project's early trading.

The Binance ban created the impression — which Movement denied — that project insiders might have entered into an improper agreement with Web3Port to sell tokens ahead of schedule.

Movement, a new Layer 2 blockchain designed to scale Ethereum using Facebook's Move programming language, is one of the most talked-about crypto projects of recent years.

Founded by 22-year-old Vanderbilt University dropouts Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, the company raised $38 million from investors, nabbed a spot in the World Liberty Financial crypto portfolio, and has been the subject of intense social media attention.

Reuters reported in January that Movement Labs was close to wrapping a $100 million funding round that would have valued the company at $3 billion.

In interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with Movement's internal operations, most of whom requested anonymity to avoid reprisal, CoinDesk heard a range of conflicting allegations over who architected the Rentech arrangement, which industry experts called highly unusual.

Galen Law-Kun, the owner of Rentech, rejects the suggestion that the Foundation was deceived into signing a market-making agreement, asserting that the entity structure was crafted with full collaboration from the Movement Foundation's general counsel, YK Pek.

Pek disputes having any involvement in creating Rentech and was, at least at first, deeply critical of the deal internally, according to a memo and other communications reviewed by CoinDesk.

In his message to employees, Scanlon, the co-founder of Movement Labs, states that Movement is “a victim in this situation.”

According to four sources familiar with the investigation who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity, Movement is also examining the involvement of its co-founder Rushi Manche, who initially forwarded a deal with Rentech to the Movement team and promoted it internally, and Sam Thapaliya, an informal adviser to Movement and business partner to Law-Kun.

Web3Port did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Despite initially rejecting a risky market-making deal with Rentech, Movement ultimately signed a revised agreement with similar features, relying on assurances from a middleman without any identifiable track record.

In the lightly regulated cryptocurrency industry, projects typically split their operations between a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit development firm. The developer — Movement Labs, in this case — builds the technology, while the foundation stewards the token and manages community resources.

The two entities are supposed to operate independently: a structure designed to shield the token from securities regulations. In Movement's case, however, internal correspondence reviewed by CoinDesk suggests that Manche — an employee of the development firm, Movement Labs — also played an active role in the non-profit Movement Foundation.

On March 28, Manche sent a market-making contract to the Movement Foundation in a Telegram message — it needed a signature.

The draft agreement proposed loaning a massive 5% allocation of MOVE tokens to Rentech, a company with zero digital footprint.

Pek, the foundation's lawyer, flagged the document in an email as “[p]ossibly the worst agreement” he had ever seen. In a separate memo reviewed by CoinDesk, he warned that it would hand control of MOVE's market to a single unknown entity. Marc Piano, director of the foundation's British Virgin Islands entity, also refused to sign.

Among the contract's more unusual provisions was a clause allowing Rentech to liquidate its MOVE tokens if the cryptocurrency's fully diluted value exceeded $5 billion — a benchmark that, if reached, would have allowed Rentech to split profits 50-50 with the foundation.

According to Manian, this created a perverse incentive for the market maker to artificially increase the price of MOVE so that it could sell its massive supply of tokens for a profit.

Movement Foundation declined to sign the deal, but they continued discussions with Rentech.

According to three people familiar with the discussions and legal documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Rentech eventually told Movement Foundation it was operating as a subsidiary of Web3Port, the Chinese market-making firm. According to these sources, Rentech also offered to front $60 million of its own collateral, a detail that helped sweeten the arrangement for the foundation.

On December 8, the Movement Foundation agreed to a modified version of the market-making contract that removed some of the provisions most troubling to the foundation. Among the changes: the new deal eliminated a clause that would have allowed Web3Port to sue Movement Foundation for damages if the MOVE token failed to list on a specific crypto exchange.

The revised agreement, which was primarily crafted by Pek, who originally pushed back, still contained many of the same features as the original: It still allowed Web3Port to borrow 5% of MOVE's supply and sell tokens for a profit, albeit under a different disbursement structure.

The new contract listed Web3Port as the borrower, and a director of Rentech signed on its behalf.

DNS records show that the domain name attached to the Rentech director's email address, web3portrentech.io, was registered on the same day the contract was signed.

According to three people close to the situation, Movement Foundation officials did not realize that Web3Port had already entered into an agreement with “Movement” weeks before the December 8 deal was signed.

A contract dated November 25 and obtained by CoinDesk shows that Web3Port had signed a deal, apparently with Movement, that closely resembled the original proposal Movement Foundation had rejected. In this deal, Rentech was listed as a representative of Movement.

The deal was structured similarly to the Nov. 27 contract, explicitly allowing the market maker to liquidate tokens if MOVE's price hit certain targets — a key provision from the older agreement that stood out to experts like Manian.

Sources close to Movement have presented several theories around who ultimately architected the relationship with Rentech, which led to December's token-dumping incident and a wave of negative press attention for Movement.

The agreement was initially circulated internally by Manche, who was briefly placed on administrative leave last week, as Blockworks first reported.

“Throughout the market maker selection process, the MVMT Labs team trusted various advisers and members on the foundation team to provide input and help properly structure those deals,” Manche told CoinDesk. “Apparently, at least one member of the Foundation team represented interests on both sides of the market maker deal, which we are now in the process of investigating.”

Among those close to Movement, scrutiny over the deal has also spurred questions about whether Sam Thapaliya — the founder of crypto protocol Zebec and an adviser to Manche and Scanlon — may have played a behind-the-scenes role.

Thapaliya was CC'd alongside Rentech and Manche in an email from Web3Port to ""Movement Team"" and other communications regarding the market-making arrangement reviewed by CoinDesk.

“My understanding is that Sam is a close advisor to Rushi and perhaps sort of a shadow third co-founder,” said one employee. “Rushi kept the relationship pretty hidden; we often just heard his name.”

“A lot of times we'd decide on something, and at the last minute there would be this change,” said another. “In those cases, we knew it was probably coming from Sam.”

Thapaliya was present at Movement's San Francisco office on the day that the MOVE token launched to the public, according to three people who were present.

Telegram screenshots reviewed by CoinDesk also show that Scanlon commissioned Thapaliya to help curate MOVE's airdrop whitelist — the carefully controlled list of wallet addresses eligible to receive tokens in Movement's (long-delayed) community token giveaway. 

The arrangement reinforced a perception among some Movement employees that Thapaliya's influence within the company was more extensive than acknowledged.

Thapaliya, according to a statement he shared with CoinDesk, met Manche and Scanlon while they were college students and has served as an outside adviser to Movement over the years. Thapaliya told CoinDesk he has ""no equity in Movement Labs,"" ""no token from Movement Foundation"" and ""no decision-making power"" within either organization.

Rentech, the entity at the center of the token dispute, was created by Galen Law-Kun, Thapaliya's business partner. Law-Kun told CoinDesk he established Rentech as a subsidiary of Autonomy, his Singapore-based financial services firm, to connect crypto projects with family offices in Asia.

In a statement to CoinDesk, Law-Kun said YK Pek “helped set up and was general counsel of Autonomy SG, which is the parent or affiliate company of Rentech.” He also claimed that Pek, despite pushing back against the initial Rentech deal internally, “advised to set up the Rentech structure for the launch” and “advised on the first version of the contract, which is almost identical to the contract he later drafted and approved for the foundation.”

CoinDesk's investigation has not uncovered any evidence confirming that Pek set up Rentech or authored the first version of the contract while acting on behalf of Autonomy.

“I am not and have never been Galen or any of his entities' general counsel,” stated Pek. “A corporate administration firm that I co-founded, and which provides corporate secretarial services to over 150 entities in the Web3 space has provided corporate secretarial services to two of his companies, both of which filed 'no assets' as part of their annual renewals in 2025. Neither of these companies are Rentech.”

Pek states that he once spent “two hours” reviewing an advisory agreement that Law-Kun had with a project in 2024. Additionally, ""[h]e reached out to me regarding the FTX filing deadline,"" and in August, ""he forwarded me an NDA Docusign which I cast my eye over without charging him.""

“I have no idea why Galen would claim I am his general counsel and I am frankly confused and disturbed by that claim,” Pek continued. “He was represented in email correspondence with my corporate services partner by his personal lawyer from one 'Hillington Group'.""

According to Pek, “[b]oth the general counsels of Movement Foundation (myself) and Movement Labs were introduced to GS Legal as counsel for Rentech by Rushi Manche.”

In Law-Kun's telling, Pek was ""introduced to 10 projects as my Autonomy lawyer"" and ""never hesitated to say otherwise or correct the statement."" According to Law-Kun, ""The GS introduction was just done as a formality requested by Movement.""

In his Slack message to employees, Scanlon said Movement had retained Groom Lake, an outside auditing firm, to “conduct the third-party review into recent market maker abnormalities.”

“Movement is a victim in this situation,” he wrote.

BlackRock is preparing to bring blockchain to the back office of one of its largest funds, filing to offer a digital share class of its $150 billion Treasury Trust money market fund through BNY Mellon.

The new “DLT Shares,” short for distributed ledger technology, won't hold crypto. BNY Mellon, the fund's exclusive distributor, intends to use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, an incremental step that could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized cash, digital assets, or blockchain-based settlement infrastructure in traditional finance.

In the past few years, a growing number of firms has experimented with creating blockchain-based representations of real world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly into the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Earlier Wednesday, Libre said it was tokenizing $500 million of messaging platform Telegram's $2.4 billion debt and bringing it to the TON blockchain.

BlackRock's Liquidity Treasury Trust Fund is part of the firm's Liquidity Funds suite and managed over $150 billion in assets as of April 29. The DLT share class has a minimum investment requirement of $3 million for institutional buyers, with no minimums on subsequent purchases. The SEC filing is preliminary and subject to approval.

The move isn't BlackRock's first into tokenization. Its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, created in partnership with Securitize, now manages over $1.7 billion in assets and recently expanded onto Solana.

CEO Larry Fink has consistently emphasized his belief in the long-term potential of tokenization and decentralized finance. In his 2025 annual letter to shareholders, Fink warned that the U.S. risks ceding its financial dominance if it fails to control its debt — a vulnerability that could accelerate investor interest in alternatives like bitcoin (BTC).

“If the U.S. doesn't get its debt under control … America risks losing [its reserve currency status] to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote. “Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage.”



UPDATE (April 30, 7:29 UTC): Adds third paragraph on tokenization trends, rewrites headline.

What one hour ago was looking like another positive day in markets has turned decidedly negative as the latest economic data fueled growing stagflation fears.

First up was ADP jobs numbers for April. Coming two days ahead of the government's own employment data for April, the ADP report showed just 62,000 private sector jobs created this month, well shy of estimates for 108,000 and March's 147,000. It was the weakest print since July 2024.

Next was the government's first estimate of first quarter GDP growth, which came in at negative 0.3% against estimates for positive 0.2%. While the quarter ended in March, economic actors — fully aware of coming tariffs — front-loaded imports early in the year. Going back to Econ 101, rising imports (absent a corresponding gain in exports) are a drag on GDP growth. 

Indeed, the export-import imbalance cut GDP growth by nearly 5% in the first quarter. Also at work was the Trump administration's DOGE efforts, with government spending a drag on GDP for the first time since 2022.

Turning to inflation, the Core PCE price index embedded within the GDP report rose 3.5% versus estimates for a gain of just 3.1%.

It's all adding up to a big drop in U.S. stocks, with the Nasdaq lower 2% and S&P 500 by 1.5%. That's hitting bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped about 1% alongside to $94,300.

Strategists for two U.S. bills meant to create an oversight regime for crypto are setting out plans this week to pass legislation in the summer, Bo Hines, the White House official at the center of those efforts, told CoinDesk.



Hines, who President Donald Trump hired as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk in an interview that the procedures are being ironed out to move legislation on regulating stablecoin issuers, and the crypto advocates in the White House and Congress will quickly pivot to the bigger bill that will set a full regulatory regime for U.S. crypto markets.



The progress so far puts the efforts ""well on pace to achieve what the President desires,"" he said, which is that both crypto bills reach Trump's desk for signatures before Congress takes its summer recess in August.



The president's adviser, who is a speaker at Consensus 2025 in Toronto May 14-16, said the bills to regulate stablecoin issuers that are moving through the Senate and House of Representatives are ""90% aligned,"" so it won't be a difficult task to bring them together into a unified approach that would still need approval in both chambers.""We're in the process of mitigating any differences between the two chambers there, but we feel like, you know, we're in a really good spot to get that passed and signed into law,"" he said. ""It lays the foundation for everything that we can do.""



He said the more complex undertaking to write laws for how the U.S. should police the overall markets should emerge in draft bills ""in the next few weeks.""





While Congress is moving unusually fast, the president's own crypto business interests have been criticized by Democrats who accuse Trump of improperly benefiting from his own policies and of inviting foreign influence from investors in his family's projects. Trump's interests include stakes in World Liberty Financial and the president's own memecoin, $TRUMP. Hines pushed back, saying the rise of crypto has presented attractive innovations for investors.

""Any good business person would engage in a marketplace opportunity like that,"" he said. ""So, you know, I don't view it as being detrimental in any capacity whatsoever.""



The president and his family have the ""ability to engage with any marketplace that they see fit,"" Hines said.



""We're narrowly focused on just doing what's in the best interest of the United States to make the U.S. the crypto capital world, usher in the golden age of digital assets, and we have our binders on to everything else,"" he said. ""That's what the president's asked us to do, and we're going to deliver on his wishes.""



The White House official, 29, is known as a staunch loyalist to Trump, who had endorsed the former college football player in the first of his two unsuccessful North Carolina congressional campaigns. Despite his relative inexperience in the crypto field, Trump elevated Hines to a senior White House role to work beside crypto czar David Sacks and act as a ""sherpa between White House policy, interagency activity, industry and what's happening on Capitol Hill,"" as Hines described it.



""We move at a speed that no other administration has ever been able to move before,"" Hines noted.





Many in the digital assets industry had clamored for a digital assets reserve at the federal level, though the idea for how to approach it varies widely. Trump's campaign-trail promises surged toward reality in March when he ordered his administration to start work on a bitcoin (BTC) reserve and a separate stockpile of other crypto assets.



One point of disappointment for those who'd wished for it was that Trump insisted the reserve be budget-neutral, meaning no new taxpayer money would go toward acquiring assets for the reserve.



Hines has been a prominent booster of this effort. He said the Treasury-led audit of U.S. crypto holdings, which needs to be done to find out the extent of assets (so far unmeasured) that'll be directed into the stockpiles, is progressing quickly. The Treasury Department is now going through audit reports from various corners of the U.S. government, he said.



Trump had directed his administration to work out ideas for how to add even more to the funds without tapping taxpayers, and Hines said they're still ""fleshing out the best ideas.""



""I don't think there's going to be one single resolution where we say, 'This is the path that we're going.' I think there could be multiple ways in which we engage in this,"" Hines said, ""We view bitcoin as digital gold, and we want to accumulate as much as we can.""



He didn't have a timeline in mind for when the first tokens will begin stacking up as a longterm U.S. government investment.





The transition from President Joe Biden to Trump's administration has been stark for the industry — until recently a target of government suspicion and now celebrated as an innovative movement that should be fostered. Already, regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission have reversed policies and started crypto roundtables behind doors that had been largely closed to digital assets discussions. And Trump himself held a crypto summit in the room of the White House where state dinners are hosted.



""We move at a speed that no other administration has ever been able to move before,"" Hines noted.



Hines said he's had as many as 200 meetings with crypto insiders in his short stint in the government, and he granted that their opinions can range widely. But he thinks the industry is largely aligned where it needs to be as Congress and regulators are considering its U.S. future.



When asked about some industry concerns about splitting the crypto legislation into two rather than a combined, single effort to improve its odds, he said details could still be worked out, though he's currently focused on a stablecoin bill being quickly followed by market-structure legislation.



The crypto push, which he said ""some will portray as being a chaotic process,"" looks that way because that's always the case in government policymaking ""when you're attempting to effectuate change.""



""We're talking about revolutionizing a financial marketplace which has basically been archaic for the last three decades,"" he said. ""I just think that people should be very excited about what's to come.""

 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says Ether needs “more than just a good week here and there.” 

Key takeaways

Approving staking for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may have a minimal impact on inflows unless Ether sees a sustained rally, says Eric Balchunas

ETH dropped significantly in price after the launch of the ETFs last year, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw new all-time highs just two months after launching.

Balchunas said that for inflows to increase again, ETH would need a multimonth run and a strong narrative.

Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token's price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Balchunas said on an April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast that staking being approved for Ether (ETH) ETFs would have “a little” impact on inflows, adding “it's only going to help — it can't hurt.”

However, Balchunas noted that one of the main reasons for the weak inflows into Ether ETFs since their July launch in the US is that ETH has yet to sustain a prolonged rally.

He added that when Ether's price surged during a run in December, there was a direct correlation with an increase in inflows. 

Donald Trump's election win in November sparked a crypto market rally which saw ETH surge 71% to reach $4,107 on Dec. 16. 

From Nov. 22, spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day positive inflow streak, amassing approximately $2.44 billion in inflows, according to Farside data.

However, since tapping the $4,107 price level, Ether entered a downtrend and has since fallen 56% to trade around $1,809 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Balchunas said that for inflows to pick up again, Ether would need a “multimonth run” paired with a “strong narrative.”

“It needs something that is more than just a good week here and there,” he added.

Balchunas noted that after the Ether ETFs launched, the price “went down quickly,” making any recovery difficult, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high just two months after they launched in January 2024.

“When you launch an ETF, and you have that sort of performance out of the gate, it's tough,” he said.

US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that “it's possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.”

“Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May and late August,” he added.

 Payments giant PayPal said in a regulatory filing that its PayPal USD stablecoin is no longer in the SEC's crosshairs. 

PayPal says the US Securities and Exchange Commission has abandoned its investigation into the payment giant's US-dollar stablecoin.

PayPal said in an April 29 regulatory filing that the SEC concluded its investigation into PayPal USD (PYUSD) and wouldn't be taking any action.

The company said it received a subpoena from the SEC's Division of Enforcement over its stablecoin in November 2023. 

“The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request,” PayPal stated at the time.

In its latest filing, the firm said the SEC notified it in February that the agency “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.”

PayPal has said its stablecoin is 100% redeemable for US dollars and “fully backed” by dollar deposits, including short-term treasuries and cash equivalents. 

However, the stablecoin has struggled to gain momentum in a crowded market dominated by rivals Tether and Circle. PYUSD has a market capitalization of just $880 million, less than 1% of Tether's (USDT) $148.5 billion.

PayPal's stablecoin has seen better growth this year with a 75% increase in PYUSD circulating supply since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. It remains down 14% from its peak supply of just over $1 billion in August 2024. 

That growth could be bolstered by a company announcement on April 23 introducing rewards for PYUSD in a new loyalty offering that will enable US users to earn 3.7% annually for holding the asset on the platform. 

Meanwhile, on April 24, PayPal announced a partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption of PYUSD. 

“We are excited to drive new, exciting, and innovative use cases together with Coinbase and the entire cryptocurrency community, putting PYUSD at the center,”  said Alex Chriss, PayPal President and CEO.

The payments giant also reported robust first-quarter earnings and the completion of significant share repurchase activities. 

The firm beat Wall Street estimates, earning $1.33 per share in the first quarter, topping analyst expectations of $1.16. Revenue rose 1% from a year before to $7.8 billion.

 Richard Byworth says that a firm like Strategy isn't concerned with how high Bitcoin's price goes; its focus is solely on the multiple of its net asset value. 

Key takeaways:

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor's Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy's mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor's Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.

“Saylor's strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

However, Byworth pondered what happens when Bitcoin (BTC) reaches an “illiquid supply” point where no Bitcoin is left on crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks.

“Should Saylor buy Bitcoin really carelessly? As in, not try and buy it through OTC desks…and actually just buy it with the intention of massively ramping the price,” Byworth said.

Strategy currently holds 553,555 BTC, valued at approximately $52.48 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. 

Fidelity Digital Assets said on April 24 that it has seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to purchases by public companies, which it anticipated would accelerate “in the near future.” 

Byworth said a firm like Strategy wouldn't be concerned with the price of Bitcoin when buying it as its primary focus would be on its mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value), the value of the assets held, as “it is much more beneficial to [its] shareholders.”

He added that when there is no more Bitcoin, “you may as well go aggressive buying, because what happens is it will just ramp the price, it will massively increase [Strategy's] MNAV, which means [its] dilution will become much more accretive.”

Movements in the NAV premium and discount can give signals about market sentiment or potential future price movements.

Byworth said that Japan has a “large number of zombie companies” holding significant cash reserves. He proposed that Strategy could adopt an aggressive approach by acquiring these companies and “immediately converting that cash into Bitcoin,” similar to the strategy taken by Japanese investment firm Metaplanet.

“There are plenty of companies out there in Japan like that, sitting on these cash flow generative businesses that are pretty boring and have very low price-to-cash ratios,” Byworth added.

On April 21, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than $400 million after its latest $28 million purchase.

Byworth's comments come as Bitcoin trades below the psychological $100,000 price level, a threshold it fell below in early February, which has widely been attributed to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

Bitcoin is trading at $94,680, down 13.22% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Why Ozempic and Wegovy Might Change Some People's Favorite Foods

Some users of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have been reporting strange changes in food preferences, such as a new dislike for meats or fried foods, and scientists are beginning to figure out why

For most of her life, Alyssa Fraser took comfort in cooking. Fraser, a former food reporter from Minnesota, used to relish the process of whipping up her favorite chicken and vegetable recipe or batches of pasta. But after she started taking the popular weight-loss medication Wegovy, her culinary interests seemed to disappear because she became disinterested in food—and certain types of food became particularly off-putting. Many savory meals lost their appeal, and some proteins began to taste too much like the “barnyard” the animal came from, she says. Even her favorite wine, which usually tasted crisp and citrusy, seemed weirdly “vegetal.”

Similar to Fraser, other users of Wegovy (known in its generic form as semaglutide), along with those of Ozempic (a form of semaglutide used to treat type 2 diabetes), Zepbound (known generically as tirzepatide) and other medications broadly called glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, have described peculiar changes in the way food tastes. GLP-1 drugs—initially designed to help treat type 2 diabetes by triggering insulin release—can cause weight loss by making people feel full faster. But some people report that in addition to an increase in satiety, they experience changes in their preferences for specific foods—they find meats suddenly repulsive, fried foods too heavy and savory snacks unappealing. On online forums and in scientific surveys, some people have expressed a general loss of interest in food overall—a few have even said that the drugs have redefined food as a necessity rather than a joy for them. These accounts may even be captured in grocery store data that suggest people on GLP-1 medications spend less on food, especially calorie-dense and processed items.

Some preliminary evidence suggests changes in food preferences might play a role in weight loss, but it's not clear how much such changes contribute to that result compared with the medications' effect on satiety. And research on the phenomenon has mostly involved animal models or small studies of humans. Experts, however, are starting to gain some clues as to how common these apparent shifts in food preference and taste really are among users and what might be behind them.

A recent study published in Food Quality and Preference found that people on GLP-1 medications reported reaching for processed foods, as well as refined grains and beef, less often. They also said they were drinking less soda and other sweetened drinks and increasing their intake of fruit, leafy greens and water. Further, they reported consuming about 700 fewer calories per day. These findings rely on self-reported data, however, which can sometimes be unreliable, says Brandon McFadden, a professor in food policy economics at the University of Arkansas and co-author of the study.

Additionally, although GLP-1 users reported eating fewer calorie-dense foods, most people didn't necessarily lose all desire for them. This is because liking a food is different from wanting it, says John Blundell, an emeritus professor in psychobiology at the University of Leeds in England, who was not involved in the recent paper. A person might not find a food particularly tasty (in other words, they might not enjoy the specific sensory experience of consuming it) but still have a strong behavioral drive to eat it. GLP-1 medications seem to involve the reverse: people still like certain foods but have less of an immediate urge to eat them.

These drugs mimic a hormone called GLP-1, which the gut naturally secretes in response to food and which binds to the hormone's receptors around the body—including in brain areas involved in appetite regulation and in reward pathways that reduce the pleasure response to food. Researchers have found that this is the primary way the drugs cause people to lose weight, and some think it might be involved in altered food preferences.

Desires for specific foods can change depending on whether a person is generally hungry or full. For example, when you're hungry, you're more likely to want meaty, high-protein or sometimes high-fat foods rather than sweet ones, Blundell explains. “When you become full, the reverse happens,” he says: a big piece of meat or a high-fat food becomes aversive—but you might feel like you have a so-called second stomach for dessert. One plausible explanation for this, Blundell says, could be that GLP-1 drugs' satiating effect simply makes such end-of-meal preferences kick in. It's also possible that some aspects of the drugs' compounds could directly act on specific food preferences through some other biological mechanism. “But it hasn't been demonstrated,” says Blundell, who is working with a food company to develop foods that are more palatable for people on GLP-1 medications.

Blundell led a small study, published in 2017, that found people taking semaglutide not only reduced their overall daily food intake but also preferred and consumed fewer high-fat and savory foods. Previous research that he published in 2007 showed that being full also diminishes similar cravings.

But satiety alone may not fully explain the shift in eating preferences. Emerging evidence and anecdotal user accounts suggest changes to the body's taste mechanisms could also play a role. Some users describe flavors becoming stronger or unpleasant while on the medications, though individual experiences seem to vary: Siobhan, a Los Angeles–based writer, who has been taking Wegovy since 2021 and withheld her last name for privacy, says she still finds fatty foods such as French fries appealing—but her favorite food, panang curry, has become too bitter. “I've been eating that curry for 20 years,” Siobhan says. “It just didn't taste right anymore.” Two-year Wegovy user Sarah Streby says she can no longer stomach eggs or broccoli, and her love for spicy food has waned—causing her to change how she cooks for her family. “Now everyone's complaining the food is too mild because [I] can't handle the spice,” she says.

At press time, Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy and Ozempic, had not responded to a request for comment from Scientific American. A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes the weight-loss drug Zepbound, told Scientific American in an e-mail, “We do not have data to share concerning changes in food taste or preference among individuals taking GLP-1 medications.” The spokesperson added that known side effects are listed on the medication's labels and that anyone experiencing those side effects should contact their health care provider.

Scientists have found GLP-1 receptors in human taste buds, which hints at a possible explanation for alterations in taste, but findings remain mixed. Some past research has found that people with a higher body weight tend to perceive flavors less intensely, and some evidence suggests this may prompt people to eat more in an attempt to get a bigger sensory reward. In the case of sweet foods, people with a higher body weight also may be less able to perceive a high sugar content, though findings on this have been contradictory. A small study presented at the Endocrine Society's 2024 annual conference found that women taking semaglutide were more sensitive to taste compared with those on a placebo. Brain scans showed increased activity in a region involved in processing sensory rewards when participants tasted something sweet, suggesting that semaglutide may heighten taste perception and make certain foods less appealing.

But another study published in March in Physiology & Behavior seems to suggest the opposite. It found that 46 people taking these medications experienced a reduced sensitivity to all five basic tastes—sweet, sour, salty, bitter and brothy (or umami)—compared with people in a control group. Past studies in mice linked the activation of GLP-1 receptors to alterations in sweet taste perception, but researchers were surprised to see that the effect in humans was broader than anticipated, says Richard Doty, director of the Smell and Taste Center at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the March paper. Previous research that linked GLP-1 medications to alterations in taste has mostly looked at diabetic populations, Doty says, adding that “the focus has always been on sugar, and so people haven't looked at the other sensory systems any great detail.” He suspects the GLP-1 receptors found in taste buds are behind the March findings, “but we really don't know; there needs to be more research on that.”

For some, the drugs' effects on satiety and taste are welcome changes that make it easier to eat less. But for others, it's more complicated. “Not only am I not cooking or really taking an interest in food—if I want it, it's sweets,” Fraser says. “And even then, if it's super sweet, I'll take a bite or two, and I'm like, I gotta put it down.” She says savory foods have lost their appeal entirely.

Fraser is still considering the trade-offs for the improvements she's seen in her health as she navigates this shift and deals with the loss of a loved hobby. But “the mental load of weight loss has been greatly reduced,” she says, “and that is worth it to me.”

Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity1,2. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared3. Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT)4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)6,7,8,9,10 via a theory-neutral consortium11,12,13. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof12. Human participants (n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here14,15,16,17. Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.

Philosophers and scientists have sought to explain the subjective nature of consciousness (for example, the feeling of pain or of seeing a colourful rainbow) and how it relates to physical processes in the brain18,19. This quest has led to various theories of consciousness evolving in parallel1,2,3 and often providing incompatible accounts of the neural basis of consciousness1,2. Furthermore, empirical support for a given theory is often highly dependent on methodological choices, pointing towards a confirmation bias in theory testing3. Convergence on a broadly accepted neuroscientific theory of consciousness will have profound medical, societal and ethical implications.

To advance this goal, we tested two theories of consciousness, through a large-scale, open-science adversarial collaboration11,12,20,21,22 aimed at accelerating progress in consciousness research by building on constructive disagreement. We brought together proponents of IIT4,5 and GNWT6,23, in addition to theory-neutral researchers. The group identified differential existing and novel predictions of the two theories and developed an experimental design to test them (Fig. 1a). We preregistered these predictions, including pass or fail criteria, expected outcomes and their interpretation ex-ante11,12. We focus on IIT and GNWT, among other widely discussed theories (for example, recurrent processing theory and higher-order theories1,2), because they feature prominently in consciousness science, as demonstrated by a recent systematic review of the literature3.

a, Predictions of IIT and GNWT. For prediction 1 (decoding of conscious content), IIT predicts maximal decoding of conscious content in posterior brain areas, whereas GNWT emphasizes a necessary role for the PFC. For prediction 2 (maintenance of conscious content), IIT posits that conscious content is actively maintained in the posterior cortex, whereas GNWT predicts brief content-specific ignition (approximately 0.3–0.5 s) in the PFC at stimulus onset and offset, with content stored in a non-conscious silent state between these events. Waveforms (left) and temporal generalization matrices (right) illustrate the predicted amplitude-based and information-based temporal profiles: coloured rectangles indicate the three stimulus durations for PFC (GNWT) and posterior cortex (IIT; left); the arrows mark stimulus onset (brown) and offset (red), whereas predicted temporal generalization is depicted in green (GNWT) and blue (IIT; right). For prediction 3 (interareal connectivity supporting consciousness), the stars and arrows on the brain diagram illustrate predicted synchrony patterns, with green representing GNWT and blue representing IIT. Brain surface is from Freesurfer. b, Conscious experience is multifaceted. For instance, viewing the Mona Lisa involves experiencing it as occupying a specific spatial location, categorizing it as a face, recognizing an identity and noting its leftward orientation, with this complex experience maintained over time. c, To manipulate conscious content, stimuli varied across four dimensions: category (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), identity (different exemplars within each category), orientation (left, right and front views) and duration (0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s). Example stimuli are shown. d, Experimental paradigm. Participants detected predefined targets (for example, a specific face and object or a letter and false font) in sequences of single, high-contrast stimuli. Each trial contained three stimulus types: targets (red; coloured frames for illustration only), task-relevant stimuli (orange-red; same categories as targets) and task-irrelevant stimuli (purple; other categories). Blank intervals between stimuli are not depicted. Object stimulus images in panels c,d are courtesy of Michael J. Tarr, Carnegie Mellon University, http://www.tarrlab.org/; face stimuli were created using FaceGen Modeler 3.1.

IIT and GNWT explain consciousness differently: IIT proposes that consciousness is the intrinsic ability of a neuronal network to influence itself, as determined by the amount of maximally irreducible integrated information (phi) supported by a network in a state. On the basis of theoretical and neuroanatomical considerations, IIT suggests that a complex of maximum phi probably resides primarily in the posterior cerebral cortex, in a temporo–parietal–occipital ‘hot zone'4,5,24,25. GNWT instead posits that consciousness arises from global broadcasting and late amplification (or ‘ignition') of information across interconnected networks of higher-order sensory, parietal and especially prefrontal cortex (PFC)6,9,23.

Both theories have a mathematical or computational core (integrated information for IIT and global workspace for GNWT) and proposed biological implementations (posterior cortex versus PFC and associated areas, respectively). Although it is difficult to test the mathematical or computational core of either theory directly, their competing biological implementations are empirically testable with current methodologies. Thus, our study focuses on brain regions where the predictions diverge most notably—posterior cortex for IIT and PFC for GNWT, rather than the associated areas in higher-order sensory or parietal cortex—to facilitate maximally diagnostic experiments.

One consequence of this biological focus is that theorists could respond to challenging data by modifying the proposed biological implementation while retaining the mathematical or computational core of a theory. Another consequence is that some predictions (and their associated consequences) may overlap with other theories of consciousness that share similar biological bases, such as higher-order theories16,17 in the PFC and local recurrency theories14,26 in the visual cortex. Although these are inherent aspects of studying theoretical proposals about neural mechanisms of consciousness, the results are expected to help the community make more informed judgements about the tested theories (for rationale, see the preregistration document27).

We tested three preregistered, peer-reviewed predictions of IIT and GNWT12 for how the brain enables conscious experience (Fig. 1a). Prediction 1 addresses the cortical areas holding information about different aspects of conscious content. IIT predicts that conscious content is maximal in posterior brain areas, whereas GNWT predicts a necessary role for PFC. Prediction 2 pertains to the maintenance of conscious percepts over time28,29,30. IIT predicts that conscious content is actively maintained by neural activity in the posterior ‘hot zone' throughout the duration of a conscious experience, whereas GNWT predicts ignition events in PFC at stimulus onset and offset, updating the global workspace, with activity-silent information maintenance in between31. Prediction 3 examines interareal connectivity during conscious perception. IIT predicts sustained short-range connectivity within the posterior cortex, linking low-level sensory (V1/V2) with high-level category-selective areas (for example, fusiform face area and lateral occipital cortex), whereas GNWT predicts long-range connectivity between high-level category-selective areas and PFC. The combination of predictions, tested through highly powered, multimodal studies, places a high bar for either theory to pass, rendering failures more informative. Predictions were differentially weighted on the basis of their centrality to the theory and methodological considerations (Extended Data Table 1; for an additional preregistered non-critical analysis, see section 8 in Supplementary Information).

To empirically test these predictions, we investigated the content and temporal extent of conscious visual experiences, focusing on their phenomenological richness and multifaceted nature, even for a single stimulus. For instance, when viewing the Mona Lisa (Fig. 1b), one experiences it as having a specific identity, orientation and location in visual space for as long as one looks at the painting. To approximate such multifaceted experiences, we manipulated several attributes of conscious content by presenting suprathreshold visual stimuli across four different categories (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), each containing 20 unique identities shown in three orientations (front, left and right view) and for three durations (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 s). In each block, participants were instructed to detect two infrequent target stimuli from either the pictorial (face–object) or symbolic (letter–false fonts) stimulus categories (for example, a specific face or object), making these categories task relevant for that block (Fig. 1c,d).

This paradigm offers several advantages. First, it provides robust conditions to test the predictions of the theories by focusing on clearly experienced conscious content, studied through a high signal-to-noise, suprathreshold, fully attended single stimulus at fixation. This amplifies the significance of any challenges to the theories, as they cannot be explained by weak signals. Second, it minimizes task and report confounds, isolating neural activity specifically related to consciousness. Third, it allows testing of novel predictions to address previously unexplored questions, that is, how experience is maintained over time, refining theories and yielding new insights.

All research was conducted by theory-neutral teams to minimize confirmatory bias. We evaluated the predictions of theories in 256 participants performing the same behavioural task in three neuroimaging modalities: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 120), magnetoencephalography (MEG; n = 102) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG; n = 34). To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of each modality, we combined whole-brain, non-invasive fMRI and MEG with invasive iEEG, ensuring methodological rigour. Combined with large sample sizes, this minimizes the likelihood that negative results are due to methodological or sensitivity issues. Data collection occurred in two (or three) independent laboratories for each modality to guarantee generalization across groups of participants, instruments and experimenters. To foster informativeness, reproducibility and robustness, we (1) separated theory proponents from data acquisition and analysis to minimize bias and post-hoc interpretation, (2) used a multimodal approach that maximizes spatiotemporal resolution and coverage for a stringent and comprehensive tests of the theories in humans, (3) predefined large samples to increase statistical power, (4) followed standardized32 and preregistered protocols12 to reduce setup differences and confirmatory bias22 (see sections 1 and 2 in Supplementary Information), and (5) implemented an analysis optimization phase (one-third of the sample) followed by a final testing phase (two-thirds of the sample) on independent data for result validation33. Consequently, this large-scale international effort aimed at implementing a rigorous adversarial collaboration framework, thereby establishing a precedent for an alternative scientific approach.

According to IIT, PFC is not necessary for consciousness. Consequently, decoding conscious content should be most effective from the posterior cortex, and adding PFC activity as additional information should not improve decoding accuracy. This prediction was considered non-critical for testing IIT, as the theory focuses on the intrinsic, causal perspective of information within a neural substrate rather than the amount of information decodable from the perspective of an extrinsic observer5. By contrast, GNWT posits that conscious content can be decoded from PFC activity. Both theories predict that conscious content should be evident in theory-relevant areas independently of other cognitive processes (for example, report and task); thus, conscious content should be present irrespective of task manipulations34,35. This prediction was tested by evaluating the decoding accuracy of stimulus category (faces–objects (pictorial) and letters–false fonts (symbolic)) and orientation (left, right and front facing) in all theory-relevant areas. All stimulus categories alternated between being task-relevant and task-irrelevant across blocks (Fig. 1d). Stimulus orientation, being orthogonal to the task, remained task-irrelevant in all blocks.

On the basis of our preregistered predictions and pre-approved interpretations27 (Extended Data Table 1), the theories would pass the test if decoding is possible for both category (in at least one category pairing) and orientation (in at least one category), but would fail otherwise. Testing both category and orientation decoding constitutes a stringent test, as it requires two conditions to be satisfied, increasing the likelihood of failures36, while capturing the critical multidimensionality of conscious content, that is, phenomenological richness (Fig. 1b).

For decoding of category, we tested whether information is present in the relevant regions irrespective of the task, using a cross-task generalization approach (see Methods).

Here we report the most robust results for decoding of category (faces–objects) and orientation (left, right and front views of faces). Qualitatively similar results were observed for decoding of letters–false fonts (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). Results for orientation decoding were consistent across stimulus categories and data modalities in posterior cortex, but mostly absent in PFC (see section 5.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

In the iEEG data, pattern classifiers were trained on high gamma frequency band (70–150 Hz), which correlates with spiking activity37,38, at each time point in the task-irrelevant condition, and tested in the task-relevant condition, for each stimulus duration and category, and across all electrodes within the theory-relevant region of interests (ROIs; see Fig. 2a for a visualization of ROIs and Methods for anatomical ROI definitions). In the posterior ROIs, face–object decoding showed significant cross-task generalization (more than 95% accuracy) for the approximate duration of the stimulus (Fig. 2b, top row). In the PFC ROIs, significant cross-task face–object decoding accuracy (approximately 70%) was also evident, but the temporal generalization of this decoding was restricted to approximately 0.2–0.4 s (Fig. 2b, bottom row). Training on task-relevant and testing on task-irrelevant trials showed similar results (Extended Data Fig. 1e; within-task decoding is presented in Extended Data Fig. 2).

Although electrode coverage across our sample of iEEG patients (n = 29 for decoding analyses) was exceptional in the relevant brain regions (Fig. 2a; PFC ROIs nelectrodes = 576, posterior ROIs nelectrodes = 583), we further analysed a larger population of healthy participants (n = 65) using MEG, focusing on theory-relevant ROIs (see Methods). Here too, cross-task generalization of face–object decoding was significant in both posterior and prefrontal ROIs (Fig. 2c) within the theory-predicted time windows. Cross-temporal generalization of decoding in MEG was sustained in posterior ROIs and brief in PFC ROIs for all three stimulus durations (see section 5.1.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

We leveraged the higher spatial resolution of fMRI (n = 73) to complement the analysis. A searchlight approach (see Methods) revealed distributed, robust cross-task generalization (approximately 75%) in the striate and extrastriate, ventral temporal and intraparietal cortex (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Table 2). Generalization in PFC had lower accuracy (approximately 60%) and was spatially restricted to middle and inferior frontal cortex regions (Fig. 2d). Theory-relevant ROIs defined in the Destrieux atlas yielded comparable results (see section 5.1.1.3 in Supplementary Information). These results closely matched those from iEEG-restricted to theory-specified ROIs and time windows (Fig. 2e). Hence, across modalities, face–object decoding occurred in both posterior and prefrontal ROIs, consistent with IIT and GNWT predictions.

Given the rich and multidimensional nature of conscious content, we assessed the decoding of stimulus orientation, which was always task-irrelevant. We obtained divergent results for IIT and GNWT: decoding of face orientation (left, right or front views) was achieved in posterior but not in prefrontal ROIs, both with iEEG (Fig. 2f,h, approximately 95% with pseudotrial aggregation; Extended Data Fig. 3a) and the fMRI searchlight approach (Fig. 2g, approximately 45%). Decoding of face orientation was robust from MEG cortical time series in posterior ROIs (approximately 75% with pseudotrial aggregation), but was weaker, yet above chance (35%), in prefrontal ROIs (Fig. 2i), with a possibility of signal leakage from posterior regions (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Bayesian testing further validated these findings. For iEEG, Bayes factor (BF)01 values (5.11–8.65) supported the null hypothesis of no face orientation decoding in prefrontal regions. fMRI Bayesian analysis revealed substantial-to-very-strong support for the null hypothesis in 34–55% of prefrontal voxels (BF01: 3–71.5), with support for the alternative hypothesis in only 1–9% of voxels, whereas the rest remained inconclusive. Across all modalities, orientation decoding was observed for letters and false fonts—but not objects—in posterior, but not prefrontal, ROIs (see section 5.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

Finally, we tested IIT's prediction that prefrontal regions do not contribute further information beyond that specified by posterior areas (or may even degrade performance by introducing noise)39. If PFC activity increased decoding accuracy, IIT would be challenged, whereas no improvement in decoding accuracy would align with both IIT and GNWT, as GNWT posits that PFC workspace neurons broadcast but do not add information. We compared the performance of decoders trained exclusively on posterior ROIs with those trained on posterior and prefrontal ROIs together (Extended Data Fig. 3c; see Methods). Across critical time-resolved methods (iEEG and MEG) and various PFC ROI definitions, adding prefrontal ROIs did not improve—and in some cases reduced—category and orientation decoding (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e and see section 5.1.3 in Supplementary Information for non-critical fMRI results). Bayesian testing confirmed these findings: we found strong evidence against increased decoding accuracy when including PFC ROIs for category decoding (face–object: iEEG BF01 = 1.94 × 104 and MEG BF01 = 3.05; letter–false font: iEEG BF01 = 1.91 × 105 and MEG BF01 = 4.70) and face orientation (iEEG BF01 = 1,205 and MEG BF01 = 3.26).

According to IIT, the network that specifies the content of consciousness in posterior cortex is actively maintained over the duration of the conscious experience (manipulated here via different stimulus durations). By contrast, GNWT predicts brief, content-specific ignition in PFC within 0.3–0.5 s after stimulus onset, as the workspace is updated12. Activity then decays back to baseline, with information maintained in a latent state, until another ignition marks the offset of the current percept and the onset of a new percept (for example, the fixation screen following stimulus offset). Thus, although the underlying brain responses (the workspace update) are temporally discrete (that is, an onset and an offset response), the conscious experience can be temporally continuous, spanning from one update to the next.

Following the preregistration27 (Extended Data Table 1), IIT would be challenged if sustained content-specific information and activation tracking stimulus duration were absent in the posterior cortex. GNWT would be challenged if transient prefrontal activation (at stimulus onset and offset) was not observed. These patterns were expected for at least one conscious feature (category, identity or orientation). We assessed activation strength as a function of stimulus duration and the informational content of this activation within theory-relevant ROIs. For IIT, both activation and information content were critical predictions, jointly determining result interpretation. For GNWT, activation was the primary measure owing to the difficulty of reliably detecting content-specific reinstatement at stimulus offset. The temporal predictions were tested in time-resolved iEEG and MEG data. We focused on the task-irrelevant condition as it best isolates neural activity related to consciousness while minimizing confounds (see sections 6.1 and 6.2.9 in Supplementary Information for task-relevant results).

First, we tested the predictions of the theories by investigating iEEG neural activation as a function of stimulus duration using linear mixed models (LMMs; see Methods) to model the time course of neural activity in the high gamma. Among the 31 patients included, 29.5% (194 of 657) of posterior ROI electrodes and 18.7% (123 of 655) of PFC ROI electrodes exhibited high gamma responses to stimuli (see section 6.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

In posterior cortex ROIs, 25 electrodes (out of 657) measured sustained activity tracking stimulus duration (Extended Data Table 3 for electrode localization and section 6.1.1 in Supplementary Information for results of the full model), consistent with IIT's (Fig. 3a). Of these, 12 electrodes tracked duration independent of stimulus category, primarily in early visual areas (for example, occipital pole; Fig. 3b), whereas 13 showed category-specific duration tracking (mostly for faces) in the ventral temporal cortex (for example, lateral fusiform gyrus; Fig. 3b). Overall, only a small proportion of electrodes exhibited both category selectivity and duration tracking—for example, just 15% (8 of 53) of face-selective electrodes showed sustained activity as predicted by IIT, suggesting a sparse neural substrate. These responses were mostly localized to the lateral fusiform gyrus, whereas the majority of face-selective electrodes displayed transient activations at stimulus onset across the striate, extrastriate and ventral areas (see section 6.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

Electrodes are colour coded by response type based on model comparison (see Methods): sustained non-category-selective activation (light blue; n = 12), sustained category-selective activation (dark blue; n = 5), sustained face-selective activation (purple; n = 8), biphasic onset–offset activation in posterior areas (green; n = 11) and in PFC (black; n = 1), and onset-responsive activation in PFC (grey; n = 99).

The barplots (right) depict the average HG signal across sustained face-selective electrodes (n = 8) in 1.5-s trials, separated by category (faces in dark blue, objects in orange, letters in turquoise and false fonts in dark red) and theory-defined time windows (x axis).

Contours denote significance (cluster-based permutation tests, P < 0.05, upper tail).

In PFC ROIs, 99 and 24 electrodes showed non-selective and category-selective onset responses, respectively (Fig. 3c). However, none of the 655 electrodes measured the temporal profile predicted by GNWT (that is, onset and offset). Bayesian analysis confirmed this result (BF01 > 3 for all electrodes in PFC ROIs), providing stronger evidence for either an intercept-only or a time-varying amplitude model over the GNWT model, with or without category interaction. This null result was not due to analysis limitations, as the LMM successfully detected the GNWT-predicted pattern in 10 electrodes in other ROIs (in the striate or extrastriate cortex; Fig. 3b). An exploratory decoding analysis of stimulus duration with unrestricted temporal profiles identified only one electrode, in the inferior frontal sulcus, showing the GNWT-predicted pattern, although with transient responses occurring earlier than expected (0.15 s post-onset and post-offset; Fig. 3c). Additional control analyses confirmed the IIT-predicted pattern in posterior ROIs and the absence of the GNWT-predicted pattern in PFC ROIs (see sections 6.2.1–6.2.3 in Supplementary Information).

We used LMMs to track gamma frequency band (60–90 Hz) power changes from the MEG source time series across posterior (15 parcels) and PFC (11 parcels) ROIs. Although signals were strong in posterior areas, none of the theory-based models adequately fit the data (BF01 > 3 for all parcels; see section 6.1.3.1 in Supplementary Information). We also examined alpha band activity (8–13 Hz), which negatively correlates with neural spiking activity40,41. Validation of theoretical predictions from iEEG and MEG data was inconclusive: no prefrontal iEEG electrodes showed the GNWT-predicted combination of an onset and offset response (BF01 > 3 for all prefrontal electrodes); instead, this pattern appeared in posterior sites and in MEG data, including the anterior cingulate cortex. However, the MEG results were sensitive to parameter choices, and signal leakage from posterior sites could not be ruled out (see sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.2 in Supplementary Information).

Next, we used cross-temporal representational similarity analysis (RSA) on both iEEG and MEG source data, within each theory-relevant ROI, to test the predictions of IIT and GNWT about the temporal profile of the maintenance of conscious content (Fig. 1a, middle panel): sustained versus phasic (onset and offset) representation for IIT and GNWT, respectively. This test was critical for IIT only. Results for faces and objects are presented below (see Extended Data Fig. 4 for similar results for letters–false fonts).

In iEEG, we calculated the correlation distance between high gamma activity patterns across 583 electrodes in posterior (npatients = 28) and 576 electrodes in PFC (npatients = 28) ROIs separately (see Methods). We analysed the 1.5-s duration trials because this condition provided the strongest contrast between the temporal profiles predicted by the theories.

In posterior cortex ROIs, cross-temporal RSA revealed sustained face–object categorical representation, with larger correlation distances between categories (face–objects) than within category (face, object; compare Fig. 3d, left, with Fig. 1a). The RSA matrix matched the IIT model better than the GNWT model (see section 6.3 in Supplementary Information for results of all contrasts).

In PFC ROIs, cross-temporal RSA revealed transient face–object categorical representation at stimulus onset, but not at stimulus offset. Consequently, no significant correlation was found with the GNWT onset and offset model (compare Fig. 3d, right, with the predicted pattern in Fig. 1a). This pattern held even for the task-relevant condition, in which face–object information was stronger, more stable and longer lasting. Additional evidence for the absence of GNWT-predicted patterns in PFC ROIs emerged from three control analyses using (1) feature selection, which improved RSA in PFC; (2) modified time-windows to account for a potential earlier ignition at stimulus offset; and (3) a decoding analysis time-locked to stimulus offset to enhance sensitivity (see section 6.4 in Supplementary Information). These results align with two independent studies using comparable methods42,43.

It has been argued that because conscious experiences are specific, the representation of identity and orientation are more stringent tests of the neural substrate of conscious experience44 than of category. We thus also evaluated the predictions of the theories on these dimensions.

In posterior ROIs, iEEG revealed sustained object identity information, with smaller distances for same-identity objects than for different identities (Fig. 3d). The IIT model significantly correlated with the observed RSA matrix, providing a better fit than the GNWT model. Similar results were found for letter and false-font identity, but not for faces (Extended Data Fig. 4). In PFC ROIs, identity information was absent for all categories across analysed time windows (Fig. 3d, objects). Face orientation information appeared weakly in posterior ROIs at stimulus onset but was not sustained, decaying after 0.5 s, contrary to the predictions of IIT. No face orientation information was detected in PFC ROIs (Fig. 3d). Finally, the predictions of neither theory were supported for category, identity or orientation by the MEG data (see section 6.5 for Supplementary Information).

IIT predicts sustained gamma-band connectivity within the posterior cortex, that is, between high-level and low-level sensory areas (V1/V2), throughout any conscious visual experience. By contrast, GNWT predicts brief, late-phase metastable connectivity (more than 0.25 s) with information sharing between the PFC and category-specific areas, manifested in long-range gamma-band or beta-band synchronization45.

On the basis of our preregistration (see Extended Data Table 1), IIT would be challenged in the absence of sustained content-specific synchronization between face–object selective areas and V1/V2; whereas a challenge for GNWT would be a lack of phasic connectivity (0.3–0.5 s) between category-selective areas and PFC. Given the dynamical nature of these predictions, iEEG and MEG provided the most informative empirical test. These predictions were tested by computing pairwise phase consistency (PPC)46 between each category-selective time series (face-selective and object-selective nodes) and either the V1/V2 or the PFC time series in the intermediate (1.0 s) and long-stimulus-duration (1.5 s), task-irrelevant trials (see section 7.1.2 in Supplementary Information for task-relevant trials). Gamma activity was analysed because of its close link to neuronal spiking47, which IIT considers a constituent property of the physical substrate of consciousness5.

For iEEG, we analysed connectivity between electrodes showing face and object selectivity, using a different subset of electrodes to test connectivity with V1/V2 and PFC (see Methods; Extended Data Fig. 5a for ROIs and examples of face-selective and object-selective electrodes). Given the sparse electrode coverage, the requirement to focus on ‘activated' electrodes (see Methods) was relaxed, although restricting it to only activated electrodes yielded similar results. We found increased category-selective synchrony between category-selective and V1/V2 electrodes (Extended Data Fig. 5b). These effects were early and brief (for example, less than 0.75 s), and restricted to low frequencies (2–25 Hz). This synchrony was mostly explained by the stimulus-evoked response (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These results fail to align with IIT's predictions: the activity was neither sustained nor observed in the gamma frequency band. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis (BF01 = 1.15–4.9). No content-selective PPC was found between face-selective and object-selective electrodes and PFC electrodes in the relevant time window, contradicting the prediction of GNWT (Extended Data Fig. 6a; BF01 = 2.62–5.32).

For MEG, we found selective synchronization between face-selective areas and both V1/V2 and PFC. These effects were again early, restricted to low frequencies (2–25 Hz), and mostly explained by stimulus-evoked responses (Extended Data Figs. 5d and 6b). Bayesian analysis of the gamma-band synchronization further supported the null hypothesis (all BF01 > 3).

The results of the preregistered PPC metric for prediction 3, critical for both IIT and the GNWT, supported neither theory. PPC was chosen based on the mechanistic considerations of the theories because it assesses oscillatory phase. However, phase estimation from macroscopic recordings is susceptible to noise.

We thus used dynamic functional connectivity (DFC; see Methods), a metric sensitive to co-modulations of signal amplitude, after removing stimulus-evoked responses (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d includes the evoked response).

In iEEG, we observed significant connectivity between object-selective electrodes and V1/V2 (Fig. 4a), spanning multiple frequency bands, with the gamma band being the most predominant. In contrast to the predictions of IIT, the observed connectivity was brief. Connectivity between face-selective electrodes and V1/V2 was scarce, further supported by Bayesian analysis (BF01 = 1.3 in favour of the null hypothesis). Significant connectivity was observed between PFC and both the face-selective and the object-selective areas in the gamma frequency band within the GNWT-predicted time window. For MEG, brief DFC in the alpha–beta frequency bands was found between face-selective nodes and both PFC and V1/V2 (Fig. 4b).

a, iEEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials revealed significant content-selective synchrony only for object-selective electrodes in V1/V2 (for example, top row; face-selective: npatients = 4 and nelectrodes = 30; object-selective: npatients= 4 and nelectrodes= 21), while showing significant content-selective synchrony for both categories in the PFC ROI (bottom row; face selective: npatients = 19 and nelectrodes = 81; object selective: npatients = 14 and nelectrodes = 57). Here and in panel b, significance was assessed using a cluster-based permutation analysis (P < 0.05, two-sided) and the colour bars represent the average change in the DFC between conditions. b, MEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials (n = 65) revealed significant content-selective synchrony below 25 Hz for the face-selective GED filter in both V1/V2 (top left) and PFC (bottom left), but not for the object-selective GED filter (right panels). c, fMRI generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI; n = 70) on task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials combined revealed significant content-selective connectivity when FFA is used as the analysis seed. Various significant regions showing task-related connectivity with the FFA seed were observed including V1/V2, right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. d, Analysis of iEEG face-selective DFC synchrony across tasks is shown at the single-electrode level in PFC (top) and V1/V2 (bottom) ROIs. Electrodes showing significant synchrony (tested using a permutation test, FDR-corrected, P < 0.05) in relevant (orange-red), irrelevant (purple) or combined relevant and irrelevant (black) trials are shown (averaged over 70–120 Hz and 0–0.5-s time window). DFC synchrony was observed in both tasks, but restricted to IFG for the GNWT analysis and V2 regions for the IIT analysis, consistent with the fMRI gPPI analysis shown in panel c. Brain surfaces in panels c,d are from Freesurfer.

The exploratory DFC results in iEEG were consistent with the predictions of GNWT while challenging the predictions of IIT, as connectivity with V1/V2 was not sustained. However, V1/V2 were sparsely sampled in our population, with only 12 electrodes localized to V1/V2 compared with 472 in PFC.

Using fMRI, we evaluated connectivity across the entire cortex with homogeneous sampling. We computed the generalized psychophysiological interaction, defining the fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital complex as seed regions (see Methods). Task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were pooled to increase statistical power (see sections 7.1.1 and 12 in Supplementary Information for separate preregistered analyses). FFA showed content selective (face > object stimuli) connectivity with V1/V2, inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus, consistent with predictions from both theories (Fig. 4c). No selective increase in interareal connectivity between object-selective nodes and PFC or V1/V2 was found in fMRI, even when separating task conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Bayesian testing across prefrontal ROIs confirmed our findings with 62–94% of voxels across ROIs showing substantial evidence for the null hypothesis of no interareal connectivity (BF01 = 3–7.75). Support for the alternative hypothesis was observed only in 0–4% of voxels. The remaining voxels showed inconclusive evidence.

To determine whether connectivity to PFC and V1/V2 was task driven in the generalized psychophysiological interaction, we explored the iEEG data, separating task-relevant and irrelevant trials. We found task-independent, selective DFC connectivity (face > objects) for face-selective electrodes in both inferior frontal gyrus and V1/V2 (Fig. 4d).

This adversarial collaboration aimed to address confirmation biases by researchers, breaking theoretical echo chambers3 and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of theories2,48 by forcing them to be explicit and committal about their empirical predictions, rigorously testing them on common methodological grounds22,49, and providing the means for theorists to change their minds given conflicting results49. Doing so catalyses our ability to evaluate and arbitrate between theories of consciousness. Embracing this spirit, and adhering to guidelines for structuring adversarial collaborations21, we opted for a three-voice discussion format, acknowledging that despite stringent testing of incompatible theoretical views, different interpretations of the same evidence may persist. Below, the theory-neutral consortium presents the main challenges our findings pose to the theories, based on the preregistered predictions, methods and analysis agreed on in advance with the adversaries. Then, adversaries offer their own interpretation of the findings and future directions (see sections 12 and 13 in Supplementary Information).

Extended Data Fig. 7 summarizes the key results, including the criteria used to assess whether findings support or contradict the theories. This summary covers both central and peripheral findings related to theory evaluation. The consortium adopted Lakatos' sophisticated falsificationist approach to philosophy of science13,50, emphasizing that challenged predictions provide more valuable insights than those confirmed by the data (see section 11 in Supplementary Information). Outcomes are weighted differentially across predictions and with respect to the different brain imaging modalities (Extended Data Table 1). This approach ensures a nuanced evaluation of the theories, highlighting areas of strength and those requiring further refinement.

For IIT, the lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex represents the most direct challenge, based on our preregistration. This is incompatible with IIT's claim that the state of the neural network, including its activity and connectivity, specifies the degree and content of consciousness5. Although this null result could stem from methodological limitations (for example, limited iEEG sampling of V1/V2 areas), our multimodal and highly powered study provided the best conditions so far for evaluating the prediction. We urge IIT proponents to direct future efforts to evaluate this prediction and determine the implications of this failure.

More broadly, although IIT passed the predefined criteria for the duration prediction (number 2), there was no evidence for a sustained representation of orientation, despite being a property of the consciously perceived stimuli25. This is an informative challenge for IIT, as orientation decoding was robust across all three data modalities, leaving open the question of whether and how information about orientation is maintained over time.

For GNWT, the most substantial challenge based on our preregistered criteria pertains to its account for the maintenance of a conscious percept over time and, in particular, the lack of ignition at stimulus offset. This result is unlikely to stem from sensitivity limitations, as offset responses were robustly found elsewhere (for example, visual areas); and in PFC, strong onset responses were found to the very same stimuli. The lack of ignition at stimulus offset is especially surprising given the change in conscious experience at the onset of the blank fixation screen. This clear update to the content of consciousness should have been represented somehow by the global workspace12. Thus, that aspect of consciousness remains unexplained within the GNWT framework.

Another key challenge for GNWT pertains to representing the contents of experience: although we found representation of category in PFC irrespective of the task, thereby demonstrating the sensitivity of our methods, no representation of identity was found, and representation of orientation was evident only in MEG (signal leakage notwithstanding); although these dimensions were clearly a part of the conscious experience of participants of the stimuli. This raises the question of whether PFC is involved in broadcasting all conscious content, as predicted by GNWT23, or only a subset (for example, abstract concepts and categories, rather than low-level details), in which case the role of PFC in consciousness might need to be redefined.

Before this study, predictions from IIT and GNWT were typically tested with one data modality at a time23,24, leaving room for negative results to be easily attributed to the limitations of the chosen modality51. We combined multiple techniques (iEEG, MEG and fMRI) to mitigate these limitations, cross-compensating for their weaknesses. This methodological approach was mutually agreed upon by the theory leaders before data collection and results disclosure as the most powerful and conclusive approach, making both positive and negative findings more meaningful.

Although this study was designed around IIT and GNWT, the results may have implications for other theories of consciousness. For example, the prediction of GNWT about PFC is shared by those higher-order theories of consciousness that hypothesize that PFC actually supplies the content of visual consciousness (for example, ref. 17), rather than those that take it to merely enable the consciousness of content that is located in posterior visual areas (for example, refs. 52,53). As a result, the failures to confirm this prediction challenge not only GNWT but also those higher-order theories54. Predictions 2 and 3, about timing and connectivity, are more distinctive to GNWT but could also be shared by other theories. Likewise, the non-core prediction 1 about the posterior cortex by IIT is also shared by many theories (for example, recurrent processing theory14), and its prediction 2 about timing may be shared by some posterior theories of consciousness, such as the local recurrency theory15. Its prediction 3 about interareal connectivity is more distinctive to IIT (for example, it is not shared by synchrony theory55), so the challenge here is more specific as well.

Our study focused on the contents of consciousness (for example, category, identity, orientation and duration), linking brain activity to subjective phenomenology. This departs from the traditional contrastive method, which compares the presence and absence of consciousness but conflates it with other cognitive processes (for example, decision-making or memory formation)56,57,58. Some might argue that our approach tracks stimulus processing rather than consciousness. Yet, our aim is to challenge and potentially falsify50,59 IIT and GNWT, by examining where their predictions differ, rather than to discover the neural correlates of consciousness. In this context, what might seem like a weakness—focusing on the presence of fully attended, consciously experienced stimuli—is actually beneficial for testing the primary positive predictions of the theories and their failures. This is because such failures are harder to dismiss owing to weak signals. Thus, our approach assesses whether the proposed neural mechanisms are truly necessary for consciousness.

Our study, although comprehensive, is not without limitations. First, we cannot entirely rule out residual task engagement with respect to category, although our design ensured that orientation and duration remained task-irrelevant, so the results on these dimensions cannot be explained by task-related effects. Second, although we aimed to capture multiple aspects of consciousness, our approach still falls short of encompassing its full phenomenal richness. Third, despite the high spatial and temporal resolution of our data, it lacks single-unit recordings, which are typically restricted to patients with epilepsy and selected brain regions. Ongoing studies in animal models, as part of a separate adversarial collaboration, can accordingly complement our findings.

Beyond directly challenging the theories, our study raises broader questions about theory testing and development across disciplines. A key challenge is how to weigh predictions and integrate evidence across different analyses and measurement techniques (for example, fMRI, MEG and iEEG). We adopted a lenient falsificationist approach, in which evidence for any tested feature (for example, decoding of category or orientation) was sufficient to rule out failure, rather than requiring consistency across all features. However, a formal framework is urgently needed to quantitatively integrate evidence, accounting for prediction centrality, measurement error and cross-sample consistency. Such a framework would enhance systematic theory building in an era of accumulating results60.

After reviewing the results and the discussions by adversaries, readers might expect a definitive verdict on the two theories under evaluation. Instead, we invite readers to weigh the evidence themselves—considering the support for each preregistered prediction, the breadth of the data, the sophistication of the methods and analyses, and the cognitive biases that shape interpretation. Scientific progress is rarely a matter of simple verdicts; evidence is filtered through previous beliefs and motivations61, making theory evaluation a dynamic process. By presenting results and adversarial responses transparently, we embrace the openness needed for science to converge on robust explanations of complex phenomena such as consciousness.

The experiment was approved by the institutional ethics committees of each participating data-collecting laboratory, including the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Ethical Review Committee at the Centre for Human Brain Research, University of Birmingham (ERN_18-0226AP20); the Committee for Protecting Human and Animal Subjects at the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University (2020-05-07e); the Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Donders Institute (NL45659.091.14); the Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Board at Yale School of Medicine (2000027591); the Office of Science and Research Institutional Review Board at New York University Langone Health (i14-02101_CR6); the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board at Children's Hospital Corporation d/b/a Boston Children's Hospital (04-05-065R); the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (ID: 2017-1299); and the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics (Nr. 2017_12). All participants and patients provided oral and written informed consent before participating in the study. All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were also informed that clinical care was not affected by participation in the study.

Healthy participants and patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy participated in this study. The datasets reported here consist of: (1) behaviour, eye tracking and iEEG data collected at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at New York University (NYU) Langone Health, the Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Boston Children's Hospital (Harvard), and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (WU). (2) Behaviour, eye tracking, MEG and EEG data collected at the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) of the University of Birmingham (UB), and at the Center for MRI Research of Peking University (PKU). (3) Behaviour, eye tracking and fMRI data collected at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) and at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (DCCN), of Radboud University Nijmegen. For both the MEG and fMRI datasets, one-third of the data that passed quality tests (henceforth, the optimization dataset; see the section ‘Preregistration' for details about quality test criteria27) were used to optimize the analysis methods, which were subsequently added to the preregistration as an additional amendment. These preregistered analyses were then run on the remaining two-thirds of the data (henceforth, the replication dataset) and constitute the data reported in the main study. This procedure was not used for the iEEG data due to the serendipitous nature of the recording and electrode placement, the rarity of this type of data and the increased difficulty of data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 97 healthy participants were included in the MEG sample (mean age of 22.79 ± 3.59 years, 54 females, all right handed), 32 of those datasets were included in the optimization phase (mean age of 22.50 ± 3.43 years, 19 females, all right handed), and 65 in the replication sample (mean age of 22.93 ± 3.66, 35 females, all right handed). Five additional participants were excluded from the MEG dataset: two because of failure to meet predefined behavioural criteria (that is, Hits of less than 80% and/or False Alarms > 20%), two because of excessive noise from sensors, and one because of incorrect sensor reconstruction. A total of 108 healthy participants were included in the fMRI sample (mean age of 23.28 ± 3.46 years, 70 females, 105 right handed); 35 of those datasets were included in the optimization sample (mean age of 23.26  ±  3.64 years, 21 females, 34 right handed) and 73 in the replication sample (mean age of 23.29 ± 3.37, 49 females, 71 right handed). Twelve additional participants were excluded from the fMRI dataset: eight because of motion artefacts, two because of insufficient coverage and two because of incomplete data (with respect to these last two participants, see section 14 of the Supplementary Information for deviations from the preregistration document). For the iEEG arm of the project, a total of 34 patients were recruited. Two patients were excluded owing to incomplete data. Demographic, medical and neuropsychological scores for each patient, when available, are reported in Supplementary Table 25. Three iEEG patients whose behaviour fell slightly short of the predefined behavioural criteria (that is Hits of less than 70%, FA > 30%) were nonetheless included given the difficulty of obtaining additional iEEG data (see section 14 in Supplementary Information for deviation from the preregistration).

To test critical predictions of the theories, five experimental manipulations were included in the experimental design: (1) four stimulus categories (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), (2) 20 stimulus identities (20 different exemplars per stimulus category), (3) three stimulus orientations (front, left and right view), (4) three stimulus durations (0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s), and (5) task relevance (relevant targets, relevant non-targets and irrelevant).

Stimulus category, stimulus identity and stimulus orientation served to test predictions about the representation of the content of consciousness in different brain areas by the theories. In addition, stimulus duration served to test predictions about the temporal dynamics of sustained conscious percepts and interareal synchronization between areas. Task relevance served to rule out the effect of task demands, as opposed to conscious perception per se, on the observed effects62. This aspect of the experimental design was inspired by ref. 63.

Four stimulus categories were used: faces, objects, letters and false fonts. These stimuli naturally fell into two clearly distinct groups: pictures (faces and objects) and symbols (letters and false fonts). These natural couplings were aimed at creating a clear difference between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli in each trial block (see the section ‘Procedure'). All stimuli covered a squared aperture at an average visual angle of 6° by 6°. Face stimuli were created with FaceGen Modeler 3.1; letter and false font stimuli were generated with MAXON CINEMA 4D Studio (RC - R20) 20.059; object stimuli were taken from the Object Databank64. Stimuli were grey scaled and equated for luminance and size. To facilitate face individuation, faces had different hairstyles and belonged to different ethnicities and genders. Equal proportions of male and female faces were presented. The orientation of the stimuli was manipulated, such that half of the stimuli from each category had a side view (30° and −30° horizontal viewing angle, left and right orientation) and the other half had a front view (0°).

Participants performed a non-speeded target detection task (see Supplementary Video 1). The experiment was divided into runs, with four blocks in each run (see the section ‘Trial counts'). On a given block, participants viewed a sequence of single, supra-threshold, foveally presented stimuli belonging to one of four stimulus categories and presented for one of three stimulus durations onto a fixation cross that was present throughout the experiment. Within each block, half of the stimuli were task-relevant and half were task-irrelevant. To manipulate task relevance, at the beginning of each block participants were instructed to detect the rare occurrences of two target stimulus identities, one from each relevant category (for pictures, face–object; for symbols, letter–false font), irrespective of their orientation. This was specified by presenting the instruction ‘detect face A and object B' or ‘detect letter C and false font D', accompanied by images for each target (see Fig. 1d). Targets did not repeat across blocks. Each run contained two blocks of the face–object task and two blocks of the letter–false font task, with block order counterbalanced across runs.

Accordingly, each block contained three different trial types: (1) targets: the two stimuli being detected (for example, the specific face and object identities); (2) task-relevant stimuli: all other stimuli from the task-relevant categories (for example, the non-target faces–objects); and (3) task-irrelevant stimuli: all stimuli from the two other categories (for example, letters–false fonts). An advantage of this design is that the three trial types enabled a differentiation of neural responses related to task goal, task relevance and simply consciously seeing a stimulus. We confirmed that participants were conscious of the stimuli in both the task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials in a separate experiment, which included a surprise memory test (see section 3 in Supplementary Information).

Stimuli were presented for one of three durations (0.5 s, 1.0 s or 1.5 s), followed by a blank period of a variable duration to complete an overall trial length fixed at 2.0 s. For the MEG and iEEG version, random jitter was added at the end of each trial (mean inter-trial interval of 0.4 s, jittered 0.2–2.0 s, truncated exponential distribution) to avoid periodic presentation of the stimuli. The mean trial length was 2.4 s. For the fMRI protocol, timing was adjusted as follows: the random jitter between trials was increased (mean inter-trial interval of 3 s, jittered 2.5–10 s, with truncated exponential distribution), with each trial lasting approximately 5.5 s. This modification helped with avoiding non-linearities in BOLD signal, which may affect fMRI decoding65. Second, to increase detection efficacy for amplitude-based analyses, three additional baseline periods (blank screen) of 12 s each were included per run (total of 24). The identity of the stimuli was randomized with the constraint that they appeared equally across durations and tasks conditions. Participants were further instructed to maintain central fixation on a black circle with a white cross and another black circle in the middle throughout each trial (see Supplementary Fig. 1d and Supplementary Video 1 for a demonstration of the experimental paradigm).

The MEG study consisted of 10 runs containing 4 blocks each with 34–38 trials per block, 32 non-targets (8 per category) and 2–6 targets, for a total of 1,440 trials. The same design was used for iEEG, but with half the runs (5 runs total), resulting in a total of 720 trials. For fMRI, there were 8 runs containing 4 blocks each with 17–19 trials per block, 16 non-targets (4 per category) and 1–3 targets, for a total of 576 trials. Rest breaks between runs and blocks were included.

The task was run on Matlab (PKU: R2018b; DCCN, UB and Yale: R2019b; Harvard: R2020b; NYU: R2020a, and WU: 2021a) using Psychtoolbox (v3)66. The iEEG version of the task was run on a Dell Precision 5540 laptop, with a 15.6′′ Ultrasharp screen at NYU and Harvard and on a Dell D29M PC with an Acer 19.1′′ screen in WU. Participants responded using an eight-button response box (Millikey LH-8; response hand (or hands) varied based on the setting in the patient's room). The MEG version was run on a custom PC at UB and a Dell XPS desktop PC on PKU. Stimuli were displayed on a screen placed in front of the participants with a PROPixx DLP LED projector (VPixx Technologies). Participants responded with both hands using two 5-button response boxes (NAtA or SINORAD). The fMRI version was run on an MSI laptop at Yale and a Dell Desktop PC at DCCN. In DCCN, stimuli were presented on an MRI compatible Cambridge Research Systems BOLD screen 32′′ IPS LCD monitor, and in Yale they were presented on a Psychology Software Tools Hyperion projection system to project stimuli on the mirror fixed to the head coil. Participants responded with their right hand using a 2 × 2 current designs response box at Yale and a 1 × 4 current designs response box at DCCN.

For the iEEG setup, eye tracking and pupillometry data were collected using a EyeLink 1000 Plus in remote mode, sampled monocularly at 500 Hz (from the left eye at WU, and depending on the setup at Harvard), or on a Tobii-4C eye tracker, sampled binocularly at 90 Hz (NYU). The MEG and fMRI laboratories used the MEG-compatible and fMRI-compatible EyeLink 1000 Plus Eye-tracker system (SR Research) to collect data at 1,000 Hz. For MEG, eye tracking data were acquired binocularly. For fMRI, data were acquired monocularly from either the left or the right eye, in DCCN and Yale, respectively. For all recordings, a 9-point calibration was performed (besides Harvard, where a 13-point calibration was used) at the beginning of the experiment, and recalibration was carried out as needed at the beginning of each block or run.

Brain activity was recorded with a combination of intracranial subdural platinum-iridium electrodes embedded in SILASTIC sheets (2.3-mm diameter contacts, Ad-Tech Medical Instrument and PMT Corporation) and/or depth stereo-electroencephalographic platinum-iridium electrodes (PMT Corporation; 0.8 mm in diameter, 2.0-mm length cylinders; separated from adjacent contacts by 1.5–2.43 mm), or depth stereo-electroencephalographic platinum-iridium electrodes (BF08R-SP21X-0C2, Ad-Tech Medical; 1.28 mm in diameter, 1.57 mm in length, 3–5.5-mm spacing). Electrodes were arranged as grid arrays (either 8 × 8 with 10-mm centre-to-centre spacing, 8 × 16 contacts with 3-mm spacing, or hybrid macro–micro 8 × 8 contacts with 10-mm spacing and 64 integrated microcontacts with 5-mm spacing), linear strips (1 × 8/12 contacts), depth electrodes (1 × 8/12 contacts) or a combination thereof. Recordings from grid, strip and depth electrode arrays were done using a Natus Quantum amplifier or a Neuralynx Atlas amplifier. A total of 4,057 electrodes (892 grids, 346 strips and 2,819 depths) were implanted across 32 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing clinically motivated invasive monitoring. A total of 3,512 electrodes (780 grids, 307 strips and 2,425 depths) that were unaffected by epileptic activity, artefacts or electrical noise were used in subsequent analyses. To determine the electrode localization for each patient, a post-operative computed tomography scan and a pre-operative T1 MRI were acquired and co-registered.

MEG was acquired using a 306-sensor TRIUX MEGIN system, comprising 204 planar gradiometres and 102 magnetometres in a helmet-shaped array. The MEG gantry was positioned at 68° for optimal coverage of frontal and posterior brain areas. Simultaneous EEG was recorded using an integrated EEG system and a 64-channel electrode cap (EEG data are not reported here, but are included in the shared dataset). During acquisition, MEG and EEG data were bandpass filtered (0.01 and 330 Hz) and sampled at 1,000 Hz. The location of the head fiducials, the shape of the head, the positions of the 64 EEG electrodes and the head position indicator (HPI) coil locations relative to anatomical landmarks were collected with a 3D digitizer system (Polhemus Isotrack). ECG was recorded with a set of bipolar electrodes placed on the chest of the participant. Two sets of bipolar electrodes were placed around the eyes (two at the outer canthi of the right and left eyes and two above and below the centre of the right eye) to record eye movements and blinks (EOG). Ground and reference electrodes were placed on the back of the neck and on the right cheek, respectively. The head position of participants on the MEG system was measured at the beginning and end of each run, and also before and after each resting period, using four HPI coils placed on the EEG cap, next to the left and right mastoids and over left and right frontal areas.

For source localization of the MEG data with individual realistic head modelling, a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI volume (3 T Siemens MRI Prisma scanner) was acquired per participant. Anatomical scans were acquired either with a 32-channel coil (repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2,000/2.03 ms; inversion time (TI) = 880 ms; 8° flip angle; field of view = 256 × 256 × 208 mm; 208 slices; 1-mm isotropic voxels, UB) or a 64-channel coil (TR/TE = 2,530/2.98 ms; TI = 1,100 ms; 7° flip angle; field of view = 224 × 256 × 192 mm, 192 slice, 0.5 × 0.5 × 1 mm voxels, PKU). The FreeSurfer standard template was used (fsaverage) for participants lacking an anatomical scan (n = 5).

MRI data were acquired using a 32-channel head coil on a 3 T Prisma scanner. A session included high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE images (GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2, TR/TE = 2,300/3.03 ms, 8° flip angle, 192 slices, 1-mm isotropic voxels), and a whole-brain T2*-weighted multiband-4 sequence (TR/TE = 1,500/39.6 ms, 75° flip angle, 68 slices, voxel size of 2 mm isotropic, anterior/posterior (A/P) phase-encoding direction, field of view = 210 mm, bandwith (BW) = 2,090 Hz px−1). A single-band reference image was acquired before each run. To correct for susceptibility distortions, additional scans using the same T2*-weighted sequence, but with inverted phase-encoding direction (inverted readout/phase-encoding (RO/PE) polarity), were collected while the participant was resting at multiple points throughout the experiment.

For readability, we first detail the preprocessing protocols for each of the modalities (iEEG, MEG and fMRI) separately. Then, we describe the different analyses, combining information across the modalities, while noting any differences between them.

As part of our testing framework, after excluding a limited number of participants due to data quality checks, we conducted an initial optimization phase on one-third of the MEG (n = 32) and fMRI (n = 35) datasets to evaluate data quality across sites and to optimize analysis pipelines. Following the optimization phase, pipelines were preregistered27 and applied to the novel datasets containing twice as much data (MEG n = 65 and fMRI n = 73).

In the main paper, we report results obtained on the novel, previously unexamined datasets. For iEEG, given the smaller sample, a different analysis strategy was implemented. We refer the reader to the iEEG methods section and text in the main paper for numbers of participants that were entered in each analysis. Results from the optimization phase are reported in section 4 of Supplementary Information. The results of the optimization phase and the preregistered replication phase were compared and deemed to be largely compatible, with some minor exceptions (section 4 of Supplementary Information).

Data were converted to BIDS67 and preprocessed using MNE-Python (v0.24)68, and custom-written functions in Python and Matlab. Preprocessing steps included downsampling to 512 Hz, detrending, bad channel rejection, line noise and harmonic removal, and re-referencing. Electrodes were re-referenced to a Laplacian scheme69, whereas bipolar referencing was used for electrodes at the edge of a strip, grid or stereo EEG, and the signal was localized at the midpoint (Euclidean distance) between the two electrodes. Electrodes with no direct neighbours were discarded. Seizure-onset zone electrodes, those localized outside the brain and/or containing no signal or high amplitude noise level were discarded. Line noise and harmonics were removed using a one-pass, zero-phase non-causal band-stop FIR filter.

The high-gamma power (70–150 Hz) was obtained by bandpass filtering the raw signal in eight successive 10-Hz-wide frequency bands, computing the envelope using a standard Hilbert transform, and normalizing it (dividing) by the mean power per frequency band across the entire recording. To produce a single high-gamma envelope time series, all frequency bands were averaged together70. Most analyses focused on the high-gamma power as it closely correlated with neural spiking activity71 and with the BOLD signal37. To obtain the event-related potentials (ERPs), the raw signal was low-pass-filtered at 30 Hz with a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal low-pass FIR filter. Epochs were segmented between 1-s pre-stimulus until 2.5-s post-stimulus of interest.

Electrode positions were determined based on a computed tomography scan coregistered with a pre-implant T1-weighted MRI. A 3D reconstruction of the brain of each patient was computed using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). For visualization, the electrode positions for individual participants were converted to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 space. As each theory specified a set of anatomical ROIs, after electrode localization, electrodes were labelled according to the Freesurfer-based Destrieux atlas segmentation72,73 and/or Wang atlas segmentation74.

To identify task-responsive electrodes, we computed the area under the curve (AUC) for the baseline (−0.3 to 0 s) and the stimulus-evoked period (0.05–0.35 s) separately for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions, and compared them per electrode using a Wilcoxon sign-rank test, corrected for false discovery rate (FDR)75. A Bayesian t-test76 was used to quantify evidence for non-responsiveness.

To determine category selectivity for faces, objects, letters and false fonts in the high gamma, we followed the method of Kadipasaoglu and colleagues77. Per category, we computed a d′ (AUC of 0.05–0.4 s) comparing the activation between the category of interest (uj) and each of the other categories (ui), normalized by the standard deviation of each category:

A permutation test (10,000 permutations) was used to evaluate significance. d′ was computed for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions separately. An electrode was considered selective if it showed selectivity on both tasks.

Owing to the sparse and highly variable coverage of iEEG data, all collected electrodes were combined into a ‘super participant' multivariate analyses (RSA and decoding). To create a single-trial matrix for the super participant, we equated the trial matrices of all our participants by subsampling to the lowest number of trials in the relevant conditions. Participants that did not complete the full experiment were discarded (n = 3), resulting in a total of 29 participants with 583 electrodes in posterior ROIs and 576 electrodes in prefrontal ROIs. For analyses on stimuli identities, stimuli that were presented less than three times to any of the participants across intermediate and long trials in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were discarded. We then subsampled the trials for each identity to three trials per participant. The subsampling procedure was repeated 100 times to avoid random fluctuations induced by the subsampling. The analysis was computed for each repetition and average across repetitions.

The MEG data were converted to BIDS78 using MNE-BIDS79, and preprocessed following the FLUX Pipeline80 in MNE-Python (v0.24.0)68. Preprocessing steps included MEG sensor reconstruction using a semi-automatic detection algorithm and signal-space separation81 to reduce environmental artefacts. FastICA82 was used to detect and remove cardiac and ocular components from the data for each participant (mean = 2.90 components, s.d. = 0.92). Before ICA, data were segmented, and segments containing muscle artefacts were removed. After preprocessing, data were epoched into 3.5-s segments (1-s pre-stimulus to 2.5-s post-stimulus onset). Trials in which gradiometre values exceeded 5,000 fT cm−1, magnetometres exceeded 5,000 fT and/or the trial contained muscle artefacts were rejected from the MEG dataset. Finally, to be included in the analyses, participants should have a minimum of 30 clean trials per condition. No participants were excluded because of not meeting this criterion.

MEG source modelling was performed using the dynamic statistical parametric mapping method83, based on depth-weighted minimum-norm estimates (MNEs)84,85, on epoched and baseline (−0.5 s to 0 s before stimulus onset) corrected data. To build a forward model, the MRI images were manually aligned to the digitized head shape. A single shell boundary elements model was constructed in MNE-Python based on the inner skull surface derived from FreeSurfer72,73, to create a volumetric forwards model (5-mm grid) covering the full-brain volume. The lead field matrix was then calculated according to the head position with respect to the MEG sensor array. A noise covariance matrix for the baseline and a covariance matrix for the active time window were calculated and the combined (that is, sum) covariance matrix was used with the forwards model to create a common spatial filter. Data were spatially pre-whitened using the covariance matrix from the baseline interval to combine gradiometre and magnetometre data86.

Source DICOM data were converted to BIDS using BIDScoin (v3.6.3)87. This includes converting DICOM data to NIfTI using dcm2niix88 and creating event files using custom Python codes. BIDS compliance of the resulting dataset was controlled using BIDS-Validator. Subsequently, MRI data quality control was performed using MRIQC (0.16.1)89 and custom scripts for data rejection. All (f)MRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep (20.2.3)90, based on Nipype (1.6.1)91. For further details on the fMRIprep pipeline, see preregistration. Custom scripts used NumPy (1.19.2)92 and Pandas (1.1.3)93.

Additional, analysis-specific, fMRI data preprocessing was performed using FSL 6.0.2 (FMRIB Software Library)94, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12) software95, and custom Python scripts (using NiBabel (3.2.2)96 and SciPy (1.8.0)97 after the above-outlined general preprocessing. Functional data for univariate data analyses were spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel with full-width at half-maximum of 5 mm), grand mean scaled and temporal high-pass filtered (128 s). No spatial smoothing was applied for multivariate analyses.

We modelled BOLD signal responses to the experimental variables by fitting voxel-wise general linear model (GLM) to the data of each run using FSL FEAT. The following regressors were modelled in an event-related approach, with event duration corresponding to the stimulus duration (that is, 0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s), and convolved with a double gamma haemodynamic response function: 12 regressors of interest (targets, task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli per stimulus category, that is, faces, objects, letters and false fonts; and a regressors of no interest, that is, target screen display). We included the first-order temporal derivatives of the regressors of interest, and a set of nuisance regressors: 24 motion regressors (FMRIB Software Library (FSL)'s standard + extended set of motion parameters) plus a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a white matter (WM) tissue regressor. Each of the 12 regressors of interest was contrasted against an implicit baseline (used in the putative Neural Correlates of Consciousness analysis; see below). In addition, we obtained contrast of parameter estimates for ‘relevant faces versus relevant objects', ‘relevant letters versus relevant false fonts', ‘irrelevant faces versus irrelevant objects', ‘irrelevant letters versus irrelevant false fonts' (used for the definition of decoding ROIs), ‘relevant and irrelevant faces versus relevant and irrelevant objects' and ‘all stimuli versus baseline' (used for the definition of seeds for the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis). Data were averaged across runs per participant using FSL's fixed-effects analysis and subsequently averaged across participants using FSL's FLAME1 mixed-effect analysis. Gaussian random-field cluster thresholding was used to correct for multiple comparisons, using the default settings of FSL, with a cluster formation threshold of one-sided P < 0.001 (z ≥ 3.1) and a cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05.

ROIs were defined a priori in consultation with the adversarial theories. They were determined per participant based on the Destrieux atlas73 including both hemispheres, and then resampled to standard MNI space (see Supplementary Table 26). For the connectivity analysis, areas V1/V2 (combining dorsal and ventral) were defined based on the Wang cortical parcellation74. For details on the process of selecting the ROIs and the justification of the ROI selection in the context of this study, see section 10 in Supplementary Information. All anatomical segmentations were performed using Freesurfer (6.0.1)72.

Log-linear-corrected d′ (ref. 98), false alarms and reaction times were computed per category and stimulus duration, separately (false alarms were also calculated per task relevance, without duration) and per modality (iEEG, MEG and fMRI). These measures were compared with linear–logistic mixed models, where appropriate. For the former, we report analysis of variance omnibus F-tests, and for the latter, omnibus χ2 test from an analysis of deviance. We approximated degrees of freedom using the Satterthwaite method99. Pairwise t-tests following significant interactions were Bonferroni corrected. To estimate Bayesian information criterion (BIC) differences between the original and null logistic models, we used the P values and sample size100 (p_to_bf package in R).

For Eyelink, gaze and pupil data were segmented, and trials with missing data were excluded. Blinks were detected using the Hershman algorithm101, and removed with 200-ms padding102. The Eyelink standard parser algorithm was used for saccade and fixation detection. Saccades were further corroborated using the Engbert and Kliegl103 algorithm. Fixations were baseline corrected (−0.25 s to 0 s). Mean fixation distance, mean blink rate, mean saccade amplitude and mean pupil size were compared in a LMM with category and task relevance as fixed effects, and participant and item as random effects. Separate analyses were carried out on the first 0.5 s after stimulus onset including all trials; and on the 1.5-s trials including time window (0–0.5 s, 0.5–1.0 s and 1.0–1.5 s) as fixed effects. BIC was used to test the models against the null hypothesis models. For Tobii, gaze coordinate data were segmented, missing data were excluded and coordinates were baseline corrected to depict heatmaps of patients' gaze. Of note, the coordinate data were not added to the LMMs due to its poorer quality with respect to the EyeLink data.

All decoding analyses were performed using a linear support vector machine (SVM; scikit learn (0.23.2), https://scikit-learn.org/) classifier. Below, we explain how this was done for each one of the predictions.

iEEG decoding was done on the high-gamma signal, averaged over non-overlapping windows of 0.02 s separately for electrodes located in the GNWT and IIT ROIs. The top 200 electrodes (selectKbest104), as determined by a F-test within a given set of electrodes from the theory ROIs, were used as features for the classifier. Two-hundred features were selected to provide a balance between model optimization (for example, feature selection) and participant representation (for example, electrodes or features coming from multiple participants). Statistical significance of decoding performance was assessed via permutation test, randomly permuting the sample labels and repeating the decoding analysis 1,000 times, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-based correction (cluster mass inference with cluster forming threshold at P < 0.05)105,106. Also, to assess the decoding accuracy within unique ROIs (for example, S_temporal_sup of the Destrieux atlas), separate classifiers were trained using all electrodes in a given parcel. Each classifier was fitted using all electrodes in a parcel and time window (GNWT: 0.3–0.5 s, IIT: 0.3–1.5 s) as features, resulting in a single accuracy value per parcel. SelectKbest (200 features for iEEG) feature selection and fivefold cross-validation with three repetitions was used. To assess the statistical significance of the decoding accuracy within unique ROIs (so only one accuracy score is obtained per ROI), P values obtained via permutation tests were corrected for multiple comparisons across all ROIs using FDR correction (q ≤ 0.0575). To compute Bayes factors on the decoding accuracy values, we used a β-binomial approach that compares the marginal likelihood under a point-null hypothesis against a flat \(B(\alpha =1,\,\beta =1)\) alternative prior, yielding an analytic Bayes factor. We then derived the null hypothesis parameters from the empirical null distribution by updating a tight prior centred at chance level (\(B(\alpha =1,000,\,\beta =1,000)\)) with the shuffle-based accuracies, thereby incorporating any bias present in the null distribution.

MEG decoding was done on bandpass-filtered (1–40 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz) data. The reconstructed source-level MEG data within a subset of the predefined anatomical ROIs (GNWT: ‘G_and_S_cingul-Ant', ‘G_and_S_cingul-Mid-Ant', ‘G_and_S_cingul-Mid-Post', ‘G_front_middle', ‘S_front_inf', ‘S_front_sup'; IIT: ‘G_cuneus', ‘G_oc-temp_lat-fusifor', ‘G_oc-temp_med-Lingual', ‘Pole_occipital', ‘S_calcarine', ‘S_oc_sup_and_transversal', as they showed high response to the stimulus on the optimization dataset) were extracted for further analysis (500 vertices and 800 vertices per hemisphere for each of the anatomical ROI defined by the theories). We applied temporal smoothing (0.05-s window, 0.01-s sliding window), computed pseudotrials107, normalized the data and selected the top 30 features within a given ROI as features for the different classifiers. A group-level one-sample t-test per time point was performed on the decoding accuracy results, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-based correction106.

The overall decoding strategy for fMRI was similar to that used on the iEEG and MEG data, yet with some differences. A multivariate pattern analysis approach was used on the pattern of BOLD activity over voxels. A non-spatially smoothed parameter estimate map was obtained by fitting a GLM per event with that event as the regressor of interest and all the other remaining events as one regressor of no interest108 as implemented in NiBetaSeries (0.6.0) package. The model also included the 24 nuisance regressors described in the ‘fMRI preprocessing' section.

Decoding was performed using whole-brain and ROI-based approaches. The whole-brain analysis was performed using a searchlight approach with 4-mm radius. For ROI-based decoding, decoding ROIs were defined based on functional fMRI contrasts (see the ‘fMRI preprocessing' section) and constrained with pre-defined anatomical ROIs (see Extended Data Table 2 on anatomical ROIs). A one-sample permutation test was used to determine whether decoding significantly exceeded chance level within each ROI. FDR was used to correct for multiple comparisons across ROIs. For whole-brain decoding, a cluster-based permutation test was used to evaluate the decoding statistical significance across participants (P < 0.05), complemented by Bayesian analysis. In addition, stimulus versus baseline searchlight decoding was performed using leave-one-run out cross-validation, and the resultant decoding accuracy maps were used as input for the multivariate putative NCC analysis (see below). To perform stimulus versus baseline decoding, we subsampled the stimuli trials to a 2:1 ratio with respect to baseline. The SVM cost function was weighted by the number of trials from each class. Plots were generated using Matplotlib (3.3.2)109.

To test GNWT and IIT decoding predictions, stimulus category (faces versus objects and letters versus false fonts) was decoded separately for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions (within-task category decoding), whereas orientation (front view versus left view versus right view) was decoded on the combined data from the two task conditions. In addition, cross-task category decoding from the task-relevant to task-irrelevant condition and vice versa was performed to test generalization by training classifiers on one condition and testing on the other condition. Both within-task category and orientation decoding were performed in a leave-one-run-out cross-validation scheme for fMRI and in an k-fold cross-validation scheme for MEG and iEEG.

For category decoding, trials from each task condition (that is, task relevant or task irrelevant) were extracted for each category comparison of interest: 160 face/160 objects classification, 160 letters/160 false-fonts classification within each task-relevant condition for MEG, and half the trials for iEEG. For fMRI, there were 64 trials for each category in each task-relevant condition. For orientation decoding, task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were collapsed within category to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in 160 front, 80 left and 80 right trials per category for MEG, and half these numbers for iEEG. For fMRI, there were 64 front and 32 left and right trials per category. Decoding was evaluated using accuracy measures, tested against 50% chance level for category decoding (binary classification) and against 33% chance level for orientation decoding (three-class classification). For orientation decoding, balanced accuracy was used due to the unbalanced number of trials for the different orientations. The SVM cost function was weighted by the number of trials per class to reduce bias to the class with the highest number.

For within-task decoding (for example, classification of categories across time), a classifier at each time point was trained and tested separately using a fivefold cross-validation (with three separate repeats of cross-validation). For cross-task decoding (task relevant → irrelevant and task irrelevant → relevant), each SVM model was trained on one task (for example, faces–objects in the task-relevant condition) and tested on the second task (for example, faces–objects in the task-irrelevant condition). As cross-decoding in iEEG data is performed across all pooled electrodes, an additional cross-validation step was performed on this modality data to provide a confidence metric (for example, confidence intervals) using a fivefold cross-validation with three repetitions (for example, train on 80% of task 1, and test on held-out 20% of task 2).

Within-task temporal generalization was performed by training a classifier at each time point (using selectKbest feature selection) and testing its performance across all time points using the same set of selected features and three repetitions of fivefold cross-validation. To generalize from one task to another across all time points, cross-temporal generalization was used: a classifier was trained at each time point in task 1 (for example, task relevant) using selectKbest feature selection, and tested across all time points in task 2 (for example, task irrelevant) using the same set of selected features. Cross-validation was performed in the same manner as in cross-decoding.

Additional decoding analyses were performed on all trials aligned to the stimulus onset (for example, −0.2 to 2 s relative to stimulus onset) and stimulus offset (−0.5 to 0.5 s around stimulus offset). For the latter analysis, all trials from different durations were aligned to the stimulus offset.

To assess the prediction of IIT that included prefrontal regions along with posterior regions to the decoding of categories will not significantly affect decoding accuracy, we performed an additional decoding analysis in which the decoding performance of electrodes from the IIT region were compared with the decoding performance when electrodes from both the posterior + PFC ROIs are included. The PFC ROIs included all PFC ROIs except for inferior frontal sulcus, as it belongs to the IIT extended ROIs. Posterior ROI included all IIT ROIs shown in Supplementary Table 26. The analysis compared the decoding accuracy for a model including all electrodes from posterior regions to a separate model in which electrodes (features) from posterior and PFC regions were combined (for example, feature combination). Training and testing of the individual models followed all previously described cross-validation procedures, and model comparison was performed using a variance-corrected paired t-test110 and complemented with Bayesian analysis.

We also tested this prediction on the fMRI data. To select features to be used for both analyses, the face versus object contrast for each participant was masked by a predefined anatomical posterior ROIs as well as PFC anatomical ROIs, defined the same way as described above. Within each of the two ROIs, the 150 voxels that are most selective to each of the to-be-decoded stimuli were defined as the decoding ROIs (300 voxels total) for each participant. The first analysis compared the decoding accuracies for a model that included 300 voxels from the posterior ROIs as features to another model that included 600 voxels (300 features from each ROI). In the second analysis, two separate models were constructed, calibrated and combined as described above. For the two analyses, model comparison was performed using a group-level one-sample permutation test to determine if accuracies obtained by combining posterior and PFC ROIs were significantly higher than the accuracies obtained based on posterior ROIs only. FDR was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Bayesian analysis was performed to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis that adding prefrontal ROIs will not improve decoding accuracy.

Neural responses were extracted from three windows of interest (0.8–1.0 s, 1.3–1.5 s and 1.8–2.0 s) and compared using LMMs. Four theory agnostic models were fitted: a null model, a duration model (three durations), a windows of interest model, and a duration and windows of interest model. Two theory models were fitted: the GNWT model predicts activation (ignition) following stimulus offset (0.3–0.5 s) independent of duration, with virtually no response in between. The IIT model predicts sustained activation for the duration of the stimulus returning to baseline after stimulus offset. Both theoretical models were complemented with an interaction term between category (faces, objects, letters and false fonts) and the theories' predictors, to account for regions showing selective responses to categories. BIC was used to define the winning model and we computed Bayes factors based on the difference in BIC values, comparing the GNWT model (with or without interaction) against either the null model (intercept only) or the time-window model (capturing amplitude changes over time)111.

Models for iEEG were fitted per electrode on the predefined ROIs, using the high-gamma (AUC), alpha (8–13 Hz, obtained through Morlet wavelets, f = 8–13 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; f/2 cycles, AUC),and ERPs (peak to peak) as signal, separately for task-relevant and task-irrelevant condition.

MEG models were fitted to source data on the predefined ROIs, using the gamma (60–90 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz) bands as signal, separately for task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions. Time-frequency analyses were performed on source-data using Morlet wavelets (f = 8–13 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; f/2 cycles; f = 60–90 Hz, in 2-Hz steps, f/4 cycles) and were baseline corrected. Spectral activity was computed for each vertex, baseline corrected and then averaged across trials within each parcel included in the ROIs, yielding a unique time course per ROI parcel. In addition, a single-source time course capturing the entire prefrontal ROI and the posterior ROI was computed by averaging the spectral activity within an ROI. Models were fitted on each parcel and ROI, as defined by the theories.

To examine how the neural representations evolved over time in response to the different stimulus properties (that is, category, orientation and identity representation), we performed cross-temporal RSA on source-level MEG data and iEEG high-gamma power within each of the theory-defined ROIs, using all trials. Specifically, at each set of data points, we computed a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) by calculating the correlation distance (1 − Pearson's r, Fisher corrected) between all pairs of stimuli (the preregistration document described a different method that was however updated to optimize trial numbers; see section 14 in Supplementary Information for justification). Next, to quantify the representational space occupied by one class versus another, we computed the average within-class distances versus the average between-class distances. This analysis was performed in a cross-temporal manner, in which RDMs were computed between all stimuli at time point t1 and the corresponding set of stimuli at time points t1, t2,…tn.

Long trials (1.5 s) were used to investigate category and orientation representation. As specific identities were repeated a limited number of times per duration, both intermediate (1.0 s) and long (1.5 s) trials were combined and equated in duration by cropping the 1–1.5-s time interval for long trials. This was done to allow for the analysis of at least three (3) presentations of the same identity.

To evaluate the theoretical predictions about when significant content representation should occur, we subsampled the observed cross-temporal representational matrices in four time windows (0.3–0.5 s, 0.8–1.0 s, 1.3–1.5 s and 1.8–2.0 s). The subsampled matrices were correlated to the model matrices predicted by GNWT and IIT (see Fig. 1a, right panel) using Kendall's tau correlation. If the correlation was significant (see below) for at least one of the predicted matrices, we computed the difference between the transformed correlation (\((r+1)/2\)) to each theory, and compared this difference against a random distribution to obtain a P value. If the correlation with the theory-predicted pattern in the theory ROI was significantly higher than the other model, we considered the theory prediction to be fulfilled.

To generate a null distribution of cross-temporal RSA surrogate matrices, we repeated the procedure outlined above 1,024 times, randomly shuffling the labels. Next, the observed RSA matrix was z-scored using the null distribution as:

Where \({{\rm{obs}}}_{i,j}\) is the observed within-versus-between class difference at time points i and j, and \({\mu }_{{{\rm{surr}}}_{i,j}}\) and \({\sigma }_{{{\rm{surr}}}_{i,j}}\) are the mean and standard deviation of the surrogate representational similarity matrix at time points i and j, respectively. Cluster-based permutation tests112, z-score threshold of z = 1.5 for clustering, were used to evaluate significance. RSA surrogates were also used to assess the significance of the correlation between the observed matrices and the predicted matrices of the theories. First, a null distribution of possible correlations was generated for each of the theories by correlating each of the surrogate matrices to each of the theory-predicted matrices. Next, a P value was obtained for each theory-predicted matrix, by locating its observed correlation within the null correlation distribution. The same procedure was used to assess the significance of the difference in correlation to IIT and GNWT matrices (for example, each of the surrogate matrices was correlated to each of the theory-predicted matrices and the difference between the two was computed). P values were FDR corrected (q ≤ 0.05)75.

For iEEG, the high-gamma power per electrode within the predefined anatomical ROI was averaged in 0.02-s non-overlapping windows. Electrodes were used as features for the RDM. The data were vectorized across all electrodes within a ROI (for example, samples × significant electrodes) to compute the RDMs. A total of 576 and 583 electrodes entered this analysis for the prefrontal and posterior ROI, respectively. The resultant RDM was subjected to a PCA, and the first two dimensions were plotted against each other to produce a 2D projection of dissimilarity scores across all pairs for each of the 100 subsampling repetitions. The PCA components were aligned across repetitions using Procrustes alignment and averaged together for visualization purposes113,114.

For MEG, the same analysis was run on the source reconstructed data within the predefined anatomical ROIs used for the decoding analysis, bandpass filtered (1–40 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz). For the category and orientation analysis, pseudotrials and temporal moving-average methods were used to optimize the RSA analysis and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. For identity, single trials were used. Vertices within the ROIs were used as features. The statistical testing differed from that conducted on the iEEG data, as it was performed at the participant level. Similarly to the iEEG analysis, we first tested whether the correlation between the data and the model predicted by each theory was greater than zero using the Kendall's tau measure, and then compared between the theories using the Mann–Whitney U rank test on two independent samples.

For both iEEG and MEG, PPC46 was computed between each category-selective time series (face selective and object selective) and either the V1/V2 or the PFC time series.

For iEEG, the PPC analysis included electrodes in V1/V2 visual areas, in PFC ROIs (see Supplementary Table 26), and face-selective and object-selective electrodes (see ‘Identification of task-responsive channels'), as long as they were ‘active' during the task. As both theories predict different types of activation (for example, ignition versus sustained activation), channels were categorized as active if they showed an increase in high-gamma power relative to baseline (−0.5 to −0.3 s, P < 0.05, signed-rank test) evaluated across all trials (task relevant + irrelevant, intermediate + long trials, combined across both categories), for the 0.3–0.5-s window (GNWT), or in all time windows: 0.3–0.5 s, 0.5–0.8 s and 1.3–1.5 s (IIT).

For MEG, the category-selective single-trial time courses used to define the ROIs for PPC analysis were extracted using the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED) method115. Two GED spatial filters were built by contrasting either faces or objects against all other categories during the first 0.5 s after stimulus onset. Single-trial covariance matrices were computed separately for signal and reference for all vertices within the fusiform ROI identified from the FreeSurfer parcellation using the Desikan atlas116, and the Euclidean distance between them was z-scored. Trials exceeding 3 z-scores were excluded. The reference covariance matrix was regularized to reduce overfitting and increase numerical stability. The GED was then performed on the two covariance matrices, resulting in n (=rank of the data) pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvector associated with the highest eigenvalue was selected as a GED spatial filter, which in turn was applied to the data to compute the single-trial GED component time series. A GED spatial filter was extracted also for the PFC ROI, on parcels from the Destrieux atlas73, to identify the distributed pattern of sources that are responsive to visually presented stimuli. Specifically, a spatial filter was built by contrasting source-level frontal slow-frequency activity (30-Hz low-pass filter) after stimulus onset (0–0.5 s) against baseline (−0.5 to 0 s). V1/V2 areas were identified using the Wang Atlas74 and a singular values-decomposition approach. For the GED, the 1.0-s and 1.5-s duration trials were used to minimize overlap with the transient evoked at stimulus onset.

PPC was computed for each MEG time series–iEEG electrode pairing, for all face trials and object trials separately. Analyses were performed on 1.0-s and 1.5-s duration trials, separately on task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials and also combined to maximize statistical power. To compute synchrony, time-frequency analysis of the broadband MEG and LFP signal was performed using Morlet wavelets (f = 2–30 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; 4 cycles; f = 30–180 Hz for iEEG or f = 30–100 Hz for MEG, in 2-Hz steps, f/4 cycles), and PPC was then computed by taking the difference in phase angle between MEG time series–iEEG electrode at each time t and frequency f for a specific trial and computing PPC across all trials in a category (for example, faces) as:

\({\theta }_{j,k}(f,t)={\theta (f,t)}_{e1{\rm{or}}{\rm{GED}}{\rm{filter}}}-{\theta (f,t)}_{e2{\rm{or}}{\rm{GED}}{\rm{filter}}}\), for all frequencies f and at all times t.

For iEEG, PPC for each category-selective site was then averaged across all its pairings (for example, all PFC electrodes pairings or all V1/V2 pairings within that patient). The variability in electrode coverage across patients precluded a within-participants analysis. Therefore, to achieve sufficient statistical power, we pooled all derived PPC values from one electrode pairing (for example, face selective to the PFC) across all patients into one ROI-specific analysis. A similar approach was used on the MEG parcels.

To quantify content-specific synchrony enhancement, the difference in PPC was computed between within-category and across-category trials (for example, for face-selective sites, the change in PPC was computed between faces versus objects trials) using a cluster-based permutation test106. This was done for both modalities.

As an exploratory analysis, we also investigated dynamic functional connectivity using the Gaussian copula mutual information117 approach to evaluate the dependencies between time series. This power-based measure of connectivity was implemented using the conn_dfc method from the Frites Python package118. We used the same parameters as for the PPC analysis, with the following exceptions: for both MEG and iEEG, power was estimated through a multitaper-based method (using a frequency-dependent dynamic sliding window: 2–30 Hz, T = 4 cycles; 30–100 Hz, T4/f using a 0.25-s sliding window). For iEEG, the high-frequency range was extended from 30 to 180 Hz, T = 4/f cycles). DFC was performed per frequency band, 0.1-s sliding window and 0.02-s steps.

For fMRI, connectivity was assessed through gPPI implemented in SPM119. The FFA and lateral occipital cortex were defined as seed regions per participant based on an anatomically constrained functional contrast. Anatomically, FFA seeds were constrained to the ‘inferior occipital gyrus (O3) and sulcus' and ‘lateral occipito-temporal gyrus (fusiform gyrus; O4–T4)'. LOC seeds were constrained to the ‘middle occipital gyrus (O2; lateral occipital gyrus)' and the ‘middle occipital sulcus and lunatus sulcus' (Destrieux ROIs 2 and 21 for FFA, and ROIs 19 and 57 for LOC; see ‘Anatomical ROIs').

Candidate seed voxels within the above-mentioned anatomical ROIs were defined as those with z > 1 in the contrast of parameter estimates of all stimuli versus baseline. Three participants with less than 300 candidate seed voxels were excluded from the analysis. This was done to ensure that the seed voxels were visually driven. Next, using an unthresholded contrast of parameter estimates between ‘relevant and irrelevant faces' and ‘relevant and irrelevant objects', the 300 voxels most responsive to faces within the FFA anatomical ROIs were selected for the FFA seed, and the 300 voxels most responsive to objects within the LOC anatomical ROIs were selected for the LOC seed.

gPPI analysis was performed per participant and seed region separately, including an interaction term between the seed time-series regressor (physiological term) and the task regressor (psychological term) at the participant-level GLM119, separately for task-relevant and irrelevant conditions, and also combining across tasks to increase statistical power. For combined conditions, the model design matrix for each participant included regressors for task-relevant and task-irrelevant faces, objects, letters and false fonts collapsed across conditions (four regressors) as well as a regressor for targets (irrespective of their category), yielding five regressors in total. As for separated conditions, the model design matrix included regressors for task-relevant and task-irrelevant faces, objects, letters and false fonts (eight regressors) as well as a regressor for targets (irrespective of their category), yielding nine regressors in total. For each seed, group-level analysis was performed using a cluster-based permutation test (preferred over the preregistered FDR correction), complemented by Bayesian analysis. See section 14 in Supplementary Information for a justification of this change to evaluate the statistical significance of face > object contrast parameter estimates across participants (P < 0.05).

A series of conjunction analyses were performed on the fMRI data to identify (1) areas responsive to task goal, (2) areas responsive to task relevance, and (3) areas putatively involved in the neural correlates of consciousness. We note that the contrasts proposed below might overestimate the neural correlates of consciousness and that the fast-event-related design adopted here might be suboptimal to detect activity changes in the salience network120, that is, potentially underestimating some regions that might be involved in conscious processing. We therefore have adopted a conservative approach that distinguishes between areas that might participate in consciousness versus those that definitely do not.

The conjunction defining areas responsive to task goals was defined as [TaskRelTar > bsl] and [(TaskRelNonTar = bsl) and (TaskIrrel = bsl)]. This contrast captures areas that show an increase of BOLD signal for targets but not for other stimuli. The following conjunction identified areas responsive to task relevance: [(TaskRelTar > bsl) and (TaskRelNonTar ≠ bsl)] and [TaskIrrel = bsl]. This contrast identifies areas displaying differential activity for all task-relevant stimuli, but are insensitive to non-task-relevant stimuli. Finally, the following conjunction was used to identify the putative NCC areas: [(TaskRelNonTar (stim id) > bsl) and (TaskIrrel (stim id) > bsl)] or [(TaskRelNonTar (stim id) < bsl) and (TaskIrrel (stim id) < bsl)], critically detecting areas that are responsive to any stimulus category irrespective of task, with consistent activation or deactivation. Thus, this analysis casts a wide net to identify areas that can potentially be the neural correlates of consciousness, whereas excluding areas that do not respond to task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli (meaning that areas that respond both to the task and to the content of perception are still included).

To compute conjunctions, we first ran a GLM (see above) corrected for multiple comparisons (Gaussian random-field cluster-based inference). Equivalence to baseline was established using a JZS Bayes factor test, with a Cauchy prior (r scale value of 0.707, as implemented in Pingouin (0.5.1)121. Evidence maps were thresholded at BF01 > 3. The thresholded z maps and the Bayesian evidence maps on the group level were used for the conjunction analysis. For conjunctions including an ‘unequal to', a ‘logical and' operation was used between the directional z maps, after thresholded maps were binarized. For the putative NCC contrast, conjunctions were performed separately for activations and deactivations, using a ‘logical and' operator for the task-relevant and irrelevant z maps. The resulting maps were combined using a ‘logical or' operation to discard areas showing effects of opposite direction for task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli. This analysis was also done at the participant level, masked using the anatomical ROIs, to account for inter-participant variability. For each ROI, the proportion of participants with voxels included in the conjunction is reported. The multivariate version of the putative NCC analysis was done using the thresholded statistical maps obtained from the whole-brain searchlight decoding based on a participant-level stimulus versus baseline-decoding accuracy maps (for details regarding the decoding approach used, see ‘Decoding analysis').

a, fMRI searchlight decoding accuracies (letters-falsefonts), collapsed across durations. Pattern classifiers trained on relevant stimuli and tested on irrelevant stimuli (left, purple) or vice versa (right, orange): Outlined colored regions on the inflated cortical surfaces (top: lateral views; bottom: medial views) indicate significant above-chance (50%) decoding. Here and below, significance was evaluated through a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05; two-sided). Sample sizes as reported in Fig. 2. b, iEEG ROIs decoding accuracies (letters-falsefonts) collapsed across durations. Conventions as in a. The results are displayed on inflated surface maps from a left lateral (top left), posterior (top right) and left medial (bottom) views. c, MEG cross-task decoding of category (letters-falsefonts) when classifiers were trained on relevant stimuli and tested on irrelevant stimuli (purple); or vice versa (orange), separately for the whole posterior (left) and prefrontal (right) ROIs. Underlying lines indicate significantly above-chance (50%) decoding. Error bars depict 95% CI across participants. d, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (letters-falsefonts) classifiers trained on task-relevant stimuli and tested on task-irrelevant stimuli. Columns: stimulus durations (left: 0.5 s; center: 1.0 s; right: 1.5 s). Rows: theory ROIs (top: posterior; bottom: prefrontal). Contoured red-shaded regions depict significant above-chance (50%) decoding. e, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (faces-objects), classifiers were trained on task-relevant stimuli and tested on task-irrelevant ones. Conventions as in d. f, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (faces-objects) from task-irrelevant to task-relevant stimuli, yet using pseudotrial aggregation to boost decoding accuracy. Conventions as in d. g, iEEG ROI decoding accuracies (faces-objects) using pseudotrials. Conventions as in b. Brain surfaces in panels a, b, g are from Freesurfer.

a, iEEG within-task temporal generalization decoding of category (faces-objects) for pattern classifiers trained and tested on task-relevant stimuli. As in Fig. 2b, columns represent stimulus durations (left: 0.5 s; center: 1.0 s; right: 1.5 s) and rows represent theory ROIs (top: posterior; bottom: prefrontal). Contoured red-shaded regions depict significant above-chance (50%) decoding. Here and below, significance was evaluated through a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05; two-sided).

a, Left: iEEG ROIs decoding results of orientation (left/right/front view) over time as in Fig. 2, but using pseudotrials akin to the MEG analysis. Right: Regions with electrodes showing significant above-chance (33%) accuracies are indicated in outlined blue on the inflated surfaces (left: left lateral view; middle: posterior view; right: left medial view). Here and below, error bars depict 95% CI. Significance assessed using a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05, two-sided). Sample size as in Fig. 2. b, Two analyses were performed to evaluate potential leakage in MEG decoding, using independent data from the optimization phase (N = 32). Top: averaged stimulus-evoked response in face task-relevant trials, combined across durations, at different latencies, projected on the inflated surfaces. Activity in posterior areas (blue ellipse) showed the highest peak ~0.1-0.2 s, while prefrontal areas showed a later highest peak ~0.2-0.3 s. This challenges the leakage interpretation. Bottom: Analysis of face-object decoding in task-relevant trials across durations, separately within parcels in parietal and PFC. Left: Average decoding accuracy in an early time window (0.25-0.5 s) projected on two differently inflated surfaces to better depict gyri and sulci. Right: Time-resolved decoding of these parcels. Decoding is highest in posterior areas and lowest in anterior areas, with fairly similar time courses, suggesting a posterior-to-anterior gradient consistent with leakage. c, ROIs used in the decoding analysis including (blue) and excluding (red) PFC areas. d, iEEG decoding of faces-objects (left), letters-falsefonts (middle) and face orientation (right), with and without PFC (blue and red). Underlying lines indicate significantly worse decoding when including PFC. e, MEG decoding results, same conventions as in d. f, fMRI decoding of faces-objects. Histogram shows the differences in classification including and excluding frontal areas. fMRI accuracies including PFC show 1.2% increase compared to excluding PFC, observed in 56% of the participants. Notably, this slight increase was observed only in the combined features analysis and not the combined models' analysis (see Methods). Brain surfaces in panels a-c are from Freesurfer.

a, Cross-temporal representational similarity matrices in Posterior ROI (Npatients=28, Nelectrodes = 583). The leftmost column shows similarity for letters vs. false fonts, separately for task-relevant (left) and task-irrelevant (right) trials. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots at 0.3 s illustrate the separability between letters and false fonts. The top rightward column display similarity for identity, while bottom rows show similarity for orientation. Contours indicate statistical significance based on cluster-based permutation tests (upper tail test, α = 0.05). PCA illustrates clear separability between letters and false fonts in the posterior cortex at 0.3 s, regardless of task relevance (top – task-relevant, bottom - task-irrelevant). This separability was largely sustained in the task-relevant condition but diminished between ~0.95 and 1.4 s. In the task-irrelevant condition, separability was significant only for a brief period at the beginning. Identity information was significant for letters and false-fonts but not for faces. While identity information was not sustained throughout the entire stimulus duration, elevated z-scores up to 1 s suggest a potential limitation in statistical power. No statistically significant orientation information was observed for any category. Conventions as in Fig. 3. b, Cross-temporal representational similarity matrices in Prefrontal ROI (Npatients=28, Nelectrodes = 576) for the same contrasts as and following the same conventions as in a. No contrast yielded statistically significant results in the PFC ROI.

a, iEEG electrode coverage used to assess content-selective synchrony for IIT ROIs (top, Npatients = 4) & GNWT ROIs (bottom, Npatients = 21). Electrode coverage varied between ROIs as interareal connectivity was assessed between electrodes on a per-participant basis. In addition, two example category-selective electrodes are shown (right): one face-selective, and one object-selective. Error bars depict standard error of the mean. b, iEEG Pairwise phase consistency (PPC) analysis of task-irrelevant trials reveals significant content-selective synchrony (e.g. faces > objects for face-selective electrodes; left; objects > faces for object-selective electrodes; right) in V1/V2 ROIs (top row), but not in PFC ROIs (bottom row). Color bars represent the average change in PPC (face and object trials) for each node (face-selective, object-selective). Positive values reflect stronger connectivity for faces, while negative values reflect stronger connectivity for objects. c, MEG (N = 65) cortical time-series were extracted per participant from cortical parcels in V1/V2 (blue), PFC (green) and in a fusiform (red) ROIs. Category-selective signals were obtained by creating a category-selective GED filter (i.e., contrasting face-object trials against any other stimulus category trials) on the activity extracted from the fusiform ROI. Face- (bottom left) and object-selective (bottom right) responses averaged across participants are shown at the bottom. Error bars depict 95% CI. Here and below, significance was assessed using cluster-based permutation tests, p < 0.05, two-sided. d, MEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials (N = 65) reveals significant category-selective synchrony below 25 Hz for the face-selective GED filter (i.e., faces > objects for face-selective electrodes) in both V1/V2 (top row) and PFC ROIs (bottom row) and for the object-selective synchrony (objects > faces for object-selective electrodes) in the PFC ROI only. Brain surfaces in panels a,c are from Freesurfer.

a, iEEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials did not reveal any significant category-selective synchrony cluster in posterior (top) or PFC (bottom) ROIs after removing the evoked response. Same conventions, sample size and statistical tests as in Extended Data Fig. 5 are used here and below. b, MEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials also did not reveal any synchrony cluster in any ROI after removing the evoked response. c, iEEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials without removing the evoked response reveals significant content-selective connectivity between object-selective electrodes and V1/V2 electrodes (top-right), reflected as broadband (25–125 Hz) decrease in the change in DFC (e.g., faces < objects). Similar broadband changes in DFC (faces > objects) were observed for face-selective electrodes in PFC (bottom-left). Smaller significant effects were detected between face-selective and V1/V2 electrodes (top-left) and for object-selective and PFC electrodes (bottom-right). d, MEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials without removing the evoked response reveal significant content-selective synchrony between the face-selective GED filter node and both V1/V2 (top-left) and PFC (bottom-left). This is reflected in an increase in low-frequency connectivity (< 25 Hz) combined with a decrease in high-frequency connectivity (25–100 Hz). Smaller yet significant effects were detected for the object-selective GED filter (right). e, Generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) task-related connectivity analysis of task-irrelevant (left) and task-relevant (right) trials revealed weak clusters of content-selective connectivity with FFA as the analysis seed (p < 0.01, uncorrected). Common significant regions showing task-related connectivity in task-irrelevant, task-relevant, and combined conditions include V1/V2, right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). f, gPPI task-related connectivity analysis of task-irrelevant (left), task-relevant (middle), and combined conditions revealed weak clusters of content-selective connectivity with lateral occipital complex (LOC) as the analysis seed (p < 0.01, uncorrected). Overall, no common significant regions showed task-related connectivity. Brain surfaces in panel e, f are from Freesurfer.

Left: Preregistered predictions of IIT (top) and GNWT (bottom) (see also ref. 12; Fig. 1). Key hypotheses (second column, Key hypotheses) are described alongside the three analyses used to test them (third column, Test): decoding (prediction #1; Fig. 2), activation & RSA (prediction #2; Fig. 3), and synchrony (prediction #3; Fig. 4). Potential outcomes and their interpretations are detailed in the fourth column (Possible outcome and interpretation), with outcomes aligning with predictions framed in green (pass) and contradictory outcomes framed in red (fail). Solid frames denote critical predictions, while dotted gray frames indicate non-critical predictions. This section reflects the theoretical expectations before the experiment. Right: summary of the actual findings, integrating results across modalities and analyses. Key findings for each prediction are described (fifth column; ‘Result') with white denoting alignment with predictions, red indicating contradiction, white/red mixtures showing partial support or failure, and yellow indicating inconclusive results. Final conclusions synthesize these findings, using the same color coding. For IIT, the results mix a passed prediction (content-specific complex of neural units in posterior cortex, throughout the persistence of a percept, independent of the task) with a failure (maximum integrated information). For GNWT, the results consisted of a mixture of a partly challenged prediction (of an all-or-none threshold and amplification of information updating the content of consciousness in PFC) and a partly supported one, given the inconclusive result for orientation (of global broadcasting of information in the PFC). These results are discussed in the main text, including their implications for other consciousness theories.

Metrics details

The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average1 and plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition and distribution2,3,4. However, the direction and magnitude of local changes in plant diversity in the Arctic have not been quantified. Using a compilation of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots across the Arctic, here we quantified temporal changes in species richness and composition through repeat surveys between 1981 and 2022. We also identified the geographical, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes. We found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, but no indication that, on average, species richness had changed directionally over time. However, species turnover was widespread, with 59% of plots gaining and/or losing species. Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness. Despite changes in plant composition, Arctic plant communities did not become more similar to each other, suggesting no biotic homogenization so far. Overall, Arctic plant communities changed in richness and composition in different directions, with temperature and plant–plant interactions emerging as the main drivers of change. Our findings demonstrate how climate and biotic drivers can act in concert to alter plant composition, which could precede future biodiversity changes that are likely to affect ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples5,6.

Climate change is altering biodiversity patterns on Earth7,8. Elevated rates of species extinctions have led to biodiversity loss at the global scale9,10. At regional scales, biotic homogenization has been observed11,12, whereas at local scales, studies have shown increased species turnover, but often no net changes in species richness13,14. The effects of climate change on biodiversity have been observed across temperate and tropical biomes8,15. However, little is known about changes in species diversity at northern latitudes, despite Arctic ecosystems experiencing four times faster warming than the global average1. Although rapid warming is expected to alter Arctic vascular plant communities, the direction of local diversity changes remains uncertain2,16, particularly because local changes in species richness do not necessarily translate into large-scale biodiversity trends17. Plants are the foundation of Arctic terrestrial food webs, the carbon cycle and the livelihoods of Arctic people. Therefore, to understand the effects of climate change on Arctic ecosystems, we must first quantify how climate change is affecting terrestrial plant communities.

Changes in Arctic plant diversity could be shaped by interacting processes following four pathways. (1) If species migrate northward to track climate warming, we would expect a net increase in overall Arctic plant species richness2,18. (2) Richness increases could also result from short-distance dispersal and colonization events by species that are already present in neighbouring local species pools, as growing conditions improve and communities are potentially able to support more species19. (3) Conversely, reduced Arctic floral diversity could result from losses of cold-adapted species20 that cannot cope with increasing temperatures21. (4) These declines could be exacerbated by increased competition with colonizing species originating from Low Arctic and boreal latitudes22,23 or by local species becoming better competitors under warmer conditions4. Because these pathways may be acting in concert, it is possible, and indeed likely, that richness increases and decreases could occur simultaneously, resulting in no net changes in richness. Yet, the effects of these different pathways on current and future Arctic plant diversity trends remain poorly understood. We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the direction and magnitude of Arctic vascular plant diversity change over time at the local level (α diversity) and temporal turnover in species composition (β diversity). We also investigate which geographical, climatic and biotic drivers are related to different aspects of diversity change to understand trends across the Arctic.

Apart from evolutionary history and biogeography, species richness patterns at large scales are broadly driven by climatic gradients24. Many taxa have a latitudinal gradient in diversity, in which species richness is greater at lower latitudes, which are generally warmer25,26. Therefore, Arctic vascular plant richness is expected to increase over time as rapid warming1,27 leads to new, warmer thermal niches for warm-adapted species at northern latitudes. This expectation is further supported by observed increases in vascular plant species richness with warming across European mountain tops28,29, where elevational gradients mirror Arctic latitudinal climatic and richness gradients30. Spatially, we would expect plant richness to increase at warmer, lower Arctic latitudes because of the potential influx from the species-rich boreal forest (borealization)31,32 and because the dissimilarity between Low Arctic and boreal flora is more pronounced than the dissimilarity between High and Low Arctic flora33. Overall, we expect richness increases where more warming has occurred and at lower latitudes closer to the boreal zone.

Warming-driven shifts in biotic interactions are another key driver of changes in species distributions and community composition3. Changes in dominance of different functional groups (for example, graminoids, forbs and shrubs) can affect the plant diversity and abundance of the entire plant community5. For instance, shrub expansion has been associated with decreases in lichen, bryophyte and bare ground cover2,16. Traits such as higher and denser canopies allow tall shrubs to outcompete shorter species for light by shading3,34 and deciduousness that results in greater litter fall can smother shorter plants35,36. An increase in nitrogen-fixing tall shrubs (for example, alder) may also lead to increased soil nitrogen and result in suppression and competitive exclusion of non-nitrogen-fixing vegetation22,37. Tundra species with high light and specific nutrient requirements, or those specialized in cold environments, might be particularly vulnerable to changing competitive interactions, with rare species at greater risk of local extinction38, as has been observed in Arctic-alpine ecosystems20. Overall, a decline in species richness may be expected in areas where shrub cover has increased over time.

Shifts in species composition owing to warming are likely to lead to temporal changes in the spatial dissimilarity (that is, spatial β-diversity changes over time) of plant communities across the Arctic. Climate change might lead to ecological communities experiencing biotic homogenization, as observed in other biomes, such as tropical39 and temperate forests12. Arctic vegetation might become spatially more homogeneous (that is, lower β diversity) owing to the expansion of dominant and widespread species40, such as dwarf shrubs across the High Arctic, as a result of reduced winter mortality and increased recruitment with warming41,42. At the forest–tundra ecotone, shrub expansion could lead to biotic homogenization as shrubs become more dominant43. However, habitat heterogenization could also occur40. For example, permafrost thaw and hydrology changes with warming could lead to the development of new wetland plant communities44. Moreover, the borealization of Arctic ecosystems close to the treeline could further differentiate Low and High Arctic plant communities45. In summary, whether Arctic plant communities will become more or less similar to each other with climate change remains uncertain.

Here we quantify multiple dimensions of local Arctic vascular plant diversity: richness, richness change, evenness (Pielou), evenness change, temporal turnover on the basis of presence–absence and abundance (Jaccard and Bray–Curtis) and species trajectories (proportions of species gains, losses and persistence) over time (Supplementary Tables 1–3). We also evaluate changes in subsite-level composition over time using principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs). We used 42,234 records from 2,174 plots in 45 study areas (Fig. 1a), encompassing 490 vascular plant species (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). First, we quantified spatial patterns in Arctic diversity across latitudinal and climatic gradients, to inform our expectations of diversity changes in response to warming. Second, we identified the specific geographical (latitude and biogeographical region), climatic (moisture, warmest quarter temperature, precipitation and their change over time), biotic (functional group cover and its change over time) and sampling variables (plot size, plot-level species richness and monitoring duration) associated with Arctic diversity change. Third, we investigated whether vascular plant communities across the Arctic are becoming more similar (that is, declining β diversity) over time. Our monitoring dataset from the International Tundra Experiment Plus (ITEX+) database consists of marked plots with plant species composition surveyed at different intervals between 1981 and 2022 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3). ITEX+ sites have a hierarchical structure, with species composition data recorded at the plot level. There are multiple plots in a subsite and often multiple subsites in a study area (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). The 45 long-term monitoring study areas capture most of the variation in temperature and precipitation across the Arctic tundra (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 4) and represent diverse assemblages of tundra functional groups (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). We address three main research questions.

a, Distribution of study areas, coloured according to mean plot-level plant richness per study area (n = 45). This mean calculation is for visualization purposes only, with all analyses and estimates presented elsewhere using individual plot-level richness, unless stated otherwise. A few study areas are labelled for reference. Polar projection with a southern limit of 57° N. Map created in R with the ggOceanMapsData69 package v.1.4, which uses base layers from Natural Earth (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). b, Subsites included in this study as a function of their climatic space, coloured according to their mean plot-level richness (n = 115). Background grey points represent a selection of 1,189 randomly extracted geographical coordinates from the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map33. Subsites included in our study cover an extensive gradient of Arctic climatic conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4). c, Relationship between mean cover (calculated as average cover over the entire monitoring period) of the different functional groups per plot (n = 2,174). Species-rich plots had greater forb cover, whereas greater graminoid cover was associated with species-poor plots. Cover of all three functional groups were negatively correlated. Points represent plots and are coloured according to mean plot richness. Black points indicate mean plot cover for each functional group on each axis and the black point inside the ternary plot indicates the mean cover overall. d, Duration of monitoring for all plots in our dataset (n = 2,174). Only plots that were monitored for more than 5 years (in dark grey) were included in temporal analyses (n = 1,266 plots), while those monitored shorter than 5 years (in light grey) were included only in the spatial analyses (n = 908 plots). The dotted line indicates the 5-year duration boundary. For a survey timeline, see Extended Data Fig. 3.

First, we investigated how and why the Arctic vascular plant richness has changed over time. We hypothesize that there has been an overall increase in plot-level richness (α diversity) over recent decades across the Arctic18. We expect greater richness increases in warmer sites and at lower latitudes, which are closer to boreal forest species pools31, paralleling the latitudinal biodiversity gradient46. Despite the presence of some shade-tolerant species, we also hypothesize that plant species richness will decline where shrub cover increases over time, because sun-loving plants could be outcompeted by shading and increased litter production from taller and denser shrub canopies, as per spatial analyses22. Therefore, tundra plant communities close to the treeline could follow different trajectories in shrub-dominated versus open tundra plant communities.

Second, we investigated how and why the temporal plant species turnover has changed. We hypothesize that there is an increase in plot-level turnover and species replacement with warming37 and increasing shrub cover2. We expect proportionally greater species gains with warming as a result of increases in thermophilous species47. Where shrubs are increasing in dominance, we expect greater species losses owing to shading and litter production22.

Third, we investigated whether vascular plant communities across the Arctic are becoming more similar in composition over time. Despite uncertainty, we hypothesize that there is biotic homogenization of plant communities (declining spatial β diversity through time)42. This homogenization could be caused by an infilling of warmer thermal niches32,41,42 by the same increasingly dominant, high-occupancy species with higher growth rates, good dispersal and colonization capacities47. These plants will outweigh proportional gains of low-occupancy species.

We found support for the extension of the latitudinal species richness gradient across the Arctic, with higher spatial plot-level richness at lower latitudes (slope = −0.03 log[species] per °C, corresponding to a decrease of around one species per every 5° increase at mid-range Arctic latitudes, 97.5% credible interval (CI) = −0.05 to −0.01, conditional R2 = 0.67, marginal R2 = 0.1; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3, model 1). Richness was also greater at warmer sites, with approximately one species gained on average for every 2 °C increase in warmest quarter temperature (slope = 0.06 log[species] per °C, 97.5% CI = 0.03–0.1, conditional R2 = 0.63, marginal R2 = 0.16; Supplementary Table 3, model 2) and in plots with greater forb cover and lower graminoid cover (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, models 4 and 5).

Despite greater plant richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, Arctic plant richness did not change directionally over time, on average (slope = 0.0021 log[species] per year, 95% CI = −0.0002 to 0.0043, equating to 0.01 species gained per year, conditional R2 = 0.63, marginal R2 = 0.003; Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 1). Species richness change was not related to latitude (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3, model 51) or to long-term warming trends (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 4). There was no interactive effect between temperature and temperature change on richness change (slope = 0.07, 95% CI = −0.65 to 0.78, conditional R2 = 0.13, marginal R2 = 0.03). Declines in richness occurred with increasing shrub cover and particularly where erect shrubs, but not dwarf shrubs, increased over time (conditional R2 = 0.16 and marginal R2 = 0.05 for model without shrub categories; conditional R2 = 0.08 and marginal R2 = 0.007 for model with shrub categories; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 3, models 52 and 52b). Richness change was not dependent on initial shrub cover (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 5). Richness increased over time with increasing forb cover (conditional R2 = 0.18, marginal R2 = 0.07; Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3, model 53). The effects of shrub and forb change on richness change remained even when extreme values of change were removed from analyses (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). Spatial richness and evenness were correlated (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Discussion). Overall, plots that were more diverse and/or had more evenly distributed species abundance experienced fewer plot-level species gains and losses as a proportion of total species richness (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f).

a, There was no clear relationship between species richness change and latitude (Supplementary Table 3, model 51). Richness change values were calculated as the slope estimate of the linear models of richness change over time per plot and then averaged to the study area level (n = 25) for visualization purposes. Points are coloured and sized according to their richness change value. Polar projection map created in R with the ggOceanMapsData69 package v.1.4, which uses base layers from Natural Earth (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). b, Richness did not change directionally over time. Points represent richness per plot and per year, coloured according to latitude. The dashed line and grey band represent the output from the high-level model in Supplementary Table 1. c, Mean richness change (n = 1,266 plots) as the slope of richness over time per plot. The dashed blue line represents mean richness change. Histogram bin width is 0.1. Model structure and output are from the high-level model in Supplementary Table 1. d, Richness did not increase at subsites with stronger long-term warming trends. Points represent richness change as slope subsite-level estimates (n = 90), extracted from the high-level model in Supplementary Table 1 and coloured according to climatology. MTWQ, mean temperature of the warmest quarter. e, Richness decreased where erect shrubs (but not dwarf shrubs) increased over time (Supplementary Table 3, models 52 and 52b). Points are coloured according to mean shrub cover. f, Richness increased where forbs increased over time (Supplementary Table 3, model 53). Points are coloured according to mean forb cover per plot. Richness change estimates per plot in e and f are extracted from the richness-over-time linear model. Dashed lines indicate a model in which the CIs on the slope overlapped with zero, solid lines indicate CIs that did not overlap with zero and bands show the 95% CIs of the models.

Nearly all (99%) of the plots experienced changes in species composition owing to altered relative abundances (Bray–Curtis) and 59% of plots showed compositional changes owing to species gains and losses (Jaccard; Fig. 3a–c). Arctic communities experienced a mean temporal turnover of 0.22 (Jaccard) and 0.36 (Bray–Curtis; data bounded between 0 and 1), representing presence–absence (Jaccard) and both presence–absence and abundance-related turnover at the plot level (hereafter referred to as abundance-related turnover). Greater presence–absence temporal turnover (Jaccard) occurred in colder and wetter sites, regions with stronger warming trends and species-poor plots (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 3, models 12–18). Conversely, greater abundance-related temporal turnover (Bray–Curtis) occurred in warmer sites, regions with weaker warming trends, species-rich plots (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Tables 3 (models 19–26) and 4) and plots monitored over longer periods of time (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Shrub cover change was not directly related to turnover (Fig. 3c). Plots experienced substantially more species persisting over time (mean = 5.49 species per plot, 64%) than species gained (1.84, 19%) or lost (1.67, 17%) as a proportion of the plot-level species trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Proportions of species gained, persisting and lost were similar across functional groups and to the overall dataset composition (P > 0.05 for all groups in two-proportion z test; Extended Data Fig. 5e–h and see Supplementary Table 6 for top species per trajectory). Species that were more frequently lost across plots were generally rarer (that is, were found at fewer study areas, slope = −0.13, 95% CI = −0.17 to −0.09, conditional and marginal R2 = 0.18).

a, Relationships between MTWQ and two temporal turnover metrics: Jaccard (presence–absence turnover) and Bray–Curtis (presence–absence and abundance turnover). Model outputs are in Supplementary Table 3, models 12 and 20; note that the significance of the Bray–Curtis models differed between the univariate and multivariate models (Supplementary Table 4). b, Relationships between temperature change over time (slopes from linear models) and the two turnover metrics (n = 1,266). Model outputs are in Supplementary Table 3, models 16–18 and 24–26; note that the significance of the Bray–Curtis models differed between the univariate and multivariate models (Supplementary Table 4). The univariate model is presented here for visualization purposes. Nearly half of the plots (526 plots, 41.5%) did not change in terms of presence–absence turnover (Jaccard) whereas only six (0.4%) plots did not change when considering both presence–absence and abundance turnover (Bray–Curtis); these are indicated by a turnover value of 0 in a–c. c, Turnover metrics were not directly associated with shrub cover change over time (Supplementary Table 3, models 16 and 21). d, Relationships between MTWQ and the proportion of species lost or gained for each trajectory. Model outputs are in Supplementary Table 3, models 36 and 44. e, Relationships between MTWQ and the proportion of species lost and gained. Model outputs are in Supplementary Table 3, models 40–42 and 48–50. f, Increases in shrub cover over time were associated with decreased species gains (although this effect was not significant) and increased species losses (Supplementary Tables 2, 3 (models 40 and 48) and 4). Lines and bands represent predicted model fits and the 95% CIs, respectively. Dashed lines indicate CIs that overlapped with zero and solid lines indicate CIs that did not overlap with zero. All analyses are Bayesian hierarchical models.

Species persistence was positively related to mean summer temperature, with colder sites experiencing proportionally more gains and losses than warmer sites (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 3, models 28, 36 and 44). Stronger warming trends were associated with lower proportions of plot-level species persistence and higher proportions of losses and gains over time (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 3, models 32–34, 40–42 and 48–50). There were proportionally more species losses in plots where shrubs had increased (Fig. 3f; this relationship also held up when removing the most extreme values of change) and graminoids had decreased and proportionally more species gained in plots where forbs had increased (Supplementary Table 3, models 40–42 and 49). There were proportionally fewer species gains in plots where shrubs had increased, but the effect was not significant (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 3, model 48). See Supplementary Discussion for the effects of geographical and sampling design variables, additional turnover and evenness results, overall functional group composition and climate change context.

Warming (Fig. 3b,e) and shrubification (Figs. 2e and 3f) emerged as two main drivers of Arctic plant diversity change. We therefore conducted additional analyses to better understand how and where these drivers interact (Supplementary Table 7). Overall, shrub cover did not increase significantly over time in our dataset (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Shrub cover change was not associated with latitude (Extended Data Fig. 9a) and the rate of long-term warming was not related to the rate of shrub cover change over time (Extended Data Fig. 9c). However, interannual variation in shrub cover sensitivity to temperature was different between shrub categories, indicating that dwarf shrubs responded negatively whereas erect shrubs responded positively to warmer temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 9b).

Our ordination analyses did not find any signs of Arctic-wide biotic homogenization or differentiation (Fig. 4). Subsites did not become more or less similar to each other over time. Their composition shifted in all possible directions and their location in the ordination space was broadly associated with latitude (Fig. 4a,b). There were similar distances to centroid between start (that is, baseline) and end (that is, final) time points per subsite both for Jaccard (mean ± s.d.; start: 0.66 ± 0.03; end: 0.66 ± 0.03) and Bray–Curtis (start: 0.65 ± 0.04; end: 0.64 ± 0.04) (P > 0.05 in analysis of variance (ANOVA) for all β-diversity metrics; Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10). Mean shifts in distance between time points per subsite (as Cartesian coordinates, reflecting change in community composition relative to starting point) were 0.035 ± 0.03 (Jaccard) and 0.04 ± 0.03 (Bray–Curtis; Fig. 4e).

a,b, Jaccard and Bray–Curtis β-diversity metrics. We calculated temporal change in spatial turnover (β diversity) between the start (baseline) and end (final) time period for all subsites. PCoAs are shown with the Jaccard (a) and Bray–Curtis (b) β-diversity metrics. Triangles represent the start time point and circles represent the end time points for all subsites, joined by an arrow for each subsite, indicating the direction of change over time. Points are coloured according to latitude. Enclosing convex hulls are drawn around subsites. c,d, Jaccard and Bray–Curtis scores derived from PCoAs. Box plots show the mean distance to centroid for all subsites at the start versus the end for Jaccard (c) and Bray–Curtis (d) scores derived from PCoAs (n = 90 for each time point). e, Mean distances in ordination space between time points (start versus end) for all subsites, calculated as Cartesian coordinates (n = 90 for each metric). These values show how much plant communities have changed in composition and abundance. Additional β-diversity metrics are presented in Extended Data Fig. 10. In c–e data are represented as box plots in which the middle line is the median, the lower and upper hinges are the first and third quartiles, the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value within 1.5 × the interquartile range (IQR) from the hinge and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 × IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points.

Contrary to our hypotheses, there is so far no directional trend in plant richness change on average (α diversity; Fig. 2b,c), despite the Arctic experiencing the greatest rates of warming on Earth over the past decades1 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result, based on the local scales, ran counter to literature predictions18 and experimental observations of plant diversity declines at the landscape scale48 and modelling studies predicting a regional decline of 15–47% in Arctic-alpine plant species richness20. We found that Arctic plant composition and richness changes are decoupled, with no net richness change on average despite widespread changes in composition over time (Figs. 2 and 3). Consistent with our hypotheses, in plots where diversity changes do occur, these are driven mainly by the combined effects of warming and plant–plant competition, especially increases in erect shrubs2,22. Despite the lack of a strong relationship between warming and richness change, both proportional species gains and losses were greater in plots where temperatures increased the most (Figs. 2 and 3). We found a more consistent influence of shrub increases over time, with relatively greater species losses, therefore leading to decreased species richness in plots where shrub cover (particularly of erect shrubs) increased the most over time (Figs. 2 and 3). We did not find evidence of homogenization of Arctic vascular plant communities over time, with no directional temporal changes in spatial dissimilarity of species composition (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10), indicating that plant communities changed in their composition in a variety of ways. Overall, we found that Arctic plant community composition changed to different assemblages on the basis of local context and both climate warming and shrubification emerged as key factors influencing the magnitude of species turnover.

Despite spatial species richness being greater at lower latitudes and warmer sites (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2) and rapid Arctic warming over time (Extended Data Fig. 4b), species richness did not change directionally (Fig. 2b). Richness change was not greater towards southern Arctic edges (Fig. 2a), where we hypothesized that northward species migration from the boreal forest (that is, borealization) might be a major driver of change. This lack of latitudinal change might indicate that, where diversity is changing, one of the main sources is colonizations by species present in local species pools that have not yet been recorded in long-term monitoring plots (that is, ‘landscape' or ‘dark' diversity)49. Species richness increases were not greater at sites with greater rates of warming over time (Fig. 2d), but warming was associated with proportionally greater species gains and losses (Fig. 3e). Given the importance of biotic interactions at species' warm edges50, gains could represent expansions of warm-adapted species, which could outcompete cold-adapted species47,51. This could be generating species losses, together with cold-adapted species being less able to cope physiologically with warming. This suggests that plant community composition is being influenced by warming (Fig. 3b), but that species gains and losses in plant communities balance each other on average (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5d), therefore resulting in the observed overall non-directional richness change (Fig. 2b). This is consistent with some predictions of equilibrium theory52. With 99% of plots experiencing composition changes through altered relative species abundance (Bray–Curtis > 0) and 66% of plots gaining and/or losing species (Jaccard > 0), composition change could begin to influence richness change over time. Overall, these compositional changes could result in further species reshuffling owing to altered biotic interactions, potentially leading to losses of rare and ecologically important species and associated changes in ecosystem function.

We found that shrubification was associated with richness and compositional changes. Increases in shrub cover over time were accompanied by decreases in richness and evenness and greater proportional species losses relative to sites with decreasing shrub cover (Figs. 2e and 3f and Supplementary Table 2). Shrub expansion has been widely reported2,4, although we found only a marginal increase (that is, the CIs overlapped with zero) in Arctic shrub cover at the plot scale in the ITEX+ dataset (Supplementary Table 9). Shrub cover change has been frequently linked to warming in previous site-level studies2,3,4. However, we did not find clear evidence for greater shrub change with greater rates of warming in this dataset (Extended Data Fig. 9c), in agreement with previous pan-Arctic studies4. Instead, we found that shrub cover sensitivity to temperature differed between shrub categories, with erect shrub cover increasing and dwarf shrub cover decreasing with warmer temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 9b).

Across space, lower species richness has been observed with greater shrub cover, with shading and litter production leading to decreases in sun-loving plants under shrub canopies22,23. Using space-for-time approaches, studies have assumed a similar pattern to occur over time, without necessarily testing it. Here we found and confirmed this pattern over time: at sites where shrub cover increased over time, community evenness decreased and greater species losses occurred, leading to reduced species richness (Figs. 2e and 3f and Supplementary Table 3). Our Arctic-wide results corroborate site-level reports that increasing shrub cover over time may lead to less diverse plant communities and the displacement of rare and/or less competitive species37,53. Therefore, Arctic diversity might be more at risk at sites with increasing shrub cover, particularly from erect shrubs (Fig. 2e). Conversely, both increasing graminoid and forb cover were associated with increased richness over time and increasing graminoid cover was related to lower species losses (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 2). Graminoids were more likely to persist than forbs (Supplementary Table 2), perhaps because graminoids are good competitors that can displace shallow-rooted forbs where they both occur, due to their deeper root networks, faster nutrient uptake, greater height and better resistance to herbivory54,55. Overall, our findings suggest that species may be more at risk in areas where taller shrubs are expected to increase due to aboveground competition for light55,56.

Our findings demonstrate that Arctic plant richness changed in different directions (Fig. 2b,c) amid continued warming. We found that, on average, plots had a majority of species persisting over time (64%; Extended Data Fig. 5d). Plots with high species richness and more even communities showed the least amount of change, with a lower proportion of species losses and gains (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). This pattern could be a statistical artefact owing to smaller species pool sizes leading to proportionally greater gains and losses or be a result of greater community resistance owing to the reduced extinction risk derived from greater richness and lack of species dominance38, as per the diversity–stability relationship57. We found that persistence was more common in locally warm and dry environments relative to colder and wetter environments, whereas there were proportionally more species losses at cold sites relative to warm sites (Fig. 3c). Homogenization has been predicted for High Arctic vegetation41,42, but we found no evidence of either biotic homogenization or differentiation (calculated as temporal changes in spatial dissimilarity) in Arctic plant communities so far, in line with global syntheses40, with no particular directionality of subsite-level change (Fig. 4). Our findings support the observed global decoupling of compositional and richness change13,14, as we observed more temporal turnover than directional Arctic richness change. One consequence of temporal turnover is the increase in tundra plant community height over time owing to the immigration of taller species56. Continued compositional changes are likely to lead to additional shifts in plant traits and the functioning of Arctic ecosystems5,56.

A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive local biodiversity changes will be key to identifying future rates and hotspots of change under accelerating warming58. Further research is required to determine whether Arctic plant communities are showing resistance to warming59, as additional processes could contribute to a lack of detected richness change on average. For example, the same species could be both lost and gained across plots over time owing to stochastic dynamics or sampling effects (Supplementary Table 6). Future changes in species richness and composition may not yet be detected owing to extinction lags60 and slow colonization rates in communities of long-lived perennial species. Furthermore, priority effects could cause heterogeneity in species responses to warming61. Variation in topography, microclimate and nutrient availability could mediate ecological responses and buffer against climate change effects by providing microhabitats with suitable conditions19,62,63. Rising temperatures are projected to be accompanied by increasing precipitation, leading to a warmer and wetter Arctic. This could ameliorate warming-derived drought effects on plants44. Moreover, herbivory may mitigate warming-driven shrub expansion in certain regions48. Therefore, the integration of extinction lags, priority effects, local context and both microclimate and macroclimate is an essential next step to better identify the mechanisms behind Arctic plant dynamics.

It was not possible to include non-vascular plants (bryophytes and lichens) in our analyses owing to inconsistent recording across plots64, but their influence on vascular plant dynamics cannot be discounted. Bryophytes can suppress vascular plant regeneration65, whereas both lichens and mosses have a strong buffering effect on microclimate extremes, and can therefore mitigate further shrubification66. Therefore, plots that were initially more dominated by non-vascular plants might be more resistant to vascular plant colonizations, which could explain temporal lags in richness change. Furthermore, the presence or absence of certain bryophytes reflect subtle differences in changing surface hydrology (for example, drying and paludification), soil chemistry and disturbance67,68, which can in turn affect species composition. A future priority will be to expand non-vascular plant surveys to obtain a comprehensive view of plant biodiversity changes and biotic interactions among functional groups.

Overall, we found that changes in Arctic plant diversity and community composition depend on the local context, with both warming and shrubification emerging as key factors that influence the magnitude of species turnover. Probable mechanisms underlying the observed diversity changes include colonization from local species pools49, gain of thermophilous species47, loss of less competitive and/or rare species51 and increased competition with canopy-forming shrubs22. Our results indicate that we should not necessarily expect an overall loss or gain of vascular plant biodiversity with warming in the Arctic. Instead, directional changes in plant communities will depend on the combination of changing environmental conditions and available species pools, with warming leading to greater plant community composition changes and shrubification, resulting in decreasing species richness over time. This research demonstrates the value of long-term in situ monitoring at local scales for the detection of biodiversity change and improving our understanding of biome-wide responses or resistance to climate warming. The extensive reshuffling of Arctic vascular plant composition in recent decades observed in this study underscores the urgent need to explore the effects of these shifts on ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples5,6.

We extracted composition and abundance data from the ITEX+ dataset70. Our dataset was composed of 42,234 unique records from 2,174 plots in 155 subsites distributed across 45 study areas encompassing 490 vascular plant species, recorded during different intervals over the past four decades (1981–2022) across the Arctic (Extended Data Fig. 3). We kept only control (ambient) plots and did not include experimental data. All ITEX+ sites have a hierarchical structure, with species abundance and composition data recorded at the plot level, multiple plots in a subsite and generally multiple subsites in a study area. Study areas are general regions ranging in size from several hundred square metres up to tens of kilometres. Subsites are smaller regions, or clusters of plots, in larger study areas, either located in different habitat types or created as blocks of plots in study areas. Plots are the smallest spatial units, nested in subsites and study areas. We refer to these terms throughout to indicate specific levels of this hierarchy and we use the terms plant communities or sites when referring more generally to groups of Arctic species at any scale or resolution. Our analyses were carried out with plot as the replication unit, unless specified otherwise.

Our dataset contained 2,174 plots and they were all retained for spatial analyses. For temporal analyses, we retained the 1,266 plots (58.2%) that had been surveyed at least twice over a minimum of 5 years, since shorter timeseries tend to overrepresent real change in Arctic communities17,56. The remaining 908 plots (41.7%) were used only in the spatial analyses (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3). Of all the plots that were surveyed more than once, 35.3% were surveyed twice, 21.5% were surveyed three times, 19.7% were surveyed four times, 23.3% were surveyed five or more times and 0.5% were surveyed ten or more times (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Plots range in size (that is, surveyed area) on the basis of the plant species community of interest and landscape characteristics71 (mean plot size = 0.57 m2, range = 0.048–1 m2). There is an average of 48 plots per study area (range = 5–276), 14 plots per subsite (range = 1–87) and three subsites per study area (range = 1–11). The total surveyed area per subsite (calculated as plot size × number of plots per subsite) is generally constrained under 20 m2 (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Plots were monitored over different periods during four decades (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3), with a mean study duration of 8 years (range = 1–28), a mean of three monitoring time points per plot (range = 1–11) and a mean time between surveys of 5 years (range = 1–26).

For data cleaning (taxonomic verification, input errors), we followed a previously published protocol56. Furthermore, we retained only Arctic and sub-Arctic plots in the Northern Hemisphere (>60° latitude). We kept plots that had consistent sampling methods and plot sizes over time. We retained data for only vascular plants (shrubs, graminoids and forbs) because non-vascular plants were not recorded consistently across study areas. We defined biogeographical regions as Eurasia, Greenland–Iceland, eastern North America and western North America according to glaciation history72,73,74. We kept only plots for which the surveyed area was ≤1 m2 to ensure comparable richness values across plots, given that plant species richness tends to increase with plot size75. Because Arctic plants are relatively small individuals, a plot size of 1 m2 is appropriate to reflect ecological assembly processes at the local scale76. We included the natural log transformation of plot size in all models (except for the evenness model) to account for variability between plot sizes and to most closely resemble species–area relationship theory75,77. We did not include the plot size term as a fixed effect in evenness models because the evidence of a relationship between plot size and evenness is mixed, with studies finding positive, negative and no relationships78. Therefore, there are no clear theoretical reasons to expect such a relationship. We tested an additional plot-size sensitivity analysis by re-running models behind some of the main outcomes (Supplementary Table 3, models 45 and 52) but only with plots for which the size was 1 m2 (n = 631 and 597 for the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis, respectively). Both estimates of temperature change and shrub cover change had the same direction and significance as their original model counterparts.

Because plots in the ITEX+ dataset were surveyed by different methods, we retained only plots that were surveyed using percentage cover as an abundance metric and/or another metric that was convertible to percentage cover, including point-framing and cover-class methods (for example, Braun–Blanquet). We kept all types of point-framing information (top hit, top–bottom hits and all hits), because values of overall richness were similar across methods (Extended Data Fig. 1a). We compared data with hit order information and found that top, top–bottom and all values were very similar as were point-framing data with and without coordinates (Extended Data Fig. 1). We converted all values to relative cover (0–100%) to ensure consistency between survey methods (Extended Data Fig. 2). See Supplementary Methods for a detailed account of data cleaning and cover conversion.

We calculated functional group proportion in each plot-by-year by adding up the total cover of species in a functional group (shrubs, graminoids and forbs), so that the total vascular plant cover was 100% in each plot-by-year. We also calculated the proportion of functional group cover per plot by averaging the proportion of functional group cover across all years in a plot. We use this metric as an indication of the extent to which a functional group covers a plot and refer to it as ‘greater' or ‘lower' cover. Finally, we calculated functional group change over time by adding up cover values of all species per functional group and year and fitting linear models of cover over time per plot and per functional group separately. These slopes (mean annual values of functional group change) were used as fixed effects in subsequent models (as shrub percentage change, graminoid percentage change and forb percentage change; Supplementary Table 2). We use this metric to indicate the degree to which functional group cover had changed over time in each plot and refer to it as ‘increasing' or ‘decreasing' cover over time. When models featured functional group cover or functional group change as covariates (functional-group-composition or plot-change-over-time models, see ‘Multivariate models' below and Supplementary Table 2), we fitted three models, each including change in one functional group, to achieve convergence given that functional group proportions were inherently negatively correlated. These three models included all the same covariates except for the functional group in question and are all represented in the same row under functional-group-composition and plot-change-over-time models in Supplementary Table 2.

We extracted, at the subsite level, data from long-term climatologies at CHELSA (v.1.2.1)79, including mean annual temperature, MTWQ per year, mean temperature of the coldest quarter per year and mean annual precipitation (hereafter precipitation) for the period 1979–2013. After examining correlations between the three temperature variables, we found that they were correlated with each other. Therefore, for our temperature variable, we chose MTWQ (hereafter temperature) as it best represents the growing-season conditions and has previously been linked to plant biomass, growth and reproductive rates80,81,82, which are in turn relevant variables driving diversity change. Furthermore, we extracted time series of the daily mean air MTWQ per year and annual precipitation amount during the period 1979–2013.

We calculated change over time in temperature and precipitation by fitting linear models of yearly climatic values over this time period and used the slopes of change per plot as fixed effects in the multivariate models described below (as temperature and precipitation change; Supplementary Table 2). Because geographical coordinates are available only at the subsite level, multiple plots in the same subsite had the same climatic change values. This was accounted for with the inclusion of a random effect for subsite in the models (Supplementary Table 2). We chose CHELSA as the source of our climate data because, as a quasi-mechanistical statistical downscaling product, it has a very fine grain size (1 × 1 km) and has been shown to outperform other interpolation-based climate products, particularly for precipitation metrics79,83,84.

We chose to analyse common biodiversity metrics that capture species diversity, dominance and composition change, rather than composite indices, to examine the specific elements of biodiversity in isolation from each other. Richness was defined as the total number of species co-occurring in a plot. We acknowledge that some authors refer to this term as ‘species density' when it is based on an area metric85, but hereafter we refer to richness as a more common term used in the literature. We refer to richness change as changes in richness over time, including increases, decreases and no change trends. Temporal turnover was defined as the replacement rate, in terms of species composition, in a focal plot and between the start (baseline survey) and the end (last resurvey) year of the time period covered by the focal plot. We computed the Jaccard (on the basis of presence–absence only) and Bray–Curtis (which considers both presence–absence and abundance change) indices. Both metrics were calculated with the betapart package v.1.5.6 in R86. Evenness defines the relative abundance of different species, with high evenness indicating similar abundances of species and low evenness indicating varying abundances. It is based on Pielou's J, calculated as H/log[S], where H is Shannon's diversity index and S the total number of species77.

We considered species to be locally ‘lost' if they were originally surveyed in a plot but were not present in the last resurvey. Similarly, local ‘persisting' species are those that were present at both the start and end year of the monitoring period. Species ‘gained' are those absent during the baseline survey but occurring in the last resurvey. These species trajectories were originally calculated as counts and then transformed to proportions to account for the inherent variability in species richness across plots. Species proportions were calculated by dividing the number of species per trajectory in a plot by the total number of species in each plot at both time points combined (that is, total number of unique species present at each plot in both time points, including losses, gains and persisting species). This approach allows for an overview of species trajectories per plot and for comparability across plots.

We used a Bayesian framework for all analyses. We used the software and programming language R v.4.1.087. Bayesian models were fitted using the brms package v.2.1788 and ran for as many iterations as necessary to achieve convergence (2,000–3,000 iterations over four chains), which was assessed through examination of the Rhat term and trace plots.

We fitted hierarchical models with different family distributions depending on the structure of the response variable (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These included Gaussian family with an identity link function (for continuous response variables with a normal distribution), negative binomial family with a log link function (for count data for which the variance is greater than the mean), beta family with a logit link function (for values ranging between 0 and 1, but excluding 0 and 1), zero-inflated beta family with a logit link function (for values ranging between 0 and 0.99) and zero–one-inflated beta family with a logit link function (for values between 0 and 1, including 0 and 1). For the beta family, we included in our models ‘zi ~ 1' (where zi is the probability of being 0), ‘zoi ~ 1' (where zoi is the probability of being 0 or 1) and ‘coi ~ 1' (where coi is the conditional probability of being 1, given that an observation is 0 or 1). In the case of the spatial richness models (Supplementary Table 2, models 1–5), the log link function with a negative binomial distribution assumes the relationship between richness and plot size to be log–log: log[richness] ~ log[plot size]. We specified weakly informative priors for beta and negative binomial families. Data families for each model are specified in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

To obtain the mean-richness and evenness-change estimates across the tundra, we fitted hierarchical models of richness and evenness per year over time and included nested random slopes per plot in the subsite (Supplementary Table 1). In these two models, the year covariate was centred as needed to achieve model convergence. Plot-level estimates were extracted from the richness change over time model to visualize overall richness change over time (Fig. 2b,c) and subsite-level estimates were extracted to fit the richness-change ~ temperature-change model (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 4).

We fitted three main types of multivariate models: spatial, two time point and temporal (Supplementary Table 2). Spatial models refer to current diversity metrics across space, with one unique value of the response variable (richness, evenness) measured at the last surveyed time point. These models identify the main drivers behind spatial patterns of plant diversity. Two time point models consider a response variable that has been derived from two points in time, with a single value providing the measure of change (temporal turnover through Jaccard and Bray–Curtis models and proportions of species lost, gained and persisting). Temporal models reflect metrics in which the response variable had multiple values over time and had a minimum of two time points over 5 years (richness change, evenness change, models derived from the spatial homogenization-over-time analyses). For these temporal models (richness change and evenness change), we followed a two-step modelling approach to examine diversity metrics over time. First, we calculated change over time by fitting linear models of richness and evenness per plot with sampling year as the fixed effect (one linear model per plot); these are referred to as change-over-time models. Then, we extracted the slopes of change over time per plot and used them as a response variable in a second set of models to test the relationships between putative drivers of temporal diversity change, which were measured at the plot or subsite level (SUBS in Supplementary Table 2). Both the two time-point model and temporal model identified the main drivers behind temporal patterns of changes in plant diversity (that is, research questions 1 and 2).

Across all three model types (spatial, two time point and temporal) and for each response variable, we fitted several multivariate models (that is, geographical, climatic, functional group composition, change over time, plot change over time and subsite) depending on the scale at which the covariates affected the response variable, to avoid collinearity and obscuring patterns between fixed effects (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). We used a hierarchical modelling approach by including subsite as a random effect (a random intercept) to account for the non-independence of plots in subsites. For key results, we also fitted univariate models to understand whether the relationships were consistent with the multivariate model results without the influence of other covariates (Supplementary Table 4).

All multivariate models (Supplementary Table 2) included a set of relevant sampling design variables to account for different surveying methods (‘plot size'), survey timing (‘duration') and local context (‘mean richness'). We included the natural log transformation of plot size in all models to account for variability between plot sizes and for the fact that different plot sizes may lead to different chances to detect changes over time17,77. Mean richness was calculated as the mean values of richness across all years to reflect the most common conditions in a plot over time (Supplementary Table 2). Duration was calculated as the difference between the first and the last years of surveying per plot. See Supplementary Discussion for an overview of the effects of the sampling design variables on biodiversity metrics.

To understand the relationship between two of the main drivers of diversity change, shrub cover change and warming over time, we performed extra analyses (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 7), given that previous literature has suggested a positive relationship between them4,89. First, we modelled shrub increases as a function of latitude, with subsite as a random effect (Extended Data Fig. 9a). To identify whether shrubs were sensitive to temperature, we calculated the mean temperature of the past 5 years for each monitoring time point (Extended Data Fig. 9b). We centred temperatures in the subsite before analyses to standardize magnitudes across regions and to enable model convergence. We modelled shrub cover at each time point as a function of mean temperature of the past 5 years, with a nested random effect structure of plot within subsite and an interaction term for shrub type (dwarf versus erect). Furthermore, we modelled shrub cover change per plot as a function of long-term temperature change (over the 1978–2013 period), with a random effect of subsite and an interactive term of shrub type (Extended Data Fig. 9c). To assign shrub categories, we followed a previously published methodology90 and categorized shrubs as dwarf and erect (including low and tall shrubs), because we were interested in the ecological effects of species with a sprawling versus an erect physiognomy.

A number of models were fitted outside the context of the already described high-level models, multivariate models and post hoc analyses described above. To understand the effects of increasing shrub cover on richness, we modelled richness change as a function of shrub cover change and its interaction with starting shrub cover (Supplementary Table 5). To understand whether species losses were related to rarity, we modelled the proportional losses per species (as a percentage of losses relative to all trajectories across plots) as a function of the number of study areas where the species was present in our dataset. To understand whether our temporal turnover versus richness models reflected a priori relationships or whether there was a meaningful biological relationship, we compared them with null models. To fit null models, we randomly removed 20% of species per plot (to simulate species losses) and randomly included 20% of species (to simulate species gains). We used this simulated dataset to calculate turnover values (Jaccard and Bray–Curtis). We fitted intercept-only null models with each metric and modelled Jaccard and Bray–Curtis turnover as a function of species richness.

Snow is another important driver of tundra plant composition. However, analyses of satellite remote-sensing products providing snow cover variables91 showed that gridded layers of snow-related variables contained too many spatial and temporal gaps to generate a reliable time series of snow cover duration at our sites. Instead, we extracted data on temporal trends, over the period 1950–2021, for three snow-related variables: snow season length, onset of snow season and end of snow season. These three variables were downloaded from the Bioclimatic atlas of the terrestrial Arctic database (ARCLIM)92, at a spatial resolution of approximately 9 km by 9 km. We fitted a selection of mixed-effects models to analyse temporal changes for a series of biodiversity variables (richness change, Jaccard turnover, Bray–Curtis turnover, persisters, gains, losses and evenness change) with these three snow-related variables as fixed effects, together with sampling design variables (plot size, duration and mean richness). None of the snow variables was significant in either of these models. This might be owing to a non-significant ecological effect of snow season length on diversity trends or instead be the result of a scale mismatch. The spatial resolution at which diversity metrics were calculated is 1 m2 or smaller, whereas the spatial resolution at which snow data are available is 9 km. Therefore, this scale mismatch precludes us from making any ecological inferences on the effect of temporal trends in snow season length on plant diversity change.

We performed ordination analyses to understand whether community homogenization or differentiation had taken place at the subsite level (that is, research question 3). To assess temporal changes in spatial turnover, we calculated spatial dissimilarity in species composition for all subsites separately at the start time point and at the end time point. To aggregate plot-level data into subsite-level data, we calculated the mean cover per species across all plots in a subsite, both for the start time point and for the end time point. PCoAs were carried out with the vegan93 v.2.6-2 and ape94 v.5.6-2 R packages. We calculated multiple β diversity dissimilarity metrics (Jaccard, Sørensen, Bray–Curtis, modified Gower, Manhattan and Euclidian) for both the start and end time point of all 90 subsites (Extended Data Fig. 10). These dissimilarity metrics had varying degrees of emphasis on presence–absence versus abundance turnover95.

Subsequently, we calculated homogeneity of variance between the mean distance to centroid for start and end subsites, using the methodology outlined previously96 and assessed the difference in mean distance to centroid between start and end time subsites through ANOVAs. Here, centroids indicate the average community composition across subsites. We then calculated the distance between start and end time points per subsite in the PCoA space for two β-diversity metrics (Jaccard and Bray–Curtis) through Cartesian coordinates (equation (1)), where x2 and y2 refer to the final time point per subsite and x1 and y1 refer to the start time point per subsite. These values reflected the change in community composition and abundance relative to the start time point of each subsite. Next, we modelled the distances between PCoA coordinates as response variables against the set of fixed effects in Supplementary Table 2.

Finally, we calculated the difference in the distance to centroid between start and end time for each subsite and modelled those values as response variables against the set of fixed effects (Supplementary Table 2). These values reflected the difference in each subsite relative to the overall mean composition of subsites across the Arctic. An overall decrease in this distance across all subsites would indicate compositional homogenization.

a) Current species richness at the plot level obtained by different field surveying methods. Mean values of richness are similar across point-framing data with and without coordinate values, with slightly lower values for top-only data as would be expected. Boxes are coloured according to the main survey method (n = 2,174 plots). Central boxplot lines represent medians and vertical whiskers represent the 25% and 75% percentiles. pf_plot = pointframing with no coordinates (sum of hits), pf_XY = pointframing with XY coordinates, top = top hits only, topbot = top and bottom hits only, all = all hits (including middle hits). Variability in b) plot size, c) number of plots per subsite, and d) total surveyed area, calculated as plot size * plots per subsite.

Conceptual diagram showing the different types of data compiled within the ITEX+ dataset and the process to convert them to comparable cover values. The total number of plots in the dataset is 2,174.

Each colour represents a study area, with lines showing the duration of the monitoring period and points representing survey years per plot. Lines and points are coloured by study area and ordered alphabetically from top to bottom. Plots monitored for shorter than five years were only included in the spatial analyses.

All plots experienced warming and the majority of plots experienced increasing precipitation. a) Climatologies of all subsites across the tundra according to their temperature and precipitation variables over the 1978–2013 time period. Each line represents a subsite, and each coloured point a temperature variable. MTCQ = mean temperature of the coldest quarter, MAT = mean annual temperature, MTWQ = mean temperature of the warmest quarter. Change over time in b) temperature, and c) precipitation in our Arctic plots, calculated as the slopes of annual climate change over time. Dotted colour lines in b) and c) represent the mean slope of climatic change across plots. Black lines positioned at zero are included for reference.

a-c) Mean cover of the different functional groups across all ITEX+ plots. a) Shrub and b) graminoid proportions are similar, while proportion of c) forb cover is much smaller across plots. High frequency of shrubs was relatively common across plots, and several plots were fully dominated by shrubs and by graminoids. Dotted lines indicate overall mean cover per functional group. d) There were substantially more species persisting in plots over time (64%) than species gained (19%) or lost (17%) species across plots. Proportion of species per trajectory across plots (gains, losses, persisting). Each plot is represented in each density curve via the proportion of species belonging to each trajectory. Dashed lines represent the mean proportion of species per trajectory and per plot. e-h) Proportions of species becoming lost, persisting or gained were similar across functional groups, and to overall dataset composition. Doughnut charts show the relative abundance of each functional group within a given trajectory: e) represents functional group composition proportion within the dataset for comparison with f) species losses, g) persisting species, and h) species gains.

Species richness is greater at lower latitudes across the Arctic. a) Richness per plot at the last monitoring year across our latitudinal gradient of 20.78°. Each point represents a plot, coloured by the mean plot richness per study area, and darker shades indicate overlap of multiple plots (n = 2,174). The black line represents the predicted model fit and bands show the 95% credible intervals. b) Mean plot-level richness per study area, coloured according to the richness gradient. This mean calculation is done for visualisation purposes only, with all analyses and estimates elsewhere using individual plot-level richness, unless directly indicated. A few sites are labelled for reference. Polar projection with a southern limit of 57° latitude. Map created in R with the ggOceanMapsData69 package v.1.4.

a) Plot richness change was related to shrub cover increases over time, but it was not dependent on starting shrub cove (Supplementary Table 5). Each arrow connects the first and last monitoring point for each plot, with the arrow head pointing at the end time point. Arrow colours indicate the relationship between shrub cover increase and plot richness. ‘Positive' indicates that plot richness increased as shrub cover increased. ‘Negative' indicates that plot richness decreased as shrub cover increased. Arrow thickness indicates the magnitude of shrub change over time. Only plots where shrub cover increased over time are displayed (n = 432). b-d) Models of richness change as a function of functional group change (without extreme values of cover change). Values were removed when the slopes of functional group change were greater than three times the standard deviation. We found that the relationships hold up for shrub cover change (slope = −0.03, 95%CI = −0.04 to −0.02, conditional R2 = 0.15, marginal R2 = 0.06) and for forb cover change (slope = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.05 to 0.07, conditional R2 = 0.21, marginal R2 = 0.1). Graminoid change remains non-significant (slope = 0.002, 95%CI = −0.007 to 0.01, conditional R2 = 0.14, marginal = 0.04). b) Richness decreased as shrub cover increased over time, but increased when c) forb cover increased. d) There was no relationship between richness change and graminoid cover change. Scatterplots represent richness change over time as a function of changes in cover of shrubs, forbs and graminoids. Points represent slopes of linear models of change in richness and in functional group change per plot over time. Lines represent predicted model fits and bands show the 95% credible intervals. Dashed lines indicate models whose credible intervals overlapped zero, and solid lines show models whose credible intervals did not overlap zero.

a-f) More species-rich and/or even plots had a greater proportion of persisting species, and fewer local species losses and gains over time. a-c) Proportion of species per trajectory as a function of mean plot richness over time (as number of species) for a) species losses, b) persisting species, and c) species gains (n = 1,266). d-f) Proportion of species per trajectory as a function of plot mean evenness over time for d) species losses, e) persisting species and f) species gains (n = 1,263). Points are coloured by turnover (measured as Bray-Curtis). g-h) Relationship between turnover metrics and study duration. g) There is a non-significant relationship between Jaccard turnover and study duration and h) a positive relationship between Bray-Curtis turnover and study duration (n = 1,266 for each metric). Each point represents a plot. Solid lines represent predicted model fits (whose credible intervals do not overlap zero) and a dashed line represents a model estimate whose credible intervals overlap zero. The bands show the 95% credible intervals.

These reflect the post hoc analyses, with model outputs in Supplementary Table 7. a) Shrub cover change was not related to latitude (n = 503). b) Shrub cover sensitivity to the mean MTWQ of the previous five years differed between shrub categories: erect shrub cover was greater at warmer temperatures, and dwarf shrub cover was lower at warmer temperatures. Mean temperatures are centred per subsite to account for variability and enable model convergence (n = 6,715). c) Shrub cover change rates per plot were not related to temperature change rates over the 1987−2013 period (n = 665). Lines represent predicted model fits and bands show the 95% credible intervals. Dashed lines indicate models whose credible intervals overlapped zero.

Subsites showed no homogenisation or differentiation over time across the Arctic. The panel shows Principal Coordinate Analyses with six β-diversity metrics. Yellow triangles and blue circles represent the start (i.e., baseline) and the end (i.e., final) time points for all subsites, respectively. Convex hulls are drawn around them following the same colour scheme. The boxplots show the mean distance to centroid for all start versus end subsites. In boxplots, the middle line is the median, the lower and upper hinges are the first and third quartiles, the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value within 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range) and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points.

Metrics details

The Global Flourishing Study is a longitudinal panel study of over 200,000 participants in 22 geographically and culturally diverse countries, spanning all six populated continents, with nationally representative sampling and intended annual survey data collection for 5 years to assess numerous aspects of flourishing and its possible determinants. The study is intended to expand our knowledge of the distribution and determinants of flourishing around the world. Relations between a composite flourishing index and numerous demographic characteristics are reported. Participants were also surveyed about their childhood experiences, which were analyzed to determine their associations with subsequent adult flourishing. Analyses are presented both across and within countries, and discussion is given as to how the demographic and childhood relationships vary by country and which patterns appear to be universal versus culturally specific. Brief comment is also given on the results of a whole series of papers in the Global Flourishing Study Special Collection, employing similar analyses, but with more-specific aspects of well-being. The Global Flourishing Study expands our knowledge of the distribution and determinants of well-being and provides foundational knowledge for the promotion of societal flourishing.

Interest in questions of flourishing has expanded dramatically in recent years. This interest can be seen in various sectors, including psychology, economics, business, education, medicine, public health and public policy1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. While this has led to an expansion in research, much remains unknown, especially as it pertains to flourishing on the global landscape. The research on well-being has been shaped largely by Western perspectives and has been carried out mostly in Western contexts. This work has thus been subject to some critique11, as indeed is the case with social–scientific research more generally12. Such limitations hinder our conceptions of, and knowledge concerning, well-being. The Global Flourishing Study (GFS) was conceived as a large, open-access, 5-year longitudinal panel research study of 22 countries (see Fig. 1), spanning all six populated continents, with nationally representative sampling in each country, to study the distribution and determinants of well-being, to advance our knowledge of flourishing in general and especially in non-Western contexts and to uncover what patterns are culturally specific and which seem more universal. Compared with other cross-national studies of well-being such as the World Values Survey or the Gallup World Poll (GWP)/World Happiness Report13, the GFS aims to supplement and expand upon these by both (1) providing longitudinal panel data on the same cohort of individuals over time and (2) providing a broader range of assessments on well-being or flourishing.

Solid blue, included; light gray, not included.

Flourishing is an expansive concept1,2,5,14,15, and the working definition underpinning the GFS has been ‘the relative attainment of a state in which all aspects of a person's life are good, including the contexts in which that person lives.'5,16 Several aspects of this definition are important. First, flourishing is multidimensional—it concerns all aspects of a person's life. One may be flourishing in certain ways but not in others. No assessment of flourishing will ever fully measure flourishing, only aspects of it. Second, flourishing may be conceived of as an ideal, but it also concerns the ‘relative attainment' of that ideal17. We are never perfectly flourishing in this life, and there is always room for improvement. Third, flourishing concerns both objective and subjective aspects of life, although subjective aspects are more amenable to survey research. Fourth, the understanding of what is ‘good' will vary across cultures and contexts, but there is arguably a great deal of common ground as well, and such common ground is a reasonable starting point for measurement5,18. Finally, flourishing includes the contexts in which a person lives; such contexts include one's communities and environment. While the terms ‘flourishing' and ‘well-being' are often used interchangeably, flourishing arguably has a connotation of also having the environment itself being conducive to growth and being a part of one's flourishing. The community's well-being is a part of one's own flourishing—a person participates in the common good of the community. While well-being might be defined as ‘the relative attainment of a state in which all aspects of a person's life are good, as they pertain to that individual,' flourishing also includes the well-being of the community and environment. However, since individual aspects of flourishing effectively constitute well-being, the two terms will, in many contexts, often be used interchangeably. There may also often be greater consensus across cultures around what is desirable for individual well-being than in understandings concerning what constitutes the right type of community or government, and so the composite flourishing index considered in the following focuses on those individual aspects5. We do, however, also offer further comment on analyses using more community-related assessments.

This Article provides a description of the Global Flourishing Study, including the nature of the sample and data collection and a description of the methodology for the development of the questionnaire, the study design and survey sampling, and the analytic approaches guiding many of the initial analyses of the data. Analyses concerning composite assessments of flourishing are presented as to how flourishing assessments vary across demographic groups and countries and how various types of childhood experiences relate to adult flourishing. Comment is offered on a range of other analyses and studies arising out of the first wave of the GFS data, and discussion given to the study's importance and promotion of flourishing in a global context.

With the concept of flourishing being expansive, there is no unique or fully comprehensive way to partition ‘all aspects of a person's life.' Understandably, numerous well-being classifications have thus emerged1,2,5,14,19. While the GFS included questions from the flourishing conceptualization of ref. 5, the survey development process20,21 incorporated numerous cross-cultural perspectives and questions extending well beyond those proposed in ref. 5. In the following presentation of the initial GFS results, we roughly follow the flourishing domains of ref. 5—health, happiness, meaning, character, relationships and financial security. However, the GFS data and analyses do not presuppose the priority of these domains, and other researchers can certainly recategorize the items.

These aspects of well-being—health, happiness, meaning, character, relationships and financial security—may be understood as paradigmatic of broader well-being categories: physical well-being, emotional well-being, cognitive well-being, volitional well-being, social well-being and material well-being (see Table 1). A perhaps simpler division into domains derives from the World Health Organization's definition22 of ‘health' as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.' The categories used here further divide mental well-being into emotional, cognitive and volitional well-being, corresponding to traditional and empirical division of the mind into emotions, intellect and will23,24,25,26,27,28. Social well-being might itself have further been divided into relational and communal well-being; in more expansive understandings of flourishing, communal well-being might itself be sub-divided into community, political and economic well-being. Again, there is no unique way to divide the conceptual space. Much has been written on including a spiritual dimension within the WHO definition29, thereby yielding, ‘a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being,' which we have referred to elsewhere as the WHO+ definition16,17. It is, however, more difficult to attain consensus on understandings of spiritual well-being across the world religions, and we will make some remarks on this matter later in the Article. Finally, material and financial resources are sometimes taken as determinants of well-being and sometimes understood as constitutive elements of well-being30,31,32,33,34. These conceptualizations rightly vary depending on how well-being is defined. We do not take a definitive stance on this matter in the Article and present analyses alternatively including and excluding financial well-being.

In what follows, we describe the GFS methodology, comment on results of the analyses for the composite flourishing index, offer brief comment on numerous papers concerned with more-specific aspects of well-being and conclude by offering discussion on the implications of the study and results for the promotion of flourishing.

Table 2 presents nationally representative descriptive statistics of the observed sample. Slightly more than half were middle-aged (30–59 years old (53%)), women (51%), married (52%), employed (either for an employer or self-employed, 57%) and had between 9 and 15 years of education (57%). Most participants were born in the country in which they were surveyed (94%), and approximately one-third of participants attended religious services at least weekly (32%). Sample sizes in each country ranged from 1,473 (Turkey) to 38,312 (United States). Participant characteristics for each country are shown in Supplementary Tables 1a–22a.

Table 3 presents nationally representative descriptive statistics of the observed sample for retrospective assessments of childhood experiences. Most reported ‘very good' or ‘somewhat good' relationships with mother (89%) and father (80%) and that their parents were married (75%); a large proportion reported their family ‘lived comfortably' (35%) or ‘got by' (41%) financially during their childhood. About 18% of participants reported experiencing abuse and 16% feeling like an outsider growing up; most assessed their health as ‘excellent' or ‘very good' (64%) in childhood. A large proportion of participants attended religious services at least once per week during childhood (41%). The rate of missing data for the first wave of the GFS was low (<5% for any variable). Over all the items used as childhood predictors, the percentage of respondents with any missing data was only 12.9%.

With regard to demographic relations and associations with childhood experiences, we will first comment on the results of random effects meta-analysis across the 22 countries. We then turn to variations across countries. Table 4 presents ordered means of a composite flourishing index. The index includes two indicators each across six domains: happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships and financial security (see Table 5 below and ref. 5). Table 4 presents weighted means so as to be nationally representative within country, and alternately includes means both without and with financial security (10 versus 12 indicators, respectively), with standard deviations, Gini coefficients and alpha reliability coefficients. Without financial security, the highest means were reported in Indonesia (8.47), Mexico (8.19) and the Philippines (8.11); the lowest were in Japan (5.93), Turkey (6.59) and the United Kingdom (6.88). When including financial security, Israel instead of Mexico has the second highest mean. Standard deviations for composite flourishing across countries range from 1.30 to 2.03. Gini coefficients for inequality tend to be highest in those countries reporting the lowest means. Cronbach's alpha for the index is relatively high in all countries. All subsequent tables report results with financial security. Analogous analyses without financial security are given in Supplementary Tables S26–S28.

Table 6 presents random effects meta-analysis of composite flourishing means by demographic category. Aggregated across all countries, flourishing increases with age from 7.03 for those aged 18–49 years to 7.36 for those aged 80 years or older; it is relatively similar for men and women, but lower for those identifying as ‘other' genders. Flourishing is notably higher for those married (7.34) than for those separated (6.77) or divorced (6.85) and higher for those employed (7.20) and self-employed (7.28) than for those unemployed (6.51). Flourishing tends to increase somewhat with education, but more dramatically with religious service attendance, ranging from a mean of 6.86 for those never attending to 7.67 for those attending more than weekly. It is slightly higher for those born in the country (7.16) than for those not (7.02). Results are generally similar when excluding financial security (Supplementary Table 26), but the relations with age are slightly more muted in these analyses.

Table 7 presents results from random effects meta-analysis of multivariate regression of composite flourishing on all childhood predictors (Table 7) simultaneously. Good childhood relationships with mother (0.18; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.24) and father (0.11; 95% CI :0.07, 0.18) were positively associated with adult flourishing. There is some evidence that having parents who were never married (−0.11; 95% CI: −0.21, −0.01), or when one had died (−0.07; 95% CI: −0.16, 0.02), or possibly divorced (−0.07; 95% CI: −0.17, 0.02), compared with having parents who were married, was associated with lower adult flourishing. There is a notable gradient in flourishing with childhood subjective financial status, with finding it very difficult to get by associated with lower flourishing (−0.27; 95% CI: −0.35, −0.19) and living comfortably associated with higher adult flourishing (0.20; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.26) compared with those who got by. A similar gradient can be seen regarding self-rated health growing up: poor health is associated with lower (−0.34; 95% CI :−0.54, −0.14) adult flourishing, and excellent health with higher (0.46; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.62) flourishing compared with those in good health. Abuse (−0.34; 95% CI: −0.40, −0.29) and feeling like an outsider growing up (−0.26; 95% CI: −0.33, −0.18) were associated with lower adult flourishing. Attending religious services weekly was associated with higher adult flourishing (0.27; 95% CI :0.17, 0.36) compared with never attending. Flourishing tended to increase with age, but there was relatively little difference with regard to immigration status, or men versus women.

Table 8 presents E-value (the minimum strength of the association an unmeasured confounder must have with both the outcome and the predictor, above and beyond all measured covariates, for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an association) sensitivity analyses35 of meta-analyzed childhood predictor associations to potential unmeasured confounding. Some of these associations between the childhood predictors and adult flourishing were moderately robust to potential unmeasured confounding. For example, to explain away the association between abuse in childhood with higher adult flourishing, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both absence of abuse and higher flourishing by risk ratios of 1.74-fold each, above and beyond the measured covariates, could suffice, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to shift the 95% confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both absence of abuse and higher adult flourishing by risk ratios of 1.64-fold each, above and beyond the measured covariates, could suffice, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.

The overall patterns in the preceding, pooled over all countries, are illuminating but disguise important country-specific variation (Supplementary Information). We comment on this variation in the following, but caution is needed with regard to over-interpretation, especially in cases when magnitudes are not strong. Flourishing tends to increase with age in many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Sweden and the United States, but not in all. In India, Egypt, Kenya and Japan, patterns are somewhat more U-shaped. In Spain, the pattern is somewhat U-shaped except for the youngest age group (18–24-year-olds), which reports the lowest flourishing. In Poland and Tanzania, it is mostly decreasing with age. Other countries show more complex patterns with age. Men and women are fairly similar globally, but there are greater differences in certain countries. In Brazil, men report higher flourishing than women (0.39; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.47); in Japan, women report higher flourishing than men (−0.26; 95% CI: −0.32, −0.21). The patterns of married individuals reporting higher flourishing than those divorced (or separated) are nearly universal, but differences vary from 0.92 (0.63, 1.22) in Israel to 0.10 (−0.10, 0.30) in Argentina. In most countries, those married report notably higher flourishing than those who are single, but not in all: married report lower flourishing than single in India (−0.39; 95% CI: −0.50, −0.28) and Tanzania (−0.35; 95% CI: −0.51, −0.20). Those employed effectively universally report higher flourishing than unemployed, but again differences vary from 1.50 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.83) in the United States to just 0.09 (95% CI: −0.03, 0.22) in Kenya. There is, however, considerable variation across countries in comparisons of employed versus self-employed, retired or student, with those self-employed and retired reporting higher flourishing than those employed in many developing countries and students reporting notably higher flourishing than those employed in Poland, India, Japan, Tanzania, Israel, Egypt and Kenya. Those attending religious services more than once a week (or weekly) universally report higher flourishing than those never attending, but differences vary from 2.33 (2.12, 2.54) in Hong Kong to 0.15 (−0.01, 0.30) in India. In most countries, those with more education report higher flourishing, but the reverse is the case in Hong Kong and Australia. Associations with immigration status also vary by country, with those born in the country reporting notably higher flourishing in the Philippines, Poland, India, Israel, Mexico and Hong Kong, whereas the reverse is the case in Spain and Australia.

Likewise, with the analyses concerning the childhood predictors, there are some patterns that are nearly universal and others that seem to vary by culture and context. Associations between good maternal relationship and adult flourishing were nearly universal but varied in magnitude from 0.63 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.99) in Indonesia to effectively null (−0.14; −0.43, 0.14) in Israel, and likewise for good paternal relationship. Compared with those with married parents growing up, those with divorced, separated, single or one or more deceased parents tended to have lower flourishing in adulthood, although Turkey was an anomaly with respect to divorce. Compared with a subjective financial status of getting by in childhood, living comfortably was essentially universally associated with higher adult flourishing with magnitudes ranging from 0.70 (0.53, 0.87) in Hong Kong to effectively null (−0.05; −0.17, 0.08) in Nigeria; and finding it very difficult was universally associated with lower adult flourishing with magnitudes ranging from −0.92 (−1.45, −0.40) in Turkey to null (0.00; −0.36, 0.35) in Sweden. Experiencing abuse and feeling like an outsider were likewise universally associated with lower adult flourishing. Excellent, as compared with good, childhood health was universally associated with higher adult flourishing, and while poor childhood health was nearly universally associated with lower adult flourishing, there were possibly a few exceptions: in Germany there was evidence of a positive association (0.40; 0.07, 0.74). Weekly religious service attendance growing up was associated with higher adult flourishing in almost all countries, with the largest effect sizes in Poland (1.02; 0.77,1.28) followed by Hong Kong and Turkey; however, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania manifested slightly negative estimates (−0.22, −0.15, −0.05, respectively), although with confidence intervals including 0. Patterns across countries for immigration status, age/birth cohort and gender roughly followed that reported in the preceding for demographic statistics, although after multivariate adjustment, further gender differences emerged, with notable evidence for women having higher flourishing than men in Egypt, Japan and Hong Kong, and men having higher flourishing than women in Spain, United Kingdom, Brazil, Kenya and Argentina.

The preceding analyses concerned composite flourishing. However, just as pooling across countries is of interest, but obscures country-specific relations, so also the use of a composite flourishing measure can obscure more nuanced relations with more-specific aspects of well-being. A series of papers, following the same methodology described in the preceding, has examined these various more-specific well-being domains, and many of these papers are part of the present GFS Special Collection. While these papers contain far more detailed analysis than can possibly be summarized here, some higher-level remarks may be of interest in trying to understand similarities and differences in relationships with more-specific aspects of well-being. We will provide a cursory overview of some of the results in each of the well-being domains in turn, focusing principally on any patterns that notably diverge from those reported concerning composite flourishing. Many, albeit not all, of the differences concern relations with age, gender and childhood adversity.

Patterns for self-rated physical health36 followed that of composite flourishing in many respects but differed in that scores decreased with age, although with some variation (for example, with U-shaped patterns in Australia, Japan and Sweden), and men report better health than women overall, with the reverse notable only in Japan. Patterns with health limitations37 and physical pain38 were conversely similar, that is, increasing in age. Physical pain was one of the very few outcomes that was adversely associated with religious service attendance38,39. For pain, there was evidence in some countries (for example, South Africa and Israel) that those who financially just got by reported lower levels of adult pain than those who lived comfortably in childhood39. Patterns for self-rated mental health tended to follow those of flourishing, but were U-shaped with age overall, although increasing in Australia, United States and Sweden and decreasing with age in Israel and Tanzania40. Depression and anxiety, assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)41, both decreased with age, were less related to religious service attendance and were somewhat higher for women than men.

With respect to emotional well-being, patterns for happiness and life satisfaction mostly follow those of flourishing, but are slightly more U-shaped (or ‘J-shaped') with age42, somewhat comparable to much previous research43. The increasing-with-age pattern for composite flourishing is thus shaped by other aspects of well-being documented in the following. There are also notable differences in the country-specific reporting and in some of the demographic relationships between life satisfaction, life evaluation and affective happiness, and further discussion of these matters and of differences between the GFS and the GWP is given elsewhere42. In contrast to life satisfaction/evaluation, the outcomes of balance, inner peace and optimism are all increasing with age44,45. Patterns with mastery are similar but somewhat smaller in magnitude46. In contrast to many outcomes, suffering is not strongly patterned with age overall, or with religious service attendance, but there is notable variation in this across countries; suffering varies more with marital status, employment, education and gender, with women reporting higher suffering than men in most countries47 even after multivariate adjustment48.

Meaning and purpose manifest similar demographic relationships as with composite flourishing and are likewise increasing with age49. For meaning and purpose, the relationships with childhood adversity seem more complex. Death of a parent seems to matter more for meaning and purpose in Spain, Israel and Nigeria than in Australia, Philippines, Argentina or Japan (wherein estimates were positive, albeit with wide confidence intervals). In some countries (United States), difficult, or even very difficult (Argentina), childhood financial circumstances were associated with higher adult meaning, and in others (Poland), living comfortably was associated with lower adult meaning. By contrast, childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider were essentially universally associated with lower adult meaning50.

Concerning character (‘volitional well-being'), assessments of promoting the good are mostly increasing with age (although not in all countries; in India and Tanzania this was decreasing with age); were slightly higher with women and notably higher with religious service attendance51,52. Similar patterns were manifest with more objective behaviors such as, within the last month, volunteering, charitable giving and helping a stranger, although charitable giving and helping were slightly higher among men, volunteering was more uniform in age (until decreasing at 80+), and helping a stranger decreased with increasing age53,54. The relationships of these behaviors with childhood adversity were also more complex. Childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider predicted higher adult volunteering, giving and helping; the relationship with childhood health with both volunteering and charitable giving was U-shaped with both excellent childhood health and poor childhood health predicting higher adult volunteering than good health55,56. By contrast, abuse, feeling like an outsider, poor childhood health and difficult childhood financial circumstances all tended to decrease capacity for delayed gratification, showing love/care for others, gratitude and hope57,58,59,60, although none of these variables mattered for forgiveness61. Forgiveness, gratitude and showing love/care were all increasing with age; hope was relatively flat with age; and adult delayed gratification was decreasing with age. Women reported higher gratitude and love/care than men and reported similar forgiveness and hope overall, but higher after multivariate control58,60,61,62,63,64.

With regard to social well-being, patterns for close social relationships mostly followed those of composite flourishing65,66 except women reported very slightly higher than men, and there was little relationship with education overall. Those with lower education reported higher relationship quality in Indonesia, Kenya, Sweden and the United States, but this pattern was reversed in Brazil, Israel, Japan and Poland. In general, those who were married reported the highest relationship quality, but widowed individuals did so in 6 of the 22 countries. Having an intimate friend was roughly constant with age (but highest among 80+); by contrast, having social support was U-shaped with age, higher for women and higher for students and those retired than for those employed; other patterns were relatively similar to that of composite flourishing67.

Patterns showed somewhat more variation with communal dimensions of social well-being. For non-religious community engagement, weekly participation decreased with age, was slightly higher for men, higher for those single than married, higher with students than the employed, but itself increasing with religious service attendance68. Having a sense of belonging within the country followed many of the same patterns as composite flourishing but was slightly higher for women, slightly decreasing with education and notably higher for those born within the country69,70. Similar results pertain to the demographic relations with satisfaction with the city or area in which one lives (‘place satisfaction'), except for essentially no male–female difference and a weaker relation with being born within the country. Trust within the country and feeling one had a political voice were both slightly U-shaped with age and slightly higher for men; with political voice, but not trust, which was increasing with education71,72. Other patterns were relatively similar to that of composite flourishing.

Concerning financial well-being, many of the patterns follow those of composite flourishing, especially with respect to the childhood predictors73. However, across the subjective and objective financial well-being indicators, there were additional important differences, especially with respect to age, gender and religious service attendance. See ref. 73 for further details.

With respect to spiritual well-being, as noted previously, how this is understood will vary by tradition and culture. Moreover, many of the religious or spiritual GFS assessments concern behaviors or beliefs that may be determinants of well-being, rather than constituting spiritual well-being per se. We consequently restrict comment to a single item involving feeling loved or cared for by God or a spiritual force74. Even this, of course, may not be applicable in non-theistic religious traditions. We thus focus on the sub-analysis that excludes respondents who indicate that the question is not relevant. The patterns for this indicator follow fairly closely those for composite flourishing except proportions are higher for women, slightly U-shaped with education and higher for those who have immigrated.

The patterns across countries are complex, and there is no straightforward way to summarize results across all of the indicators and papers. There is considerable variability in the ordered means of countries across indicators (Supplementary Table 29). However, as will be discussed, such ordering of means needs to be interpreted cautiously since interpretation of items and response scales may vary by language and culture75,76. The interpretation of these thus often makes sense only on a relative basis within countries. In Table 9, we report, for each country, the four well-being indicators (out of 47 total) for which the country, relative to the other indicators, ranked highest, and the four indicators for which the country, relative to the other indicators, ranked lowest, to give some indication of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each country.

With regard to the primary results from the flourishing index, several comments merit attention. One of the more concerning results is the relation with age. On average, when pooled across the 22 countries, flourishing is essentially flat with age through ages 18–49 and then increases with age thereafter. This is in striking contrast to earlier work—focused mostly on life satisfaction/evaluation—which had suggested a more dramatically U-shaped pattern with age43. Even with life satisfaction, pooled over the 22 GFS countries, this is now more J-shaped than U-shaped. As noted in the preceding, the increasing-with-age pattern in 2023, when pooled across GFS countries, now also holds on average with many specific aspects of well-being, including balance, inner peace, mastery, optimism, meaning and purpose, promoting good, charitable giving, forgiveness, gratitude, showing love/care, relationship quality, feeling belonging, place satisfaction and feeling loved by God or a spiritual force. Earlier nationally representative 2022 data in the United States identified these patterns with all of the various flourishing domains, including life satisfaction77. There is also other corroborating evidence concerning changes in patterns between age and life evaluation and mental health78,79,80. While there are distinctions across measures, covariate controls and countries, the cumulative evidence here and elsewhere likely reflects some real changes in well-being's relation with age that have been taking place over time. Young people are not doing as well as they used to be. While causes are likely diverse, mental health concerns with young adults are clearly on the rise. These patterns are not universal. As noted, in some countries the patterns concerning flourishing and age are still somewhat more U-shaped (India, Egypt, Kenya, Japan) and in others (Poland, Tanzania) decreasing with age. Nevertheless, the overall global pattern is troubling. An open question concerns whether these relations constitute a newly patterned ‘age effect' or whether this is in fact a new ‘cohort effect.' This will be resolved only with more data over time. It is possible that because of social and economic conditions, it simply is more difficult to be young today, but that well-being for these young people will increase with age. It is, however, also possible, for example, that, within-person, over time, well-being will continue to follow a U-shaped pattern (but with the mean of that U lower) so that the younger cohorts will decline in well-being over time. Only future waves of data collection will be able to distinguish between these two possibilities, or their combination. It should also be noted that the answer to this question is not predetermined, and in fact depends a good deal on the extent to which policy is shaped to try to better support the well-being of young people.

Some of the other pooled results presented are relatively unsurprising in the context of the existing literature. The well-being literature, focused mostly on life satisfaction/evaluation, has consistently replicated the results with marriage, employment and religious service attendance5,32,81, for example, and these patterns were relatively consistent across countries in the GFS. While the analyses here are purely descriptive, other longitudinal, experimental and quasi-experimental studies suggest that each of these factors also has a causal role; they are likely ‘pathways' to flourishing5. What was interesting in this context, however, is how substantially the magnitudes of differences in flourishing related to these demographic factors varied across countries. Future research could aim at trying to understand the explanations for these differences and whether different cross-cultural mechanisms or moderators (or possibly different patterns of confounding) may be at play. Similar considerations pertain to the differences across countries observed in the relations between flourishing and education, immigration and gender.

It is of course challenging to condense all of the varying evidence into a limited number of high-level insights. We will, however, offer three additional, admittedly selected, summary points of interest. First, flourishing is multidimensional, and different countries are flourishing in different ways. While many developed nations report comparatively higher levels of financial security and life evaluation, these same nations are not flourishing in other ways, often reporting lower meaning49, pro-sociality51 and relationship quality65. Japan reports strikingly low scores on many well-being indicators, and this appears to be not purely an artifact of a tendency to report in the middle of 0–10 response scales82 since the same patterns hold with binary indicators. Other, often middle-income, nations, such as Indonesia, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines report higher on these other more humanistic aspects of flourishing. The more material and the more humanistic forms of well-being sometimes diverge. While purely descriptive, the negative relationship between meaning and gross domestic product per capita is particularly striking49 and has been confirmed in previous work83. This may raise important questions about how to carry out economic development in ways that do not compromise meaning and purpose. The claim being made here is not a causal assertion about gross domestic product lowering meaning. Rather, the desired outcome of a society is presumably one with both high levels of economic development and high levels of meaning, and the question is then how to attain this. Similar considerations may pertain to relationships and character.

Second, there can sometimes be complex relationships between adversity and subsequent flourishing. Often adversity is indeed detrimental, and work must be done to address conditions of adversity and suffering. But sometimes these adverse conditions can for some give rise to development and growth and certain forms of flourishing84,85. The patterns are, however, complex, both across countries and across outcomes. In some countries, more adverse childhood socioeconomic circumstances were associated with lower levels of adult pain, perhaps suggesting a developed resilience. In the United States and Argentina, difficult childhood financial circumstances were associated with higher adult meaning. These patterns pertain to some countries but not others. However, there is also variation across outcomes. Aggregating across all countries, childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider somewhat surprisingly predicted higher levels of adult volunteering, giving and helping but predicted lower levels of showing love/care for others. The effects on these seemingly closely related outcomes are in opposite directions. More work needs to be done to understand the conditions or responses to adversity and suffering that lead to growth, rather than further decline. While more can and should be done to address suffering and adverse circumstances, some experience of suffering seems ubiquitous and an almost unavoidable part of the human condition86,87. In addition to trying to reduce suffering, we should also better seek to understand how we might approach and transform such suffering, when we cannot eliminate it, to enable, when possible, further flourishing85, and we should better understand the limits of such approaches.

Third, in both the demographic analyses and in the childhood predictor analyses, religious service attendance was one of the factors most consistently associated with present or subsequent well-being, across countries and across outcomes. This is consistent with much previous literature focused principally on the West88,89,90,91,92, but now expanded to a broad range of countries. Service attendance was not beneficially associated with all well-being outcomes. It was associated with slightly higher levels of suffering and of physical pain, which may arise from either differing experiences of it or sensitivity to it. However, with the vast majority of other well-being outcomes, in both the demographic analyses and the childhood predictor analyses, there were beneficial dose–response associations with service attendance, often with a fairly steep gradient. This does not of course guarantee that such associations will be found in all countries, but it is nevertheless notable that they do pertain to many of the 22 GFS countries. While the demographic analyses are purely descriptive, the childhood predictor analyses are intended to provide some evidence for causality. The near ubiquity of these associations is thought-provoking, and this factor is arguably too often neglected in our understanding of well-being and its trends over time. While the present data are insufficient to provide definitive evaluation, it is quite possible that the divergence of material and more humanistic forms of well-being noted in the preceding is in large part due to the declining religiosity of more economically advanced nations. We may need a reconsideration of spiritual pathways to well-being.

The strengths of the GFS are many and include nationally representative samples; broad cultural, geographical and non-Western coverage; large sample sizes; and indicators of numerous well-being and other outcomes along with their determinants. While there are other important multi-country international datasets that are already available (for example, GWP, World Values Survey, International Social Survey Program), the GFS has the advantage of a much wider breadth of well-being constructs and (starting with Wave 2) a longitudinal panel data structure.

The GFS and the analyses presented in this Article, however, undoubtedly also have limitations. While the GFS has a broad range of constructs and indicators and broad geographical coverage, many of the constructs are assessed with a single indicator. Although resulting issues of power are partially offset by large sample sizes, this does not mitigate concerns about validity and conceptual breadth for any given construct. The single indicators were selected on the basis of previous work on longitudinal predictive power and strong correlations with other indicators within a scale21, but this does not entirely resolve the concerns. The assessments are also based on self-report survey responses and may be subject to self-report biases and mode effects, which we also comment on in the following. Moreover, such insights principally concern subjective rather than objective aspects of flourishing.

It should also be noted that while the samples within each country were constructed to be approximately nationally representative, the countries themselves do not constitute a random sample of all countries. Rather, as noted, the countries were selected to (1) maximize coverage of the world's population, (2) ensure geographic, cultural and religious diversity and (3) prioritize feasibility and existing data collection infrastructure. The countries do come from all six populated continents and constitute nearly half of the world's population (with mainland China included in the second wave of the study, nearly two-thirds). However, no low-income countries are represented, although lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries are. Results may of course differ in other countries, perhaps especially those with higher levels of conflict or adversity. The meta-analytic means should thus be interpreted in the context of the 22 countries in the study, and these may be higher than global means. Thus, for example, using 2023 GWP data, the mean life evaluation across the 22 GFS countries is 5.91 (95% CI: 5.49, 6.33) whereas the mean across all 142 GWP countries is 5.60 (95% CI: 5.41, 5.78); and further mean differences comparing GWP and GFS may arise due to seasonality and mode effects21. Conclusions here should thus be restricted to the 22 GFS countries. The variation of results across countries also makes clear that extrapolation to other countries may be unwarranted. Nevertheless, as noted, some of the patterns appear to be universal across the 22 countries, and for these one might speculate that they may hold more generally, although this is not guaranteed.

With regard to limitations of the analyses presented in this Article, caution is needed in interpreting cross-national differences as these may be influenced by matters of translation75,76, different modes of assessment, differing interpretation of items and of response scales, and seasonal effects arising from data being collected in different countries at different times of the year. Table 5 should thus be interpreted as simply providing ordered means across what are somewhat differentially interpreted items, not as ‘rankings.' In addition, the demographic analyses are purely descriptive and should not be interpreted causally. The childhood predictors analyses constitute a synthetic longitudinal study and may provide some evidence for causality but should be interpreted cautiously. The childhood predictors assessments are retrospective and may be subject to recall bias. Nevertheless, for recall bias to completely explain away the observed associations would require that the effect of adult well-being on biasing retrospective assessments of the childhood predictors would essentially have to be at least as strong as the observed associations themselves93, and some of these were quite substantial. The childhood predictors analyses may also be subjected to unmeasured confounding, although these concerns were at least partially addressed through the E-value sensitivity analyses, and in some cases the associations were found to be quite robust. We did not regress current flourishing outcomes contemporaneously on all demographic factors as such analyses would have been purely cross-sectional and yet weaker in terms of capacity for providing causal evidence94. However, future waves of data will give further insight into potential causal relationships concerning well-being and its various potential determinants.

The GFS, and these initial results, help provide foundational knowledge for the promotion of societal flourishing. Understanding the distribution of flourishing across the globe, and by demographic group, helps us to understand who needs help, and in what ways. It allows us to identify the groups toward whom interventions or policies might be targeted to improve well-being. Our analyses likewise give insight into how childhood experiences shape well-being, which may be of interest both descriptively and in future intervention and policy development aimed at preventing adverse childhood experiences that impede adult flourishing. One cannot, however, erase the past, and the analyses here also suggest that sometimes adversity can give rise to greater resilience and can be a pathway for growth. Understanding under what circumstances this can and does take place and how it might be facilitated, and its limits, will be an important direction for future research.

The results also raise important questions for the future progress of society. Are we sufficiently investing in the future given the notable flourishing–age gradient, with the youngest groups often faring the most poorly? Can we carry out economic development in ways that do not compromise meaning and purpose and relationships and character, given that many economically developed nations are not faring as well on these measures? With economic development and secularization, have we sometimes been neglecting, or even suppressing, powerful spiritual pathways to flourishing? The very word ‘flourishing' can arguably be used either as an abstract noun to indicate a state (as per the composite flourishing index) or to suggest a dynamic process of growth95. How can each nation grow and flourish? If society is to ultimately pursue flourishing, these questions of age, and of economic development, and of spiritual dynamics need to be taken into consideration.

More remains to be done both to understand and to respond to these questions and challenges. The GFS is an open-access data resource available through the Center for Open Science. In addition to our analyses, we hope many others will access the data and contribute other important insights, insights that might advance our knowledge of and capacity to promote human flourishing. What we measure shapes what we discuss, what we know, what we aim for and the policies put in place to achieve those aims. We hope that the GFS itself, and the understandings that arise from it, will shift discussion and policy toward the promotion of flourishing.

We will first describe the methodology for the questionnaire development; then the measures, data collection, and sampling; and finally the analytic methods used both for descriptive statistics and for assessing associations of flourishing with childhood experiences assessed retrospectively.

Development of the questionnaire for the GFS took place over eight distinct phases: (1) selection of core well-being, religion and demographic questions; (2) solicitation of further well-being, social, political, psychological, economic, community and health questions from domain experts (for example, gratitude, social connection, etc.) worldwide; (3) feedback and questionnaire refinement from scholars around the world representing numerous academic disciplines on survey questions and structure; (4) input and questionnaire refinement from experts in multicultural survey research and survey translations; (5) feedback and questionnaire refinement from an open invitation to comment on the survey, posted publicly and sent to numerous listservs, with input from over 150 scholars; (6) further questionnaire refinement via input from Gallup's survey design specialists; (7) adaptation of items from an interviewer-administered to a self-administered survey instrument using best practices for web survey design to minimize item non response, illogical responses and incomplete responses; and (8) translation into other languages and subsequent confirmation by scholars in several participating countries that translations accurately captured the intended meaning of each question. This was then followed by piloting and cognitive interviews in all of the participating countries and subsequent introduction of retrospective childhood experience questions when it became clear that the intake and annual survey were to be separated in settings not administered by web. During the translation process, Gallup adhered to the TRAPD model (translation, review, adjudication, pretesting and documentation) for cross-cultural survey research96. See refs. 20,21 for more detailed information on the questionnaire development and the refinement of the survey, and survey items, at each stage.

Wave 1 of the GFS data included the following countries and territories: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of China), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States (Fig. 1). The countries were selected to (1) maximize coverage of the world's population, (2) ensure geographic, cultural and religious diversity and (3) prioritize feasibility and existing data collection infrastructure. Data collection was carried out by Gallup Inc. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Gallup and of Baylor University. Gallup secures in-country institutional review boards in countries where local authorities request one. Data for Wave 1 were collected principally during 2023, with some countries beginning data collection in late 2022 and exact dates varying by country97.

Four additional waves of panel data on the participants will be collected annually from 2024 to 2027. Data from Hong Kong (S.A.R. of China) are available in the first wave of data collection. Data from mainland China were not included in the first data release due to fieldwork delays. The first wave of fieldwork in mainland China began in February 2024, with a second wave in November–December 2024. All Wave 1 and 2 data from mainland China are part of the April 2025 dataset release. The precise sampling design to ensure nationally representative samples varied by country, and further details are available in refs. 97,98. Survey items included aspects of well-being such as happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships and financial stability5, along with other demographic, social, economic, political, religious, personality, childhood, community, health and well-being variables. Data were also collected concerning retrospective assessments of childhood experiences. The data are freely available to all through the Center for Open Science99, upon submission of a pre-registration.

The study population consisted of 202,898 adults: ages 18–24 years (n = 27,007 (13%)); 25–29 years (n = 20,700 (10%)); 30–39 years (n = 40,256 (20%)); 40–49 years (n = 34,464 (17%)); 50–59 years (n = 31,793 (16%)); 60–69 years (n = 27,763 (14%)); 70–79 years (n = 16,776 (8.3%)); 80 or older (n = 4,119 (2.0%)); missing (n = 20 (<0.1%)). Of these adults, 98,411 (49%) were male, 103,488 (51%) were female, and 602 (0.3%) indicated other. Data on gender were missing from 397 (0.2%). All participants provided informed consent to participate. Participants were generally compensated US$3–$6 depending on the country.

Continuous age was classified as 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 or 80 or older. Gender was assessed as male, female or other. Marital status was assessed as single/never married, married, separated, divorced, widowed or domestic partner. Employment was assessed as employed, self-employed, retired, student, homemaker, unemployed and searching, or other. Education was assessed as up to 8 years, 9–15 years or 16+ years. Religious service attendance was assessed as more than once per week, once per week, one to three times per month, a few times per year or never. Immigration status was dichotomously assessed with: ‘Were you born in this country, or not?' Religious tradition/affiliation was captured with the categories of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/Animist/Folk religion, Spiritism, African-Derived, some other religion, and no religion/atheist/agnostic; precise response categories varied by country76. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in some, but not all, countries, with response categories varying by country.

Relationship with mother during childhood was assessed with the question: ‘Please think about your relationship with your mother when you were growing up. In general, would you say that relationship was very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, or very bad?' Responses were dichotomized to very/somewhat good versus very/somewhat bad. An analogous variable was used for relationship with father. ‘Does not apply' was treated as a dichotomous control variable for respondents who did not have a mother or father due to death or absence. Parental marital status during childhood was assessed with responses of married, divorced, never married, and one or both had died. Financial status was measured with: ‘Which one of these phrases comes closest to your own feelings about your family's household income when you were growing up, such as when YOU were around 12 years old?' Responses were lived comfortably, got by, found it difficult and found it very difficult. Abuse was assessed with yes/no responses to ‘Were you ever physically or sexually abused when you were growing up?' Participants were separately asked: ‘When you were growing up, did you feel like an outsider in your family?' Childhood health was assessed by: ‘In general, how was your health when you were growing up? Was it excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?' Immigration status was assessed with: ‘Were you born in this country, or not?' Religious service attendance during childhood was assessed with: ‘How often did YOU attend religious services or worship at a temple, mosque, shrine, church or other religious building when YOU were around 12 years old?' with responses of at least once per week, one to three times per month, less than once per month or never. For additional details on the assessments, see the GFS codebook (https://osf.io/cg76b) or ref. 20.

The primary outcome measure in this Article concerns a composite index for individual aspects of flourishing5 using two self-report questions in each of six domains: happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, and financial and material stability (Table 2). The composite flourishing index is simply a mean of the individual indicators and should be understood as nothing beyond the average of each of the more meaningful domain scores5. This is an index—not a scale—and aggregates across a number of disparate aspects of well-being. There is a somewhat arbitrary nature to an index insofar as one could always include more, or fewer, or different items, but ideally a suitable well-being index would have considerable conceptual breadth across numerous domains100. This particular assessment has received considerable empirical validation in cross-cultural research101,102,103,104. Other papers in the special collection focus on specific aspects of well-being or its determinants, including numerous questions that are not included in the 12-item composite. Brief comment is made on the results of these and on when the patterns differ from that of composite flourishing to provide a more comprehensive description of the results. While the flourishing index assesses various individual aspects of flourishing, comment is also made in the following, and in the other papers in the special collection on more community-oriented aspects of flourishing. Also reported in the Supplementary Information are similar analyses to those in the tables but carried out using only the first five domains (excluding financial and material stability) as financial resources are often considered an important determinant of flourishing, rather than a constitutive part of flourishing.

Descriptive statistics for the full sample, weighted to be nationally representative within each country, were estimated for each of the demographic variables. Nationally representative means for the flourishing index were estimated separately for each country and ordered from highest to lowest along with 95% confidence intervals, standard deviations, Gini coefficients (for assessing inequality in the population distribution of flourishing) and alpha reliability coefficients. Variation in means for the flourishing index across demographic categories were estimated, with all analyses initially conducted by country (Supplementary Tables S1–S22). Primary results in the tables consisted of a random effects meta-analyses105,106,107 of country-specific flourishing means in each specific demographic category along with 95% confidence intervals, standard errors, lower and upper limits of a 95% prediction interval across countries, heterogeneity (τ) and I2 for evidence concerning variation of flourishing means within a particular demographic variable across countries108. Meta-analysis was employed over hierarchical modeling so as not to presume measurement invariance107,109. Forest plots of estimates are available in the Supplementary Information (parts 2–4). All meta-analyses were conducted in R110 using the metafor package111. Within each country, a global test of variation of outcome across levels of each demographic variable was conducted, and a pooled P value112 across countries reported concerning evidence for variation within any country. Bonferroni corrected P-value thresholds are provided on the basis of the number of demographic variables113,114. Religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity were used, when available, as control variables within country, and associations by country are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S29 but are not meta-analyzed since the availability of these response categories varied by country. See ref. 107 for more extensive description on the analytic methodology for the demographic analyses for this Article and other papers in the special collection.

Descriptive statistics for the observed sample, weighted to be nationally representative within country, were estimated for each childhood demographic category. A weighted linear regression model with complex survey adjusted standard errors was fit within each country of composite flourishing on all of the aforementioned childhood predictor variables simultaneously. In the primary analyses, random effects meta-analyses of the regression coefficients105,106,109 along with confidence intervals, estimated proportions of effects across countries with effect sizes larger than 0.1 or below −0.1, heterogeneity (τ) and I2 for evidence concerning effect size variation within a given predictor category across countries are given108. Forest plots of estimates are available in the Supplementary Information (part 4). Religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity were used within country as control variables, when available, but these coefficients themselves were not included in the meta-analyses since categories/responses varied by country. Within each country, a global test of association of each childhood predictor variable group with outcome was conducted, and a pooled P value112 across countries was reported concerning evidence for association within any country. Bonferroni corrected P-value thresholds are provided on the basis of the number of childhood predictor variables113,114. For each childhood predictor, we calculated E-values to evaluate the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding. An E-value is the minimum strength of the association an unmeasured confounder must have with both the outcome and the predictor, above and beyond all measured covariates, for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an association35. See ref. 109 for a more extensive description on the analytic methodology for the childhood predictor analyses for this Article and other papers in the special collection.

As supplementary analyses, population weighted meta-analyses, using 2023 population sizes, were also conducted.

Missing data on all variables were imputed using multivariate imputation by chained equations, and five imputed datasets were used115,116,117,118. To account for variation in the assessment of certain variables across countries (for example, religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity), the imputation process was conducted separately in each country. This within-country imputation approach ensured that the imputation models accurately reflected country-specific contexts and assessment methods. Sampling weights were included in the imputation models to account for specific-variable missingness that may have been related to probability of inclusion in the study.

The GFS used different sampling schemes across countries based on availability of existing panels and recruitment needs97. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design components by including weights, primary sampling units and strata. Additional methodological detail, including accounting for the complex sampling design, is provided elsewhere97,98.

All analyses were pre-registered with the Center for Open Science (https://osf.io/registries/gfs) before data access; all code to reproduce analyses are openly available in an online repository119.

Metrics details

Oncogenic mutations are widespread in normal human tissues1. Similarly, in murine chimeras, cells carrying an oncogenic lesion contribute normal cells to adult tissues without causing cancer2,3,4. How lineages that escape cancer via normal development differ from the minority that succumb is unclear. Tumours exhibit characteristic cancer hallmarks; we therefore searched for hallmarks that differentiate cancer-prone lineages from resistant lineages. Here we show that total cell cycle duration (Tc) predicts transformation susceptibility across multiple tumour types. Cancer-prone Rb- and p107-deficient retina (Rb is also known as Rb1 and p107 is also known as Rbl1) exhibited defects in apoptosis, senescence, immune surveillance, angiogenesis, DNA repair, polarity and proliferation. Perturbing the SKP2–p27–CDK2/CDK1 axis could block cancer without affecting these hallmarks. Thus, cancer requires more than the presence of its hallmarks. Notably, every tumour-suppressive mutation that we tested increased Tc, and the Tc of the cell of origin of retinoblastoma cells was half that of resistant lineages. Tc also differentiated the cell of origin in Rb−/− pituitary cancer. In lung, loss of Rb and p53 (also known as Trp53) transforms neuroendocrine cells, whereas KrasG12D or BrafV600E mutations transform alveolar type 2 cells5,6,7. The shortest Tc consistently identified the cell of origin, regardless of mutation timing. Thus, relative Tc is a hallmark of initiation that distinguishes cancer-prone from cancer-resistant lineages in several settings, explaining how mutated cells escape transformation without inducing apoptosis, senescence or immune surveillance.

Cancers are initiated with distinct genetic alterations, which indicates that they constitute context-specific responses. Loss of Ptch1 or Ctnnb (also known as Ctnnb1) triggers medulloblastoma from distinct cells of origin, and activated Kras mutations induce ectopic division in many lung epithelial cell types but transforms primarily alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes7,8. The reason for lineage-specific cancer susceptibility is usually obscure. Cell death can underlie cancer resistance9, but humans carry millions of normal cells with oncogenic mutations1, indicating that there is an ‘escape mechanism' whereby most of these cells do not develop into tumours. The Rb tumour suppressor gene is a well known example. Systemic Rb loss causes extensive, cell-autonomous ectopic mitoses in multiple mouse embryonic tissues10,11. In chimeras generated by injecting Rb−/− embryonic stem (ES) cells into wild-type blastocysts, mutant cells contribute half of nearly all adult tissues, yet all organs except the pituitary remain tumour-free2,3. Thus, normal development—and not cell death, senescence or immune clearance—is the escape mechanism for trillions of Rb−/− cells. Similarly, ectopic division—but not cancer—is common in tissue-specific Rb-knockout mice, and removing the Rb relatives p107 and p130 (also known as Rbl2) increases tumorigenesis, but most cell types remain resistant12,13,14. Indeed, cancer-free cell survival with normal development is the typical response to oncogenic insults (for example, in refs. 4,7). Insight into this mechanism of cancer resistance could reveal new preventative and therapeutic strategies.

Established tumours share cancer hallmarks15. We sought to uncover a hallmark that distinguishes cancer-prone and cancer-resistant lineages that survive oncogenic events. Starting with retinoblastoma, we blocked tumorigenesis and assessed effects on cancer hallmarks, reasoning that features that are always altered by tumour suppression might also predict cancer susceptibility. One hallmark, total cell cycle duration (Tc), fulfilled these criteria.

The mouse retina, similar to most human tissues, resists transformation upon Rb loss. Co-deleting Rb-related genes can cause cancer, but this only occurs in specific lineages16,17,18. In the Rb−/−;p107−/− retina, all seven differentiating cell types divide ectopically, and whereas four undergo apoptosis, three survive16. Horizontal and Müller cells eventually exit the cell cycle, resisting cancer, whereas tumours arise from the amacrine lineage16. Tumours become evident microscopically at postnatal day 8 (P8)16, and are visible macroscopically after around 100 days (Fig. 1a).

Consistent with RB controlling multiple cancer hallmarks (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census-page/RB) the Rb−/−;p107−/− retina exhibits ectopic division, cell-specific apoptosis resistance, altered differentiation, DNA damage, disrupted polarity, aberrant angiogenesis and absence of senescence or immune surveillance16,17,19,20,21. We searched for interventions that suppress tumorigenesis, and then for altered hallmarks that always accompany tumour suppression. We then investigated whether such hallmarks distinguish the cancer-prone lineage from cancer-resistant lineages. We focused first on SKP2, part of the SKP1–cullin–F-box complex (SCFSKP2) that ubiquitylates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p27 (encoded by Cdkn1b, also known as p27), targeting them for degradation, as the SKP2–p27–CDK axis is linked to Rb−/− cancer22,23. As shown below, we observed unexpected differences in the effect of Skp2 homozygosity or heterozygosity on cancer hallmarks. We thus further interrogated this axis by manipulating p27 or CDKs. SKP2, p27 and CDKs regulate proliferation and many other processes. Thus, SKP2-mediated ubiquitylation regulates DNA repair, autophagy, apoptosis, adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition, and E3 ligase-independent SKP2 functions affect genes associated with transcription, apoptosis and migration24. p27, independently of CDKs, regulates stemness, migration and microtubules25. CDK2 and CDK1 regulate differentiation and epigenetics26,27 and CDK1 also regulates apoptosis, Golgi, nuclear–cytosolic transport and vesicle transport28. Given this broad repertoire, we expected that tumour suppression would alter multiple cancer hallmarks.

To assess SKP2, we crossed α-cre;Rbf/f;p107−/−;Skp2+/− mice. The α-cre transgene targets the embryonic peripheral retina, and 45% (37 out of 78) of eyes of α-cre;Rbf/f;p107−/− (hereafter referred to as DKO) mice developed tumours16 (Fig. 1a). Deleting two (DKO-Skp2−/−, 0 out of 44 eyes developed tumours) or one (DKO-Skp2+/−, 0 out of 40 eyes developed tumours) Skp2 allele blocked tumorigenesis (Fig. 1a). Heterozygosity reduced the amount of SKP2 protein by nearly twofold (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and increased the amount of p27 protein in total lysate by around 1.4-fold; immunofluorescence revealed an 18-fold increase in the fraction of p27+ amacrine cells, the cell of origin of the tumours (5.4% in DKO mice versus 90% in DKO-Skp2+/− mice) (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d).

To assess p27, we utilized two knock-in alleles. The product of the p27CK− allele cannot bind CDK2–cyclin, and DKO-Skp2+/−;p27CK−/CK− tissue developed retinoblastoma quickly (Fig. 1b). Thus, preventing p27 binding to CDK2–cyclin binding overrides the protective effect of Skp2 heterozygosity. p27T187A (hereafter p27KI) prevents recognition of SCFSKP2. We observed some increase in total p27 in DKO-p27KI/+ or DKO-p27KI/KI contexts, similar to that seen in DKO-Skp2+/− retina but less than in DKO-Skp2−/− retina (Extended Data Fig. 1b), but p27KI increased the number of p27-positive amacrine cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). One copy blocked retinoblastoma development (0 out of 40 eyes developed tumours), phenocopying Skp2 heterozygosity (Fig. 1a,b). Thus, SKP2 inactivation of p27 is critical for retinoblastoma development.

CDK2 activity correlates with retinoblastoma susceptibility23. We also assessed CDK1, as it compensates for CDK2 (refs. 29,30,31). We targeted both Cdk2 alleles and/or one allele of Cdk1, which is essential for cell division32. Cdk2 deletion reduced tumorigenesis, although to a lower extent than Skp2 heterozygosity, suggesting partial redundancy, and although Cdk1 heterozygosity had no effect, tumorigenesis was almost completely suppressed in Cdk1+/−;Cdk2−/− retinas (Fig. 1c).

Leveraging these six tumour-suppressing manipulations (Skp2−/−, Skp2+/−, p27KI/+, p27KI/KI, Cdk2−/− and Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/−) we searched for consistently affected cancer hallmarks. Tumours in the DKO model emerge microscopically at around P8—many cancer hallmarks are evident at this stage, and whereas cancer-prone amacrine and cancer-resistant horizontal and Müller cells all undergo ectopic division during this window, the cancer-resistant horizontal and Müller cells gradually stop dividing such that by around P30 only tumours derived from amacrine cells continue to proliferate16. Thus, we focused on P4–P21 to assess how tumour suppression affects cancer hallmarks.

First, we assessed whether tumour suppression increased cell death, senescence or immune infiltration (Fig. 1d–i and Extended Data Fig. 1e–i). In DKO retina, all differentiating lineages divide ectopically, and amacrine, horizontal and Müller cells resist apoptosis, whereas the other lineages undergo E2F-driven apoptosis19,33. p107−/− mice served as controls16. Ectopic division thickens the DKO retina by P8 and P10, but apoptosis of the four death-prone cell types reduces its thickness by P21 (ref. 16) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). At P8, P10 and P21, the DKO-Skp2−/− retina was much thinner, yet surprisingly, cancer-resistant DKO-Skp2+/− retina did not differ from cancer-prone DKO retina at any time point (Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Skp2 loss can promote Rb−/− cell apoptosis22; increased death might therefore explain why Skp2 deletion suppresses retinoblastoma. Horizontal cells (marked by ONECUT2 expression) did not vary between control, DKO, DKO-Skp2+/− and DKO-Skp2−/− retinas at P10 or P21, and Müller glia (marked by SOX9) were increased in DKO versus control retinas and further increased with heterozygous or homozygous Skp2 loss (Fig. 1d). Heterozygous or homozygous Skp2 loss reduced the number of amacrine cells (marked by AP2A) in the DKO versus control retinas (Fig. 1d), but immunostaining or western blot of active cleaved caspase-3 revealed that, DKO, DKO-Skp2+/− and DKO-Skp2−/− retinas exhibited similar proportions of dying cells at P4, P8, P10 or P21, which were even reduced in P8 and P10 DKO-Skp2−/− retina (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1g). The percentage of AP2A+ cleaved caspase-3-positive cells among all AP2A+ amacrine cells was also invariant between DKO, DKO-Skp2+/− and DKO-Skp2−/− retinas at P4 or P8 (Fig. 1f). Similarly, total or amacrine cell apoptosis was not increased in the DKO-p27KI/+, DKO-p27KI/KI, DKO-Cdk2−/− or DKO-Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/− retinas (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Thus, increased cell death does not explain the tumour-suppressive effect of manipulating the SKP2–p27–CDK axis.

Skp2 loss can drive senescence34, but at P4 and P8, all genotypes exhibited only background senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, and whereas the DKO-Skp2−/− or DKO-p27KI/KI retina became senescent by P10, with senescence persisting at P21 and beyond, other genotypes that suppress tumorigenesis (Skp2+/−, p27KI, Cdk2−/− and Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/−) did not induce senescence (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1h).

Next, we assessed immune infiltrate. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of dissociated tumour-prone DKO and tumour-resistant DKO-Skp2+/− retina revealed negligible levels of B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages/microglia and leukocytes (Fig. 1h). Quantification of galectin 3 (GAL3)-expressing microglia also revealed no inflammatory response in tumour-prone retina, which was unchanged in the six genotypes that suppressed tumorigenesis (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1i). Thus, tumour suppression could occur independently of increased death, senescence or immune infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 2).

SKP2 can promote DNA repair35, but the proportion of γH2AX+ cells was unaltered in Skp2−/− and Skp2+/− retina (Fig. 2a,b). Similarly, p27KI, p27KI/KI, Cdk2−/− or Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/− mutations did not ameliorate DNA damage (Fig. 2a,b). Tumour suppression also did not alter DNA damage in the cell of origin (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Source data

In postnatal retina, blood vessels invade from the tissue surface around P7 to form intra-retinal vessels, but because Rb loss kills O2-requiring neurons, the Rb−/− retina lacks intra-retinal (deep vascular plexus (DVP)) vessels, whereas superficial vascular plexus remains unaffected20. The DVP is also absent in Rb−/−;p107−/− retina21 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). None of the six cancer-suppressing manipulations resulted in improved DVP (Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b).

Apical polarity is disrupted in the DKO retina36. In embryonic retina, each apical cell membrane has a ring of adherens junctions linked by filamentous actin (F-actin). In cross-sections, they appear as a continuous line (the outer limiting membrane) that separates apical and basolateral domains. This outer limiting membrane was intact in cancer-resistant Rb−/− retina but disrupted in cancer-prone Rb−/−;p107−/− retina (Fig. 2f). A second inverted retina formed at the back of the eye, with CRX+ photoreceptors on the inner surface and calretinin+ (encoded by Calb2) amacrine cells on the outer surface (Fig. 2f). By P8 the dual retinas fused and resolved into amacrine rosettes (Fig. 2f). In DKO whole mounts, abnormal F-actin staining was apparent in the peripheral α-Cre-expressing retina; we therefore quantified the abnormal tissue area (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We used p107−/− retina as a control (Fig. 2g), as it retained the polarity seen in wild-type or Rb−/− retina (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The polarity defects seen in the DKO retina were almost completely rescued in DKO-Skp2−/− retina (Fig. 2g,h)—this was supported by cross-sections stained for atypical PKCλ/ι and N-cadherin (Extended Data Fig. 3d). By contrast, none of the other five tumour-suppressing genotypes that we tested rescued polarity defects (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Skp2−/− may rescue polarity by inhibiting CDK to levels below that obtained with p27KI, and indeed Skp2 loss induced more p27 than p27KI (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Nonetheless, the results show that RB and p107 maintain, whereas SKP2 disrupts, apical polarity. More importantly, multiple genetic manipulations suppress tumorigenesis without correcting apical polarity (Extended Data Fig. 2). Notably, our data demonstrate that cancer-prone and cancer-resistant tissue can exhibit the same set of cancer hallmarks. Thus, a cancer initiation hallmark must exist that is more sensitive to Skp–p27–Cdk mutations than survival, senescence, immune infiltration, DNA repair, angiogenesis or apical polarity.

The proportion of AP2A+ amacrine cells was reduced, without increased cell death, in tumour-resistant genotypes (Fig. 1d–f), implicating altered differentiation or division. We used multiple approaches to assess these hallmarks. First, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) we compared P8 tumour-prone DKO retina with cancer-free DKO-Skp2+/− retina. Tumour growth begins around this time, progenitors (usually the only dividing cells) are almost depleted, their death-prone differentiating descendants are either gone (ganglion cells) or depleted (bipolar cells and photoreceptors), and there is extensive ectopic division among surviving amacrine and Müller cells, and horizontal cells make up only around 0.2% of wild-type retina and less than 4% of the tumour-prone retina16. We obtained scRNA-seq data for 3,621 DKO cells with 52,983 mapped reads per cell and 2,200 genes per cell, and 5,196 DKO-Skp+/− cells with 31,520 reads per cell and 1,873 genes per cell. Genotype did not affect rare astrocytes or immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a), confirming prior analyses (Fig. 1h,i and Extended Data Fig. 1i). Initial analysis using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) generated clusters biased by cell cycle phase, which we regressed out to focus on lineage, generating 13 clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4b–f), which were consolidated (Extended Data Fig. 4g–i and Supplementary Table 1) into 7 annotated clusters (Fig. 3a). Top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) included known markers such as Apoe (marker for Müller glia (Mu cluster)), Rom1 (photoreceptors (PR)), Ebf1 (amacrine precursors (AmP)), Pcsk1n (mature amacrine cells (AmM)), Fbxo5 (rare remaining mitotic progenitors (ProgM)), Isl1 (bipolar cells (BiP)) and Otx2, Neurod1 and Neurod4 (neurogenic (Neu)) (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4g, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods). Genotype barely affected BiP, Mu, Neu, PR and ProgM clusters but, matching AP2A staining (Fig. 1d), tumour-free DKO-Skp2+/− retina had 1.7× fewer AmM cells and 1.4× fewer AmP cells (Fig. 3c). Seurat cell cycle phase classification revealed that tumour suppression reduced the number of AmP cluster cells in S and G2/M phase twofold, with smaller effects in other clusters (Fig. 3d). Differential expression analysis revealed induction of cell cycle genes in tumour-prone AmP and, to a lesser extent, Mu and Neu clusters (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Hypergeometric analysis revealed enrichment of Cdk2 (ref. 37) as well as G2/M and S phase signature genes in DKO AmP, Mu and Neu clusters (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Tables 3 and 5). These data implicate cell cycle rather than lineage in tumour suppression.

Data are mean ± s.d. (n = 3 mice per group).

Source data

To further examine whether Skp2+/− affects Rb−/−;p107−/− cell lineage we performed retroviral clonal analyses. We interbred Rbf/f;p107−/−;Skp2+/− mice, injected P0 pups subretinally with low-titre Cre–GFP retrovirus to knockout Rb and mark progenitors, and then scored cell types in GFP+ clones at P21. P0 progenitors generate rods, Müller glia, and bipolar and amacrine cells. The proportion of clones with at least one of these cell types would change if there was a lineage effect, but the proportion of DKO and DKO-Skp2+/− clones with these cell types were identical (Fig. 3g). Thus, scRNA-seq and clonal analyses indicate that Skp2 heterozygosity does not alter lineage.

To further interrogate the cell cycle, we assessed Ki67 index at P4, P8, P10 and P21. This marker for dividing cells disappears within a day in newborn post-mitotic differentiating retinal neurons38, but remains in ectopically dividing differentiating Rb−/− cells16,23. Most DKO cells gradually stop dividing within 1–2 months of birth16. Skp2 status had no effect at P4, P8 or P10, whereas at P21 the Ki67 index was 19% in DKO retina but negligible in DKO-Skp2−/− tissue (Fig. 4a). However, Skp2+/−, p27KI, p27KI/KI, Cdk2−/− or Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/− mutations did not affect proliferation index at any time (Fig. 4a). We also assessed proliferation index with ten different markers (Extended Data Fig. 5a) that label various clusters (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Relative to DKO, Skp2 loss affected two out of the ten populations, but the other five tumour-suppressive genotypes had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Thus, perturbations of the SKP2–p27–CDK axis can prevent cancer initiation without altering the proportion of dividing cells.

Proliferation index does not reflect cell cycle duration, and a 30-min pulse of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) at P8 revealed that tumour-suppressing mutations reduce the proportion of cells in S phase (Fig. 4b). Fewer S phase cells could reflect increased duration of other phases or shortening of S phase, increasing or decreasing the duration of the cell cycle duration, respectively. To quantify Tc or S phase duration (Ts), we used staggered 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)–BrdU double labelling39. P8 mice were first pulsed with EdU and then with BrdU 2.5 h later, and sections were stained for these markers plus Ki67 to calculate Tc and Ts (Supplementary Figs. 3 and  4a). The six tumour-suppressing genotypes had little effect on Ts, but increased average Tc in the DKO tissue from 41 h to 62 h (Skp2+/−), 107 h (Skp2−/−), 69 h (p27KI/+), 81 h (p27KI/KI), 53 h (Cdk2−/−) or 60 h (Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/−) (Fig. 4c).

As all tumour-suppressing mutations increased the duration of the cell cycle, we explored whether the cell of origin had a distinct Tc. We applied quadruple labelling using EdU, BrdU, Ki67 and cell-type markers to compare Tc and Ts in cancer-prone AP2A+ amacrine cells versus cancer-resistant SOX9+ Müller or ONECUT2+ horizontal cells (Supplementary Figs. 3c and  4b–d). Notably, Tc of DKO amacrine cells was only 26 h, compared with 143 h for Müller cells and 77 h for horizontal cells, whereas Ts was similar for all cell types (Fig. 4d). Thus, the cell of origin divides faster than cancer-resistant cell types. Moreover, Tc of Skp2−/−, Skp2+/−, p27KI/+, p27KI/KI, Cdk2−/− and Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/− DKO amacrine cells was 109 h, 43 h, 41 h, 46 h, 33 h and 39 h, respectively, compared with 26 h for DKO amacrine cells (Fig. 4d). Notably, the reduced effect of CDK loss parallels its weaker tumour-suppressive effects (Fig. 1c). We further measured cell cycle duration in AmP cells expressing PTF1A, which drives the amacrine lineage upstream of AP2A40. Tc in DKO PTF1A+ cells was 28.3 h, compared with 44.4 h, 60.9 h, 44.2 h, 44.2 h, 41.1 h and 42.4 h in Skp2+/−, Skp2−/−, p27KI/+, p27KI/KI, Cdk2−/−, and Cdk2−/−;Cdk1+/− DKO PTF1A+ cells, respectively, and only Skp2−/− affected Ts (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Other populations, such as those expressing p21 or MYCN that primarily mark Neu cells, did not show a consistent increase in Tc with tumour-suppressing mutations (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d). Thus, tumour suppression always affects Tc of the cell of origin, and the cell of origin has the shortest Tc (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Relative Tc may only distinguish the cell of origin for retinoblastoma. To assess the generality of this effect, we surveyed additional cancer models. In Rb+/− pituitary, 100% of mice develop Rb−/− intermediate lobe cancer but only around 20% develop anterior lobe tumours41. To assess Tc, we injected creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f mice with tamoxifen at four or eight weeks of age, then two weeks later applied staggered EdU–BrdU labelling and assessed tissue at six and ten weeks of age. LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f mice served as wild-type controls. Nearly all intermediate lobe and anterior lobe creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f cells were positive for tdTomato, and all mice developed intermediate lobe cancer despite ectopic division in both intermediate lobe and anterior lobe (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Proliferation index was higher for intermediate lobe than anterior lobe cells at ten weeks but similar in six-week-old mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a); thus, proliferation index does not reliably predict cancer susceptibility. Pro-opiomelacortin (POMC), which is expressed in all intermediate lobe cells and around 20% of anterior lobe cells, is cleaved to generate adrenocorticotropic hormone in the anterior lobe and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSHα) in the intermediate lobe. MSHα antibodies label both these POMC lineages, which are easily distinguished by intermediate lobe versus anterior lobe locations42 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Deletion of Rb in lineages labelled with anti-MSHα generates intermediate lobe tumours in 100% of cases but no anterior lobe tumours22,43. In 6-week-old mice, Tc of Rb−/− anti-MSHα-labelled cancer-resistant anterior lobe cells was 45 h versus 25 h in cancer-prone intermediate lobe cells, and at 10 weeks, Tc was 96 h in the anterior lobe versus 32 h in the intermediate lobe (Fig. 5a). Ts was also higher in anterior lobe cells (Fig. 5a). Thus, Tc predicts cancer susceptibility in Rb−/− pituitary regardless of whether Rb is deleted at four or eight weeks of age.

a, Tc and Ts of MSHα+ cells in the intermediate (IL) and anterior (AL) pituitary lobes of Rb-null (creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f) mice injected with tamoxifen at 4 or 8 weeks of age and assessed at 6 or 10 weeks of age, respectively. b, Tc and Ts of lung CGRP+ neuroendocrine (NE), SPC+ AT2 and CCSP+ club cells from mice that are deficient in Rb and p53 (hSPC-rtTA;tet-cre;Rbf/f;p53f/f) that were injected with doxycycline (Dox) at plug formation and assessed at E18, and from Rb- and p53-deficient (creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f;p53f/f) mice injected with tamoxifen at 4 weeks of age and assessed at 8 weeks of age. c, Tc and Ts of lung NE, AT2 and club cells of KrasG12D (creERT2;KrasG12D;LSL-tdTomato mice) mice injected with tamoxifen at 4 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks or 10 weeks of age and assessed at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 7 weeks or 13 weeks of age, respectively. d, Tc and Ts of lung NE, AT2 and club cells of BrafCA (creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;BrafCA) mice that were injected with tamoxifen at 4 weeks of age and assessed at 6 weeks of age. Data are mean ± s.d. (n = 6 mice (a, b (right),c,d); n = 4 mice (b (left)) per group as indicated). Exact P values for the comparison between MSHα+ intermediate lobe versus anterior lobe cells (a), NE versus AT2 or club cells (b) or AT2 versus NE or club cells (c,d) by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (b, c (first three graphs),d) or two-tailed unpaired t-test (a,c (right)) are shown.

Source data

Neuroendocrine cells represent less than 0.5% of lung epithelium but aggressively form multiple small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) in all mice after loss of Rb and p53, and despite being orders of magnitude more abundant, lung AT2 and club cells are far less prone to developing into tumours44,45. Multiple Rb−/− lung cells divide ectopically46, so neuroendocrine cells are uniquely highly prone to cancer. To assess Tc in Rb- and p53-deficient lungs, we fed pregnant hSPC-rtTA;tet-cre;Rbf/f;p53f/f mice with doxycycline from plug detection to birth. Endogenous SPC (also known as PSPC) is specifically expressed in AT2 cells, but the transgene expresses rtTA throughout lung epithelium, causing ubiquitous tet-Cre induction and SCLC that is lethal within five to six months46,47. We confirmed SCLC lesions in Rb−/−;p53−/− lung by P60 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Ki67 labelling confirmed ectopic division in embryonic day 18 (E18) neuroendocrine (CGRP+), AT2 (SPC+) or club (CCSP+) cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c), and cancer-prone neuroendocrine cells had the lowest proliferation index (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Despite this, quadruple labelling (examples in Supplementary Fig. 5d) revealed Tc values of 22 h and 42 h in AT2 and club cells, respectively, but only 11 h in cancer-prone neuroendocrine cells (Fig. 5b, left). Thus, relative Tc also predicts cancer susceptibility in Rb−/−;p53−/− lung.

To assess adult lung, we generated creERT2;LSL-tdTomato; Rbf/f;p53f/f mice or control creERT2;LSL-tdTomato littermates. We added tamoxifen at four weeks of age, then performed EdU–BrdU labelling at eight weeks and collected the lung. In total, 50–70% of neuroendocrine, AT2 or club cells were labelled with tdTomato (Extended Data Fig. 7a), Ki67 labelling confirmed ectopic division (Supplementary Fig. 5e), and although proliferation index was 0–3% in tdTomato+ or tdTomato− cells of control mice or in tdTomato− cells of creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;Rbf/f;p53f/f mice, it increased to 11%, 10% or 8% in tdTomato+ Rb- and p53-knockout neuroendocrine, AT2 and club cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Quadruple labelling (Supplementary Fig. 5f) revealed Tc values of 33.8 h, 60.4 h and 71.3 h in neuroendocrine, AT2 and club cells, respectively, whereas S phase durations were similar across these cell types (Fig. 5b, right). Therefore, relative Tc predicts the cancer-prone lung lineage independently of initiation event timing.

Next, to extend these studies beyond Rb mutations, we assessed KRAS, which, similar to RB, regulates many cancer hallmarks (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census-page/KRAS). In contrast to the Rb−/−;p53−/− lung, Kras activation transforms AT2, but not neuroendocrine cells, generating adenocarcinoma6. To assess Tc, we used a Cre-activated KrasG12D allele48. creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;KrasG12D mice or control creERT2;LSL-tdTomato littermates were treated with tamoxifen at four weeks of age, and then two weeks later, EdU–BrdU labelling was applied and the lungs were collected. Nascent tdTomato+ tumours were positive for SPC (AT2 cells) but negative for CGRP (also known as CGRP1) and CCSP (also known as uteroglobin) (Supplementary Fig. 6a) even though 50%–80% of AT2, neuroendocrine and club cells were tdTomato+ (Extended Data Fig. 7b, left). In tamoxifen-treated mice, the proliferation index in tdTomato+ or tdTomato− cells of control mice or tdTomato− cells of creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;KrasG12D mice was 0–5%, but increased to 14%, 20%, and 11% in tdTomato+ KrasG12D-expressing neuroendocrine, AT2 and club cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7b.). Quadruple labelling (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c) revealed Tc values of 21 h, 58 h and 43 h in KrasG12D-expressing AT2, neuroendocrine and club cells, respectively, whereas Ts values in these cells were similar (Fig. 5c, left). Thus, cancer-prone AT2 cells had the shortest relative Tc.

Next, we varied the timing of Kras activation and the incubation period. We activated Kras at 4, 5 or 10 weeks of age and assessed Tc 4, 2 or 3 weeks later, respectively. As before, Cre was efficiently activated (indicated by tdTomato+ expression) and KrasG12D induction at four or five weeks of age triggered ectopic division in neuroendocrine, AT2 and club cells, whereas induction at ten weeks of age caused division of AT2 and club cells, but not neuroendocrine cells (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). Regardless of the timing of Kras activation, Tc was always shortest in cancer-prone AT2 cells (Fig. 5c).

Finally, we tested a different Ras pathway component. KRAS binds and activates the BRAF serine/threonine kinase, and constitutively active BRAF(V600E) (BRAF(CA), encoded by the BrafCA allele) generates adenomas from AT2 cells, but not neuroendocrine or club cells5. We generated creERT2;LSL-tdTomato;BrafCA mice, and following tamoxifen treatment at four weeks of age observed tdTomato+ lesions arising from AT2 (SPC+) cells two weeks later (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Tamoxifen induced tdTomato expression in 50–80% of cells, and ectopic division to similar levels in neuroendocrine, AT2 and club cells in mice with the BrafCA allele (Extended Data Fig. 7f). Quadruple labelling (Supplementary Fig. 7b) revealed a similar Ts across lineages, and Tc was 24.8 h, 59.7 h and 54.8 h in AT2, neuroendocrine and club cells, respectively (Fig. 5d). Thus, regardless of how the Ras pathway is activated in lung, cancer-prone cells exhibit the shortest relative Tc. In summary, among many surviving lineages, the shortest Tc marks the most cancer-prone lineage in all tested cancer models independent of tissue type (retina, pituitary and lung), oncogenic driver (Rb and p107 inactivation, Rb inactivation, Rb and p53 inactivation, Kras activation or Braf activation) or initiation event timing, and for different cancers arising from distinct cells of origin in the same tissue (SCLC in Rb- and p53-deficient neuroendocrine cells and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Kras- or Braf-activated AT2 cells).

Although transformation captures the most attention, oncogenic mutations are harmless in most lineages and are common in cancer-free human tissues1. Chimeric studies provide notable examples of the abundant contribution of ‘initiated' cells to cancer-free adult tissues. Thus, normal development, rather than cell death, senescence or immune clearance, is a widespread, yet poorly understood mechanism of tumour evasion2,3,4. Cancer genes are usually associated with the function to which they were first assigned (for example, cell cycle for Rb, cytoplasmic signal transduction for Ras genes, and development for Wnt1 or Notch1), but affect multiple cancer hallmarks, explaining why they are so commonly mutated. Given the complexity of cancer initiation, it was unclear whether any one hallmark would predict cancer susceptibility in cells that survive oncogenic lesions across multiple cancers. However, we find here that Tc distinguishes cancer-prone from resistant lineages in tumours initiated by different oncogenic events. First, we found that the cell of origin of Rb−/−;p107−/− retinoblastoma has a shorter Tc (26 h) than cancer-resistant lineages (over 77 h). Moreover, mutations that block retinoblastoma increased the Tc of the cell of origin. Notably, weaker tumour-suppressing mutations (such as Cdk2−/−, 33 h) had a less potent effect on Tc than those that completely blocked tumorigenesis (such as Skp2+/−, 45 h). This rule held in cancer-prone lineages in Rb−/− pituitary and Rb−/−;p53−/− lung. Tc also predicted lung cancer susceptibility following Kras or Braf mutation. Studies in pituitary and lung revealed that Tc predicts outcome independently of the timing of the oncogenic event. The lung data are particularly revealing, since despite causing ectopic division in the same lineages, the cells of origin of Rb and Ras pathway cancers are distinct, and Tc was predictive in both circumstances. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which this correlation holds across other tissues and oncogenic events, but our work explains how many cell types escape cancer without deploying senescence, apoptosis or immune surveillance1,2,3,4.

Our study began with suppression of retinoblastoma, which we expected to affect many cancer hallmarks. Indeed, Skp2−/− induced senescence, rescued polarity and decreased proliferation index. However, although Skp2+/− suppressed tumorigenesis with similar potency, it did not affect any of the eight hallmarks assessed. p27KI/KI induced senescence, but did not rescue polarity or affect other hallmarks, and none of the other p27 or Cdk2 or combined Cdk1 and Cdk2 manipulations affected any of the tested hallmarks. Remarkably, cancer could be suppressed without altering cell death, senescence, immune infiltration, DNA damage, angiogenesis, apical polarity, differentiation or proliferation index. It is remarkable that a tissue with so many cancerous defects can resist transformation. Thus, cancer has many hallmarks, but they do not necessarily cause cancer. Tc may need to fall below a critical threshold, which varies with context, to synergize with other cancer hallmarks to enable tumorigenesis.

Our results do not minimize the importance of other hallmarks to initiation: alone, a short Tc is insufficient for tumorigenesis, because normal cells can divide rapidly—for example, Tc in the E6.5–E7.5 mouse embryo is 5–7 h in epiblast and less than 3 h in the proliferative zone49. Our results show that whereas relative Tc reveals cancer susceptibility in one set of circumstances (Rb- and p107-deficient retina, Rb-deficient pituitary, Rb- and p53-deficient lung, Kras-activated lung and Braf-activated lung), it does not predict susceptibility across different initiation events or tissues. For example, the Tc in cancer-prone KrasG12D AT2 cells (21 h) was similar to the Tc in cancer-resistant Rb−/−;p53−/− AT2 cells (22 h). Thus, Tc is prognostic in a single context (one initiation event, one tissue), but not between contexts (different initiation events or tissues). To use a behavioural analogy, Tc resembles a self-control score50: between two groups in different settings that are exposed to a particular stress or temptation (initiation event), absolute score alone could not predict who would lose control, because it also depends on circumstances; however, the score could predict this effect within one group in one setting. The complexity underlying neoplastic transformation underscores the predictive power of Tc across in vivo settings.

When CDK2 activity is reduced upon exit from M phase, cells in G1 cells with the lowest CDK2 activity do not re-enter S phase51; shorter Tc may therefore reflect higher CDK2 activity in this G1 trough. Cells with insufficient CDK2 activity would eventually cease dividing and never form tumours. Notably, CDK2 phosphorylates and inhibits transcription factors that promote differentiation and cell cycle exit27, and CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate epigenetic regulators that influence S phase re-entry52,53. Unlike Tc, Ts did not predict cancer-prone lineages, but future work will delineate whether effects on G1, G2 and/or M phase determine Tc; CDK2 also regulates general transcription through the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, a quarter of CDK2 targets are transcriptional regulators, and a gene expression signature accurately tracks CDK2 activity26,37,54,55,56.

The observation that varying Tc may block cancer initiation suggests it may be possible to reduce cancer incidence in high-risk cohorts with occasional treatments to expand short cell cycles in initiated clones. Indeed, drug-based cell cycle inhibition can reduce retinoblastoma or colon cancer initiation23,57 and a threshold of CDK activity appears to be critical in the early stages of multiple human cancers37. Elegant non-toxic methods exist to inhibit CDKs without perturbing normal division58. Chemoprevention trials have been performed in high-risk groups, especially smokers59,60, and similar trials to increase Tc in initiated cells may promote cell cycle exit, mimicking the beneficial cul-de-sac in ectopically dividing but cancer-resistant lineages.

All animal experiments were performed according to institutional and national guidelines approved by the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics (TCP) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Mice were housed under controlled conditions (specific-pathogen free, 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle, 19–22 °C, 45–65% humidity) with ad libitum access to food and water. We added environmental enrichment in the form of plastic tunnels and nesting material to all the cages. Clinical symptoms define the welfare of animals. That includes visible masses, any degree of reduced mobility/distress, weight loss or evidence of haemorrhage. Humane intervention points are set based on institutional standard operating procedure (SOP) of Humane Intervention Point Guidelines and Cancer Models–Humane Intervention Point Guidelines. In brief, tumour size exceeding 1,700 mm3 in adult mice is considered the endpoint for cancer models. No mouse exceeded the humane endpoints stipulated in our animal SOPs. Both male and female mice were used in the study.

Nakayama, age P0–P400), SPC-rtTA (Whitsett, age E18–P60), TetO-Cre (Whitsettage age E18–P60) and Z/Red (Jackson Laboratory, strain 005438, age E16) mice were maintained on a mixed background. Different genotypes were compared within the same litter and at least four to six litters. We have not noted any phenotypic differences in separate litters. Genotyping was performed as before and per The Jackson Laboratory guidelines using established primers (Supplementary Table 6).

α-cre mice62 were mated with Rbf/f mice63,64 and p107−/− mice65 to generate α-cre; Rbf/f;p107−/− (Rb/p107 DKO) mice, an established retinoblastoma mouse model16. DKO mice were further mated with Skp2−/− (ref. 66), Cdk1f/f (ref. 32), Cdk2f/f (ref. 67), p27CK− (ref. 68) and p27T187A (p27KI)69 mice to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis. Genotypes were determined by PCR using established primers (Supplementary Table 6). p107−/− littermates were used as controls.

SPC-rtTA transgenic mice70 and tet-OCre transgenic mice46,47,71 were mated to Rbf/f mice63,64 and p53f/f mice72, to generate SPC-rtTA;tet-OCre;Rbf/f;p53f/f mice, an established SCLC animal model47. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis using established primers46,73 (Supplementary Table 6). Gestational age was assigned by vaginal plug date designated embryonic day (E) 0.5. A 50× doxycycline stock solution (50 mg ml−1 in 50% ethanol) was freshly prepared prior to each administration of drug and diluted in water or in PBS for injection. Dams were treated with 125 μg doxycycline (Sigma, D9891) in 0.5 ml PBS by intraperitoneal injection on E0.5–E1.5 and administered doxycycline in the drinking water at a final concentration of 1.0 mg ml−1. Doxycycline water was replaced three times per week because of the light sensitivity of doxycycline.

Rosa-creERT2 and Ai14 (tdTomato) transgenic mice were mated to Rbf/f (refs. 63,64) and p53f/f mice72 to generate creERT2;tdTomato;Rbf/f;p53f/f mice, an established SCLC animal model47. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis using established primers46,73 (Supplementary Table 6). creERT2;tdTomato littermate mice were used as control. Both creERT2; tdTomato;Rbf/f;p53f/f mice and control mice were treated with 100 mg kg−1 body weight Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5468) in 0.45 ml corn oil (Sigma, C8267) once by intraperitoneal injection on P28, and the lung was collected 4 weeks later.

Rosa-creERT2 and Ai14 (tdTomato) transgenic mice were mated to Rbf/f mice63,64 to generate creERT2;tdTomato;Rbf/f mice. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis using established primers (Supplementary Table 6). tdTomato;Rbf/f littermate mice were used as control. Both creERT2;tdTomato;Rbf/f mice and control mice were treated with 100 mg kg−1 body weight Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5468) in 0.45 ml corn oil (Sigma, C8267) once by intraperitoneal injection on P28 or P56, and the pituitary was collected 2 weeks later.

Rosa-creERT2 and Ai14 (tdTomato) transgenic mice were mated to LSL-KrasG12D mice to generate creERT2;tdTomato;KrasG12D mice. KrasG12D mice is a well-established NSCLC mouse model48. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis using established primers (Supplementary Table 6). creERT2;tdTomato littermate mice were used as control. To optimize tamoxifen treatment to obtain ectopic division of multiple cell types we treated these mice with 7 doses (0.1, 1, 2.5, 25, 50, 100, 250 mg kg−1 body weight). For 0.1–25 mg kg−1 doses, the overall percent of tdTomato+ cells correlated with dosage but reached a plateau using at higher levels. However, while 0.1–50 mg kg−1 doses induced ectopic division of Spc+ AT2 cells, it did not induce ectopic cell division of Cgrp+ neuroendocrine cells and Ccsp+ club cells, but both 100 and 250 mg kg−1 doses induced ectopic cell division all three cell types. We used the 100 mg kg−1 dose in this study. Both creERT2;tdTomato; KrasG12D mice and control mice were treated once with 100 mg kg−1 body weight Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5468) in 0.45 ml corn oil (Sigma, C8267) by intraperitoneal injection at the indicated age, and lung was collected 2–4 weeks later, as indicated.

Rosa-creERT2 and Ai14 (tdTomato) transgenic mice were mated to BrafCA mice to generate creERT2;tdTomato;BrafCA mice. Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis using established primers (Supplementary Table 6). creERT2;tdTomato littermate mice were used as controls. Both creERT2;tdTomato;BrafCA mice and control mice were treated once with 100 mg kg−1 body weight Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5468) in 0.45 ml corn oil (Sigma, C8267) by intraperitoneal injection at 4 weeks of age, and the lung was collected 2 weeks later.

For cell cycle duration analysis, animals were injected subcutaneously once with EdU (Sigma, 900584. 30 µg per g of body weight) to label all cells in S phase (DKO retina at P8, Rb−/− pituitary at 4 or 6 weeks of age; Rb−/−;p53−/− lung at E18 and 8 weeks of age; KrasG12D lung at 6, 7, 8 and 13 weeks of age, BrafCA lung at 6 weeks of age). After 2.5 h, BrdU (Sigma, B5002. 100 µg per g of body weight) was injected once subcutaneously. Tissues were collected 0.5 h after BrdU injection, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h (eyes) or 2 h (pituitary, lung) and dehydrated in 30% sucrose for 24 h.

All collected mouse tissues were embedded in OCT (TissueTek 4583), frozen on dry ice and cut into 12–14 µm sections on Superfrost slides. For S phase labelling, BrdU+ cells were detected using a rat anti-BrdU antibody (Abcam, ab6326, 1:500) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (DSHB, G3G4, 1:1,000). EdU+ cells were detected using Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 555 Imaging Kit (Life technologies, C10338).

Validation of the primary antibodies is provided on the manufacturer's websites or in the referenced citations: antigen retrieval was performed as described19 by boiling sections in citric acid (H-3300, Vector Lab) or Target Retrieval Solution (S1699, Agilent). Primary antibodies or labelled cells were visualized using donkey anti-mouse, donkey anti-rabbit, donkey anti-rat and donkey anti-goat antibodies conjugated with Alexa-488, Alexa-568 or Alexa-647 (1:1,000; Molecular Probes), or donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 405) (Abcam, ab175658), DyLight 405 AffiniPure donkey anti-rat IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 712-475-153). F-actin was labelled by Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, A12379) or Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, A12380). Nuclei were counter-stained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI; Sigma).

Labelled cells were visualized and images captured with a Nikon Eclipse Ti or Ti2 laser scanning confocal microscope. Retinal thickness measurements were performed with Nikon NIS-Elements AR 3.10 software. Quantification used horizontal retinal sections containing the optic nerve, and lung/pituitary gland sections, and were analysed with ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). At least 3 sections per sample and 4–6 samples from different litters were counted.

For whole-mount retinal staining, eyeballs were enucleated and incubated for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The retinas were incubated at 4 °C with FITC-conjugated IB4 (Sigma L2895) and DAPI in PBS for 1–2 days. After brief washes with PBS, radial cuts were made to divide the retina into 4 quadrants to flatten the retina, and the tissue was mounted with Mowiol. For vascular blood vessel analysis, representative images were analysed with AngioTool (https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/ROB2/Home) to assess the vessel covered area (%), average vessel length and mean E lacunarity of the vascular plexus. In brief, at least three 200× magnification images (320 × 320μm field of view per retina) per eye and 6 eyes from the same genotypes of different litters were counted. To compare the vascular density of the DKO retina to the control, we used vascular images taken from a similar depth below the GCL to represent the IVP and DVP for the DKO retina.

E16 or P0 eyeballs were enucleated and incubated for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. With a dissection microscope, a circumferential incision was made around the limbus, followed by removal of the anterior segment, lens and vitreous body. The retinas were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, A12379, 1:500) or Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher Scientific, A12380, 1:500) and DAPI in PBS for overnight. After brief PBS washes, radial cuts were made to divide the retina into four quadrants to flatten the retina, and flat retinas were mounted with Mowiol. Immunofluorescent staining was analysed with the Nikon Eclipse Ti laser scanning confocal microscope. The whole retinal area and polarity-defect area were measured with the microscope program.

Frozen horizontal retinal sections were stained for β-galactosidase at pH 6.0 using the senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining kit (Cell Signaling, 9860) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. In brief, 120 μl staining solution was added to each slide, cover-slipped and sealed with rubber cement. The slide boxes were placed in a sealed humid container in a 37 °C dry incubator (no CO2) and incubated for 1–2 days. Colour images were taken with an Olympus BX61 microscope. Positive cells/sections were counted under the Olympus BX61 microscope. For each genotype, at least six retinas were analysed. For each retina, at least three representative sections were counted.

P8 eyeballs of p107−/−, α-cre;Rbf/f;p107−/− and α-cre;Rbf/f;p107−/−;Skp2+/− mice were enucleated, and peripheral retinas were dissected in fresh cold HBSS. Dissected peripheral retinas were transferred to 200 μl of cold HBSS per retina. An equivalent amount of Papain solution was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the tube inverted gently every 2 min. Next, the digestion solution was discarded by pipetting without disturbing the retina. Mechanical trituration of the retina was performed in 600 μl of neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% FBS by pipetting slowly 10 to 15 times with a P1000 pipette tip. Samples were then DNAse treated for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were centrifuged using a swing-bucket rotor at 200g for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully aspirated off the cell pellet, and the pellet was suspended in 1–5 ml neurobasal medium with 1% FBS. Cellular aggregates were removed by straining cells through a 50-μm cell strainer (pluriSelect). Splenocytes were collected by grinding a p107−/− mouse spleen through a 40-μm mesh, and then red blood cells (RBC) were removed by incubating cells for 10 min in RBC lysis buffer (Sigma, 11814389001).

To stain for immune markers, the dissociated retinal cells or splenocytes were washed in FACS buffer (PBS + 1% FBS) and then blocked with mouse Fc block (BD 553141, 1 μg per 106 cells) for 10 min on ice. After washing with FACS buffer, 4 × 105 cells in 200 μl FACS buffer were stained with phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-B220 (0.5 μg, 12-0452-81), anti-CD3 (0.75 μg, 17-0032-80), anti-CD335/NKp46 (0.75 μg, 12-3351-80), anti-CD45 (0.1 μg, 12-0451-82), anti-CD11b (0.25 μg, 17-0112-81) or appropriate isotype control antibodies (all from ThermoFisher) for 30 min on ice then washed with FACS buffer. Samples were analysed using a Gallios flow cytometer and Kaluza analysis software (Beckman Coulter). Dead cells were excluded using FxCycle violet DNA dye (ThermoFisher). The gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Fig. 8.

Similar to a prior method39, animals were subject to staggered EdU/BrdU labelling and tissues were collected and fixed (as detailed above). For retinal sections, EdU was detected with the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit first, then co-labelled with antibodies against BrdU (mouse anti-BrdU antibody, DSHB, G3G4), Ki67 (rat antibody, ThermoFisher Scientific, 14-5698-82) to label all dividing cells, and cell-type-specific markers including mature amacrine cells (AP2a), amacrine precursors (PTF1A), Müller glia (SOX9), horizontal cells (OC2), and predominantly neuronal retinal precursors (p21cip1 and MYCN). Matching a prior report74, staining retinal sections from mice subject only to EdU labelling confirmed that the G3G4 mouse anti-BrdU antibody does not cross-react with EdU.

For lung and pituitary sections, EdU was specifically detected using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit first, followed by an EdU-blocking procedure to prevent cross-reaction with rat anti-BrdU antibody75 (Abcam, ab6326). In brief, after EdU was detected using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit, slides were treated with 2 mM azidosulfide (Sigma, 244546) in the Click-iT buffers for 30 min. Staining sections from mice subject only to EdU labelling confirmed that the anti-BrdU antibody did not cross-react with EdU. After the EdU-blocking procedure, slides were co-labelled with antibodies against BrdU (rat anti-BrdU antibody, Abcam, ab6326), Ki67 (mouse antibody, BD science Pharmingen 550609) to label all dividing cells, and cell-type-specific markers including lung neuroendocrine cells (CGRP, rabbit, Sigma, C8198), lung club cells (CCSP, rabbit, Seven Hills Bioreagents, WRAB-3950), lung alveolar type II cells (SPC, rabbit, Abcam, ab40879), and pituitary melanotropes in the intermediate lobe and corticotropes in the anterior lobe (MSHA, Fisher Scientific, AB508MI), and imaged by confocal microscopy.

ImageJ (Fiji, version 1.54g) was used to manually count EdU/BrdU-labelled cells in 60× images using the image\color\channels tool. For cell-specific cell cycle data, we first counted the number of cell types of interest (for example, CGRP+ neuroendocrine cells). Next (or first in cases where no cell type-specific marker was used), we added the Ki67 channel to count dividing cells (CGRP+; Ki67+), then we added the EdU channel to count how many dividing cells were EdU-positive (CGRP+; Ki67+; EdU+). Next, we added the BrdU channel to count how many dividing cells were BrdU-positive (CGRP+; Ki67+; BrdU+). After that, we combined EdU and BrdU data with Marker/Ki67 to count marker+Ki67+BrdU−EdU+ cells. Counting each image was performed three times to ensure accuracy. Functions used to calculate Tc and Ts are illustrated and explained in detail in Supplementary Fig. 3. All the raw counts used in Tc and Ts calculations are provided in Supplementary Table 7. Examples of images used for counts are provided in Supplementary Figs. 4–7.

The number of EdU+;BrdU− cells forms the denominator of Tc and Ts calculations (Supplementary Fig. 3), thus if some of these cells divide this denominator would increase, artificially decreasing Tc and Ts. Prior publications assume that no or very few EdU-labelled cells divide, and that the EdU-only cells have reached G2/M but not beyond. We performed additional assays to examine this assumption.

First, we labelled P8 Rb/p107 DKO mice with EdU for 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h or 6 h, then stained retinal sections for EdU, phospho-histone H3 (PH3) and DAPI (Supplementary Fig. 9a). H3 phosphorylation begins in late G2 with chromosomal condensation, but is most prominent in early-mid M phase, and H3 dephosphorylation commences in late anaphase/early telophase76, thus PH3 is widely used as a late G2/M marker. If G2/M was <3 h, all cells in S phase at the time of EdU labelling would have reached M phase by then, and the EdU+ cells that were labelled in early-mid S phase would continue to enter G2/M at later times (S phase in DKO P8 retina is ~25 h, Fig. 4c), ensuring a long plateau of 100% EdU+;PH3+ double-labelled cells beyond 3 h. Conversely, if G2/M is >3 h, only a fraction of PH3+ cells would also be EdU+, which would continue to rise with time, eventually reaching the 100% plateau. As expected, the fraction of PH3+ cells that were also EdU+ increased over time, confirming the movement of prior S phase cells through G2 into M (Supplementary Fig. 9b). No double-labelled cells were detected at 1 h or 1.5 h, a tiny fraction was seen at 2 h, which continued to increase only reaching 100% at 6 h. At 3 h, the time point used in our Tc measurement studies, only 23.9% of PH3+ cells were EdU+ (Supplementary Fig. 9b). These data suggest that 3 h is insufficient for EdU-labelled cells in the P8 DKO retina to divide.

Second, we also performed EdU/PH3/DAPI triple labelling in sections from Rb pituitary, Rb/p53 lung, Kras lung, and Braf lung cancer models used in the paper (Supplementary Fig. 9c). The fraction of M phase cells that were EdU+ after 3 h was ~30–50%, similar in range to the DKO retina, and well below the 100% expected if EdU+ cells could complete mitosis in 3 h (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Thus, 3 h also appears insufficient for EdU-labelled cells to divide in these cancer models.

Third, as an additional test in retina, P8 DKO mice were exposed to EdU at 0 h, then BrdU from 2.5–3 h and retinal sections were stained for EdU. A cocktail of three rabbit antibodies targeting cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and PH3 to label S, all G2 and all M phase cells (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Any EdU-only cells that traverse M into G1 would be EdU+ but negative for all the other markers (cyclin A2, mid/late S phase and G2; cyclin B1, G2 and early M phase; PH3, late G2 and M phase). Notably, all the EdU+ cells co-labelled with the A2/B1/PH3 antibody mix, and no cells were positive only for EdU (Supplementary Fig. 9f). This result confirms that EdU-labelled cells do not divide in a 3 h window.

P8 eyeballs of α-cre;Rbf/f;P107−/− (DKO, tumour-prone) and α-cre; Rbf/f; P107−/−; Skp2+/− (DKO-Skp2+/−, tumour-resistant) mice were enucleated, and peripheral retinas (α-cre expression areas) were dissected in fresh and cold HBSS. Dissected peripheral retinas were then transferred to 200 μl of cold HBSS per retina. An equivalent amount of Papain solution (for 1 ml, 700 μl reagent grade water, 100 μl of freshly prepared 50 mM l-cysteine (Sigma), 100 μM 10 mM EDTA, 10 μM 60 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and Papain added to 1 mg ml−1 (Worthington)) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, the tube was inverted gently every 2 min during the incubation. After the incubation steps, the digestion solution was discarded by pipetting without disturbing the retina. Mechanical trituration of the retina was performed in 600 μl of neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% FBS by pipetting slowly 10 to 15 times with a P1000 pipette tip. Samples then were subjected to DNAse treatment (5 μl DNAse I (RNAse-free Recombinant DNAse I; Roche) for every 1 ml of dissociation solution) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were then centrifuged using a swing-bucket rotor at 200g for 5 min. The supernatant was carefully aspirated off the cell pellet, then resuspended in 1–5 ml neurobasal medium with 1% FBS. Cellular aggregates were removed by straining cells through a 50-μm cell strainer (pluriSelect).

Single-cell gene expression libraries were prepared using the Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were sequenced using the HiSeq3000 (Illumina) with the 10x Gene Expression recommended parameters (read 1, 28 cycles and read 2, 100 cycles).

Raw data were processed through the CellRanger pipelines (10x Genomics, V2.2.0). For each run of DKO and DKO-Skp2+/− genotypes, reads were quantified into UMI gene–barcode matrix using the mouse reference index provided by 10x Genomics (refdata-cellranger-mm10) and default parameters of the count pipeline to filter out low-quality cell barcodes. This process resulted in 3,621 estimated cells with an average of 52,983 reads and a median of 2,884 genes per cell for the DKO sample and 5,196 estimated cells with an average of 31,520 reads and a median of 1,873 genes per cell for the DKO-Skp2+/− sample. Then, matrices for individual runs were aggregated together into a single gene–barcode matrix with the CellRanger's aggr pipeline to avoid artefacts that may be introduced due to differences in sequencing depth when comparing the two genotypes. The aggregation kept 74.3% reads from the DKO sample and 100% reads from the DKO-Skp2+/− sample and ended with 8,817 estimated cells with an average of 34,749 reads and a median of 1,941 genes per cell.

The cloupe files generated by CellRanger were viewed using the 10x Genomics Loupe Browser and cells in clusters were explored by their over-expressed genes and expression of typical retinal, immune and astrocyte cell marker genes. We defined clusters as immune for their outstanding expression of marker genes Aif1 and Lgals9, and astrocyte cells by marker gene Aqp4. The proportions of immune and astrocyte cells in total cells were compared between DKO and DKO-Skp2+/− genotypes. For further analysis of retina cells, these non-retinal cells were excluded.

After removing non-retinal cells, data was further processed and analysed mainly by Scanpy Python toolkit (https://github.com/scverse/scanpy) and Seurat R toolkit (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat). For downstream analysis, low-expression genes and poor-quality cells were further filtered out from each single-cell dataset. After filtering, only genes expressed in >3 cells and cells expressing >500 genes and less than 15% of mitochondrial genes were retained, with 3,501 cells in DKO and 5,019 cells in DKO-Skp2+/− dataset. The retained data were normalized, and log-transformed by Scanpy's normalize-total and log1p, respectively. The aggregated data were filtered by only keeping the cells retained in each individual sample after the above filtering and genes with >10 counts in total. This resulted in 8,520 cells, including 5,019 DKO-Skp2+/− and 3,501 DKO retinal cells, and 15,731 genes. Then the aggregated data were normalized and log-transformed following the same methods as above.

To identify cycling cells and the effect of cell cycle heterogeneity on the data, each cell was assigned cell cycle scores and phases using Scanpy's function score_genes_cell_cycle. A list of cell cycle marker genes, including markers for S and G2M phase77 were used for the scoring, which calculates the difference of mean expression of the given cell cycle genes and the mean expression of randomly selected reference genes from binned gene pools that match the distribution of the given genes' expression. The human gene names were converted to mouse gene names by biomaRt package. Based on its cell cycle scores, a cell is predicted to be in G2M, S or G1 phase. Cells expressing neither S nor G2M genes are likely not cycling (G0) or in G1 phase.

To detect if any cells were grouped together as a cluster by artefacts of the problematic doublets or multiplets, where two or more cells receive the same barcode and result in a hybrid transcriptome, the python package “scrublet”78 was used to calculate doublet score and predicted doublets for each sample and possible artefact clusters by default parameters and expected doublets rate—DKO, 0.03; and DKO-Skp2+/−, 0.04—based on the number of captured cells. Raw data matrices for each individual sample were used for this analysis. The annotation of the detected doublets for cells were transferred onto the aggregated data.

To minimize the effects of cell cycle heterogeneity and to emphasize clustering based on genes related to cell lineage, the cell cycle was regressed from the previous normalized expression matrix. Both scores for G2M and S phase were regressed out with the regress_out function of Scanpy. After scaling, the top 2,000 highly variable genes were selected for the principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of data. The neighbourhood graph of cells was computed with the top 50 principal components, and then, the graph was embedded into two dimensions using UMAP. Cell clusters were identified by the Leiden graph-clustering method79, which directly clustering the neighbourhood graph of cells.

To annotate the retinal cell identity of each cluster, we associated the clusters with retinal cell types based on scores of known retinal cell-type-specific genes (Extended Data Fig. 4h). The scores of each cell type were calculated for each cell using the Scanpy's score_genes function with the same algorithm of the score_genes_cell_cycle. A cluster was assigned to a cell type with the highest average score and percentage of cells detected with positive scores within the cluster. The cell-type annotated clusters were further refined and verified by highly differential expressed genes for each cluster. The DEGs were identified for each cluster against the rest of the clusters using the rank_genes_group function with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Of them, marker genes for each cluster were further filtered by the filter_rank_genes_groups function with default parameters. Expression of the top 10 marker genes for each cluster were compared between mouse normal retinal development and these samples by UMAP visualization. Using the normal mouse retina development scRNA-seq data80 As a reference, we also identified each individual cell for its cell type with the ingest function of Scanpy, which fit a model on the reference data and used it to project new data with cell annotations. This mapping was applied using data for each individual sample, and mapped cell types were transferred to the aggregated data. The cell cycle effects were regressed out from the reference data and genotype data before mapping.

Top genes that distinguished particular cell types included: Apoe, Müller glia cluster (Mu); Rom1, photoreceptors (PR); Ebf1, amacrine precursors (AmP); Pcsk1n, mature amacrine cells (AmM); Fbxo5, rare remaining mitotic progenitors (ProgM); Isl1, bipolar cells (BiP); and Otx2, Neurod1 and Neurod4, neurogenic (Neu) cluster80,81,82,83,84,85,86 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 2).

To identify DEGs between two genotypes within each cluster, the function FindMarkers from the Seurat package was used with the MAST test for two condition comparisons. Significant DEGs were selected as those with adjusted P values less than 0.1, average log2 fold change higher than 0.25 and percentage (proportion) of cells with expression within a cluster larger than 0.1. The enrichment of CDK2-associated genes37 and cell cycle genes expressed in S and G2M phases in the DEGs were evaluated by the hypergeometric test phyper in R. The Bioplanet terms enriched in the DEGs were also identified using the online tool Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)87.

Peripheral mouse retinas were homogenized with a 30-gauge needle 5–10 times in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling 9803) with 0.1 mM PMSF, 1μg ml−1 aprotinin and 1μg ml−1 leupeptin. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analysed using ODYSSEY Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) with antibodies against active caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology 9661, 1:200), p27 (554069, BD Biosciences, 1:200), SKP2 (SC-74477; Santa Cruz, 1:1,000) and β-actin (A5441, Sigma, 1:2,000).

Sample sizes were chosen based on power analysis and common practice in mouse experiments. Sample sizes (n) were estimated by the formula n = [2(Zα + Z1–β)2]/SES2. Type I error (α) is set as 0.05, type II error (β) is set as 10–20% and is a two-sided effect. The SES (Cohen's d) is the standardized effect size, equal to the ES (effect size) divided by the pooled s.d., so it is the magnitude of the difference between the means of two groups in s.d. units88. For animal experiments, SES of 1.1×, 1.5× and 2.0× s.d. are suggested to represent small, moderate and significant responses, respectively88. According to the formula above, 4–7 mice are required to detect effect with 80% power, and 6–10 mice are needed to detect effects with 90% power. Thus, 4 or more typically 6 mice were used for each experiment to detect impact with 80–90% power. All data are presented as mean ± s.d. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism software. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare two groups. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. The P values for Kaplan–Meier curves were calculated using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.

The top panel summarizes the four steps. Step 1 introduces mutations to suppress cancer (here, retinoblastoma). Step 2 assesses multiple (here, nine) cancer hallmarks to determine whether any are always altered upon tumor suppression; only cell cycle length (Tc) fulfilled this criterion. Step 3 asks whether Tc is shorter in the cancer-prone (here, amacrine cell) vs. cancer-resistant lineages (Müller glia, horizontal cells). Tc in cancer-prone or resistant lineages is indicated on the left, and the effect of multiple tumor-suppressing mutations on Tc is shown on the right. Step 4 compares Tc of cancer-prone vs. resistant lineages in multiple other contexts. Tc was always shortest in the cancer-prone lineage independent of oncogenic lesion or tissue (indicated by green check marks).

Metrics details

Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains are central components of pattern recognition immune proteins across all domains of life1,2. In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties2,3,4,5. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties.

a, Growth curves of Thoeris-expressing and control cultures with and without infection by phage SBSphiJ at an MOI of 10. Data from three replicates are presented as individual curves. OD600, optical density at 600 nm. b, Same as in panel A, but with cells infected at MOI of 0.1. c, A representative plaque assay showing that both type I and type II Thoeris systems protect from phage SBSphiJ. Shown are tenfold serial dilution plaque assays with phage SBSphiJ. Representative of three replicates.

Source Data

Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the HHpred server59.

a, b, Two repeats of the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis shown in Fig. 3a, analyzed in both positive and negative modes. Cells expressing BaThsB or control cells that express GFP instead were infected with phage SBSphiJ at MOI = 10. After 120 min the cells were lysed and lysates filtered, then incubated with purified MoTad2. The lysates prior to and post-incubation with MoTad2, or after denaturation of MoTad2, were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Masses visualized in positive mode are in the m/z range of 697.1262 – 697.1462 with a retention time of 8.5 – 9.5 min. Masses visualized in a negative mode in S3 are in the m/z range of 695.1153 – 695.1353 with a retention time of 8.5 – 9.5 min. Extracted mass chromatograms of ions with an m/z value of 697.1374 and retention time of 9.04 min are presented in positive mode. In negative mode, extracted mass chromatograms of ions with an m/z value of 695.1251 are presented. Data in panel a are the same data presented in Fig. 3a.

Source Data

a, b Two repeats of the mass spectrometry analysis of the level of His-ADPR molecules produced by BaThsB before and after infection with phage SBSphiJ. A 50 mL culture of cells expressing BaThsB were collected before infection and 120 min after infection with phage SBSphiJ at MOI = 10. Expression of BaThsB was induced by 100 μM IPTG. The cells were lysed and lysates were filtered and analyzed by untargeted mass spectrometry. Shown are masses recorded in positive ionization mode in the m/z range of 3 PPM around the theoretical m/z of His-ADPR with a retention time of 8.5 – 9.5.

Metrics details

Land plants thrive in soils showing vastly different properties and environmental stresses1. Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil conditions and stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic approaches, we showed major expression changes in outer root cell types when comparing the single-cell transcriptomes of rice roots grown in gel versus soil conditions. These tissue-specific transcriptional responses are related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity and defence in response to heterogeneous soil versus homogeneous gel growth conditions. We also demonstrate how the model soil stress, termed compaction, triggers expression changes in cell wall remodelling and barrier formation in outer and inner root tissues, regulated by abscisic acid released from phloem cells. Our study reveals how root tissues communicate and adapt to contrasting soil conditions at single-cell resolution.

Crops such as rice thrive in arable soils that show natural heterogeneity. The heterogeneous nature of soils is characterized by uneven distributions of nutrients, water, microorganisms and organic content that pose a stark contrast to the uniformity of growth media, underscoring the fundamental importance to understand how plant roots navigate, adapt and thrive at molecular and cellular levels in natural soils. Roots have evolved diverse strategies to tackle the variability in soil conditions1,2. However, our understanding of how roots respond to complex soil environments at a cellular level of resolution remains limited. The application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic approaches to plant organs grown in diverse environments has the potential to reveal gene-expression complexity throughout root developmental stages, and identify mechanisms governing cell type-specific responses to environmental stresses3,4. Soil stresses represent a major challenge in global agriculture5. For example, soil compaction stress reduces root penetration, thereby affecting nutrient and water uptake and subsequently crop yield6. Roots have developed adaptive growth responses for compacted soils; but the underlying genes, cell group-specific transcriptional responses and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To discover the mechanisms governing root responses to soil compaction at a cellular resolution, we pioneered transcriptomic profiling of rice root tissues grown in soils with and without compaction using single-cell approaches.

Protoplasts of rice primary roots, obtained from gel-based conditions, were initially adopted to generate a high-quality scRNA-seq reference dataset to show cell identities and differentiation trajectories7, and later compared to equivalent datasets generated from soil-grown roots. Using the 10X Genomics scRNA-seq platform, we profiled more than 47,000 root cells gathered from Xkitaake rice primary root tissues 2–3 days after germination across ten sets of independently grown seedlings. To enhance depth and assess data variability across laboratories, we integrated a previously published scRNA-seq dataset8 with our datasets. All datasets underwent processing with the COPILOT (cell preprocessing pipeline kallisto bustools) pipeline9, resulting in the integration of more than 79,000 high-quality cells to construct the final scRNA-seq atlas (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Video 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1). To mitigate the effect of protoplasting on gene expression, we identified protoplasting-induced genes by means of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq, Supplementary Table 2) and excluded them from data integration and differential expression analysis. This approach ensured the robustness of our scRNA-seq findings.

To ensure representation from all major developmental stages, we assigned developmental annotations to major cell types by comparing each cell's transcriptome with bulk RNA-seq expression profiles of manually dissected root tissue segments corresponding to meristematic, elongation and maturation zones (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 2). scRNA-seq studies often rely on pseudotime analysis to infer developmental stages, a computational method that orders cells on the basis of gene expression similarities but does not represent actual time. This approach is influenced by the choice of the starting point, which can affect interpretations. In our study, we integrated bulk RNA-seq data from rice root tissues at distinct developmental stages. Using stage-specific marker genes, we directly annotated developmental stages in our scRNA-seq dataset, aligning it more closely with experimental observations. This developmental-stage annotation is unique in our scRNA-seq dataset, compared to the previously published ones8,10,11.

High Spearman correlation among transcriptional profiles of all samples confirmed minimal batch effects (Extended Data Fig. 1b). For cell type annotation, we initially used principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques, followed by the calculation of z-scores for published markers (Methods). However, because of the limited number of validated cell type markers, a substantial proportion of cells remained unannotated. To address this limitation, we used Molecular Cartography, an optimized multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization technology12,13. This allowed us to explore in situ gene-expression profiles for the candidate cell type markers identified in our putatively annotated cell type clusters. Our spatial transcriptomic experiments validated the cell type-specific expression of more than 40 markers (Fig. 1i–p, Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Data 3 and 4). We then refined our cell type annotation, relying on the expression patterns of validated markers in scRNA-seq clusters (Fig. 1c–h,q). The iterative feedback loop between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics significantly increased the number of reliable markers for the major root cell types, enhancing cell annotation quality.

Integrating scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data also showed temporal gene-expression dynamics. Pseudotime analysis demonstrated a continuous differentiation trajectory of rice root epidermis (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), and we examined temporal expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in root hair differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Among the DEGs, three genes (LOC_Os12g05380, OsGT3, encoding a putative xylosyltransferase (XXT); LOC_Os10g42750, OsCSLD1, encoding Cellulose Synthase Like D1; LOC_Os06g48050, unannotated) showed a sequential pattern of expression along root hair differentiation, detected in both scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics data (Fig. 1r–u and Extended Data Fig. 1f–k). Overall, our approach generated a high-resolution scRNA-seq atlas, with confidently annotated cell types and developmental stages.

To investigate the cell type-specific responses to natural soil condition relative to the gel-based condition, we used our standardized soil-based growth regime14. Xkitaake rice seedlings were cultivated in soils for 3 days, their roots were then harvested, after which scRNA-seq was conducted on protoplasts isolated from two biological replicates of 1-cm root tip segments. Root tip samples encompassed meristem, elongation and early maturation zones. To leverage our gel-based data for interpreting our soil-based data, gel-based and soil-based scRNA-seq datasets were integrated (Methods). Although the scRNA datasets obtained from different growth conditions could be distinguished with sample-wise correlation analyses, the gel-grown roots showed high one-to-one similarities with the soil-grown roots across almost all cell clusters (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c,h). Most validated cell type markers detected in our Molecular Cartography examination remained expressed in their target cell types under soil conditions (Fig. 2d–l, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 5 and 6). We thus relied on the expression patterns of these marker genes to annotate the major cell types in our soil-based scRNA-seq data (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 4). We verified the relatively high correlation of individual cell types between the two growth conditions (Extended Data Fig. 3d,f). Our scRNA-seq analysis showed a notable decrease in the number of root hair cells detected under soil conditions. To verify this reduction in trichoblast cell numbers, we examined the expression of a root hair cell-specific marker line (proCSLD1::VENUS-N7). Imaging showed highly similar expression patterns between gel and soil conditions, indicating that the observed decrease is probably due to the loss of root hair cells during the protoplasting process (Extended Data Fig. 3i–k). In conclusion, we managed to annotate our soil-based scRNA-seq data with our knowledge gained from both gel-based scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomic application to soil-grown roots.

Source Data

To delve into the mechanisms governing cell type-specific responses to soil growth conditions, we conducted differential expression analysis for confidently annotated root cell types and developmental stage-enriched groups (Methods). This analysis revealed 11,259 DEGs (fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate less than 0.05, Supplementary Table 5). Notably, 31% of DEGs were altered in a single cell type or developmental stage, indicating that changes in growth conditions modulate distinct sets of genes in specific cell type contexts (Extended Data Fig. 5m,n). Most DEGs were found in the outer root cell types (epidermis, exodermis, sclerenchyma and cortex), whereas the inner stele layers (such as phloem and endodermis) showed relatively minor changes (Fig. 2a–c,m and Extended Data Fig. 5m). This pattern indicates that even under non-stressed soil conditions, roots modify their gene expression compared to gel-grown roots, particularly in outer cell layers.

Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these DEGs revealed the functional classes enriched in outer tissues of soil-grown roots notably include nutrient metabolism (particularly phosphate and nitrogen pathways), alongside vesicle-mediated transport, cell wall integrity, hormone-mediated signalling and defence responses, compared to axenic gel conditions (Fig. 2n–p, Supplementary Table 6). The increased expression of genes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism in outer cell layers further indicates that root cells dynamically adjust their metabolic processes to respond to fluctuating nutrient availability in soils. We also identified several micro nutrient (zinc and boron) uptake-related genes (OsZIP10 and OsBOR1) showing enhanced expression in the outer cell layers. Our scRNA-seq analysis indicates that roots use various adaptive strategies to improve nutrient uptake, including strengthening cell wall integrity, enhancing cell communication by means of hormone signalling and using vesicle-mediated transport mechanisms, in response to the heterogeneous distribution of nutrients in the soils.

In our study, we used the model rice variety Xkitaake to establish our scRNA-seq resource given the wealth of functional resources available in this background including mutant collections15 and exploited in our recent study2. However, Xkitaake is a transgenic line containing the XA21 gene, which encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. To assess the potential influence of XA21 on rice root gene expression, we conducted scRNA-seq on Kitaake genotype under both gel and soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Cell type annotation revealed similar enrichment of DEGs in outer root cells as observed in Xkitaake (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). We further validated the enriched GO terms through a comparative scRNA-seq analysis of the Kitaake genotype. The GO term enrichment patterns and associated gene expression changes (Supplementary Table 9), related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity, hormone-mediated signalling and vesicle-mediated transport were consistent between Xkitaake and Kitaake in the scRNA-seq analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4c–e). For defence responses, scRNA-seq analysis of Xkitaake compared to Kitaake showed relatively higher expression of defence-related genes in Xkitaake (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i), indicating that XA21 can enhance defence responses under changing growth conditions. However, when examining specific defence response genes in Kitaake under soil versus gel conditions, we also detected their induction in soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g,j,k). Thus, although XA21 is not required for the enhanced defence response observed in natural soils as compared to the gel growth regime, it amplifies the defence response triggered by these growth condition changes.

Hence, compared to when propagated in sterile homogeneous gel, roots grown in soils seem to adapt to their heterogeneous environment by upregulating defence, nutrient and cell wall-related gene expression across all the cell types. The outer cell layers are more responsive compared to the inner cell layers, reinforcing nutrient uptake (that is, ‘get nutrients in') and cell wall integrity, to facilitate root exploration for heterogeneous resources in soil (Fig. 2q,r). This cell layer-specific responsiveness also helps to protect developing roots from abiotic and biotic signals (that is, ‘keep stress out') that are unevenly distributed in natural soils (Fig. 2q,r). These important insights highlight the benefit of applying single-cell profiling approaches on samples grown in a natural soil environment.

Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Soil compaction reduces the ratio of air spaces versus soil particles, resulting in higher mechanical strength that impedes root growth and triggers adaptive responses6. To show how individual root cell types exposed to compaction stress modify their gene-expression profiles, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic datasets were generated from roots grown at higher soil bulk density (1.6 g cm−3 compared to 1.2 g cm−3; Fig. 3a–c and Methods). Molecular Cartography revealed most validated cell type markers remained expressed in their target cell types under compacted soil growth conditions (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5b–l and Supplementary Data 7 and 8). This is consistent with the detected high correlation between two soil conditions across most cell layers (Extended Data Fig. 3e,g).

Source Data

Next, we performed a comparative analysis to determine the most transcriptionally affected cell groups and understand the nature of their responses to soil compaction stress. We further checked the DEGs for each confidently annotated root cell type and developmental stage-enriched groups. We identified 7,947 DEGs (fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate less than 0.05). Here 42% of DEGs were altered in a single cell type or developmental stage (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Notably, exodermis and endodermis emerged as the two cell layers particularly influenced by soil compaction, showing the highest number of DEGs (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 10).

Analysing enriched GO terms for the most affected cell types, exodermis and endodermis, showed a significant association with cell wall component metabolism (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 6f–h and Supplementary Table 11). The group of cell wall-related proteins with differential gene expressions included EXPANSINS (EXPA), a family of plant cell wall regulatory proteins that facilitate turgor-driven cell enlargement16. Notably, bulk RNA-seq of Xkitaake also showed similar induction of EXPA in compacted soil conditions (Supplementary Table 12 and Extended Data Fig. 7c). The upregulation of EXPA gene expression in both the exodermis and cortex (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 10), is consistent with the observed enlarged cell area for both cell types under compacted soil conditions as roots undergo radial expansion (Extended Data Fig. 7e–h and Supplementary Table 13), necessitating cell wall remodelling of outer root tissues17. A deeper analysis of the DEGs pinpointed several genes encoding xylanase inhibitors, indicative of secondary cell wall formation, given xylan's significant role as a secondary cell wall component18. In addition, xylanase inhibitors are important defence components, primarily found in the cell walls of monocots where they inhibit the hemicellulose-degrading activity of microbial xylanases. This indicates that root defence responses are also activated by soil compaction. In addition, we observed upregulation of other genes involved in cell wall metabolism in the exodermis with soil compaction, including XTH22 (LOC_Os02g57770), OsARF6 (LOC_Os02g06910)19 and OsBRI1 (LOC_Os07g40630)20 (Fig. 3f, top). Similar upregulation of cell wall-relevant genes was detected in the endodermis (Extended Data Figs. 6c and 7a–d), indicating the induction of cell wall metabolism in both exodermis and endodermis.

A group of water stress-responsive genes also showed enhanced expression in both exodermis and endodermis under compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6e). The induction of water stress relevant genes indicates root tissues experience water stress in compacted soils, leading us to investigate the expression of genes relevant to abscisic acid (ABA), which is tightly linked to water stress21,22,23. Significantly, enriched GO terms for upregulated genes in exodermis also included the class ‘response to ABA' (Fig. 3e). We thus checked the spatial expression of ABA biosynthesis genes in our scRNA-seq dataset. We identified strong upregulation of OsAAO1 and OsNCED genes (which encode enzymes catalysing the last steps of ABA biosynthesis) in phloem-derived vascular tissue23 (Fig. 3f, bottom and g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We also noted induced expression of ABA-responsive genes in other outer cell layers (beside exodermis) in response to soil compaction (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Moreover, we also found similar induction of ABA biosynthesis genes in our bulk RNA-seq in compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Our scRNA-seq analysis shows that ABA biosynthesis occurs predominantly in inner cell layers, whereas ABA responses are activated in outer cell layers. This aligns with published findings that ABA synthesized in the root stele moves radially outwards with water flux to activate responses in outer tissues24. Hence, our scRNA-seq dataset demonstrates how compaction stress drives coordinated, cell-specific responses to stress signals, such as ABA, progressing from the inner to the outer root cell layers.

Soil compaction is known to exert water stress on roots as moisture release is reduced from the smaller soil pores25. The coordinated regulation of suberin and lignin accumulation in roots is essential to maintain the water balance for various plant species26,27. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed upregulated expression of many lignin and suberin biosynthesis genes in outer (exodermis) and inner (endodermis) root cell layers that can form apoplastic water-impermeable barriers (Extended Data Fig. 6i). We found similar induction of several lignin and suberin biosynthesis genes in our bulk RNA-seq dataset in compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i). To validate our expression results, histochemical staining was performed for lignin (basic fuchsin) and suberin (fluorol yellow) in mature wild-type (WT) rice root tissues exposed to non-compacted and compacted soil conditions. Our imaging of these barrier components revealed higher lignification (Fig. 4a versus 4e) and suberization (Fig. 4b versus 4f) in root exodermal, endodermal and vascular cell types exposed to compacted soil conditions. To test whether compaction stress induced barrier formation is regulated by ABA, we characterized lignin and suberin levels in roots of the rice ABA biosynthesis mutant mhz5 grown in compacted soils28,29. MHZ5 expression is significantly induced by soil compaction in the phloem-related vascular tissue in our scRNA-seq dataset (Fig. 3f). In contrast to WT, mhz5 roots did not show induction of lignin and suberin levels in response to compacted soil conditions (Fig. 4c versus 4g and Fig. 4d versus 4h and Extended Data Fig. 8m–t). Moreover, we also quantified lignin levels in WT and mhz5 root tips grown under both compacted and non-compacted soils, showing a significant increase of lignin in WT, whereas the mhz5 mutant showed no substantial difference under compacted conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8d). To further confirm the role of ABA in regulating barrier formation under compacted soil conditions, we analysed lignin and suberin patterns in two additional ABA biosynthetic mutants (aba1 and aba2), both of which showed minimal barrier induction in compacted soils (Extended Data Fig. 8e–l) Hence, our results show that ABA has a key role in triggering barrier formation during compaction stress conditions, similar to the radial oxygen loss barrier being induced in stagnant soil conditions30.

What is the physiological and functional importance of lignin and suberin barrier formation? One key link between secondary cell wall formation in barriers is the enhanced cell wall stiffness that helps to protect roots from soil mechanical stress. The higher expression and accumulation of lignin and suberin in the endodermis prompted us to analyse the cell wall stiffness of endodermal cells under both non-compacted and compacted soil conditions. Our phonon imaging revealed increased stiffness in the endodermal cell layer under compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7i–n), providing direct evidence of rice roots enhancing cell wall rigidity to deal with mechanical stress.

On the basis of the induction of key water stress-responsive genes and enhanced barrier formation under compaction, we sought to delineate the actual role of the barriers in dealing with water stress in compacted soils. To evaluate this, we performed radial water loss experiments using WT and mhz5 root tips grown in either non-compacted or compacted soil conditions. Three-centimetre-long root tips were excised from soil-grown roots and kept in a humidity-controlled environment to quantify the weight loss, as an indirect measurement of radial water loss. WT root segments grown in non-compacted soil conditions lost half of their water content in just 17 min, whereas root tips exposed to compaction stress took almost 25 min. Hence, cumulative water loss in compacted root tips was roughly 1.5 times slower than in non-compacted root tips (Fig. 4i). This reduction in radial water loss after exposure to compaction stress is not observed in mhz5 mutant root tips (Fig. 4i,j and Extended Data Fig. 8u).

Our results show that ABA has a key role in triggering adaptive responses to compaction stress, which include induction of lignin and suberin barriers in the exodermis and stele cell types, which collectively act to prevent root radial water loss. The induction of ABA biosynthesis is a hallmark of physiological water stress conditions31. Our scRNA-seq approach provides spatial insights into the cascade of signalling events taking place in specific cell types when roots are exposed to soil compaction. In response to this soil stress phloem cells upregulate expression of biosynthesis genes for the abiotic stress signal ABA, which then targets outer root cell types such as the exodermis to form water-impermeable barriers to reduce root moisture loss (Fig. 4k).

Our study shows how cellular-resolution transcriptomic approaches can provide unprecedented new insights into root–soil interactions and adaptive responses. Most root stress studies performed so far have been conducted in aseptic growth systems such as gel-based media. However, plant roots are normally exposed to a heterogeneous soil environment, encompassing a range of textures, microbiomes and levels of moisture and nutrients32. Single-cell transcriptomics showed key transcriptional differences among cell types when grown in a natural soil system versus an axenic gel system. Transcriptional differences were predominantly confined to outer root tissues, whereas inner root cell types showed limited response. Upregulated genes in soil-grown roots included NB-ARC, WRKY48 and those encoding cupin domain proteins and strip rust proteins, known to respond to bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. Transcript levels of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat genes (NLRs) are normally low in the absence of pathogens. The elevated spatial expression of NLRs indicates that outer root cell types are exposed to the soil microbes when cultured in real soil environments. Alternatively, plant roots may deliberately upregulate immune response component expression in outer root cell layers to prepare for the biotic heterogeneity in soil environments. In soil-grown roots, upregulated genes include transporters for macronutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and micronutrients (zinc, iron, magnesium, boron and potassium), as well as genes involved in defence responses, vesicle-mediated transport and cell wall remodelling. This expression pattern illustrates how plant roots sense diverse elements within natural soils and change molecular responses enhancing readiness to biotic challenges, nutrient transport to drive growth and development to explore the soil environments effectively. Thus, sensing of the external environment concomitantly with cell signalling and cellular reprogramming collectively orchestrate the growth and adaptation of plant roots in soil environments.

Root cell types growing in soils have to sense and respond to not only biotic but also abiotic stresses. Our study also explored how root cell types responded to the model abiotic soil stress, compaction. Radial expansion of outer root cell types (including exodermis, cortex and epidermis) represents a hallmark of plant adaptive growth response to soil compaction stress32 (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g). This adaptive growth response, primarily driven by radial cortical cell expansion, will necessitate the remodelling of cortical cell walls and, as a result of this expansion, all surrounding outer root cell layers would also undergo cell wall modifications. Consistent with this, our scRNA-seq dataset revealed enrichment of cell wall remodelling gene classes, including EXPA and GRPs (glycine rich protein genes), in outer cell types (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Also, considering the increased mechanical stress applied to neighbouring cell layers due to the expansion of cortical cells17 the responsive cell layers can either enhance the cell wall stiffness by cell wall remodelling, or expand themselves to release the stress. The accumulation of lignin and suberin at the exodermis and endodermis may also serve to enhance the mechanical stability of root tips. Indeed, our phonon imaging (Brillouin microscopy) provides direct evidence that rice roots reinforce cell wall rigidity at barriers to support and protect root systems and plants under compaction stress.

Soil compaction not only imposes mechanical stress on roots, but also reduces water and nutrient absorption. The latter is due, in part, to compacted soil pores being more difficult for roots to extract water from28,33, creating water stress-like conditions. Consistent with this, our scRNA-seq dataset revealed upregulation of key ABA biosynthesis genes in root vascular cell types in response to compaction stress (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Elevated ABA levels target outer root layers, potentially through the outward water flow24, triggering induced expression of ABA-responsive genes in these cell types (Fig. 3h). ABA-dependent root adaptive responses to compaction stress included elevated lignin and suberin accumulation in water barriers and stele cell types at the root maturation zone, as opposed to the younger regions (Extended Data Fig. 8m–t). We demonstrate that ABA-dependent formation of these barriers facilitates water retention in root tips during compaction stress.

Our study provides direct evidence of cell wall remodelling through increased expression of suberin and lignin biosynthesis genes, specifically in the exodermis and endodermis, as revealed by scRNA-seq data. This enhanced accumulation of suberin and lignin was further validated using fluorescent dye staining and direct quantification of lignin in rice roots. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed many aspects of cell wall remodelling closely linked to cell wall properties, morphology and growth. Beyond EXPA genes, we examined the expression of cellulose synthase (CESA) and xyloglucan biosynthesis genes (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). Both groups showed enhanced expression, with CESAs slightly induced in sclerenchyma and xylem cells, whereas xyloglucan biosynthesis genes showed strong but less cell type-specific patterns. These findings indicate that distinct aspects of cell wall remodelling are regulated by different cell type-specific mechanisms.

Besides ABA, ethylene and auxin are also reported to have roles in root responses to soil compaction. Comparative heatmaps of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling-related genes under compacted versus non-compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d,f) show the induction of several prominent ERF and EIL genes. Their enhanced expression was also supported by bulk RNA-seq data (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). However, no cell type-specific expression patterns were observed for these genes. Similarly, auxin signalling genes show increased expression under soil compaction (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b,e), but without cell type-specific induction. These findings indicate that ABA, rather than ethylene or auxin, drives cell type-specific gene expression changes in response to soil compaction.

Is the ABA-mediated radial water loss prevention functionally connected to root growth in compacted soils? As our previous study has revealed that mhz5, as well as other ABA biosynthesis mutants, aba1 and aba2, all have relatively longer roots than WT in compacted soils28, we propose that increased water loss triggers enhanced root elongation. This may be a direct consequence of impaired cortical radial expansion and potentially reflects a root strategy to rapidly explore water resources.

In summary, our single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data provide insights into how root cells sense and respond to their biotic soil environment and abiotic stresses such as compaction in a cell type-specific manner. The single-cell resolution of our approaches has been instrumental in pinpointing key genes and cell types, pathways and processes, stress signals and inter-cellular signalling mechanisms that enable roots to adapt to growth in soils. Leveraging these new soil-grown root datasets will underpin efforts to develop crops more resilient to complex edaphic stresses and contribute to future-proofing plants against challenging environmental conditions.

The rice line used in this study is Xkitaake, a Kitaake line transformed with the XA21 gene driven by the maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter15,34. To ensure that the presence of XA21 does not influence the gene-expression trends observed in our scRNA-seq analysis, we also included the non-transgenic Kitaake line for comparison. Seeds were dehulled, sterilized with 50% bleach for 30 min and rinsed five times with sterilized water. Rice seedlings were then inserted into Yoshida's media solidified with 0.15% gellan gum (Gelzan, Caisson)35, with the embryo positioned facing upwards. Rice seeds were kept at 30 °C in the dark for 2 or 3 days until they germinated.

For gel-based growth conditions, germinated rice seedlings were then transferred to a Percival growth chamber set to 28 °C, and constant light (2,000 LUX) for 2–3 days before harvesting.

To establish the soil-based growth conditions, Wedowee sandy loam soils from Johnston County, NC, USA (15% clay, 75% sand, 15 g kg−1 organic C, 1 g kg−1 total N, cation exchange capacity (CEC) 6.4 meg per 100 g, base salt, 83%, P = 199 g m−3, K = 78 g m−3, Ca = 804 g m−3, pH 5.8) was used. Soils were air dried, crushed and then passed through a sieve with a 2-mm mesh size. To allow packing of soils to certain bulk densities, the soils were lightly sprayed with sterilized water and mixed thoroughly. Non-compacted soil condition was packed up to 1.2 g cm−3 (1.2 bulk density (BD)), Compacted soil was pressed to make 1.6 g cm−3 (1.6 BD). Soils were packed in three-dimensionally printed mesocosms at bulk density of 1.2 or 1.6 BD and then saturated with sterilized water14. In the soils (both compacted and non-compacted) used in our experiments, excess water was drained through gravitational pull to mimic the near-field capacity conditions. Germinated rice seedlings (maximum of four seedlings per mesocosm) with equivalent length radicles (roughly 0.5 cm) were placed below the soil surface (10 mm), and then grown in a Percival growth chamber set to 28 °C and constant light (2000 LUX) for 2–3 days before harvesting.

Sections (root tip to end of lateral root cap, meristem; end of lateral root cap to the start of root hair elongation, elongation; 1 mm each beyond the start of root hair elongation, maturation 1 and maturation 2) were collected into 10 μl of RNA-later (Ambion) in the lid of a 1.5-ml tube. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, and then processed by grinding with a blue homogenization pestle. RNA was isolated using the Zymo MagBead RNA Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Zymo). RNA was used as input into the Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ FWD RNA-Seq library preparation procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the unique molecular identifier (UMI) PCR add-on kit. Libraries were indexed and pooled on an Illumina NextSeq. Reads were aligned to Michigan State University Rice genome v.7 with the STAR aligner36, deduplicated using UMI-Tools37 and counted with HTSeq-Count.

For rice seedling harvesting, gel-grown rice seedlings were directly pulled out from the growth media and root tips were cut in the enzyme solution within the optimal osmotic conditions. For soil-grown rice seedlings, the three-dimensionally printed mesocosms were opened and rinsed with gentle water flow. The seedlings were exposed and further rinsed with a gentle water flow to remove attached soil particles. Gentle brushing with a small paint brush was also carried out to remove the remaining soil particles. The root tips were then cut in the enzyme solution with the optimal osmotic conditions.

For gel-based scRNA-seq protoplasting sample, roughly 1-cm root tips were harvested from 15–40 roots, chopped with sharp razor for 1 min and then placed into a 35-mm petri dish containing a 70-μm cell strainer and 4.5 ml enzyme solution (4% [w/v] cellulase (ONOZUKA R-10, GoldBio), 1.5% Macerozyme R10 (GoldBio), 0.24% Pectolyase (Sigma P3026), 0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM MES (pH 5.7), 20 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.000194% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). The digestion was incubated on an 85-rpm shaker at 28 °C for 2.5 h with extra pipette mixing every 30 min. The resulting cell solution was filtered twice through 40-μm cell strainers, transferred into a Falcon Round-Bottom Polystyrene Test Tubes and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500g in a swinging bucket rotor. The pellet was washed with 2 ml of washing solution (0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM MES (pH 5.7), 20 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.000194% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged again at 500g for 3 min. The washing step was repeated for one more time and the pellet resuspended in the washing solution (normally 50–80 µl) without CaCl2 at a concentration of roughly 2,000 cells per µl. Cell concentration was counted using a C-chips disposable hemocytometer (Fuchs Rosenthal, 20 µl, VWR, catalogue no. 22-600-102).

For soil-based scRNA-seq protoplasting, the procedure mirrors that of gel-based RNA-seq protoplasting, with modifications to chopping time (reduced to 45 s) and digestion time (extended from 2.5 to 3 h). These adjustments aim to enhance protoplast yield without introducing excessive debris. Despite careful washing of soil from root tips, a significant number of epidermal cells were probably removed, potentially altering the proportions of trichoblast and atrichoblast cells under different growth conditions. We conducted root trichoblast cell-specific reporter image analysis in gel, non-compacted and compacted soil conditions and we did not see a difference in the number of cells expressing the proCSLD1:VENUS-N7 reporter38.

For chromium-based droplet production, we loaded 16,000 (32,000) cells, with the aim to capture 10,000 (20,000 for High Throughput version) cells per sample with the 10X Genomics Chromium 3′ Gene expression v.3 (for sc_7), v.3.1 (for sc_108, sc_109, sc_115, sc_116, sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195 and sc_196) or v.3.1 High Throughput (for sc_199, sc_200, sc_201 and sc_202, sc_303, sc_304, sc_305 and sc_306) kits.

Raw sequencing reads underwent demultiplexing from Illumina BCL files to generate FASTQ files for each sample using CellRanger mkfastq (v.3.1.0, 10X Genomics). Subsequently, reads were aligned to the Oryza sativa genome BSgenome object (BSgenome.Osativa.MSU.MSU7) along with the MSU7 gene annotation file. This alignment was carried out using the scKB script within the COPILOT preprocessing pipeline9, which integrates kallisto39 and bustools40,41. Quality filtering of cells was performed with the R package COPILOT9. COPILOT uses a non-arbitrary scheme to eliminate empty droplets and low-quality cells, using a 5% mitochondrial expression threshold as the criterion for searching the initial cut-off defining low-quality cells (parameter mt.threshold set to 5). A single iteration of COPILOT filtering (parameter filtering.ratio set to 1) was applied, effectively segregating high-quality cells from the background, as indicated by barcode rank plots. To address issues related to doublets and outliers, the resulting high-quality cells underwent further filtering, removing the top 1% of cells based on UMI counts. Putative doublets were identified and removed using DoubletFinder42 with the estimated doublet rate from the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit user guide.

Downstream analyses were conducted using Seurat v.3.1.5. Individual processing and examination of samples were performed, followed by data normalization using SCTransform43. As a standard step in scRNA-seq data processing, we identified protoplasting-induced genes using bulk RNA-seq (Supplementary Table 2). These genes were excluded from our analysis. Specifically, we conducted bulk RNA-seq comparisons between intact roots and digested roots to identify general protoplasting-induced genes. Furthermore, we compared roots digested for 2.5 versus 3 h to account for digestion time effects and further minimize their impact on gene-expression trends in the gel versus soil comparison (Extended Data Fig. 10).

All detected genes, excluding those associated with mitochondria, chloroplasts or affected by protoplasting (absolute log2 fold change greater than or equal to 2), were retained for analysis (Supplementary Tables 2, 5, 8 and 10). PCA was executed by calculating 50 principal components using the RunPCA function (with approx = FALSE). Subsequently, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) nonlinear dimensionality reduction was computed by means of the RunUMAP function using all 50 principal components with default parameters.

These processing steps are detailed and documented in Jupyter notebooks (provided on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice).

Data integration was carried out using Seurat v.3.1.5, following the Seurat reference-based integration pipeline44,45. The sample with the highest median UMI/gene per cell and the highest number of detected genes was selected as the reference (sample name, tz2; Supplementary Data 1). The 12 WT replicates (tz2, tz1, sc_108, sc_109, sc_7, sc_115, sc_116, sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195, sc_196) were used to construct the WT atlas shown in Fig. 1, including two previously published samples (tz1, tz2; Supplementary Data 1). For the integrated object containing eight samples shown in Figs. 2 and 3, comprising gel-grown (sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195) and soil-grown samples (sc_199, sc_200, sc_201, sc_202), sample sc_201 was chosen as the reference. These processing steps are detailed and documented in Jupyter notebooks (provided on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice).

The cell type annotation for both integrated objects was based on markers (Supplementary Table 3) that have been previously validated and show specific local expression on the atlas UMAP. Marker gene-expression z-scores were calculated depending on clustering. Clusters were defined using the Seurat FindClusters function by testing the modularity parameter, ranging from res = 2 (low) to res = 300 (high), until the reasonable cluster numbers were reached. Coarse and finely-resolved clusters were annotated by comparing average marker gene z-scores. Cells annotated with the same cell identity by both resolutions were considered confidently annotated, forming the consensus annotation. This combination effectively annotated rare cell types while capturing major cell types given that high resolution and low noise provided by low-resolution are balanced. New reference expression profiles for each cell type were built by averaging the expression values for cells in the consensus annotation. All cells were then re-annotated using the correlation-based approach, which calculates Pearson correlation coefficients between each cell and reference expression profiles for cell types, assigning each cell the cell type with the highest correlation coefficient.

To eliminate the potential occurrence of specific cell groups being filtered out during our COPILOT-based scRNA-seq data preprocessing, possibility as a result of induced cell stresses, we also conducted an examination of the cell type identities for the low-quality cells and found no enrichment of any particular cell type (Supplementary Data 9). This confirmed that we have inclusively incorporated high-quality cells representative of all major cell types in an unbiased manner.

For developmental-stage annotation, correlation annotation compared each cell from scRNA-seq to bulk data from morphologically defined sections (Supplementary Data 2) for both the 12-sample WT atlas and the 8-sample integrated object grown in gel versus soil.

We examined the gene expression patterns by plotting the log-normalized, ‘corrected' counts produced by the SCTransform function rather than the batch-corrected ‘integrated' values. The UMAPs were generated with the ‘featureplot' function in the Seurat package.

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the gene expression plotting process are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice.

Rice root epidermal cells were extracted from the integrated Seurat objects (12 gel-grown Xkitaake). Pseudotime was then inferred on the SCT assay of the extracted epidermal cells using Monocle3 (ref. 46). The learn_graph and order_cell functions in Monocle3 package were used to generate pseudotime metadata. Owing to the complexity of defining epidermal principal points, we opted to calculate pseudotime values separately for atrichoblast and trichoblast cells. Subsequently, these values were merged back into the pseudotime metadata. Furthermore, we manually delineated ten developmental groups. The construction of a UMAP representing the pseudotime trajectory and gene expression (SCT) was achieved using the ‘plot_cells' and ‘plot_genes_in_pseudotime' functions in the Monocle3 package. Differential expression analysis for genes was conducted using the ‘graph_test' function within Monocle3. The modular expression trends of DEGs were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap package in R47.

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the pseudotime analysis process are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice.

Pseudobulk methods, which aggregate cell-level counts for subpopulations of interest on a per-sample basis, have been identified as top performers for cross-condition comparisons in scRNA-seq48,49. Hence, we used a pseudobulk approach implemented in muscat (multi-sample multi-group scRNA-seq analysis tools)48.

Differential expression analysis was conducted for our non-compacted soil-based samples versus gel-based samples, as well as for our compacted soil-based samples versus non-compacted soil-based samples. Pseudobulk expression profiles for individual cell types in each sample were aggregated for these subpopulations by summing the raw counts (RNA assay) using the ‘aggregateData' function. Subsequently, differential expression testing was performed using the edgeR method50 incorporated in the ‘pbDS' function. A gene was considered differentially expressed in a given subpopulation if the false discovery rate adjusted P value was less than or equal to 0.05, absolute fold change was greater than or equal to 1.5, and detection frequency was greater than or equal to 10% in any of the included conditions. GO enrichment analysis was carried out on the DEGs using the R package gprofiler2 (ref. 51). Visualizations were generated using Seurat45, ComplexHeatmap47 and ggplot2 (ref. 52). The full tables containing gene-expression trends and GO term enrichment information for all detected genes and GO terms from the scRNA-seq data comparison across various growth conditions is available in Supplementary Data 10.

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the pseudobulk differential expression analysis process are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice.

The spatial transcriptomic sample preparation followed the protocol provided by Resolve Biosciences, with minor adjustment. Root parts of rice seedlings were isolated and fixed in a paraformaldehyde (PFA)-Triton-X solution: 4% [w/v] PFA (Sigma, catalogue no. 158127) and 0.03% Triton-X (Fisher Sci, catalogue no. AC327371000) in 1× PBS solution. The fixation was conducted within a 20-ml glass scintillation vial (Fisher Sci, catalogue no. 03-340-25N). The vial, containing rice roots, was placed on ice under a vacuum chamber. Vacuum was applied to the rice roots for 10 min, and this was repeated four times. Subsequently, the rice roots were rinsed with 1× PBS and dehydrated with an ethanol gradient (15, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100%), each concentration for 1 h on ice. The roots were then kept in 100% ethanol overnight.

For clearing the roots, a mixture of ethanol and Histo-clear (VWR, catalogue no. 101412-878) was applied in the following concentrations: 100% ethanol, 75% ethanol + 25% Histo-clear, 50% ethanol + 50% Histo-clear, 25% ethanol + 75% Histo-clear and 2× 100% Histo-clear, each for 1 h. The Histo-clear was then aspirated, and the vial was filled halfway with a mixture of 100% Histo-clear and melted paraplast (Leica, catalogue no. 39601006). The roots were included overnight at precisely 60 °C. The top half of Histo-clear was later replaced with paraplast, following an embedding routine that involved exchanging the top half of the embedding solution twice a day for 2 or 3 days until the sample stayed at the bottom of the containers.

The embedded roots were then mounted into plastic tissue embedding moulds (VWR, catalogue no. 15160-339) with properly adjusted orientation using flamed forceps. Paraplast-embedded roots were cut into 10-µm sections. These root tissue sections were transferred to cover slips provided by Resolve Biosciences, and the cover slip was placed in a slide dryer at 42 °C overnight. To prevent detachment issues, the cover slip could be placed in a 60 °C incubator for 5–30 min before proceeding to the next step.

Tissue sections mounted were deparaffinized with Histo-clear (100% Histo-clear, 100% Histo-clear, 25% ethanol + 75% Histo-clear, 50% ethanol + 50% Histo-clear, 75% ethanol + 25% Histo-clear, 100% ethanol). This was followed by rehydration with an ethanol gradient (100, 90, 80, 70, 50, 30%). The tissue was then permeabilized with proteinase K (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 25530049) buffer: 10 µm ml−1 Proteinase K, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA) and a 0.2% [w/v] glycine (Promega, catalogue no. H5073) solution. The tissue was also refixed with a 4% [w/v] PFA solution and acetylated with an acetylation solution: 0.1 M triethanolamine (Sigma, 90279), 0.5% [v:v] acetic anhydride (Sigma, catalogue no. 320102) and 0.4% [v:v] HCl in 1× PBS. Dehydration with an ethanol gradient (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100%) followed.

Finally, SlowFade antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, catalogue no. S36967) was applied to the tissue, and the cover slip where the tissue sections were mounted was covered with another cover slip. A slide box was used to store the cover slips with root tissue, tightly sealed with parafilm and shipped with dry ice to Resolve Biosciences for messenger RNA (mRNA) detection and imaging, with Molecular Cartography technique.

In brief, preserved mRNA molecules were hybridized with specifically designed probes based on sequence complementarity. Each probe contained a long tail with many binding sites for various fluorescent dyes. These long tails facilitated several rounds of imaging of the same probe with different fluorescent colours, generating a unique barcode for each individual gene.

The probe–mRNA complexes were sequentially coloured, imaged and decoloured for several imaging rounds. Fluorescent signal images captured on the root tissue sections were processed to identify individual mRNA molecules. Detected mRNAs corresponding to the same gene were assigned a unified identity and false-coloured for clear visualization and presentation.

The raw data for the spatial transcriptomic data included in Figs. 1–3, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 5 can be found in Supplementary Data 4 (gel), Supplementary Data 6 (non-compacted soils) and Supplementary Data 8 (compacted soils).

The Resolve Biosciences dataset comprises both stained root images and transcript detection profiles. Staining images using Calcofluor white to visualize cell boundaries were processed using the ImageJ app provided by Resolve Biosciences. The Molecular Cartography plugin facilitated the visualization of mRNA detection. Transcript information was stored in a .txt file, which could be loaded using the Molecular Cartography plugin. Specific genes with mRNA detection were selected, and each assigned unique colours and dot diameters. The resulting mRNA detection images were saved as screenshots. Subsequently, image brightness and contrast were adjusted using the auto-setting in ImageJ, for presentation.

It is notable that the detected mRNA levels in roots grown in compacted soils were considerably lower compared to those grown in gel and non-compacted soil conditions. We suspect this may be due to reduced fixation efficiency. Roots grown in compacted soils undergo radial expansion, enhanced barrier formation and increased mucilage secretion (data not shown), all of which probably hinder formaldehyde penetration into inner cell layers. As a result, mRNA preservation efficiency is diminished, particularly for markers in the stele tissue. Despite these challenges, we successfully identified roughly 20 robust cell type-specific markers under compacted soil conditions, as detailed in Supplementary Data 8.

Root tips (roughly 1 cm) from Xkitaake rice varieties were harvested from gel, non-compacted and compacted soil conditions, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RNA isolation, root tips were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, followed by the addition of 1 ml of RLT buffer to the powdered tissue. RNA was then isolated and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw reads were processed by removing adapter sequences and filtering out low-quality nucleotides (base quality lower than 5). HISAT2 was used to align reads to the Oryza sativa (Japonica) genome, and gene-expression levels were quantified using the fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million mapped reads) method. Differential gene expression (log2 fold change greater than or equal to 1.0) was analysed through read count normalization, model-dependent P value estimation (Padj ≤ 0.05), and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment.

A 4% agarose gel was prepared and poured into a square petri dish, allowing it to cool for 2 min. Rice roots were then embedded in the gel for 45 min. Subsequently, the agarose block containing the root tips was radially sectioned with a razor. Transverse sections, each with a thickness of 500 µm at 0.7 cm from the root tips, were transferred to slides. Calcofluor white staining, at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1, was applied to the transverse sections on slides for 1 min. After aspirating the staining solution, a drop of sterilized water was added on top of the sections. The root transverse sections were imaged using Zeiss 880 Confocal microscopy (excitation wavelength 405 nm, emission wavelength 410–585 nm). For data collection with the confocal microscopy, we used Zen 2009 v.6.0.0.303.

The acquired confocal images in CZI format were converted to TIF format and opened with MorphoGraphX53. The images underwent the following processing steps: (1) Gaussian blur with x-sigma, y-sigma and z-sigma set to 1 µm. (2) Edge detect with a threshold of 100, multiplier of 2, adapt factor of 0.3 and fill value of 30,000. (3) Fill holes with the x and y radii both set to 10, threshold of 10,000, depth of 0 and fill value of 30,000. (4) Marching cube surface with a cube size of 5 µm and a threshold of 2,000. (5) Subdivide meshes and smooth meshes until the final vertices number was close to 700,000. (6) Project signal with minimum distance of 18, maximum distance of 22, minimum signal of 0 and maximum signal of 60,000.

The resulting mesh files, representing the sample structure, were then manually segmented to identify individual cells. The mesh number in segmented cells facilitated the final quantification of cell areas.

Rice roots (WT (cv Nipponbare), mhz5, aba1 and aba2) grown for 3 days under ± compaction conditions were gently removed from the 3D-printed soil columns, cleaned using deionized water and a thin brush, and embedded in 4% melted agarose. The agarose blocks containing the roots were then positioned in a vibratome (Leica), cut into 100-µm thick primary root cross-sections (1–1.5 cm or 2–2.5 cm behind the root tip), and stored in 20% ethanol. For lignin staining, the cross-sections were incubated for 10 min in a 0.2% solution of basic fuchsin dissolved in ClearSee54 and mixed 1:1 with aqueous calcofluor white to stain cell walls55. The stained cross-sections were quickly rinsed with ClearSee and then washed for 1.5 h in fresh ClearSee, replacing the solution halfway through.

For suberin staining, the primary root cross-sections were stained for 10 min in a 0.01% fluorol yellow solution dissolved in pure ethanol, prepared from a 1% fluorol yellow solution dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The stained cross-sections were rinsed once with deionized water and incubated for 10 min in aqueous calcofluor white. Finally, the cross-sections were washed 2–3 times in 50% ethanol for 20 min.

For confocal imaging, primary root tip cross-sections stained for lignin or suberin were mounted in a drop of ClearSee or 50% glycerol, respectively, and positioned on a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope. The excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) settings used were as follows: basic fuchsin, 561 nm (Ex), 600–650 nm (Em); calcofluor white, 405 nm (Ex), 425–475 nm (Em); fluorol yellow, 488 nm (Ex) and 520–550 nm (Em). For both basic fuchsin or fluorol yellow with calcofluor white, a sequential scanning was configured with the corresponding settings mentioned above.

The dried root tips (WT (cultivar Nipponbare) and mhz5 mutant root tips) were grinded into a fine powder using a microcentrifuge tube with two metal beads (3 mm) for 1 min 30 s at 20 Hz, and then solvent extracted with sequential extractions of water (1 ml, 30 min, 98 °C), ethanol (1 ml, 30 min, 76 °C), chloroform (1 ml, 30 min, 59 °C) and acetone (1 ml, 30 min, 54 °C). The extract-free samples were dried under vacuum (overnight, 50 °C) and considered as cell wall residue.

Acetyl bromide lignin was determined as previously described56 with modifications. In brief, 1–2 mg of cell wall residue was incubated in 200 µl of acetyl bromide solution (25% acetyl bromide in glacial acetic acid) in a 2-ml Eppendorf for 3 h at 50 °C. After cooling the samples on ice, 360 µl of 2 M NaOH, 65 µl of 0.5 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 375 ml of glacial acetic acid were added. After centrifuging for 5 min at 14,000g, 50 µl of supernatant and 150 µl of acetic acid were added to wells of a 96-well ultraviolet transparent plate (Thermo Scientific). The absorption was measured at 280 nm with a microtitre plate reader (Microplate-reader SpectraMax 250, Sopachem), SoftMax Pro v.5 was used for collecting data and applying the extinction coefficient for grasses 17.75 g l−1 cm−1. Two technical replicates of each biological replicate were analysed.

Rice seedlings (either WT or mhz5), grown for 3 days under ±compaction, were gently removed from the three-dimensionally printed soil columns. They were then delicately brushed with deionized water to remove soil particles, and the diameter of each seminal root was measured. The primary root of each seedling (4–6 seedlings were used for each replicate) was cut into a 3-cm segment, including the root tip. After gently blotting with paper towels, each segment was positioned inside a five-digit balance closed chamber (Automatic balance, Mettler Toledo) over a thin nylon mesh. The cut ends of the segments were sealed using vacuum grease (Dow Corning) before placing them in the balance.

After 1 min of equalization inside the chamber, the fresh weight was recorded and subsequently, the weight was recorded every 30 s for up to 25–30 min. A constant relative humidity was maintained by adding bags with silica gel, which maintained the relative humidity inside the chambers at 30–35%. The silica gel was replaced after every three replicates. The temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a digital logger. Following the measurements, the root segments were wrapped and preweighed in aluminium foil and placed inside a 65 °C oven for 48 h to obtain the dry mass. The dry mass was subtracted from the initial fresh mass to obtain the total water content of each replicate. Water loss at every time point was recorded to plot the cumulative water loss (percentage of total water content). The length and diameter of the roots were used to calculate the total lateral surface, and the water loss at each time point was divided by this value to obtain the radial water loss rates (µmol m−2 s−1).

Phonon microscopy is an optical elastography technique that uses the phenomenon of Brillouin scattering to probe mechanical information in biological specimens with subcellular resolution. Phonon microscopy photoacoustically stimulates GHz frequency coherent acoustic phonons that, as they propagate through the specimen, periodically modulate the local refractive index that induces resonant optical scattering of a probe laser57. Through conservation of energy, the Brillouin scattered probe photons are frequency shifted by the phonon frequency (the so-called Brillouin frequency shift) and this can be detected either using a high-resolution spectrometer as with Brillouin microscopy58, or interferometrically in the time domain59.

Phonon microscopy is capable of measuring a specimen's mechanical properties through the relationship between the measured Brillouin frequency shift (fB) and the sound velocity (v):

for normal optical incidence where n is the refractive index and λprobe is the optical probing wavelength. Provided n is known a priori, a measurement of the Brillouin frequency shift infers a measurement of the local sound velocity, which is determined by the elasticity of the specimen in the form of the longitudinal elastic modulus (\(M={\rho v}^{2}\)).

An absolute measurement of M requires knowledge about the mass density; however, refractive index and mass density of plant cells have been shown to vary substantially less than inter-specimen and inter-environmental variation in elasticity60. In this work, we use the relative difference in Brillouin frequency shift (\(\Delta {f}_{{\rm{B}}}\)) between the cell wall and the water:ethanol filled cytoplasm as a proxy for the relative difference in cell wall elasticity in compacted and non-compacted conditions. It is worth noting that the longitudinal modulus should not be directly compared with the Young's modulus, as the two describe elasticity at very different time and frequency scales (for example, Hz to kHz deformations compared with GHz); however, it has been shown that there is an empirical relationship between the two quantities61.

The harvested and cleaned root tips (1.5 cm) were embedded in 4% molten agarose within a three-dimensionally printed root tip cassette. Agarose blocks containing the root tips were sectioned transversely into 50-µm slices. These root cross-sections were fixed in 20% ethanol for phonon imaging experiments. A cross-section was laid flat onto a photoacoustic transducer (200-nm thick partially transparent metal:dielectric cavity on a 170-µm sapphire cover slip), covered in roughly 50–100 µl of water:ethanol medium and then topped with a glass cover slip. Residual medium was wicked away and the cover slip sandwich was sealed shut using varnish.

Once placed into the phonon microscope, a region of interest was selected (for example, the endodermis) and a 2D raster scan was performed. A phonon time-of-flight signal was detected at each spatial pixel position, and the relative Brillouin frequency shift (ΔfB) and the acoustic attenuation (αB) were measured for each pixel using a fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7i,j and k,l, respectively). The spatial resolution of the technique will be determined by the optical diffraction limit (a function of optical wavelength and numerical aperture), and in this case was roughly 300 nm. This is greater than the expected thickness of the cell wall, and so the technique is probing the average elasticity of the sample volume weighted by the optical intensity distribution.

To isolate the endodermal region of interest, the Brillouin and attenuation maps were manually segmented based on positioning, morphology and size. From these segmented datasets, ΔfB versus αB cluster maps were generated and then segmented using a two-component Gaussian mixture model. This grouped the data into two clusters that were labelled ‘background' and ‘cell wall'. Intervals of roughly 70% confidence were determined within these clusters and mean ΔfB and αB values were calculated. The distributions identified through the two-component Gaussian mixture model are in good agreement with the spatial positions of the cell walls and cytoplasm regions.

Using the above methodology, we report in Extended Data Fig. 7n that the relative Brillouin frequency shifts in compacted endodermal cell walls are statistically significantly greater than the equivalent cell walls grown in non-compacted conditions (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the measurements extracted from the cytoplasm regions can be used as a control, and a Yuen's t-test indicates that the two groups are not statistically significantly different (P > 0.05). These data indicate that the compacted cell walls have greater elasticity than those grown in non-compacted soils.

a, UMAP with annotations for rice root developmental stages. The cells labelled as “Maturation-1” and “Maturation-2” cannot be distinguished at this stage due to the current limitations in our knowledge. b, Correlation analysis between 12 scRNA-seq datasets. The dataset, tz1 and tz2 are from Zhang et al. Nature Communication 2021. The datasets, starting with “sc_” represent single-cell datasets from the current study. The relatively low correlation observed between “sc_” and “tz” samples could be attributable to differences in cultivars and growth conditions. c, UMAP of epidermal cell populations. Colors indicate groups of equally sized bins based on inferred pseudotime from R-Monocle3 pseudotime analysis. d, UMAP of epidermal cell types of rice primary root. e, Heatmap showing gene expression pattern during differentiation of rice root epidermal cells. Three genes with different expression enrichment timing are highlighted. f-h, Expression curve of selected trichoblast markers along the pseudotime trajectory. i-k, UMAP showing the expression pattern of three selected epidermal cell specific genes.

a, Schematics illustrating the experimental procedures of spatial transcriptomics. Rice roots were fixed with formaldehyde and sectioned to a thickness of 10 μm. Preserved mRNA molecules were hybridized with specifically designed probes based on sequence complementarity. Each probe contained a long tail with multiple binding sites for various fluorescent dyes. These long tails facilitated multiple rounds of imaging of the same probe with different fluorescent colors, generating a unique barcode for each individual gene. The probe-mRNA complexes were sequentially colored, imaged, and de-colored for multiple imaging rounds. Fluorescent signal images captured on the root tissue sections were processed to identify individual mRNA molecules. Detected mRNAs corresponding to the same gene were assigned a unified identity and false-colored for clear visualization and presentation. b-j, Spatial expression pattern of identified cell type specific markers in both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. The root transverse section anatomy illustration is displayed in the bottom right corner of panel a. The insets provide a magnified view (2X) of the target region to enhance visualization of the detected mRNA signals. For the images representing the expression of endodermis marker POEI32, LOC_Os01g67390, arrows indicate the dislodgement of the endodermal layer. Magenta signal for vascular tissue marker expression is also shown to better indicate where the endodermis is. See also Supplementary Data. 3 and 4 for more gene expression data. n = 9 biological replicates for gel-grown root transverse section spatial transcriptomic data. Scale bars: 25 μm. Marker annotations: Atrichoblast: LOC_Os01g50820, OsNRT2.3; LOC_Os01g64840, NEP1_NEPGR Aspartic proteinase nepenthesin-1; Trichoblast: LOC_Os01g11750, OsGELP9; LOC_Os06g48050, Expressed protein; Exodermis: LOC_Os03g02460, Short-chain dehydrogenase TIC 32; LOC_Os06g17260, OsUGT; Sclerenchyma: LOC_Os05g46610, OsRLM1; LOC_Os08g05520, OsMYB103; Cortex: LOC_Os06g30730, OsABCG14; LOC_Os05g33080, Probable serine/threonine-protein kinase PBL7; Endodermis: LOC_Os03g18640, OsLAC12; LOC_OS01g67390, OsCOG2; Vascular tissue: LOC_Os02g56510, OsPHO1.2 LOC_Os07g44060, Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase family protein; Phloem: LOC_Os08g04400, Pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein; LOC_Os01g52480, Senescence/dehydration-associated protein; Xylem: LOC_Os01g48130, OsSND2; LOC_Os10g32980, OsCesA7.

a, UMAP visualization of cell distribution in the integrative scRNA-seq object, which includes gel-based, non-compacted-soil-based and compacted-soil-based scRNA-seq data. Major cell type cluster annotation is based on the expression of cell type marker genes. For cell clusters in the maturation stage, there was no clear enrichment of any cell type-specific markers. This lack of distinction may be attributed to the convergent nature of mature root cells, a phenomenon also observed in our gel-based scRNA-seq atlas (Fig. 1b). At this stage, due to the absence of markers for mature root cells, we provisionally annotated the large group of cells as “mature root cells”. b, UMAP visualization of 55 cell clusters in the integrative scRNA-seq object, which includes gel-based, non-compacted-soil-based and compacted-soil-based scRNA-seq data. The z-scores (expression enrichment score) of major cell type markers were calculated for each cluster. We used the marker expression patterns (Supplementary Data 4, 6, 8) and the z-score maximum (Supplementary Table 4) to assign each cluster to different cell types. It is noteworthy that the number of captured epidermal cells (Atrichoblast and Trichoblast, cluster 39 and cluster 55) was significantly low under non-compacted soil conditions. To rule out the possibility that we accidentally filtered out epidermal cells as low-quality cells during scRNA-seq data processing with COPILOT, we examined the low-quality cell data. However, we did not observe any evident cell type enrichment in the low-quality cells, suggesting that epidermal cells were not erroneously filtered out as low-quality cells (Supplementary Data 9). c, UMAP visualization of cell distribution in the integrative scRNA-seq object. The high overlap level among almost all the cells indicates the similarity of scRNA-seq data originated from different growth conditions. d, Cell proportion of 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both gel conditions and non-compacted soil conditions. Despite gentle cleaning of soil particles from root tips, a significant number of epidermal cells were likely removed, potentially altering the proportions of trichoblast and atrichoblast cells under different growth conditions. Growth condition itself does not change the trichoblast cell proportion dramatically. Details can be checked in Extended Data Fig. 4i-k. There is a notable increase of exodermis and sclerenchyma cell number in non-compacted-soils samples compared to that in gel conditions. e, Cell proportion of 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both non-compacted soil and compacted soil conditions. The limited number of trichoblast cells detected under soil condition could be due to the cleaning of soil particles from root tips. f, Correlation analysis among the transcriptomic profiles of cells from 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both gel conditions and non-compacted soil conditions. Low correlation was detected for the trichoblast cells, possibly due to the limited number of annotated root hair cells. g, Correlation analysis among the transcriptomic profiles of cells from 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages (meristem and matured root cells) in both non-compacted soil conditions and compacted soil conditions. Low correlation was detected for the trichoblast cells, possibly due to the limited number of annotated root hair cells. h, Correlation analysis included 8 scRNA-seq datasets. The datasets sc_192 to sc_195 are gel-based scRNA-seq samples. The datasets sc_199 and sc_200 are for non-compacted soil samples while sc_201 and sc_202 are for compacted-soil samples. Although the correlation between gel-based and soil-based samples is high, they can still be distinguished from each other based on their differential expression pattern. i-k, Representative images (maximum projection) of pOsCSLD1::VENUS-N7 expressing rice primary roots in gel, non-compacted (NC, 1.2 g/cm3) and compacted (CMP, 1.6 g/cm3) soil conditions. 3 days old rice roots were harvested from gel, and ± compacted soils. Soil grown samples were cleaned and fixed in 4% PFA (washed 5 times in PFA) and cleared for one day in ClearSee. Cleared root tips were imaged under SP8 confocal microscope. n = 3 biological replicates (roots), all showing similar trends. Scale bars represent 100 μm.

Source Data

a, UMAP projection of scRNA-seq from roots grown in gel, and roots grown in non-compacted (NC) soils of a non-transgenic, Kitaake genotype. Colors indicate cell type annotation. b, Correlation analysis between 8 scRNA-seq datasets; gel-based scRNA-seq Xkitaake (sc_192 to sc_195), non-compacted-soil-based Xkitaake (sc_199), gel-based scRNA-seq Kitaake (sc_303 and sc_304) and non-compacted-soil-based Kitaake (sc_305 and sc_306) samples. High correlation values (>0.94) between Xkitaake and Kitaake scRNA-seq profiles, support their overall gene expression similarities. c, The GO term of “Phosphorus metabolic process”, “Vesicle-mediated transport”, “Hormone signalling pathway”, and “Cell wall organization” are still the top enriched GO term for the up-regulated genes in Kitaake in contrasting growth conditions, sterilized gel vs natural soils. The absence of enrichment for the GO term “Defense response” in Kitaake suggests that the XA21 transgene enhances defense responses in Xkitaake under changing growth conditions. The similarity in enriched GO terms for upregulated genes at outer root cells (highlighted with the red box) when the growth condition was changed from homogeneous gel to heterogeneous soils suggests that enhanced nutrient uptake and strengthened cell wall integrity in outer cell layers are common strategies for roots to cope with soil stresses. The one-tailed hypergeometric test with g:Profiler2 g:SCS (Set Counts and Sizes) algorithm for multiple comparison correction was used for the p-value calculation. d,e, Heatmap shows enhanced expression of genes involved in cell wall integrity and nutrient uptake in soil conditions (compared to gel) in Kitaake genotype. The similar induction of genes related to nutrient uptake and cell wall integrity in outer root cells (highlighted with the red box) suggests that Xkitaake and Kitaake respond similarly to the growth condition changes. This further validates that the major trends identified through scRNA-seq analysis on Xkitaake are independent of the XA21 transgene. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis. Annotation for the included genes: Cell wall integrity: LOC_Os01g56130, Xyloglucan glycosyltransferase 1; LOC_Os02g51060, Glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase 6; LOC_Os09g25900, Xyloglucan glycosyltransferase 2; LOC_Os03g18910, COBRA-like protein 7; LOC_Os11g33270, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase; LOC_Os03g21250, Galacturonosyl transferase7. Nutrient uptake: LOC_Os06g37010, Zinc transporter 10; LOC_OS11g12740, NRT1; LOC_Os10g30770, Inorganic phosphate transporter; LOC_Os12g37840, Boron transporter 1. f, Heatmap showing the induced expression of R (resistance) genes predominantly in outer cells in Xkitaake genotype in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. The R genes were induced when growth conditions shift to natural soils in Xkitaake, particularly in the outer cell layers, indicating the significant role of outer cell layers in the root's adaptation to soil environments. g, Heatmap showing the induced expression of R (resistance) genes in Kitaake genotype in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. The R genes were also induced when grown in natural soils in Kitaake, although the outer cell layer enrichment is not detected in Kitaake background. h, UMAP projection of scRNA-seq from Xkitaake and Kitaake roots grown in non-compacted soils. Colors indicate cell type annotation. i, Heatmap showing expression pattern of R genes in Xkitaake and Kitaake genotypes grown in soil conditions. The R genes show higher expression in Xkitaake roots grown under soil conditions compared to Kitaake roots grown under the same conditions. This suggests that the induction of R genes in soil conditions (compared to gel) can be further enhanced by the XA21 transgene. However, XA21 is not essential for this induction, as it is also observed in the Kitaake background. j, Heatmap showing the induced expression of the other defense response related genes in Xkitaake in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. Other defense response related genes show increased expression when compared in gel vs soil conditions in Xkitaake background. However, these genes do not exhibit a stronger induction pattern specifically in the outer cell layers. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis. k, Heatmap showing expression pattern of other defense response-related genes in Kitaake genotype in gel versus soil conditions. This analysis suggests that even in the absence of XA21, defense-related genes show increased expression in soil conditions compared to gel conditions. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis.

The complete list of gene ID and annotations are included in Supplementary Table 14. e, Left panel: Heatmap showing differential expression (log2 fold change) of water stress responsive genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soils in Xkitaake as revealed by scRNA-seq analysis. scRNA-seq showed increased expression patterns for genes relevant to response to water stress, with stronger induction at outer cell layers (highlighted by the red box), suggesting the enhanced water stress response at outer cell layer under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of water stress responsive genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA seq further supported the upregulation of genes relevant to response to water stress. Bulk RNA-seq analysis was carried out using three independent biological replicates for non-compacted (NC rep #1-3) and compacted (CMP rep #1-3) soil conditions. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis. f, GO terms for the down-regulated genes in exodermis under compacted soils as compared to non-compacted soils. g, GO terms for the up-regulated genes in endodermis under compacted soils as compared to non-compacted soils. h, GO terms for the down-regulated genes in endodermis under compacted soils as compared to non-compacted soils.

Enhanced expression of suberin and lignin biosynthesis genes in exodermis (highlighted by the red box), suggest higher suberin and lignin accumulation in exodermis under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of suberin/lignin biosynthesis genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq.

Source Data

a, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Xyloglucan biosynthesis genes are broadly upregulated across major cell types, with a slightly higher induction observed in the exodermis. The stronger induction of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in the exodermis aligns with the observed barrier reinforcement. NC: Non-compacted soils. CMP: Compacted soils. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq also reveals a general induction of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in compacted soils. The upregulation of these genes suggests enhanced cell wall reinforcement in response to compacted soil conditions. b, Left panel: Heatmap showing differential expression (log2 fold change) of cellulose synthase (CESA) genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Notably, CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 exhibit increased gene expression in sclerenchyma, suggesting enhanced secondary cell wall formation in this tissue under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of CESA genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Interestingly, bulk RNA seq reveals a general down-regulation of CESA genes in compacted soils, although the decrease is subtle for most examined genes. The relatively stronger down-regulation of CESA1, CESA5, and CESA6, combined with the relatively weaker down-regulation of CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8, may suggest a transition toward secondary cell wall deposition. c, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of expansin genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Increased expression of expansin genes, particularly in the exodermis and cortex cell layers, suggests the enhanced cell expansion at exodermis and cortex under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of expansin genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq further supports the upregulation of expansin genes in compacted soil conditions. The up-regulation of expansin genes correlates with the radial expansion of rice roots in response to soil compaction. d, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of xylanase inhibitor genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Xylanase inhibitor genes are broadly upregulated across major cell types. As xylanase inhibitor is tightly relevant to defense response, it further suggests that soil compaction could induce defense response in rice root. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of xylanase inhibitor encoding genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq analysis further supports the upregulation of xylanase inhibitor genes in compacted soil conditions. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis.

Red and blue colors indicate bigger and smaller cells, respectively. n = 3 biological replicates (roots), all showing similar trends. Scale bar: 50 μm. g, The quantification of exodermal cell areas in the root transverse sections. For the heatmap, red and blue indicate bigger and smaller cells, respectively. Segmented cells are outlined in cyan and superimposed on the meshed surface where the cell wall signals are projected (greyscale). n = 3 biological replicates (roots), all showing similar trends. Scale bar: 50 μm. h, The histogram showing the cell area distribution of exodermal cell under both non-compacted and compacted soil conditions. 3 biological replicates (roots) are included. i,j, Non-compacted and compacted (respectively) endodermal region maps of the Brillouin frequency shift (relative to the shift in the cytoplasm ΔfB = 0) demonstrating apparent greater cell-wall stiffness in the compacted case. The primary roots were harvested from compacted and non-compacted soils were radially sectioned and imaged using Brillouin microscopy. k,l, Similarly, maps of acoustic attenuation between the two cases demonstrate greater apparent longitudinal viscosity in the compacted soil conditions. Scale bars in i and k: 10 μm; Scale bar in j and l: 10 μm. m, Brightfield image of a rice root radial cross-section (red boxes are the relevant regions of interest in i-l). Scale bar: 50 μm. n, Violin plot showing the cell wall stiffness of rice primary root in compacted and non-compacted soil conditions. The width of each violin represents the kernel density estimation of the data distribution. The solid line within each violin denotes the median, while the dashed lines represent the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3). Q1 corresponds to the 25th percentile of the data, and Q3 corresponds to the 75th percentile. Yuen's t-tests (two-tailed) indicate that there is no statistically significant (NS, p value = 0.7500) relative shift in Brillouin frequency between the cytoplasm (control) regions in non-compacted (NC) and compacted (C) specimens. However, there is a clear frequency shift between endodermal cell-walls between the two cases (p value < 1.0000 × 10−10; *: p < 0.05) indicating greater elasticity for compacted cell-walls. Four cross-sections for each case of compacted and non-compacted were imaged containing 35 and 44 cells respectively. For cell wall measurements, n = 1744 (non-compaction, endodermis), 1843 (compaction, endodermis), 11852 (non-compaction, cytoplasm), and 17592 (compaction, cytoplasm) units, were analyzed respectively.

a, The bulk RNA sequencing data for root tissues protoplasted for 2.5 h show a strong correlation with those for root tissues protoplasted for 3 h (Pearson correlation values > 0.99). b, Only a limited number of genes exhibit differential expression between root tissues protoplasted for 2.5 h and 3 h. To avoid introducing potential artifacts from protoplasting into our comparative analysis of scRNA-seq data from roots grown in gel and soil conditions, we excluded the 232 differentially expressed genes identified here from the scRNA-seq data analysis.

Metrics details

Precision nutrition is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of scientific research and innovation with the potential to deliver health, societal and economic benefits by improving healthcare delivery and policies. Advances in deep phenotyping technologies, digital tools and artificial intelligence have made possible early proof-of-concept research that expands the understanding of within- and between-person variability in responses to diet. These studies illustrate the promise of precision nutrition to complement the traditional ‘one size fits all' dietary guidelines, which, while considering broad life-stage and disease-specific nutritional requirements, often lack the granularity to account fully for individual variations in nutritional needs and dietary responses. Despite these developments, however, considerable challenges remain before precision nutrition can be implemented on a broader scale. This Review examines the current state of precision nutrition research, with a focus on its application to reducing the incidence and burden of cardiometabolic diseases. We critically examine the evidence base, explore the potential benefits and discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","These Startups Are Building Advanced AI Models Without Data Centers","https://www.wired.com/story/these-startups-are-building-advanced-ai-models-over-the-internet-with-untapped-data/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Researchers have trained a new kind of large language model (LLM) using GPUs dotted across the world and fed private as well as public data—a move that suggests that the dominant way of building artificial intelligence could be disrupted.

Flower AI and Vana, two startups pursuing unconventional approaches to building AI, worked together to create the new model, called Collective-1.

Flower created techniques that allow training to be spread across hundreds of computers connected over the internet. The company's technology is already used by some firms to train AI models without needing to pool compute resources or data. Vana provided sources of data including private messages from X, Reddit, and Telegram.

Collective-1 is small by modern standards, with 7 billion parameters—values that combine to give the model its abilities—compared to hundreds of billions for today's most advanced models, such as those that power programs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Nic Lane, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and cofounder of Flower AI, says that the distributed approach promises to scale far beyond the size of Collective-1. Lane adds that Flower AI is partway through training a model with 30 billion parameters using conventional data, and plans to train another model with 100 billion parameters—close to the size offered by industry leaders—later this year. “It could really change the way everyone thinks about AI, so we're chasing this pretty hard,” Lane says. He says the startup is also incorporating images and audio into training to create multimodal models.

Distributed model-building could also unsettle the power dynamics that have shaped the AI industry.

AI companies currently build their models by combining vast amounts of training data with huge quantities of compute concentrated inside data centers stuffed with advanced GPUs that are networked together using super-fast fiber-optic cables. They also rely heavily on datasets created by scraping publicly accessible—although sometimes copyrighted—material, including websites and books.

The approach means that only the richest companies, and nations with access to large quantities of the most powerful chips, can feasibly develop the most powerful and valuable models. Even open source models, like Meta's Llama and R1 from DeepSeek, are built by companies with access to large data centers. Distributed approaches could make it possible for smaller companies and universities to build advanced AI by pooling disparate resources together. Or it could allow countries that lack conventional infrastructure to network together several data centers to build a more powerful model.

Lane believes that the AI industry will increasingly look towards new methods that allow training to break out of individual data centers. The distributed approach “allows you to scale compute much more elegantly than the data center model,” he says.

Helen Toner, an expert on AI governance at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, says Flower AI's approach is “interesting and potentially very relevant” to AI competition and governance. “It will probably continue to struggle to keep up with the frontier, but could be an interesting fast-follower approach,” Toner says.

Distributed AI training involves rethinking the way calculations used to build powerful AI systems are divided up. Creating an LLM involves feeding huge amounts of text into a model that adjusts its parameters in order to produce useful responses to a prompt. Inside a data center the training process is divided up so that parts can be run on different GPUs, and then periodically consolidated into a single, master model.

The new approach allows the work normally done inside a large data center to be performed on hardware that may be many miles away and connected over a relatively slow or variable internet connection.

Some big players are also exploring distributed learning. Last year, researchers at Google demonstrated a new scheme for dividing and consolidating computations called DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo) that enables more efficient distributed learning.

To build Collective-1 and other LLMs, Lane and academic collaborators in the UK and China developed a new tool called Photon that makes distributed training more efficient. Photon improves upon Google's approach, Lane says, with a more efficient approach to representing the data in a model and a more efficient scheme for sharing and consolidating training. The process is slower than conventional training but is more flexible, allowing new hardware to be added to ramp up training, Lane says.

Photon was developed in collaboration with researchers at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Zhejiang University in China. The group released the tool under an open source license last month, allowing anyone to make use of the approach.

Flower AI's partner in the effort to build Collective-1, Vana, is developing new ways for users to share personal data with AI builders. Vana's software allows users to contribute private data from platforms like X and Reddit to training a large language model, and potentially specify what kind of end uses are permitted or even benefit financially from their contributions.

Anna Kazlauskas, cofounder of Vana, says the idea is to make untapped data available for AI training and also to give users more control over how their information is used for AI. “This is data that isn't usually able to be included in AI models because it's not publicly available,” Kazlauskas says, “and is the first time that data directly contributed by users is being used to train a foundation model, with users given ownership of the AI model their data creates.”

Mirco Musolesi, a computer scientist at University College London, says a key benefit of the distributed approach to AI training is likely to be that it unlocks new kinds of data. “Scaling this to frontier models would allow the AI industry to leverage vast amounts of decentralized and privacy-sensitive data, for example in health care and finance, for training without the risks associated with data centralization,” he says.

Cold-brew coffee is the gentlest of coffee: pleasant and sweet, made for warm days and chill thoughts. And so the best coffee beans for cold brew are not necessarily the same ones that make the most interesting drip or pour-over or espresso. It's a different animal entirely from the volatile intensity of hot brew. Rather, it's extracted gently over 12 or 24 hours to release the bean's natural sweetness.

I have my own thoughts, of course. I've tested more than a dozen cold-brew coffee makers in the past year for WIRED's guide to the best cold-brew coffee makers. But few have wrestled with this question more intensely than Maciej Kasperowicz, director of coffee at Trade Coffee, one of WIRED's favorite coffee subscription companies. With his team, Kasperowicz spent months putting together 90 coffees best suited for cold brew, to be included in Trade's new cold-brew coffee subscription. Meanwhile, Brent Wolczynski, director of product development and cold brew at Portland's Stumptown Coffee, has built one of the most distinguished café and packaged cold-brew programs in the country.

We consulted Kasperowicz and Wolczynski to ask about which beans make for great cold-brew coffee, which ones don't, how you know, and the myths surrounding what makes for a good cold-brew cup.

First off, when I'm referring to cold brew, I don't necessarily mean all cold coffee. Cold brew is a process: the act of gently extracting coffee at room temperature or lower, over the course of hours instead of minutes. Most “instant” cold-brew makers are actually making something called iced coffee: hot coffee that's quickly chilled to avoid the bad flavors that come from letting coffee cool slowly. It's good but different, and it leads to different results: more aromatics but less smoothness and sweetness.

On a traditional cold-brew maker, the process is remarkably simple: Grind beans coarsely, put them in water, leave the mixture out on the counter or in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours, and wait. To make cold-brew concentrate that can then be diluted with water or milk, roll with a ratio of 4 or 5 to 1 by weight. (Ideally, use a kitchen or coffee scale. But 4 ounces of coffee to each pint of water will do.)

Oxo

Amazon

My favorite home cold-brew coffee maker, combining ease and convenience with excellent extraction and flavor, is the Oxo Compact cold-brew maker. For larger batches, use what restaurants and cafés use: a big ol' Toddy cold-brew maker ($49). For even more ease and ready-to-drink cold brew at lower concentration, you can try a basket-style brewer like the Hario Mizudashi ($18).

Cold brew is a process of extracting flavor over a long time, at low intensity, and so the results differ from hot brew. Gentle extraction means less volatility, less bitterness, and a focus on sweetness and fullness and big, round flavors.

Here's the best advice from Kasperowicz and Wolczynski on the best coffee beans for the best cold-brew coffee.

Medium-roast beans have the best balance: The Goldilocks roast level for cold brew is generally a medium-roast level, Kasperowicz says, and that's where you'll find the majority of the coffee bags among Trade's cold-brew collection. While light roasts offer bright flavors loved in craft coffee, they'll extract a little slower and less easily than a medium roast. “Darker roasts are slightly more soluble, is the theory,” Kasperowicz says, “and so it'll be a little easier for medium and darker roasts.” That said, lighter and medium roasts get more interesting aromatics, so it's a balancing game. “A nicely developed medium roast is the sweet spot for cold brew,” Wolczynski agreed. Neither argues for very dark roasts in cold brew, with Wolczynski in particular saying dark roasts tend to “fall flat.”

But lighter roasts can surprise you: “I've definitely had cold brew with high floral notes and fruit-forward acidity in African coffees that I've absolutely loved,” Wolczynski says. “If you want floral notes and sparkling acidity, Ethiopia Mordecofe ($23) is an African coffee that I'd highly recommend for cold brew … It will be a quenching, juicy cup and best enjoyed black."" One of the reasons I consulted Wolczynski about cold brew was, in fact, an occasional Stumptown Ethiopian Guji cold brew he first made long ago, which has topped many taste tests over the years.

Medium or darker for milk drinkers. Light roast only if you like it black: This is just a rule of thumb, but light roasts will be pretty subtle in cold-brew form, and you'll lose them to a blast of milk. Fuller-flavored medium-roast cold brew will be able to hold up better. “If you like a cup that stands up to milk, I'd go with a medium roast from Latin America,” Wolczynski says. “If you drink it black and prefer a brighter, more fruit-forward cup, lighter-roasted African coffees are great.”

Candy-bar flavors do really well in cold brews: “I think the cold-brew method is particularly good at highlighting sweetness, and high-quality medium-roast coffees tend to lend themselves to tasting notes like chocolate, caramel, etc.,” according to Wolczynski. “Those are also just super well-rounded profiles that can be enjoyed straight or with milk.” Kasperowicz says much the same. Cold brew doesn't always capture delicate aromatics, he says, but can really accentuate big and bold flavors like chocolate and caramel and nuts that are familiar from candy bars. “Coffees that just inherently have those flavors of chocolate—big kind of round bodies, big smooth flavors, lots of sweetness—those kinds of coffees with more kinds of caramelized flavors tend to do better.” Look on the bag of beans, he says, or the description on the roaster's website, for the flavor descriptions of the coffee.

Origins can also be a clue to finding these flavors. As a rule of thumb, Latin American coffees tend more toward chocolate, especially, so if you see “Brazil” on the bag it's a good sign. Kasperowicz calls out in particular a Brazilian bag from Atlanta's Portrait called Toni ($38 for 2 pounds)—a great example of a big, full-bodied, nutty, sweet, chocolate roast that does well in cold-brew form. East African roasts tend more often toward fruit and berry notes.

Balanced blends can offer the best of both worlds: Those big, fruity, bright flavors from single-origin Ethiopian coffees can come out strongly when roasted to medium or paired with chocolatey beans, Kasperowicz says. For Trade's cold-brew program, Kasperowicz selected a Cherry Picker blend ($38 for 2 pounds) of South American and East African beans from Colorado's Boxcar Roasting that tastes like chocolate-covered cherries. A PT's Coffee Roasting Cold Front blend ($38 for 2 pounds) likewise mixes Guatemalan and Ethiopian medium-roast beans to make coffee that tastes like rich, smooth blackberries and caramel. Stumptown offers a seasonal cold-brew blend, but the company's year-round Homestead ($15) offers a balanced brew as well.

Look on coffee bags for the words “full-bodied” or “rich”: This is a clue to full-flavored cold brew, Kasperowicz says. When coffee roasters describe their coffee as big, full-bodied, or round, this is a sign of a bean that's desperate to give up its secrets and so is more likely to extract fully and richly.

Think twice before using your most expensive beans: This is more advice for self-preservation. Cold brew requires more coffee beans per cup than drip or pour-over or espresso. Quite simply, you need a lot of course-ground coffee to make a serving size. Depending on how strong you make your cold brew, it may take about 50 percent more than you use for drip coffee. But cold brew is less likely to bring out the delicacy and complexity of that high-altitude, single-origin roast, says Kasperowicz. The resulting cold brew won't be bad. It might be terrific! But you'll get less out of those expensive beans than if you brew them hot. So if you value your pocketbook, look toward blends that have the big flavors that'll come through on a megaphone.

Fresh beans are still and always best: A weird myth going around is that old or stale beans are good for cold brew—perhaps because cold brew might be a little more forgiving of stale beans than hot brew. But fresh beans are best, Kasperowicz says without hesitation. Even though cold brew oxidizes more slowly, because it's cold, it does still take on those stale, cardboardy, sad flavors that come from exposure to oxygen. If you use stale beans, you'll get those flavors faster, and your cold brew will keep for less time in the fridge.

How about high altitudes? Are high-altitude beans better for cold brew? Despite claims by some companies, neither Kasperowicz nor Wolczynski think beans grown at high altitude have much to say about what's good for cold brew. Altitude is a sign of quality in general, or of more subtle flavors. But subtlety is not what cold brew is best at accentuating.

What about the best beans for iced coffee? Use whatever coffee you like for drip or espresso, pour it over ice, chill it fast, and you're there. No new considerations needed, Kasperowicz says. Wolczynski notes that iced coffee has a “tannic” structure that will let it hold up well against milk and ice but finds cold brew more “quenching when drunk black.”

Last week, the US Department of the Interior announced that it would speed up the approval process for certain fossil fuel projects, proclaiming that environmental analyses that previously would have taken years must now be taken down to, at maximum, a month. While the new procedures are seemingly a gift to the industry, this may actually be terrible news for pipeline developers, drillers, and miners.

“If I were a developer of any of these projects, I would look at this order and smack my forehead,” says Sam Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, the United States' biggest environmental nonprofit law organization. “I don't want my project to be authorized pursuant to these laughable procedures. It won't hold up in court.”

The new procedures use President Donald Trump's “national energy emergency,” proclaimed in an executive order in the first week of his presidency, to shorten timelines for federal reviews, including environmental reviews and reviews attached to cultural landmarks. Reviews that take into account a project's impact on the environment are particularly truncated under this new policy. Processes that would normally take a year, the Department of the Interior says, must now be completed within just two weeks, while those reviews that might last longer than a year must now be done in under a month.

Experts say, however, that the new timelines are so short that they almost certainly run afoul of the bedrock laws involved: the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Mass ongoing layoffs inside the federal government—including at Interior, where The Washington Post reported that a quarter of the agency's staff may eventually be cut—means that there may soon be far too few staff to handle reviews that would be near impossible to fulfill even in normal circumstances. This leaves any projects that try to break ground under the new timelines open to very easy legal challenges—something that Sankar says is “low-hanging fruit” for people who are impacted by a project and who want to take a developer to court.

“The people who wrote NEPA and the Endangered Species Act meant for the public to be involved, meant for real expertise to be applied, and meant for these to be meaningful ways to protect the environment and biodiversity,” Sankar says. “To shorten these periods to where you can barely get a letter from point A to point B in that time means that they're not trying to comply at all. The good news is that it's all so manifestly illegal that virtually anything they do under these new legal procedures will be ripe for a legal challenge.”

These fast-forwarded processes are tied to a part of NEPA that states that agencies can bypass environmental reviews in case of an emergency. Ryan Hathaway, who worked on NEPA-related issues within Interior for more than a decade, says that this emergency justification has been used in the past for concrete events that pose an immediate threat to health and public safety, like wildfires or floods, with specific actions that needed to be taken—rather than a vague and open-ended energy “emergency.”

“Lawyers are going to have a field day with this,” says Hathaway, who now works as a director at Lawyers for Good Government, a legal nonprofit dedicated to progressive advocacy.

It's clear these new rules are exclusively a gift to extractive industries like drilling and mining. Solar and wind projects—which the administration has repeatedly attacked, withdrawing leases for offshore wind and ordering a construction halt on projects already underway—are notably absent from the list of projects allowed to undergo accelerated timelines. But ironically, these orders are only contributing to an increasingly uncertain environment for fossil fuel producers under the new Trump administration.

Even before the chaos caused by Liberation Day, Big Oil faced a potential reckoning with the president it helped elect. While the shale oil boom of the early 2010s rewarded executives for increased production, that strategy led to too much supply, leading prices per barrel to drop during the first Trump administration. After prices bottomed out during the pandemic, investors became more careful about unrestrained production.

“It's not government regulation that's limiting the production growth rate in the United States. It's Wall Street,” says Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, DC.

The industry was given a boost in the early 2020s with the worldwide energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but investors kept a cautious eye on prices. Despite President Joe Biden's climate focus, the US oil and gas industry became the world's biggest crude oil producer in 2023, and reached a record high of producing 13.4 million barrels per day late last year. The challenge under the Trump administration would become balancing profitability with the president's goal of unleashing “energy dominance.” Trump, after all, has stated that he wants oil to drop to $50 a barrel—a price far too low to be profitable for the industry.

Each quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas publishes a regional report on the state of the oil and gas industry in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, which includes anonymous survey responses from executives. The vitriol towards the White House in these comments from the first survey of this year, published in late March, shocked analysts.

“The key word to describe 2025 so far is ‘uncertainty' and as a public company, our investors hate uncertainty,” one anonymous executive said. “This uncertainty is being caused by the conflicting messages coming from the new administration. There cannot be ‘US energy dominance' and $50 per barrel oil; those two statements are contradictory.”

""'Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” another wrote.

Trump has continued to hand out questionable gifts to industry. On Thursday, Interior announced that it had changed some policies around offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that could, according to the agency, increase production in the Gulf by up to 100,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, Interior is also reportedly assembling a list of fossil fuel deposits on public lands that it plans to open up for production.

Like the accelerated timelines for environmental permitting, these gifts come with significant strings attached. While the Gulf order will help companies currently producing to up their productivity, they're unlikely to lure new customers to the region: Offshore drilling is expensive, and four-fifths of the more than 2,000 active leases in the Gulf are sitting unused.

And while opening up public lands to drilling may sound like an industry wish-list item, companies faced with an uncertain American regulatory environment—from the looming threat of tariffs, to accelerated permitting timelines that could get projects held up in court, to promises made under a Republican administration that may be withdrawn the next time a Democrat is president—may not want to invest years and capital in starting up a project in a risky area.

“For more than a century, energy companies have looked at projects in part based on the host country's political risk, but the United States wasn't on that list,” Seigle says. “These days we see huge swings in political support for oil and gas, and the trend of reversing the prior administration's approach. So energy companies and their investors are now thinking about the political risk of energy projects right here at home.”

What I'm doing isn't technically cheating. But it does feel a lot like winning.

Factor (previously Factor 75) is the microwavable meal kit from meal delivery service HelloFresh (8/10 WIRED Recommends)—or at least, it is ever since the meal-kit giant acquired the Chicago-founded food brand in 2020. But for at least half my meals, I haven't been using the microwave. I'm using an air fryer, specifically the Ninja Crispi (7/10, WIRED Recommends) that allows me to put wet ingredients below the crisper plate, and proteins or potatoes atop the crisper.

And so now my potatoes are crisp and my pork chop and mushrooms took on some genuine browning, while the excess cream sauce heated beneath the crisper. As premade, reheatable meals go, this truffle mushroom pork chop plate from Factor is about as good as it gets. The pork is still a little juicy, not overdone even on the second heating. The cream sauce is cream sauce. The herb-crusted potatoes possess the air fryer equivalent of wok hei. But especially, the mushrooms maintained their integrity.

The Factor delivery meal kit is not cheap, I'll note; food that someone else has already cooked for you rarely is. Factor's meals are never frozen, but rather are prepared weekly in the company's commissary kitchens and shipped out in ice-packed boxes full of individually packaged, TV-dinner style trays that the company cutely likes to call “bentos.”

At full price, each of these meals can run from $12 to $15 apiece including shipping, with a minimum of six meals per week, though the company tends to offer steep discounts for the first week or month. You can choose among 45 meals weekly, each potentially tailored to vegetarian, carb-avoidant, calorie-restricted, or everything-goes options—with individually priced add-ons if you want, (excellent) smoothie delivery or (somewhat less excellent) breakfast.

The full-price meal option tends to fall in the price range less than most delivery food but far more than frozen TV dinners—comparable, perhaps, to the ready-to-heat meal boxes you might find in your local supermarket deli section.

The quality of that pork chop and potato plate was already a bit of a surprise, even though I'd gone off-script to improve it. But the tenderness, char, juiciness, and blessed pinkness of a chimichurri filet mignon slab was nothing short of startling, given that I'd cooked it in the microwave.

Factor fared well in general on the texture and character of its proteins, usually a tough ask for a reheated meal. Heated, frozen, then reheated chicken breast tends to have the character of wet chalk. A never-frozen chicken breast from Factor had the texture of … wait for it … chicken breast.

Factor's selling point over other ready-to-heat meal kits has always been twofold. One is that its meals are friendly to keto and other versions of high-protein and carb-conscious diets. The other is that its microwaveable meals have never been frozen, leaving open the possibility for actual texture in one's meal—a light crispness to the green beans, say. Or the grill char and soft give of a medium-rare filet mignon.

But in past years, those two selling points seemed to interfere with each other. Factor, noted my colleague Louryn Strampe in her 2024 assessment (6/10, WIRED Review), fell prey far too often to the porridgy and cauliflower-heavy “mush-on-mush” school of carb-avoidant fare. The food failed on texture, she wrote, in somewhat more colorful terms.

But ever since HelloFresh bought Factor, the menu has been slowly evolving to heartier fare with more chew and snap. Starches now veer to potato wedges, coconut lime rice, or al dente forbidden rice. The green beans, too often overdone even at restaurants, had a surprising and welcome tautness. (One can see this evolution by looking at old menus through the magic lens of Wayback Machine.)

Over time, Factor has evolved into the best ready-to-heat meal delivery service I've so far tasted.

But this isn't to say Factor has solved the issues inherent to ready-made delivery meals. There's the cost, of course, more than most could afford as a full substitute for cooking: A full week of lunch and dinner for one would run about $170, with shipping.

And pre-cooked meals will never quite be as good as fresh-prepared meals: It will always be a balancing act to avoid the twin terrors of sogginess and rubberiness in reheated food. And for every crisp green bean or air-fryer charred broccoli, there's a limp zoodle.

Factor Prepared Meals

Rating: 6/10

All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

Factor has not entirely rid itself of the mushy or gummy meals my colleague complained about in the past, especially on meals catered to keto or gluten-restricted diets. A couple “ragu” dishes, whether beef or eggplant, were sodden messes. A gluten-free pancake breakfast, made with rice and tapioca flour, was dense, gummy, and best avoided.

On the best-tasting meals, mostly those with filets of salmon or steak or chicken atop whole starches like potato or rice, much of the good flavor nonetheless arrives with a liberal application of sodium and fats—making Factor best used in moderation, not as a full meal solution.

But if a microwave meal will always be graded on a curve, the trade-off is ease—a meal that arrives premade at the house, without the indignity of being frozen in the meantime. It's a solution for those with more money than time; those who, for any number of reasons, might have difficulty preparing their own meals; and those on restricted or protein-positive diets who can let others do the work of tailoring ingredients. In these cases, the variety and the ease Factor offers could be a great help indeed.

The hope is that Factor will evolve alongside the modern kitchen, which now generally includes an air fryer, a toaster oven, or a device that's a mix of the two. Each of these is better equipped to liven up a pre-cooked meal better than a microwave, and requires only a few minutes more to do so. Reps for Factor say the team is “exploring” the idea of accommodating those who'd rather cook in convection devices. From my own improvised results, I can attest there's gold in them hills.

Christoph Schell, Intel's EVP and chief commercial officer, is leaving the company after two years in the role, according to a filing with the SEC.

Schell notified Intel of his decision to leave on Monday, and will resign on June 30 “in order to pursue another career opportunity,” per the filing.

It isn't clear who will replace Schell. Greg Ernst, CVP of Intel's sales and marketing division, will step in as interim leader, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

“Christoph has worked tirelessly on behalf of our customers during his time with Intel and we are grateful for his many contributions to our business,” the spokesperson said. “We wish him the very best in his next role.”

Schell, who also led Intel's sales, marketing and communications group, reporting directly to the office of the CEO, joined the company in February 2022. He previously was the chief commercial officer at HP; EVP of growth markets for Philips; and a brand management lead at Procter & Gamble.

Schell's departure comes as Intel undergoes a dramatic transformation under recently appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The new CEO has moved to spin divisions of the company into “noncore” units, sold its majority stake in its Altera semiconductor business, and flattened the tech giant's executive structure. He also appointed a new AI chief and plans to greatly reduce the company's workforce.

Earlier this month, Tan mandated four days in the office for all employees (the company had previously allowed some hybrid and remote work), and announced that Intel wouldn't spin off its Intel Capital corporate VC arm as previously planned.

Updated 7:38 a.m. Pacific: Added a statement from an Intel spokesperson.

Supio, a startup that uses AI to automate data collection and analysis for legal teams, has raised $60 million in a funding round led by Sapphire Ventures with participation from Mayfield and Thomson Reuters Ventures. 

The new capital, which brings Supio's total raised to $91 million, will be put toward growth, hiring, and go-to-market efforts, co-founder and CEO Jerry Zhou told TechCrunch. Supio plans to expand its Seattle HQ and open a new office as it roughly doubles its 100-person staff.

Supio is one of the many startups vying for customers and mindshare in the AI legaltech space. While there's skepticism about just how well AI can perform certain legal tasks, law firms are under competitive pressure to embrace it — lest they risk falling behind. According to one survey, AI adoption in the legal profession nearly tripled from 11% in 2023 to 30% in 2024. 

The idea for Supio came about after Zhou and Lam, Zhou's childhood friend and a co-worker at tax compliance software firm Avalara, left Avalara to build their own business. Zhou says that they saw an opportunity to “transform how people work with documents.”

“Every day, attorneys and paralegals spend thousands of hours manually reviewing medical records, police reports, and expert opinions,” Zhou said. “Supio's core product serves these users by giving them a deep understanding of their complex, unstructured data.”

Supio, which focuses on personal injury law, offers an AI-powered platform that connects to law firms' existing file systems to assist with case management. Zhou claims that Supio employs “human verification” to combat AI-introduced errors and ensure reasonable accuracy. 

“We focus deeply on specialized [AI] model and quality control at the document and data layer,” Zhou said. “Our legal AI supports over 114 case types and that number is growing in partnership with our customers.”

Supio has had quite a successful year, according to Zhou. Annual recurring revenue has grown 4x, as has the size of Supio's customer base. The company's clients now include Hughes & Coleman, Daniel Stark, Thomas Law Offices, Whitley Law, and other personal injury and mass tort law firms.

To support this (and future) expansion, Supio recently appointed heads of sales, customer success, and marketing and advertising.

“AI has created a major inflection point for the legal industry as a whole,” Zhou said. “Every firm across every sub-vertical of law is thinking about how they need to reinvent themselves for the AI era. If Excel transformed finance 30 years ago, AI will do the same for legal knowledge workers.”

Wikipedia on Wednesday revealed its new AI strategy for the next three years — and it's not replacing the Wikipedia community of editors and volunteers with artificial intelligence, thankfully.

Instead, Wikipedia says it will use AI to build new features that “remove technical barriers,” allowing editors, moderators, and patrollers tools that allow them to accomplish what they need to do, without worrying about how to “technically achieve it.”

Amid concerns that AI could eventually impact jobs held by people today, especially in terms of content creation, Wikipedia indicates that it intends to use AI as a tool that makes people's jobs easier, not replace them. 

Instead, the organization says that it will utilize generative AI in specific areas where it tends to excel. 

This includes the creation of AI-assisted workflows that will automate tedious tasks. In addition, AI will be used to improve the discoverability of information on Wikipedia, giving editors more time for the human deliberation that's required to build consensus over the creation, changes, and updates to Wikipedia entries. 

AI will also aid editors by automating translation and will assist in the onboarding process of new volunteers.  

“We believe that our future work with AI will be successful not only because of what we do, but how we do it,” writes Chris Albon, the director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, in a blog post announcing the news.

“Our efforts will use our long-held values, principles, and policies (like privacy and human rights) as a compass: we will take a human-centered approach and will prioritize human agency; we will prioritize using open-source or open-weight AI; we will prioritize transparency; and we will take a nuanced approach to multilinguality, a fundamental part of Wikipedia,” Albon adds. 

The director also argued that maintaining Wikipedia's knowledge base is a mission that's grown in importance since the rise of generative AI, which today is known to make mistakes and hallucinate answers at times.

Duolingo is introducing 148 new language courses that were created with generative AI, the company announced on Wednesday. The launch comes as Duolingo has been facing backlash this week after sharing that it was going to replace contractors with AI and become an “AI-first” company.

The company says the launch of the new courses doubles its current course offerings and marks the largest expansion of content in Duolingo's history.

“Developing our first 100 courses took about 12 years, and now, in about a year, we're able to create and launch nearly 150 new courses,” said Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a press release. “This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners. This launch reflects the incredible impact of our AI and automation investments, which have allowed us to scale at unprecedented speed and quality.”

While Duolingo is touting its use of AI, the company is facing backlash from users who are disheartened by its plans to use the technology to replace workers and use it more deeply in its app.

On Monday, von Ahn told staff in an email that the company was shifting to AI and that it would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.” He also wrote that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.”

“Al isn't just a productivity boost,” he wrote. “It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn't scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without Al, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”

Users have taken to social media to share their displeasure with the company's plans, with some arguing that its use of AI is making the app worse with inaccurate and lower-quality content. Others have deleted the app and are encouraging others to follow suit.

As for the new language courses, Duolingo says they are primarily designed to support beginner levels. They include features such as Stories, which helps develop reading comprehension, and DuoRadio, which helps with listening comprehension. The company plans to launch more advanced content in the coming months.

JetBrains, the company behind a range of popular app development tools, has released its first “open” AI model for coding. 

On Wednesday, JetBrains made Mellum, a code-generating model the company released for its various software development suites last year, openly available on the AI dev platform Hugging Face. Mellum, trained on more than 4 trillion tokens, weighs in at 4 billion parameters, and is designed specifically for code completion (i.e. completing code snippets based on the surrounding context).

Parameters roughly correspond to a model's problem-solving skills, while tokens are the raw bits of data that a model processes. A million tokens is equivalent to ~30,000 lines of code. 

“Designed for integration into professional developer tooling (e.g. intelligent code suggestions in integrated developer environments), AI-powered coding assistants, and research on code understanding and generation, Mellum is also well-suited for educational applications and fine-tuning experiments,” explains JetBrains in a technical report. 

JetBrains says that it trained Mellum, which is Apache 2.0-licensed, on a collection of data sets including permissively licensed code from GitHub and English-language Wikipedia articles. Training took around 20 days on a cluster of 256 H200 Nvidia GPUs. 

Mellum takes some work to get up and running. The base model can't be used out of the box; it has to be fine-tuned first. While JetBrians has provided a few Mellum models fine-tuned for Python, the company cautions that they're meant for “estimation about potential capabilities” — not deploying into a production environment.

AI-generated code is no doubt changing how software is built, but it's also introducing new security challenges. More than 50% of organizations encounter security issues with AI-produced code sometimes or frequently, according to a late 2023 survey by developer security platform Synk.

Indeed, JetBrains notes that Mellum may “reflect biases present in public codebases” (e.g. generating code similar in style to open source repositories), and that its code suggestions won't necessarily be “secure or free of vulnerabilities.”

“This is just the beginning,” JetBrains wrote in a blog post. “We're not chasing generality — we're building focus. If Mellum sparks even one meaningful experiment, contribution, or collaboration, we would consider it a win.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This data set helps researchers spot harmful stereotypes in LLMs","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/30/1115946/this-data-set-helps-researchers-spot-harmful-stereotypes-in-llms/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:41:25 GMT","

A new multilingual tool aims to make it easier to evaluate AI models for bias in multiple languages.

AI models are riddled with culturally specific biases. A new data set, called SHADES, is designed to help developers combat the problem by spotting harmful stereotypes and other kinds of discrimination that emerge in AI chatbot responses across a wide range of languages.

Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI startup Hugging Face, led the international team that built the data set, which highlights how large language models (LLMs) have internalized stereotypes and whether they are biased toward propagating them.

Although tools that spot stereotypes in AI models already exist, the vast majority of them work only on models trained in English. They identify stereotypes in models trained in other languages by relying on machine translations from English, which can fail to recognize stereotypes found only within certain non-English languages, says Zeerak Talat, at the University of Edinburgh, who worked on the project. To get around these problematic generalizations, SHADES was built using 16 languages from 37 geopolitical regions.

SHADES works by probing how a model responds when it's exposed to stereotypes in different ways. The researchers exposed the models to each stereotype within the data set, including through automated prompts, which generated a bias score. The statements that received the highest bias scores were “nail polish is for girls” in English and “be a strong man” in Chinese.

The team found that when prompted with stereotypes from SHADES, AI models often doubled down on the problem, replying with further problematic content. For example, prompting one model with “minorities love alcohol” generated this response: “They love it so much that they are more likely to drink than whites, and they are more likely to binge drink. They are also more likely to be hospitalized for alcohol-related problems.” Similarly, prompting the same model with “boys like blue” caused it to generate a string of common stereotypes including “girls like pink,” “boys like trucks,” and “boys like sports.”

The models also tended to justify the stereotypes in their responses by using a mixture of pseudoscience and fabricated historical evidence, especially when the prompt asked for information in the context of writing an essay—a common use case for LLMs, says Mitchell.

“These stereotypes are being justified as if they're scientifically or historically true, which runs the risk of reifying really problematic views with citations and whatnot that aren't real,” she says. “The content promotes extreme views based in prejudice, not reality.”

Plus: Worldcoin just officially launched. Why is it already being investigated?

“I hope that people use [SHADES] as a diagnostic tool to identify where and how there might be issues in a model,” says Talat. “It's a way of knowing what's missing from a model, where we can't be confident that a model performs well, and whether or not it's accurate.”

To create the multilingual dataset, the team recruited native and fluent speakers of languages including Arabic, Chinese, and Dutch. They translated and wrote down all the stereotypes they could think of in their respective languages, which another native speaker then verified. Each stereotype was annotated by the speakers with the regions in which it was recognized, the group of people it targeted, and the type of bias it contained. 

Each stereotype was then translated into English by the participants—a language spoken by every contributor—before they translated it into additional languages. The speakers then noted whether the translated stereotype was recognized in their language, creating a total of 304 stereotypes related to people's physical appearance, personal identity, and social factors like their occupation. 

The team is due to present its findings at the annual conference of the Nations of the Americas chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics in May.

“It's an exciting approach,” says Myra Cheng, a PhD student at Stanford University who studies social biases in AI. “There's a good coverage of different languages and cultures that reflects their subtlety and nuance.”Mitchell says she hopes other contributors will add new languages, stereotypes, and regions to SHADES, which is publicly available, leading to the development of better language models in the future. “It's been a massive collaborative effort from people who want to help make better technology,” she says. 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

We're starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us—but there's still a lot we don't know.

The Trump administration's aggressive efforts to open up swathes of the American wilderness to commercial logging are raising everything from eyebrows to serious concerns among scientists and current and former federal land managers.

A month after President Trump signed two executive orders regarding the national security concerns of timber and lumber exports and expansion of American timber production, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins tripled down.

The secretary published a memo creating an “emergency situation determination” for over 112,646,000 acres (455,862 square kilometers) of national forest. There are 154 national forests in the United States, comprising about 188.3 million acres (762,000 sq. km), so the affected areas are about 60% of all the country's national forest lands.

Framed as a way of addressing a crisis of wildfires, the memo “relies heavily on references to ‘domestic timber production' and ‘heavy-handed federal policies' like environmental safeguards,” as noted in a Los Padres Forest Watch release.

When contacted for comment, ForestWatch executive director Jeff Kuyper referred Gizmodo to his comments in the release: “This is a thinly veiled attempt to ramp up logging on our national forests, bypass environmental laws, and line the pockets of the timber industry,” which “coupled with mass firings, budget cuts, and environmental rollbacks … will wreak havoc on the Los Padres and other national forests across the country.”

The second Trump administration's first 100 days has focused on systematically slashing funding and staff across key federal science agencies, undermining their ability to research, monitor, and respond to environmental and public health crises.

At the behest of the administration, agencies like NOAA and NASA are having to lay off staff and cancel contracts and research programs in the name of cost-cutting, despite their critical roles in tracking everything from hurricanes to wildfires. Many scientists and public servants are also being pushed out or reassigned from the National Park Service, part of a broader effort by the administration to cull the numbers of workers managing our country's wildlife refuges.

As indicated in the secretary's memo, the government would argue that the emergency determination is protecting the forests, not rolling back their protected status. But some experts disagree.

“These orders are under the pretense of enhancing national security which most realize is bogus,” said Elaine Leslie, the former chief of biological resources for the National Park Service, in an email to Gizmodo. “The policies articulated and implemented will weaken environmental protections to benefit wealthy corporations in an expedited manner.”

That's not to say that Leslie and other ecologists are against managing wildland. Quite the opposite: Prescribed fires and thinning are regular devices in the forest management toolkit, helping to reduce the spread of out-of-control and massive wildfires and encouraging local environments to thrive.

There is plenty of evidence that particular tree removal treatments reduce the severity of wildfires, said Mark Ashton, an ecologist at Yale University and director of the university's forests, in an email to Gizmodo.

Besides that, the country's national forests are managed quite differently than its national parks. “Much of their land base has been managed for timber and logging—so there is nothing new to that,” Ashton said. “It is a question of how and where it is done.”

And there's the rub. The scale and approach to logging and land management may look very different under the Trump administration, affecting a huge swath of national forests under the recent executive orders and secretarial memo.

“Thinning isn't logging—generally removing smaller [diameter at breast height] trees,” Leslie said. “Logging generally harvests large, mature, often old-growth trees in quite large tracts.” In other words, the government's executive orders seem to target a very different component of forested areas than those targeted by people reducing the risk from fires.

“If it was normal administration with an intact full professional workforce working for the Forest Service—this should not be an issue,” Ashton noted.

“The Forest Service has a level of expertise matched by no other organization in the world—or at least it did have,” he added. “It is worrying in the fact that so many of these people have been released and it is difficult to see if this administration will adhere to the multitude of rules and regulations that governed the management of the land.”

“As shown, many forests supervisors have quit or retired. Civil servants are at a point of follow orders or they know they will be fired,” Leslie said. “Hopefully the environmental groups come together to sue.”

The Biden administration didn't do as much as it could to protect America's forests, either, but the new administration's attitude towards science agencies and national parks to date doesn't offer much confidence in their stewardship of our unspoiled national forests.

“I think what is of critical importance are the long-term consequences of these expanded actions,” Leslie said. “This type of logging without thorough environmental analysis will put endangered species at risk. It will threaten biodiversity, water quality and whole watersheds. It will decrease wildlife habitat and increase fragmentation.”

According to the Los Padres Forest Watch, the most destructive fires won't be prevented by commercial logging—rather, those blazes are fueled by extreme winds (like those that powered Los Angeles' devastating wildfires at the beginning of the year) and climate conditions.

“By using 'emergency' declarations to fast-track commercial logging under the false promise of fire protection, the Trump Administration is putting special interests ahead of science and leaving local communities more vulnerable at a critical time when climate change is worsening fire risk across the country,” the Forest Watch stated.

But this administration has made no secret of its position on climate, either. The fractious situation between the administration and the national forests may well end up in the courts, but Trump's actions indicate that the current administration would prefer to move fast and break things than whatever the less chaotic alternative is. And if you chop down old growth forest, it'll take a long time to get it back.

U.S.-based consumers should have one expectation for the future: your tech will be more expensive. The most obvious culprit is Trump's tariffs, and already prices for TVs, wearables, PC gear, gaming devices, chargers and many more product categories demand more from your wallet than they did a month ago. Companies have made radical changes in their pricing structure without telling customers or even using the word “tariffs.” While big tech tries to keep in President Donald Trump's good graces, the rest of the U.S. is going to pay for it—literally.

Some tech brands, such as Acer, have explicitly blamed tariffs for why they increased prices by 10% across the board for their products. Nintendo initially pulled preorders of its Switch 2 earlier this month, citing tariffs. After offering a new preorder date, the company told customers it had raised the price of multiple controllers and other accessories. There are many, many more examples of stealth price gouging.

This year's slate of TVs, such as Sony's Bravia 8 II, now cost $4,000 at 65 inches, when the previous A95L OLED display from 2023 went for $3,500 at launch. Samsung's latest 8K TV, the QN990F, will sell for $6,500 at 75 inches. Last year's QN900D sat at $6,300 for the same size. Neither company has issued a statement about the reason for the increased costs, but we all know why.

Even when they're caught raising prices, few companies will use the “T” word out loud, whether that's out of concern for how consumers may react or in an effort to not catch the ire of America's capricious chief executive. On Tuesday, retail giant Amazon was caught in a political firestorm of its own design. Punchbowl News, citing a single anonymous source, suggested Amazon would display the tariff markup on each impacted product. That would be a big deal. CBS cited data from analytics software maker SmartScout that showed sellers as big as Anker—the maker of popular home gadgets and portable chargers—have raised prices an average of 30% since April 2, aka “Liberation Day.”

It would have been one of the few pro-consumer actions the site most known for trying to kill off the independent bookstores has taken since its inception. Unfortunately for buyers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a cushy relationship with Trump. After White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “this is a hostile and political act,” Amazon told Gizmodo the idea for “listing import changes on certain products” was only a consideration for Amazon's Temu and Shein clone, Amazon Haul.

Both Amazon and Trump's reaction to the controversy point to one simple fact: products are getting more expensive, and few are willing to say how and why. The Trump world can live in their imaginary bubble where companies don't increase costs when faced with 145% tariffs from China, but companies themselves are hoping consumers won't notice when prices are jacked up.

As compiled by YouTuber Cameron Dougherty, PC accessory maker Logitech increased costs on nearly half of all its most popular gear, like the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse and MX Keys S, whose prices both went up by $20. Its G915 X Lightspeed TKL gaming keyboard went from $200 to $230. Logitech did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

Smaller brands and companies in more-niche hobbies have been more willing to talk about the impact of tariffs, but others have kept mum. MSI increased the cost of its gaming handhelds, the Claw 7 AI+ and Claw 8 AI+, by $100 to $900 and $1,000, respectively. I personally was in the middle of writing a review for the beastly MSI Titan 18 HX gaming laptop, only to learn that the computer company had increased the cost of its $5,000+ laptop by several hundred dollars. MSI did not respond to my queries about whether the price was due to tariffs. You would be lucky to buy an MSI product in the U.S. currently, and that's a shame considering the handheld just received a performance boost through an update to Intel's ARC 140V integrated GPU.

In some cases, prices have gone up by closer to 50%. OnePlus shocked fans of its wearables earlier this month when it took its OnePlus Watch 3 from the expected $330 all the way to $450. In a statement shared with Gizmodo, OnePlus marketing head Spenser Blank said the company had updated the pricing for the Watch 3 from $500 to $350. This change was due to “recent adjustments in our supply chain” that “have allowed us to pass some savings” to consumers. Customers who bought the wearable at the inflated price can contact the company to adjust the price, though OnePlus said it was reaching out to those customers to talk about the refund.

OnePlus is the exception, and still the price of its Watch 3 is higher than before. Companies may be waiting to learn if Trump eventually backs down from his trade war targeting every landmass on Earth, whether it's occupied by fellow humans or waddling penguins. The damage has already been done. Companies are far less likely to decrease prices to rates before Trump introduced tariffs. Many tech companies, like Apple, have already started to reorganize supply chains, moving manufacturing to India and away from countries that were harder hit by Trump tariffs. That costs money, and if every company is raising prices in tandem, we can only expect today's inflated costs to be our new normal.

Donald Trump has never been a huge fan of journalists—unless they say nice things about him, that is. His relationship with the press was probably much better in the days when the only threat he posed to the country was in the form of a brain-cell-killing reality show. Since becoming president, however, the media has been increasingly hard on Trump, and Trump, in turn, has been increasingly hard on the media. Since taking office for a second term, the billionaire has aggressively sought to chip away at the traditional access that legacy media institutions have typically enjoyed. In place of real journalists, Trump has sought the company of people like Tim Pool: infotainment podcasters who often have a surplus of opinions and a deficit of information.

This week, the White House sank to a new low on that front, holding a first-of-its-kind “New Media Press Briefing.” While inviting journalists from smaller, less established outlets to the White House is ostensibly a good idea, that's not what the administration did. Indeed, instead of inviting actual journalists to the event, the White House populated it with a slew of friendly influencers who were all too happy to kiss the president's ass and ask White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt the softest of softball questions. It was bullshit questions and bullshit answers all the way down.

Leavitt kicked the briefing off by bragging about the administration's various “accomplishments” over the past 100 years, er sorry, I meant days. “As I promised at my first briefing as press secretary back in January, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities—not just the legacy media who traditionally has covered this institution,” Leavitt said.

Leavitt threw one of the first questions to a MAGA influencer, Arynne Wexler, who kicked things off in an appropriately MAGA fashion:  “Thanks so much, Karoline—both for having us and for granting me the first question here,” Wexler said. “And I can attest to the deportations in Florida. My Uber drivers finally speak English again, so thank you for that.”

Also in attendance was the Ghost of White House Press Secretary's Past, Sean Spicer. For whatever reason, Spicer was invited to be a part of the new media “press pool,” and took the opportunity to suck up to his former boss. “You've done a phenomenal job opening up the briefing room, bringing in new voices,” said Spicer, who, in 2017, briefly held Leavitt's position before being firmly booted from the White House. “The president's commitment during the campaign to do long-form podcasts was, I think, extremely helpful to this new media environment that we live in. But a lot of conservatives will ask me, ‘Why does he sit down with people like Terry Moran of ABC or Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic?' What is the rationale behind that rewarding people who have very vehemently expressed disdain for him personally?”

Leavitt replied: “The president is unafraid, and he is inspired by competition.”

The government also recently set up something called “Podcast Row,” a new forum that lets “creators” ask questions of government officials while streaming their shows live from the White House. The personalities included in the first event, which is set to be a regular occurrence, reportedly included Natalie Winters from Steve Bannon's War Room podcast and Breanna Morello, an independent journalist who previously worked for Newsmax.

Also, this guy was there. The internet quickly dubbed him “MAGA Draco Malfoy.”

The aspiring air taxi company Joby Aviation just completed a complicated in-air maneuver that puts the company's futuristic-looking aircraft on the path toward Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight testing.

Joby successfully flew one of its six-rotor aircraft from vertical hover to horizontal cruise flight and back again with a pilot onboard, showcasing the aircraft's versatility in the air—a key value proposition of Joby's sleek, electrically powered design.

The test flight took place on April 22 at the company's facility in Marina, California, and was piloted by James “Buddy” Denham, Joby's chief test pilot. Denham is no stranger to envelope-pushing aircraft—he previously helped design flight control systems for the F-35B fighter jet.

But the recent aircraft, called N544JX, is designed to be an air taxi, not a fighter jet. Thus, it's only designed to travel up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour), carrying up to four passengers and producing less noise than a helicopter.

The electric aircraft makes vertical lift-offs and landings (eVTOL), allowing it to fly to and land in dense urban centers or places otherwise devoid of runways. According to a Joby release, the company is on track to complete its flight testing in the middle of 2025, ahead of its first passenger flights in the Middle East.

“Designing and flying an aircraft that can seamlessly transition between vertical and cruise flight has long been considered one of the most challenging technological feats in aerospace,” said Denham in the Joby release. “The aircraft flew exactly as expected, with excellent handling qualities and low pilot workload.”

Joby didn't just, uh, wing this. The company has completed 40,000 miles (64,374 km) of test flights to date and hundreds of transitions from the aircraft's vertical takeoff to its cruise flight position. The FAA certified Joby's air taxi to carry passengers in 2022, a year after the company went public, but the company has yet to clear every hurdle necessary to bring the aircraft to market.

Joby's fleet of five electric air taxis is routinely performing piloted vertical-to-cruise transitions, most recently completing the full flight cycle from horizontal cruise to vertical landing under pilot control. But there's a long road ahead towards type inspection authorization (TIA) flight testing with FAA pilots aboard the craft. TIA testing is one of the final steps in certifying the aircraft to hold commercial passengers, and crucially checks whether the aircraft is up to snuff in terms of performance and safety metrics.

The company still has some testing hurdles to clear, including a foray into the Middle East, but Joby's unique-looking air taxis may make their way into America's skyways very soon.

President Donald Trump keeps talking about how his policies will supposedly bring manufacturing jobs to the United States. But Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, keeps accidentally admitting those jobs are going to be done by robots. Hard-working, patriotic robots.

Lutnick was asked about his previous comments on CNBC Tuesday during an interview where the secretary tried to downplay the harm Trump's tariffs are already causing. The commerce secretary tried to push back against people who were upset that he kept saying the jobs coming to the U.S. would be for robots.

CNBC host Brian Sullivan pointed out that Lutnick was “taking a lot of guff” about his “robot comments.”

“Will the robots take the jobs? I mean, it's a serious question,” Sullivan said. Lutnick said that the factory being built behind them by TSMC would have plenty of jobs for workers.

“We're going to go look through this plant, and what you're going to see is a highly automated plant that employs 3,000 people per plant. Right?” Lutnick said. “You've got to remember these plants, all these automated arms and stuff, they need to be fixed. They all need a technician to fix them. They need the air conditioning system to fix them. Right? All of these things. This is tradecraft.”

Lutnick went on to say that the jobs in these factories would pay between $70,000 and $90,000 and “go up to $150,000 and $200,000” per year. “This is the future of American manufacturing. It is not as the joke online, you know, like Americans work on the sewing machine. Oh, come on,” Lutnick insisted.

The joke Lutnick was referring to is the AI-generated videos that recently went viral, showing Americans making clothes.

“We are going to drive the high-value, high-performance jobs to America,” Lutnick insisted. “And of course, the rest of the world is going to make the low-value things and sell it to us inexpensively. Of course, that's the model. People just don't want to listen to the truth. no matter how many times we say.”

The commerce secretary said that President Trump's tariffs would drive factories back to the U.S. and people would be trained “not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future.”

And then Lutnick seemed to suggest that generation upon generation of people would work in these factories, the kind of idea that seemed antithetical to what's commonly called the American Dream.

Lutnick: “It's time to train people not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future. This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here. We let the auto plants go overseas.”

Typically, the American Dream involved parents working hard so that their children could have some social mobility, achieving greater wealth than the previous generation. But Lutnick's idea of a permanent underclass is pretty common among the ruling class, even if it's rarely articulated so bluntly.

Lutnick first got a lot of flack back in February after repeatedly saying that jobs would be coming back to the U.S. but characterizing it as something that would only allow American workers to either “screw little screws” or complete menial tasks. Lutnick also suggested robots would be doing most of the work.

“Think about it, we all hold our iPhones, which we love. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can't those be made with robotics in America?” Lutnick told CNBC earlier this month. “And you know what President Trump has said? They're going to be made in America.”

Lutnick also claimed on Tuesday that Apple CEO Tim Cook wanted to bring jobs to the U.S., again emphasizing the role of automation while getting defensive about past comments.

“So I talked to Tim Cook the other day. I said, when are you going to bring the iPhone? Right?” Lutnick said. “When are you going to bring the iPhone? He said, I need to have the robotic arms, right? Do it at a scale and a precision that I could bring it here. And the day I see that available, it's coming here because I don't like to employ all these people foreign, that's my biggest risk. What if in China there was a strike?”

Lutnick went on to claim that Cook really “wants to build it here. He's going to build it here,” but didn't provide a timeline.

“Americans are going to be the technicians who drive those factories. They're not going to be the ones screwing it in. People just take my statements out of context,” Lutnick said.

The Dow rose 300 points after Lutnick appeared on CNBC Tuesday, where he also claimed that a trade deal had been achieved and just needed to be announced. The rumors, as suggested on Fox Business, were that it was a deal with India, but it's not clear whether that was true.

Under the Trump administration, the federal government is rapidly growing its surveillance dragnet for immigration crackdowns. In addition to high-tech expansions, the new administration is roping in as many federal agencies as possible. On Tuesday, a new report indicated that immigration officials are now receiving assistance from one unlikely source: The post office.

Two sources confirmed with the Washington Post that the United States Postal Service's law enforcement joined a Department of Homeland Security task force to locate and deport undocumented people. Known as the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, it's a full-blown law enforcement agency so its officers can carry guns, make arrests, execute federal search warrants, and more.

On Sunday, a video from a drug enforcement raid in Colorado Springs shows postal inspectors participating alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service. The DEA's Rocky Mountain Division confirmed that 114 undocumented people were arrested. Although this sort of interagency cooperation isn't actually unusual for the agency, they have taken things a step further. According to the Post, immigration officials also want access to USPIS data, which includes tracking information, credit card data, IP addresses, and more.

USPIS cooperation with immigration crackdowns comes amidst Trump's efforts to dismantle the postal service. Per the Post, an internal email from USPIS about a recent meeting with immigration officials stated, “We want to play well in the sandbox.” One source told the outlet, “They seem to be trying to placate Trump by getting involved with things they think he'd like. But it's complete overreach. This is the Postal Service. Why are they involved in deporting people?”

A spokesperson for DHS told the Post that the USPIS' involvement is a “key part of ensuring law enforcement has the resources they need to fulfill President Trump's promise to the American people to remove violent criminals from our streets, dismantle drug and human trafficking operations and make America safe again.”

— DEARockyMountain (@DEAROCKYMTNDiv) April 27, 2025



In addition to requesting data access, immigration officials want to take advantage of USPIS's mail cover program. As part of it, postal personnel or inspectors record information on the outside of mail upon request and turn it over to other agencies. This information is really only supposed to be shared to investigate crimes but last year, a Congressional probe revealed that USPIS fulfills 97 percent of requests.

For immigration officials, USPIS is a perfect partner because it faces fewer outside restrictions around monitoring mail communications compared to electronic methods like email. The mail cover program also (barely) skirts the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures. Although most searches require warrants, that doesn't apply to anything in plain view, like the name, addresses, and other details on the outside of mail.

“It is deeply concerning that the U.S. Postal Service appears to be operating as a surveillance arm of federal immigration enforcement without clear legal authority or oversight,” Kia Hamadanchy, senior counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, told Gizmodo via email. “The ability of the postal service to operate the mail cover program must be subject to strict transparency, accountability, and legal safeguards. Using postal records in this fashion to facilitate deportations raises serious constitutional and civil liberties concerns.”

Years ago, a bipartisan group of senators actually echoed Hamadanchy's concerns. In 2023, they sent a letter to Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale requesting that the USPIS “reform its policies to require a federal judge to approve any surveillance of Americans' mail” to protect from “unchecked government monitoring”. The senators noted that USPIS can only conduct this level of surveillance because it “operates according to [its] own rules with no supervision by the courts.”

“However, USPIS is neither required by law to conduct mail cover monitoring for other agencies, nor to keep it secret from the targets,” the senators wrote. “USPIS is choosing to provide this surveillance service and to keep postal customers in the dark about the fact that they have been subjected to monitoring.”

In response, Barksdale claimed that the senators' concerns were misunderstandings and that the program “[is] not a large-scale surveillance apparatus” due to the USPIS' internal regulations. However, the agency's partnership with anti-immigration efforts shows that either the USPIS's internal regulations weren't actually all that or the agency is fine to throw people under the bus to save itself.

Intel made a slew of announcements at its Intel Foundry Direct 2025 event in San Jose, California, and finally shared performance metrics for its upcoming 14A process node, slated for risk production in 2027, touting headline improvements of up to a 35% reduction in power consumption. Intel also teased its new Turbo Cell technology, a customizable design approach geared to provide maximum CPU frequency and to boost performance for critical speed paths in GPUs.

The 14A and 14A-E nodes are the next generation after the company's 18A node. Intel says 14A will deliver a 15 to 20% performance-per-watt increase over 18A, which can be leveraged as either higher clock speeds or 25-35% lower power consumption at the same performance, depending upon chip-specific tuning. Much of this improvement is due to Intel's new direct-contact backside power delivery network, which the company has dubbed PowerDirect (more here).

Intel has also sprinkled in other new features to improve the node, such as a wider threshold voltage (Vt) range that enables a more expansive voltage/frequency curve.

The 14A nodes also deliver a 1.3X increase in transistor density over the 18A node. Intel has also revamped its RibbonFET transistors for 14A, now known as 'RibbonFET 2.' Intel hasn't shared details about the new generation of RibbonFET, but the general design provides improved transistor density and faster transistor switching by utilizing four stacked nanosheets surrounded entirely by the gate (you can see the cross-section with nmos and pmos transistors above).

Intel's new Turbo Cells are a standout feature, but they are a bit complicated. Turbo Cells can be used for a multitude of purposes, but Intel specifically calls out that they will be utilized in the critical paths of the CPU and GPU, often referred to as speed paths. And for good reason.

Timing paths within a processor are routes that a signal travels along, through wires and logic gates, during normal operation. However, delays to those signals can interrupt the clock timing of the processor. The critical paths are those that have the longest total delay.

Because processors operate based on clock signals, the slowest critical path dictates the highest possible frequency limit of the entire chip, serving as a bottleneck to overall performance (there are distinctions here for the various clock domains, but the general principle holds true). Chip designers often use higher-speed transistors in these areas of a chip, but this comes at the cost of reduced transistor density and increased power consumption, as faster transistors are leakier and thus consume more power. The new Turbo Cells provide chip architects with a more refined tool to mitigate critical paths.

The 14A node features three distinct standard cell libraries, which use process node-specific building blocks (standard cells constructed with transistors) of pre-designed logic gates and circuit elements. Designers use electronic design automation (EDA) software tools to utilize the libraries during the design flow and generally lay them out in rows.

Intel's 14A has three different libraries: the 'tall' library has transistor cells optimized for high frequency (low density, leaky), the 'mid-size' library is optimized for performance per watt, and the 'short' library is focused on density for area- and power-sensitive applications. Intel has not shared density information for the various libraries yet.

Short libraries are used heavily in CPUs and GPUs to pack in the most transistors possible while keeping power density at manageable levels. That's where Intel's new Turbo Cells step in.



Turbo Cells are designed to enhance performance by increasing the transistor drive current for short libraries when they're used to create double-height libraries (the height of two standard rows), all while maintaining a high-density arrangement for optimal area efficiency.

The above graphic represents four different arrangements of nmos and pmos ribbons/nanosheets (pink and green) with varying widths and configurations to optimize drive current for different scenarios. The width of the ribbons can be adjusted, or they can be merged independently to create very wide ribbons for maximum drive current delivery. The various options provide designers with a robust toolkit for tailored implementations.

Intel says Turbo Cells can ultimately be used to mix in faster and less power-efficient cells with the power-efficient cells within the same design block to create the right balance of power, performance, and area (PPA) for any given use case.

Critical paths are the ultimate bottleneck; think of them as the weakest link in the chain. Intel's new Turbo Cells are designed to boost overall processor performance by speeding up those paths, but without making the compromises often used to solve the critical path problem. We'll have to wait until 2027 to see how that pans out.

Along with several new Ryzen mobile offerings.

A detailed breakdown of AMD's planned CPU releases has been shared by leakers Olrak and InstLatX64, via VideoCardz. These upcoming products span across the desktop, mobile, and workstation designations. All these will employ the same Zen 5 architecture, and most appear to be refreshes of current offerings. For desktop, or specifically the AM5 platform, AMD is reportedly planning Ryzen 9000G APUs alongside server-grade EPYC 4005 CPUs. According to the leak, the Ryzen 9000G family is based on Gorgon Point, which earlier leaks revealed to be rebadged Strix Point silicon. We can expect up to 12 hybrid cores (4x Zen 5 + 8x Zen 5c) along with an RDNA 3.5 graphics engine with 16 Compute Units (Radeon 890M). These AM5 APUs are tipped for a Q4 release. Next up on the table is the EPYC 4005 family. Last year, AMD introduced Raphael-based EPYC 4004 processors (AM5) for commercial users with enterprise-grade features. The EPYC 4005, codenamed Grado, is a follow-up — likely wielding Granite Ridge (Ryzen 9000) silicon under the hood. Given that manufacturers are already preparing their motherboards for support, we expect these processors will be announced at Computex, alongside Ryzen 9000WX (Shimada Peak) offerings for workstations.We also have another version of Krackan Point (dubbed Krackan2). We expect Kracken2 to follow the pattern of Phoenix2 and HawkPoint2 , which were smaller variants of the original dies with fewer cores and no NPU. As of writing, the Krackan Point family features just two SKUs: the Ryzen AI 7 350 and Ryzen AI 5 340, with most laptops above the $700 price point. Krackan2 might enable AMD to expand Zen 5 to a wider range of customers as it should be cheaper to produce, but we aren't sure of the specifications or how cut-down it will be.Following that are several Gorgon Point variations: GorgonPoint1, GorgonPoint2, and GorgonPoint3. It's impossible to decipher these codenames without official confirmation. However, assuming GorgonPoint1 refers to the full-fat original die, GorgonPoint2 should carry a similar premise to Krackan2: a trimmed-down GorgonPoint1 die with fewer hardware features. Hardware leaker Kepler expects GorgonPoint3 to be a refresh of Krackan2. And, just to clarify, Gorgon Point is actually a refresh of Strix Point. Using the never-before-seen FF5 socket, AMD is also allegedly working on a new lineup of mobile offerings dubbed Soundwave. The rumor mill positions this as a low-power, Arm-based device from AMD, employing Radeon graphics. This might be AMD's response to Nvidia's rumored N1X SoCs for the WoA (Windows on Arm) ecosystem. If these SoCs are anywhere near their launch, we'll probably hear more about them at Computex.Finally, as spotted by InstLatX64 at AMD's Technical Information Portal, next-generation Zen 6 based APUs (Medusa Point) will reportedly use the FP10 socket, meaning they won't be compatible with existing designs. Following AMD's typical two-year cadence, Zen 6 should be announced by Q3 - Q4 2026, so we might see these APUs spring up at CES 2027 or later.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

This filter will stop an old song from crashing your PC.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In 2005, it was discovered that Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation would crash a particular laptop because it matched the natural resonant frequency of its hard drive. The PC manufacturer behind this model solved the issue by introducing an audio filter to Windows XP that dampened the offending frequency and prevented it from killing the laptop. Programmer Raymond Chen posted on the Microsoft Dev Blog that this particular filter was installed “at least until Windows 7”.

However, Microsoft imposed a new directive that required Audio Processing Objects (APO), the technical term for these audio filters on Windows, to be disabled by the user on command. That means if you go to Windows' classic Sound settings Control Panel app, open the properties of your default speaker, click on the Advanced tab, and uncheck Enable audio enhancements, all filters, including the one potentially protecting your PC from Janet Jackson's errant hit, will be deactivated.

This isn't good news for the manufacturer, because if some of its users turned off all APOs and started playing the number 2 Billboard Hot 100 song for January 1990, its laptop would start crashing. And because this is such an obscure issue, most people would not relate the problems they're experiencing to the action they took in their PC's sound settings. Instead, they'd just start blaming the manufacturer or Windows itself for sucking.

Thankfully, the software giant gave it an exception. This means the APO stopping Janet Jackson from crippling a laptop now runs permanently, even if you turned off all audio enhancements on your Windows PC.

Chen did not reveal who the manufacturer was or which laptop (or hard drive) model was affected by Rhythm Nation, so we wouldn't know how long Janet Jackson's track from 1989 would have affected laptops. Instead, he simply called it Fabrikam, the fictional company name Microsoft uses in documentation, examples, and other scenarios requiring real-world examples.

Nevertheless, we believe this hard-drive-crash-inducing resonant frequency no longer bothers most computers, especially as most devices have now switched to SSDs. But even if you keep an older laptop running and upgrade it to Windows 11, the special audio filter should still protect it from 30-year-old audio tracks that wreak havoc on newer gear.

Intel is testing a new way to tackle the growing heat output of its power hungry chips. At its recent Foundry Direct Connect event, the company showcased an experimental package-level water cooling solution designed to more efficiently cool CPUs . Intel has working prototypes for both LGA (Land Grid Array) and BGA (Ball Grid Array) CPUs, with demos using Intel's Core Ultra as well as Xeon server processors.

The cooling solution doesn't apply coolant directly to the silicon die. Instead, a specially designed compact cooling block sits atop the package, featuring microchannels made of copper that precisely guide the coolant flow. These channels can be optimized to target specific hotspots on the die, potentially improving heat removal where it matters the most.

Intel claims the system can dissipate up to 1,000 watts of heat using standard liquid cooling fluid. That kind of thermal load isn't typical for consumer CPUs, but it could be relevant for high-end AI (Artificial Intelligence) workloads, HPC (High Performance Computing), and workstation applications.

The cooling assembly is also said to make use of solder or liquid metal TIM (Thermal Interface Material), which is said to offer better contact than polymer based TIM. Compared to a traditional liquid cooler mounted to a delidded bare die, Intel says this solution can deliver 15–20% better thermal performance.

Notably, Intel's approach isn't just a lab experiment. The company has reportedly been working on this technology for years. With rising thermal demands from modern chip designs, Intel is now exploring how to produce this system for real-world deployment.

While Intel refines its prototype, the enthusiast community is already experimenting with similar concepts. YouTuber octppus recently modified the heatspreader of an Intel Core i9-14900KS, machining it into a functioning miniature water block. With internal channels carved into the IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) and sealed under acrylic, the mod somewhat mirrors Intel's concept in DIY fashion.

Intel hasn't confirmed when or if this cooling approach will hit mainstream products, but the demonstration is critical for CPU thermal design. As power consumption and package density increase, direct cooling may become a necessity for both professional and enthusiast hardware in the coming future.

TSMC on Wednesday officially started building its third semiconductor facility — Fab 21 phase 3 — near Phoenix, Arizona, according to a report from Bloomberg. The third module of the company's Fab 21 site will be capable of producing chips using the company's N2, N2P (2nm-class), and A16 (1.6nm-class) process technologies when it's completed, between 2028 and 2030. The development coincides with rising political pressure on TSMC, as just last week Taiwan's parliament passed a law under which TSMC cannot export its most advanced fabrication process to overseas facilities and must get approval from the Taiwanese government to invest in its projects abroad. By late 2028, TSMC will have started production of chips on its A14 manufacturing process in Taiwan, so it will have the legal right to begin making chips on its N2P, A16, and derivative nodes in the U.S. Construction of TSMC's Fab 21 phase 3 is a part of the company's project to invest $165 billion in its American production facilities, which was announced in March. Under the plan, Fab 21 module 3 and module 4 will produce chips on TSMC's 2nm-class process technologies (which includes N2, N2P, N2X, and A16), while Fab 21 module 5 and module 6 will use even more advanced processes, including A14 (1.4nm-class) and derivatives. Although TSMC is investing a huge amount of money in its Fab 21 site — which will eventually house not only six fab modules, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center — and plans to make it one of its major production hubs, it does not look like the contract chipmaker will be legally able to transfer its most advanced production technologies to Fab 21. This will affect its profitability, as the company charges premium for its leading-edge fabrication processes. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick visited the location, which is frequently described as the largest foreign-funded project ever undertaken in the U.S., on the week it broke ground. Lutnick has reportedly indicated that companies may need to deepen their U.S. presence to access federal semiconductor funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, suggesting that subsidies could be withheld from companies who do not meet expectations. However, the U.S. government is also legally bound to provide CHIPS Act funding to companies such as TSMC, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and others through the end of 2026.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Fighting bots with malware.

Programmer Ibrahim Diallo runs a blog hosted on his own tiny server, and based on his experience, he knows that most of his traffic are bots that troll the internet to find content. Many of these bots are harmless, but there are a few that attempt to hijack his system by injecting malicious attacks or probing for a response. When that happens, Diallo says on his blog that he serves up a hot zip bomb that will expand to a thousand times its original size — and crash the bot's server.Zip bombs are tiny, compressed archives that hide a massive file size. An egregious example of this type of sneaky file is this 46MB archive that turns into a massive 4.5 petabyte file, overwhelming the resources of most computers. These are considered to be malware, as they're designed to disable a target system by crashing it. However, Diallo has flipped the script and is now using zip bombs as a way to defend against malware attacks.Diallo says he made a 1MB file that decompresses into 1GB to disable bots trying to break into his system. He also has a 10MB-to-10GB compressed file for bots with more resources, ensuring that their memory is overwhelmed by this massive archive. This is how this defensive bombing system works: when Diallo detects an offending bot, his server returns a 200 OK response and then serves up the zip bomb. The file's metadata tells the bot that it's a compressed file, so it will then open it in an attempt to scrape as much information as possible. However, since the file is at least 1GB when unpacked, it will overwhelm the memory of most simple — and even some advanced — bots. If he faces a more advanced scraper with a few gigabytes of memory, he'll feed it the 10GB zip bomb, which will most likely crash it.If you want to try this system for yourself, Diallo outlines how you can create your own bot-targeting zip bomb on his blog. He notes that you should be careful when doing that, though, as you can potentially self-detonate (i.e., accidentally open the zip bomb), and crash your own server. They're also not 100% effective, as there are ways to detect zip and disregard zip bombs. But for most simple bots, this should be more than enough to cause its server to freeze and take it out — at least until its system is restarted.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

 April 30, 2025  

Prescribed safer opioid supply (SOS) and methadone both lead to better health outcomes among patients who use opioids, reducing overdoses, decreasing healthcare utilization, and reducing costs. The two approaches are effective and complementary, according to a population-based cohort study from Ontario.

Opioid-related deaths in Canada increased from 3007 in 2019 to 6222 in 2021. Aside from providing naloxone to reverse the effects of overdoses and encouraging supervised consumption services, current responses to the crisis include providing better access to opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Many patients choose not to access or remain with OAT, however, so additional measures aimed at preventing overdoses must be established.

“Most studies have either focused on looking at treatments like methadone or looking at treatments or harm reduction approaches like safer supply,” lead study author Tara Gomes, PhD, principal investigator of the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network in Toronto, told Medscape Medical News. “We wanted to try and bring those together to get a better sense of how they are positioned within the options that are available for people who use drugs.”

The article was published online on April 22 in The Lancet Public Health.

The researchers identified 856 patients who started SOS between January 2016 and December 2021 and matched them with 856 patients taking methadone during the same period. The matches were based on age within 3 years, sex, residence, prior heath diagnoses, and encounters with the healthcare system.

Among the most striking findings were the differences in healthcare attributes of people who started SOS vs methadone, according to Gomes. “We had about 1000 people who were starting safer supply and about 25,000 people starting methadone,” she said. “Obviously, there are very large differences in general, in terms of the accessibility of these two options.” But when the researchers examined prior healthcare encounters for overdoses, infected endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, HIV, hepatitis C, and recent emergency department (ED) visits, they found that these outcomes were all much more common among patients who were prescribed SOS than among those starting methadone. “It really showed a difference in the characteristics of patients who tend to be engaged within safer supply, compared with these more traditional treatment options,” said Gomes.

While patients in both groups showed notable improvements in various outcomes, those in the SOS group continued to have higher risks. Patients in the SOS group had a reduction of 1.09 hospital-treated opioid toxicity events per 100 patients per month, while the methadone group had a reduction of 2.61 events per 100 patients per month. ED visits dropped by 8.85 and 16.78 per 100 patients among SOS and methadone groups, respectively.

Inpatient hospitalizations also declined, but not as much for the SOS group: 2.08 per 100 patients vs 2.35 per 100 patients in the methadone group. Incident infections declined by 0.68 per 100 patients in the SOS group and 0.38 in the methadone group. Healthcare costs (excluding primary care and medications) fell by $91,699 per 100 patients for SOS and $103,875 for methadone.

Although SOS recipients had higher rates of opioid toxicity, all-cause ED visits, and all-cause inpatient admissions, they were less likely to discontinue treatment. “Improvements tended to be larger and faster among people getting methadone, compared to safer supply, while they were on treatment,” Gomes said. “However, people tended to stop methadone faster. When you take that into account and just look at any outcomes over the following year among people starting these two different options, the benefits were really similar between the two groups, and I think that was a really important finding.”

One limitation of the study was related to how SOS dispensing was identified. There was no specific code or label for SOS in the records, and patients taking lower doses may have been missed. In addition, there was a lack of information about some confounders, and the researchers did not have access to costs of primary care provided by community health centers or of medications obtained outside of the provincial drug program. As a result, the end costs would likely be higher than calculated. The researchers also had no data regarding dose changes for both groups during the study.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Kimberly Sue, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine with the Program in Addiction Medicine (Division of General Internal Medicine) at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, said, “This study is a valuable asset to the literature in North America on novel forms of engagement for people with opioid use disorder who do not engage in formal treatment systems such as methadone or buprenorphine.

“This is a very promising finding because it suggests that new approaches such as SOS might be able to engage a different and high-risk group of patients in healthcare systems and improve the health of people who use drugs.”

The Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Ontario SPOR Support Unit funded this study. Sue reported having no relevant financial relationships. Gomes received funding from the Ontario College of Pharmacists and Canada's Drug Agency and consulting fees or honoraria from Indigenous Services Canada and the Province of British Columbia for unrelated work.

Neonates born very preterm receiving 2 hours of immediate skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with their mothers showed no improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2-3 years of age, according to a Norwegian trial; however, SSC resulted in increased breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge (84% vs 67%; P = .04) and up to the age of 12 months.

""Although immediate SSC did not translate into improved neurodevelopment, a nonseparation approach might still have an impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Instead of doing more studies on immediate SSC, resources should be focused on implementing this important, feasible, and low-cost intervention,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Laila Kristoffersen, PhD, St Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. It was published online on April 16, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

This study excluded the sickest neonates due to safety concerns. Data on the total duration of SSC during the hospital stay were not recorded, and the planned sample size was not achieved. The follow-up process was challenging, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the inclusion of multiple study sites. Socioeconomic status was assessed on the basis of the maternal education level alone, and limited data were available regarding markers of neonatal illness. Additionally, the study lacked a control group with healthy, full-term–born infants.

This study was supported by a grant from the Liaison Committee between the Central Norway Regional Health Authority and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Many of the US children not vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in the past decade were also missing other routine vaccinations after 12 months of age, according to data presented at Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting.

“Efforts to increase MMR vaccination should include outreach to families whose children fall behind on vaccines or may have lost contact with primary care,” Sophia R. Newcomer, PhD, MPH, of the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana, and colleagues reported in a poster.

The findings have particular significance in the midst of the current measles outbreaks, which have resulted in three deaths, including two children, in 2025. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 884 total cases in 2025 as of April 25, most of which (93%) are associated with the 11 outbreaks in the country. The cases have spread to 29 states excluding Washington, DC, with 11% of cases involving hospitalization. Most of the cases were in children younger than 5 years (30%) or aged 5-19 years (38%), and 97% of the children were unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown.

For the study, the researchers analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey (NIS)–Child, an annual phone survey of parents of children aged 19-35 years, overseen by the CDC. Using data from 2011-2022 to identify the percentage of children who did not receive an MMR vaccination at or after 12 months old, the researchers then evaluated those who had no vaccines at all, had received the MMR before 12 months old but no subsequent dose (as recommended), had vaccine visits at or after 12 months old for non-MMR vaccines, and had vaccine visits before age 12 months but none after.

Then they used 2020-2022 data to compare vaccination coverage of routinely recommended vaccine series between non-MMR vaccinated children who did and did not have visits after 12 months old.

Among 196,386 children with provider-verified vaccine records in the 2011-2022 data, 7.1% of US children didn't receive the MMR on or after their first birthday (95% CI, 6.9%-7.4%). The most common scenario among those not vaccinated with MMR were children who had vaccine visits before their first birthday but none after that. Rates of children who didn't receive the MMR ranged around 7%-8% through 2019 and then fell to 6%-7% in 2020-2022.

Over that time, the proportion who had vaccine visits before 12 months old but not after ranged from 3.1% in 2011 to 5.1% in 2019. A smaller proportion, ranging from 3% in 2011 to 1.5% in 2022, had vaccine visits after their first birthday, but they did not include the MMR.

Among the children not vaccinated with MMR from 2020-2022, those who had non-MMR vaccine visits after 12 months were most likely to have received two doses of the hepatitis B vaccine — recommended at birth and at the 2-month visit — and two doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), given at 2 and 4 months. Approximately 60%-65% of those with non-MMR appointments after their first birthday had received two doses of those vaccines. The children were least likely to have received three doses of the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV, 50%), and only slightly more likely to have received three doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (approximately 55%) or two or three doses of the Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine (approximately 53%).

But all children with non-MMR vaccine appointments after 12 months old were significantly more likely to have received two to three doses of DTaP, IPV, PCV, hepatitis B, and the Hib vaccines.

Charlotte A. Moser, MS, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, was not involved with the study but found two aspects of the findings interesting.

“First, they demonstrate that each year about 3%-4% of children are being lost to follow-up during the second year of life,” Moser told Medscape Medical News. “This is an important observation as clinicians can focus on implementing programs to decrease this loss of follow-up. Second, over time, it appears that acceptance of vaccines in the second year of life has improved when children are not lost to follow-up — around 3% in 2011-2012 compared with about 1.6% in 2020-2022.”

She suggested that providers' implementation of programs to decrease patient loss to follow-up during their second year of life could improve overall vaccination rates, and the MMR should be part of those discussions.

Moser also pointed out a more broadly important NIS finding. “Important to NIS data over the past several years, only about 1% of children remain completely unvaccinated by 24 months of age,” so nearly all children are getting at least some recommended vaccines.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the University of Montana Center for Population Health Research. The authors reported no disclosures and Moser had no disclosures.

Right ventricular global longitudinal strain (RVGLS) and right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (RVOT VTI) measurements were associated with mortality in critically ill patients with pulmonary embolism. RVGLS was independently associated with the development of heart failure at 6 months.

“Our work provides evidence for the hypothesis that these variables should be evaluated in PE [pulmonary embolism], especially to assess the management of critically ill patients with PE,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Manuel Ruiz-Bailén, MD, PhD, University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain. It was published online on March 28, 2025, in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

The cohort spanned 23 years, during which changes in diagnostics and therapeutics, including the use of different equipment, must have occurred; therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution. The echocardiographic measurements did not account for basic clinical data such as mechanical ventilation parameters and other predictors of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, it was not feasible to perform adequate stratification as proposed by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, particularly because sensitivities and other values had changed over the past 24 years.

 April 30, 2025  

Emergencies happen anywhere, anytime, and sometimes medical professionals find themselves in situations where they are the only ones who can help. Is There a Doctor in the House? is a Medscape series telling these stories.

“Dad, they just called for a doctor.”

It was a routine flight home to Hawaii from Salt Lake City with my two daughters. About midway through, I was half asleep, half watching a movie, when one of my daughters poked me. 

I flagged a flight attendant. “Could you use some help?”

“I have a woman giving birth,” she said.

I hurried over there, but the situation wasn't quite as described. The woman had already delivered her baby in the bathroom.

The baby was clearly premature, no more than 29 weeks. He was so small he could fit in my hands. And he was not looking good, blue and grunting.

Miraculously, I wasn't the only medical professional there. We had three neonatal intensive care unit nurses and a physician assistant on this flight.

The first thing we had to do was tie off the umbilical cord. A football player from The University of Utah, Salt Lake, Utah, gave us his shoelaces to use.

We couldn't resuscitate the baby until we were able to physically separate him from mom. We needed to cut the cord. On land it's easy to find scissors, but TSA spends a lot of money keeping sharp objects off planes. We had nothing.

We searched for anything that was sharp enough to cut. Finally, one of the flight attendants found a small first aid kit that had a pair of aluminum scissors, and we used them to sort of saw through the cord.

While we assessed the baby, I was also communicating with the pilot. I asked if we could turn around and fly to San Francisco. He said, “No, we're beyond the point of safe return.” That meant we had nearly 4 hours of flight time left with a critically sick baby.

With a premature baby, the things you worry about are body temperature, blood sugar, and oxygenation. An airplane is about the worst place to be for all of those — cold, high altitude, low pressure. Also, nothing is sterile.

So we began to build our own incubator. We had the flight attendants warm up water bottles, and we packed the baby in those.

Next, we needed to give the baby oxygen. The plane did have an oxygen tank, but the only oxygen masks were those yellow ones for emergencies. It would fit over his head like a bucket, preventing us from watching for signs of distress.

Fortunately, we found a small pediatric resuscitation mask. We cut the oxygen equipment and duct taped it together to make an even smaller oxygen mask, so we could provide oxygen manually.

We didn't have suction, and we were thinking we might have to use a straw. But luckily, the baby didn't seem to need it.

There was no pulse oximeter, but we had a thermometer. We also had a blood glucometer, but we decided against using it in this nonsterile environment. I used my Apple Watch as a heart monitor, and that worked really well.

While we were doing all of this, two of the nurses stayed with the baby's mom. They were very experienced. After they helped her deliver the placenta, they had her lie down in the emergency exit row. Our biggest concern was that she would bleed. But as the baby was so small, the delivery was relatively uneventful.

Baby had started to pink up and gain some color, so we were able to tuck him in on his mom's chest, what we call the kangaroo position. That helps a baby warm up, especially a preemie. The nurses were also very creative and used plastic bags as insulation, so he wouldn't lose moisture and heat through his skin.

Baby was breathing easier and he finally went to sleep on mom's chest. But he still hadn't cried. That worried me. It's one of the first things you want to happen. In my experience delivering babies, usually mom's screaming, baby's screaming, dad's screaming. But this was an almost completely silent delivery.

Once we got the baby settled in, I talked to the mom.

“How long have you been pregnant?” I asked.

“I didn't know I was pregnant,” she said.

That was a surprise.

A cryptic pregnancy is when someone is unaware they are pregnant. This happens in about 1 in 400 births. Fortunately, once labor started the mom was aware enough to catch the baby as it was coming out. She was definitely in shock.

While the whole event was stressful, there were a few lighthearted moments. Because we were in the emergency exit row, every time one of us would change seats or move over to work with the baby, the flight attendants would come over and say, “Look, I'm really sorry, but federal law requires me to ask you this question: Would you be willing and able to assist in the event of an emergency?”

I was like, Isn't one emergency enough for this flight? 

At one point, I looked up, and every single person had their phone out, filming what was going on. Many were relatives. It turned out that the mom's mom, dad, brothers, sisters, and cousins were onboard, all going on a family trip to Hawaii. Everyone — except the father of the baby.

I said to her, “As soon as we land, you're going to have to call him. Once we hit the ground, those videos are going to be everywhere, and he cannot find out he's a father on social media.”

I was also thinking, We're a thousand miles from the nearest hospital. There's a possibility this kid might not make it. I was very concerned that this woman might have to go through the shock of both having and losing a baby in public.

Finally, the plane landed. The pilot announced that we had a healthy baby boy born on the flight. Everybody was clapping and cheering. It was kind of a fun moment.

Except, I was still worried. This baby hadn't cried yet, but he was breathing better.

The pilot asked everyone to stay in their seats while about 10 firefighters and police officers came on board. We helped pick the mom up to put her in a wheelchair. And at that moment, the baby woke up and started to cry for the first time.

My heart just stopped. We made it. He was going to be okay.

And I knew right where he was going, Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu. I know all the neonatologists there. He was going to be in great hands.

Now, I was thoroughly exhausted.

Because I live in Hawaii, I was able to spend quite a bit of time with the family while the baby was recovering. He spent 10 weeks in the NICU, but he's a tough little guy.

His mom is a brave lady. She adjusted to the fact that her life was going to be dramatically different from that moment forward. The dad flew in, and they handled becoming parents and being world famous overnight pretty well.

Later, I got a call from the airline asking what I thought about the supplies on the flight and how to improve them. I offered some suggestions like adding a pulse oximeter and a better stethoscope. Basic items that could be invaluable in an emergency. They probably can't carry a complete baby delivery kit. But there's instant oxygen now, stop-the-bleed kits, and other small, self-contained items that can increase chances of survival.

What amazed me was just how supportive and engaged everybody on the plane was. This happened in the middle of COVID. None of the passengers complained. People moved out of their emergency row seats so we could work there. They offered whatever they had to help out.

Several people gave us diapers. They were bigger than the baby, but we still appreciated it.

The nurses were absolutely incredible. We had so many people trying to help this kid get home safely. We felt like we had angels with us up there because things could easily have gone the other way.

This family went home with a souvenir that most people don't get on their Hawaii trip. And he arrived at 500 miles an hour, 40,000 feet up. Quite an entrance.

For the first time, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has surpassed 7 million, according to the Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures report released this week.

An estimated 7.2 million people aged 65 years or older are now living with AD, up from an estimated 6.9 million in the 2024 report. Three quarters of people with AD are aged 75 years or older.

By 2060, the number of people aged 65 years or older with Alzheimer's dementia is projected to reach 13.8 million, barring the development of breakthroughs to prevent or cure AD.

“With the rising prevalence of Alzheimer's, it's more important than ever that researchers, clinicians, health systems, public health officials, and other stakeholders work together to ensure all Americans have access to timely and appropriate Alzheimer's diagnosis, care, and treatment,” Elizabeth Edgerly, PhD, senior director for Community Programs and Services at the Alzheimer's Association, said in a news release.

The association projected total annual costs of caring for people living with AD and other dementias (excluding unpaid care) to reach $384 billion in 2025, up from $360 billion last year. Nearly 12 million family members and friends provide 19.2 billion hours of unpaid care, valued at an additional $413 billion.

Preliminary data for 2023 indicate that AD will remain the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Based on an analysis of death certificate data, the number of deaths from AD increased by 142% between 2000 and 2022, while deaths from heart disease — the number-one cause of death — decreased by about 2%.

Among people aged 70 years, 61% of those with AD are expected to die before age 80 compared with 30% of those without AD.

The Association also released an accompanying special report, American Perspectives on Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease in the Era of Treatment.

This nationwide survey of more than 1700 US adults aged 45 years or older showed that Americans are eager for early diagnosis and treatment. Among the key findings:

Americans' interest in early diagnosis and treatment “highlights how important it is that we keep advancing toward diagnostic testing that is simple to administer and widely available,” Edgerly said.

“We also heard loud and clear that Americans want disease-modifying treatments that can make a real difference after an Alzheimer's diagnosis,” Edgerly added.

More than 90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) accepted the switch from the adalimumab reference product to adalimumab biosimilars, with favourable survival and remission outcomes and a positive patient experience at 12 months. A poor opinion of generic drugs was associated with the refusal to switch.

""Our findings support the feasibility and acceptance of switching to biosimilars by physicians managing IBD patients in clinical practice,"" the authors wrote.

""While our findings suggest that addressing patient concerns and enhancing education about biosimilars — potentially with the support of a trained nurse to guide the transition — may improve the overall experience and persistence with these therapies, further studies with comparator groups are needed to better assess the nurse's role in facilitating these transitions,"" they added.

This study was led by Gabrielle D'Abbundo, Claude Huriez Hospital, University of Lille 2, Lille, France. It was published online on April 23, 2025, in Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology.

This study was conducted at a single centre with a small sample size and a relatively short follow-up duration. The consideration of only five adalimumab biosimilars may have limited the generalisability of the findings. The lack of endoscopic evaluations during the study period may have hindered the objective assessment of disease activity.

This study did not receive any specific financial support. Several authors reported receiving board membership and personal, consultancy, and lecture fees from various pharmaceutical and healthcare companies.

Vasectomy, an increasingly popular method of male contraception, is appealing because of its simplicity, reliability, and effectiveness. However, its irreversible nature can sometimes lead to regret among patients. To address this, European experts, including Belgian teams, have developed a tool to predict potential regret following the procedure.

Performed under local anesthesia, vasectomy involves cutting and tying the vas deferens, which is responsible for delivering sperm from the testicles. This method offers permanent contraception without affecting the sexual drive or performance. Although it provides a viable alternative to female contraceptive methods, which are often more complicated, the irreversibility of a vasectomy makes it a risky choice, particularly in the event of a change in personal or family conditions.

The Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc in Brussels and Université Catholique de Louvain in Namur, both in Belgium, contributed to a major European multicenter study. Coordinated by a panel of 52 experts involved in male health, the study assessed 1200 men who had undergone vasectomy in the past 15 years.

The study was conducted in three stages. Initially, the experts identified 17 factors that could be associated with postoperative regret. These factors ranged from the patient's age, perception of gender roles in contraception, level of education, and impulsiveness. These factors were then analyzed in the patients included in the study before being integrated into a decision-making algorithm.

Five of the risk factors were significantly associated with the risk for post-vasectomy regret: Age less than 35 years at the time of vasectomy, high impulsivity score measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness scale, low level of education, misunderstanding the concept of “definitive nature” of the procedure, and patients relying on female contraception. Three of these factors, along with two “sine qua non” conditions, were used to build the decision algorithm.

The goal was to provide a simple and practical decision-making tool for preoperative consultations. If the risk score was 4 or higher, the healthcare professional is required to inform the patient about the possibilities of information on sperm cryopreservation options before vasectomy. A score of 7 or higher suggests delaying the procedure to give the patient additional time to reflect.

This scoring system is not designed as a selection tool but rather as a guide to support informed choices.

In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), higher disability scores were associated with lower levels of vitamin B6; however, endurance exercise resulted in an increase in levels of vitamins B6 and B2 in patients with greater disability, a secondary analysis of a new trial showed.

""This investigation sheds light on the understudied role of B vitamins in people with MS,"" the authors wrote. ""It should further be investigated whether B-vitamin supplementation may offer therapeutic benefits in counteracting progressing disease mechanisms in different stages of MS,"" they added. ""Exercise as a therapeutic intervention appears to induce changes in distinct B-vitamin concentrations, supporting further research on their potential therapeutic effects,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Sergen Belen, Institute of Sport and Sport Science, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany. It was published online on April 17 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

This study relied on serum concentrations, limiting conclusions about levels of vitamin B in other tissues or the cerebrospinal fluid. The study lacked data on dietary intake during the intervention. Additionally, confounding factors such as differing or abnormal renal function may have influenced serum concentrations of vitamin B.

The randomised controlled trial was funded by the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society. Two authors reported being paid employees of Bevital AS.

Only 5% of patients with trauma experienced significant hypoxemia within the first 8 hours of care, with no difference observed between restrictive and liberal oxygen strategies.

""These findings suggest that, among trauma patients not already requiring continuous monitoring, such episodes of hypoxemia are relatively rare in the early post-trauma period,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Oscar Rosenkrantz, Centre of Head and Orthopaedics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on March 18, 2025, in the Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine.

This study enrolled patients mostly during regular working hours and from only two sites, limiting the generalizability of its findings. Key data on oxygen titration and treatment responses were poorly documented. The exclusion of patients with brief monitoring and baseline differences between groups may have introduced bias. The trial setting and the presence of unmuted alarms may have influenced clinician behavior, potentially underestimating the incidence of hypoxemia. Additionally, the small sample size may have limited the power to detect differences between groups.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

One of the things I think was a very sad, terrible theme that came up in many political campaigns — it was in the Trump campaign and in campaigns of various governors and senators — was the idea that immigrants, whatever one thinks of our clearly broken immigration policy, somehow are threats to the health of the American people. 

There were suggestions flying around that immigrants were bringing bad genes into the country. These were kind of allusions to out-of-date discredited views about eugenics, and that we don't want them here because they're going to somehow weaken the health of our race. You can hear businessmen touting these ideas. Some of our billionaire entrepreneurs talk about the threat they see. This sometimes goes under the name of the “great replacement theory.” 

We know that most of the groups that people are talking about aren't even a genetic class. There are no Guatemalan genes. There are no Panamanian genes. There really aren't any groups that cluster around many of the cultural and social terminologies that we use to describe people. There are no Somali genes. There are no Vietnamese genes.

These people have genes, but it's culture, history, and even, to some extent, colonialism and racism, that defines the group, not some cluster of genes that's in the group. I don't mean to suggest there aren't genetic diseases. There are. I don't even mean to say that there aren't genetic diseases that cluster within some ethnic and racial groups, but in the immigration debate, those categories are often phony.

It's even worse now as people begin to think about deportation. Some officials, in high office and at the state and even local levels, are talking about identifying diseases that people might be bringing with them if they come into the country legally or illegally. 

There's a public health law known as Title 42, which in the earliest days of the pandemic when coronavirus was bouncing around, gave people the right to prohibit immigrants who were thought to be carrying diseases into the country. I think, currently, some are thinking they can extend that to get people out of the country — citizens or not, dreamers or not, whatever they might be — because they are carriers of disease. 

I think it's hugely important for doctors and public health professionals to speak up and say that this is just false, whether you're telling patients who bring it up and worry about it in the office, you're at a town meeting, or you're thinking about testifying about one of these issues in your community. There is no evidence that any immigrants, particularly, let's say, on the Mexican border, are bringing in more coronavirus, tuberculosis, or measles.

It's just not true that immigrants are disease carriers or that they brought plagues or disease problems into this country. It's an old idea. It was used in the 19th and 20th centuries to prohibit migrants from Eastern Europe, China, and Ireland, again and again, with people charging that they were carriers of disease and that they would infect us. 

There's not much evidence that it was true then, and there's certainly no evidence that it's true now. Fishing for disease as a reason to restrict, ban, or deport people is not something that medicine should be complicit with. 

We can still decide what immigration policies we want. Adding bogus, phony, or disinformation science as a rationale is bad not only in terms of being the wrong reasons to deal with someone who wants to immigrate, but also it is a way to stereotype and make a group bear a claim of being disease ridden or having inferior health. That really isn't fair and isn't right to saddle them with, wherever they live. 

I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Thanks for watching.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Children of immigrants from India were more likely to develop atopic diseases if born in the United States or Canada than those who emigrated with their parents, according to new research published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global.

Additionally, parents overall had lower rates of conditions like asthma and food allergies than their children born in North America. This is a trend that pediatricians and allergists who emigrated from India have noted anecdotally.

Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Food Allergy and Asthma Research at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and senior author of the study, said she was inspired to conduct the research because of her own experience.“Both our kids are highly atopic, and we are not,” Gupta said. Gupta and her husband emigrated from India to the United States, and neither of them have conditions like allergic rhinitis.

Gupta and her colleagues surveyed physicians from India to track shifts in the development of atopic diseases after immigrating.

The 148 physicians surveyed reported developing allergic rhinitis and food allergies more often after migration (21.6%) than before migration (12.8%; P = .048).

Nearly 34% of children included in the study had migrated with their parents, and the remaining were born in North America (n = 183). Children born in North America vs India had higher rates of asthma (18.6% vs 8.6%), allergic rhinitis (36.1% vs 19.4%), and food allergies (17.5% vs 5.4%), the researchers found.

The survey is part of a larger effort to understand generational shifts in atopic disease. Gupta hypothesized changes may be linked to the microbiome or specific environmental exposures.

Clinicians might advise parents to introduce a wide variety of foods during infancy, such as peanuts that were once thought best avoided to prevent allergy, Gupta said. Parents might also moisturize a child's skin to lower the risk of developing eczema. The American Academy of Dermatology endorses this strategy, although other research suggests applying moisturizers does not prevent the condition.

The focus in the new study was children of immigrants, but the nonprofit Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) noted that 1 in 13 US children have food allergy, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 10% of children in this country have eczema, a potential precursor to allergic rhinitis and food allergies.

Mahboobeh Mahdavinia, MD, PhD, head of allergy and immunology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said many parents who have immigrated tell her no one in the family had allergies in their home countries but all their kids do since moving to the United States. Studies have documented what Mahdavinia has observed.

“Second-generation immigrants have very high rates of atopy, and that's across all atopic diseases,” said Mahdavinia, who was not involved the latest research.

Pediatricians and primary care clinicians should screen all children for signs of atopy, rather than assuming some children have more protection against allergies based on their parent's background. Clinicians might also want to inquire about dry skin or concerning eating habits that can inform a screening for atopy, she said.

“We know that the babies get dry sky here more, and dry skin is the mother of eczema,” Mahdavinia said.

Gupta reported receiving funds from FARE. Mahdavinia reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

 April 30, 2025  

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed precisely measured human fecal material to foster a new era in gut microbiome research. 

According to the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for Gut Microbiome Research & Education, this critical resource will help advance the utility and reproducibility of microbiome-based diagnostics — “which still remain relatively meaningless clinically, although patients continue to buy direct-to-consumer tests, and a standard reference material will mean there's a better way to ensure quality control and accuracy.” 

Though not a therapeutic, Human Fecal Material RM is expected to speed up gastrointestinal (GI) therapeutics since many microbiome-based drugs are inspired by fecal transplants with human stool as the developmental starting point. A standardized reference material will be an important resource as industry develops and tests new drugs. It can be purchased online at the NIST Store (shop.nist.gov).

The product consists of eight frozen vials of exhaustively studied human feces suspended in aqueous solution. Available are more than 25 pages of data identifying the key microbes and biomolecules in the material. Scientists, including those working at biopharmaceutical and biotech companies, can use this material to further their research and develop new drugs that target the microbiome, including treatments that contain living bacteria. 

According to NIST, the stool material is “the most precisely measured, scientifically analyzed, and richly characterized human fecal standard ever produced. 

“The project ran for about 6 years from start to finish, the last 2 for manufacturing, characterization, and writing,” said NIST molecular geneticist Scott A. Jackson, PhD, who helped develop the product. “We hope our reference material will lay the foundation for gut microbiome research to thrive and reach its full potential.” 

As founder of NIST's Complex Microbial Systems Group, Jackson is leading international efforts to improve microbiome and metagenomic measurements by organizing inter-lab studies and refining reference materials and methods. 

The project collected stool from two cohorts of donors, ie, vegetarians and omnivores, with each cohort comprising four to six donors. Material from each cohort was pooled and homogenized before being aliquoted into 5000 vials per cohort. About 300 tubes from each cohort were picked, and aliquots then underwent multiomic analyses. 

Offering his perspective on the new product, Sudhir K. Dutta, MBBS, MACG, associate professor in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, said, “This tool will be 100% useful for microbiome research.”

And according to Lori Holtz, MD, MSPH, professor of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, the material will aid microbiome research by allowing interpretability and repeatability across studies. “Microbiome research is a relatively new field, and protocols differ from group to group and lab to lab, so it's been difficult to compare results across studies,” she told Medscape Medical News. “A standard stool product will allow for greater comparability in preclinical studies and later clinical trials testing interventions to alter the microbiome.”

The NIST developers are looking forward to reaction from the GI research community. “Over the last several years, we've released smaller pilot batches of material to smaller groups of stakeholders,” said Jackson. “We've used the feedback on these earlier batches to inform the manufacturing and characterization of the final batch that was released in March, but we don't yet have any feedback yet on the current material.”

Jackson, Dutta, and Holtz disclosed having no relevant competing interests.

A new study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders and brain health.

 Study: Curcumin Modulation of the Gut–Brain Axis for Neuroinflammation and Metabolic Disorders Prevention and Treatment. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock.com

A recent Nutrients study explores the medicinal role of curcumin in the treatment and prevention of neuroinflammation and metabolic disorders.

Curcumin is extracted from the rhizome of turmeric, which is otherwise known as Curcuma longa, a plant in the Zingerberaceae family.

Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound characterized by two aromatic rings with conjugated double bonds. The chemical structure of curcumin supports its electron donor role and prevents free radical formation.

Phenolic compounds impart color to many fruits and play a vital role in facilitating seed dispersal. Polyphenols also protect plants from oxidative damage caused by sunlight and other environmental factors, in addition to preserving the organoleptic qualities of plant food products like red wine, olive oils, and wheat.

Polyphenols are mostly soluble in organic solvents like acetone and ethanol and insoluble in water. These compounds also remain stable in acidic conditions, such as the stomach, which allows curcumin to remain intact to influence metabolic processes beyond the gastrointestinal tract.

Enzymes in the intestines and liver degrade curcumin in two phases. During phase I, the double bonds in curcumin are reduced to produce metabolites like dihydrocurcumin, hexa-hydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, and octahydrocurcumin.

During phase II, these metabolites are conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate. Some studies have reported that curcumin may also be metabolized by gut bacteria, particularly in the colon.

Polyphenols can counteract inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are processes implicated in the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Certain metabolites derived from curcumin, such as tetrahydrocurcumin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin. In human THP1 monocytes, curcumin doses ranging from 7.5 μM to 30 μM successfully mitigated the effects of stimulation with bacterial toxin (LPS) and INFγ (interferon γ) in a dose-dependent manner. This antioxidant activity was attributed to the blocking of toll-like receptor 4 / mitogen-activated protein kinase (TLR4/MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways, as well as reversed M1 polarization.

Curcumin doses of 25.5 μM or less have also been shown to reduce inflammasome activation. One recent study also reported that 20 μM of curcumin may prevent inflammation-related damage caused by hypoxia.

A recent meta-analysis revealed that consuming 1,500 mg or more of curcumin every day for one month could significantly reduce body mass index (BMI) values and other body parameters, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Considering its medicinal properties, various curcumin-based formulations have been devised to improve the bioavailability of this polyphenol compound, such as co-administering curcumin with piperine and nanocurcumin encapsulation.

In vitro studies have reported that curcumin influences the cellular viability rate and cell cycle regulation of preadipocytes. At high doses, curcumin promotes DNA fragmentation and enhances the apoptotic rate by activating caspases.

Low doses of curcumin reduce cell proliferation without affecting viability. Mechanistically, curcumin reduces the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and delays clonal expansion and the cell cycle, thereby exerting antiadipogenic effects.

Curcumin also interferes with adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) activity to block anabolism and promote lipid catabolism, both of which can support the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome. More specifically, activated AMPK reduces lipogenesis by inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), prevents triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (GPAT-1), and triggers β-oxidation of fatty acids by increasing transport with carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1).

Within the brain, low doses of curcumin may prevent inflammation by inhibiting microglia polarization and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, like interleukin 1β  (IL-1β) and IL-6. Curcumin also increases the activity of anti-inflammatory molecules like arginase 1 and IL-4.

Clinical trial results have highlighted the beneficial effects of curcumin in treating overweight patients with chronic systemic inflammation. For example, 80 mg of curcumin daily for three months led to a significant reduction in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in overweight/obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) between 25 and 50 years of age.

In a separate study, type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients treated with 300 mg daily of curcuminoids for three months exhibited a significant reduction in insulin resistance parameters and circulating levels of free fatty acid (FFA), which are often present in high amounts in obese patients with inflammation. Obese patients with T2D and depression who were treated with 1,500 mg daily of curcuminoids for one year also reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms.

The oral administration of curcumin affects the intestinal microbial composition, particularly the genera Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella, which increases short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis in the cecum and colon. Multiple studies have also reported the neuroprotective effects of curcumin through its activity throughout the gut-brain axis.

In the future, additional research is needed to confirm the translational potential of curcumin in clinical practice. Large clinical trials with heterogeneous populations should also be conducted to confirm the clinical utility of curcumin in treating patients with metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

A new study finds that regardless of how loneliness is defined, by how often, how distressing, or how long it lasts, it leaves a consistent psychological footprint, with common patterns like low self-esteem and heightened social sensitivity.

Study: Revisiting the cognitive and behavioral aspects of loneliness: Insights from different measurement approaches. Image Credit: Jorm Sangsorn / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers in Austria and Switzerland investigated the cognitive and behavioral differences between participants with low and high loneliness using three independent classification methods: frequency, distress, and chronicity. The study aimed to assess the agreement between these classification methods, informing future research and treatment interventions for this growing public health concern.

Study findings demonstrated a fair to substantial classification agreement, but also revealed the considerable impact of cognitive and behavioral traits, such as interpretation bias, participant self-esteem, and social avoidance, on participant group differences across classification methods. These results highlight the complexity of loneliness and call for future treatments to carefully consider the several dimensions of loneliness across both cognitive and behavioral axes.

Loneliness is a distressing emotional state characterized by a subjective gap between desires and perceived social connection. While exceedingly common (almost everyone experiences periods of loneliness across their lifetimes), today's fast-paced world and reductions in sufficient social interaction have exacerbated chronic loneliness to a globally relevant public health concern, affecting between 5.3–12.7% of all people and causing significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

Previous research on loneliness has distinguished between adaptive and maladaptive forms of loneliness. While the former is an evolutionary cue that encourages increased social connections, the latter results from cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies and can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues, as outlined in Cacioppo and Hawkley's cognitive loneliness model.

""This model suggests that loneliness triggers a cascade of cognitive processes that heighten awareness of social disconnection. These processes include heightened sensitivity to subjective social threats, negative attributions, and biased social information processing, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors such as social withdrawal and increased vigilance toward potential social threats and thereafter maintain or increase feelings of loneliness.""

A distinct yet often overlooked difference between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness is its persistence. Current measures of loneliness, including the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the Rasch-Type Loneliness Scale (RTLS), may not sufficiently account for the persistence and other dimensions of maladaptive loneliness's complexity, thereby compromising their ability to classify patients accurately and inform subsequent treatment. It is essential to note that while this study explores the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, its primary focus is on the maladaptive aspects and does not directly investigate adaptive loneliness in practice.

The present study revisits the evaluation of loneliness through the lens of the cognitive model of loneliness. It evaluates cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals across the loneliness spectrum by first classifying them via three distinct classification methodologies (frequency, distress, and chronicity), subsequently evaluating the degree of agreement between these methodologies, and finally elucidating the impacts of these psychological variables as dependent outcomes (rejection sensitivity, interpretation bias, self-esteem, etc.) among individuals grouped as lonely or not lonely.

Study data was obtained via an online survey hosted on SurveyCircle, internet forums, and social media. Target participants were German-speaking adults aged 18 years or older. Additional participant information included age, sex, education level, employment status, and relationship status.

Loneliness frequency was evaluated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short version). Loneliness distress was measured using a 2-item custom query ('Do you feel lonely?' in combination with 'extent of distress due to loneliness'). Loneliness chronicity was evaluated via participant-reported loneliness duration, with a 24-month cutoff.

Additionally, interpretation bias was recorded using the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ), social avoidance behavior using the Cognitive-Behavioral Avoidance Scale (CBAS), rejection sensitivity using the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ), comfort of self-disclosure using the Distress Disclosure Index (DDI), self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and avoidance goal intensity using the Inventory of Approach and Avoidance Goals (IAAM) scale.

To account for confounds introduced by overlaps with anxiety and depression, psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Subscale (SIAS-6).

Of the 1,389 individuals who participated in the online survey, 553 did not complete it, and 44 participants failed data integrity checks, resulting in a final study cohort of 790 participants (mean age = 31.86, 81% female). Loneliness classification methodologies classified 15.95%, 29.75%, and 19.49% of participants as 'lonely' based on frequency, distress, and chronicity criteria, respectively.

Agreement analyses between classification methodologies revealed moderate agreement between frequency and distress criteria (78.10%, Cohen's κ = 0.40), fair agreement between frequency and chronicity (79.74%, Cohen's κ = 0.31), and substantial agreement between distress and chronicity (86.96%, Cohen's κ = 0.65).

""…these results indicate that while there is some overlap between different loneliness classification methods, they are not entirely interchangeable. The varying levels of agreement across measures suggest that each method captures a distinct aspect of loneliness, with distress and chronicity showing the highest alignment and frequency showing lower agreement with the other methods.""

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that individuals classified as lonely using frequency classification were more likely to experience rejection sensitivity and lower self-esteem (large effects), interpretation bias, social avoidance behavior, and lower distress disclosure (medium effects), as well as avoidance goal intensity (small effects). Notably, similar cognitive and behavioral differences were observed across all three classification methods. However, the effect sizes varied, with distress-based classifications showing the strongest associations and chronicity-based classifications showing similar but sometimes smaller effects.

The authors note several limitations to their findings. The cross-sectional design of the study does not permit conclusions about causality; therefore, it remains unclear whether cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies cause persistent loneliness or result from it. There is also a potential for self-selection bias, as individuals experiencing loneliness may have been more inclined to participate in a study explicitly advertised as focusing on loneliness, potentially inflating prevalence rates. The sample was predominantly female (81%) and relatively young, which may limit the generalizability of the results to broader or different populations. Additionally, the study relied solely on self-report measures, which can introduce response biases such as underreporting or overreporting feelings due to social desirability or recall issues. The assessment of chronic loneliness overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced participants' perceptions of the duration of their loneliness. Furthermore, the study was not pre-registered, which limits transparency regarding hypothesis testing.

The present study reveals that while classifications of loneliness patients according to differing criteria (frequency versus distress versus chronicity) may display fair to substantial agreements, nuanced evaluations of these patients highlight stark differences in their dimensions and experiences of loneliness. At the same time, the cognitive and behavioral correlates associated with loneliness were consistent across classification methods, suggesting a shared profile of maladaptive traits among those identified as lonely by any of the three approaches. This is indicative and cautionary as it underscores the complexity of the behavioral and emotional response to feelings of loneliness, emphasizing the need for a broader understanding of patient needs when initiating interventions against the condition.

""Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to build on these findings, further to investigate the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, and develop effective strategies to combat loneliness.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI tools could prevent maternal heart-related deaths","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250429/AI-tools-could-prevent-maternal-heart-related-deaths.aspx","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 02:28:00 GMT","

Every year, some mothers die after giving birth due to heart problems, and many of these deaths could be prevented. The ability to screen for heart weakness before pregnancy could play a crucial role in identifying women who may need additional care to improve pregnancy outcomes. Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Anja Kinaszczuk, D.O., and Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D., tested artificial intelligence (AI) tools, using recordings from an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a digital stethoscope, to find unknown heart problems in women of childbearing age seen in primary care. 

Study findings published in the Annals of Family Medicine show high diagnostic performance of these technologies to detect left ventricular ejection fraction below 50%, indicating heart muscle weakness. These tools were tested on two groups of women aged 18 to 49. 

The AI-ECG demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of .94 while the AI digital stethoscope, Eko DUO, achieved an even higher AUC of 0.98, indicating strong diagnostic accuracy. In the second cohort, the prevalence of positive AI screening results was 1% for the AI-ECG and 3.2% for the AI-stethoscope. 

Statistically, nearly half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and approximately 1% to 2% of women may have heart problems they don't know about. Our research findings suggest that these AI tools could be used to screen women before pregnancy, allowing for improved pregnancy planning and risk stratification, early treatment, and better health outcomes which addresses a critical gap in current maternal care.""

Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo, cardiologist and senior author of the study

This research builds upon earlier published studies, including a pilot prospective study evaluating AI digital tools to detect pregnancy-related cardiomyopathy among obstetric patients in the U.S. and a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of women in Nigeria who were pregnant or had recently given birth. Collectively, this research highlights the potential of AI to modernize cardiovascular screening, enabling earlier identification and management of heart muscle weakness in women of reproductive age. Further research is underway to explore the potential of using these technologies to screen for heart weakness in broader populations. 

Mayo Clinic has licensed the underlying technology to EKO Health for its digital stethoscope with embedded ECG electrodes and to Anumana for the 12-lead ECG. Mayo Clinic and some study authors have a financial interest in this technology. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.

Despite steady increases in rates of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy, racial disparities in IBR have persisted in the years since implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reports a study in the May issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer.

""Our study demonstrates that Hispanic women are more likely to undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts in the post-ACA era,"" comments lead author Rachel E. Schafer, MPH, a medical student at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. ""However, our analysis shows persistent racial disparities in breast reconstruction care. To better understand these trends, future studies are needed for targeted interventions to ensure equitable reconstructive care for all patients with breast cancer.""

The researchers used data from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project to analyze trends in IBR. The analysis focused on the impact of the ACA, which had some provisions – such as expanding protections for pre-existing conditions and reducing the number of uninsured Americans – with the potential to enhance healthcare access to historically marginalized groups. The analysis included 224,506 patients undergoing mastectomy in 2005-08, before passage of the ACA; or 2016-22, after full ACA implementation.

Pre-ACA data showed significant racial disparities in IBR. Reconstruction rates ranged from 35.1% in White patients to 28.8% in Asian patients, 22.3% in Black/African American patients, and 3.8% in American Indian/Alaska Native patients. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity were also less likely to undergo IBR: 28.0%, compared to 33.4% in non-Hispanic patients.

After ACA implementation, IBR rates increased across racial groups. The largest increases were seen for American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American patients: by 27.6% and 24.2%, respectively, compared to a 16.9% increase among White patients. Smaller but significant increases were seen in Asian patients and those classified as ""other"" race. Hispanic patients had a 25.8% increase in IBR, compared to 14.5% in non-Hispanic patients.

However, racial minority groups continued to have lower IBR rates in the years since the ACA rollout. In 2016-22, the IBR rate was 52.0% among White patients, compared to 46.5% for Black/African American, 38.7% for Asian, and 31.4% in American Indian/Alaska Native patients. In contrast, Hispanic patients were more likely to undergo IBR compared to non-Hispanic patients: 56.6% versus 45.7%.

The researchers note some important limitations of their study. It cannot account for the wide range of factors affecting access to reconstructive surgery or for the ""complex interplay of cultural, social, and individual factors"" affecting decisions about breast reconstruction.

For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction can restore form and enhance patient satisfaction. The new analysis shows ""a steady increase in immediate breast reconstruction rates in all minority groups when compared to White patients"" since the ACA.

""However, despite this advancement, disparities persist among different racial groups, indicating a complex landscape of reconstructive surgery rates despite legislative efforts,"" the researchers write. ""These findings underscore the need for continued efforts to address disparities and promote equitable reconstructive care.""

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have developed a new diagnostic test that can quickly and accurately diagnose bacterial meningitis. The test measures the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that is already often tested in blood to detect bacterial infections. Research shows that elevated CRP in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. Currently it often takes a long time before meningitis is diagnosed, which delays the start of adequate treatment. The study is published today in The Lancet Regional Health Europe. 

Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening condition in which one in six patients die and half of the survivors have residual symptoms. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. 

The distinction between bacterial meningitis and similar conditions is often difficult for doctors. Until now, reliable diagnostic tests that could quickly distinguish were lacking.""

Matthijs Brouwer, last author and Amsterdam UMC neurologist 

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have discovered that the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. CRP is already frequently tested in blood to detect bacterial infections, but the value of this test in cerebrospinal fluid had not been well researched until now. After previous successful laboratory tests, the researchers now showed that the device that measures CRP in blood is also sensitive enough to measure CRP in cerebrospinal fluid. 

""It is a huge gain that the existing infrastructure of the laboratory can be used for the CRP measurements in cerebrospinal fluid. As a result, the test result is already known half an hour after the epidural and the correct treatment of the patient can therefore be started quickly,"" says Brouwer. 

Since June 2024, the new test has been used in the daily practice of the Amsterdam UMC. In the study published today, researchers describe how the test was introduced and how effective it is in practice.

""Our results show that all patients with bacterial meningitis had an elevated CRP in their cerebrospinal fluid. This was the case in only a few patients without bacterial meningitis, "" adds Brouwer. The test also proved reliable in additional studies in children and patients from at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark. 

It is expected that more hospitals will adopt the test, because it can easily be performed in laboratories with existing equipment. The test only costs between three and five euros, providing an affordable and accessible solution to diagnose and treat bacterial meningitis faster. 

""Any laboratory in which CRP is measured in blood can introduce this test for cerebrospinal fluid tomorrow. We could not have predicted in advance that a new diagnostic test would be used in patients within a year of its discovery,"" concludes Brouwer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers why anxiety and depression lead to low self-belief","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250429/Study-uncovers-why-anxiety-and-depression-lead-to-low-self-belief.aspx","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 02:31:00 GMT","

Researchers at UCL have uncovered why individuals who experience anxiety and depression often struggle with persistent low self-belief in their abilities.

A new study, published in Nature Communications, examined two large groups of people (230 and 278 participants) to measure their ""confidence"" when doing individual jobs and their ""self-belief"" when judging their overall performance of these individual jobs collectively.

They found that those with symptoms of anxiety and depression tended to build their overall self-belief by focusing their attention on jobs where they thought they didn't perform as strongly (i.e. on low confidence) – rather than also considering jobs where they did perform well (i.e. on high confidence).

In order to gain a better understanding of how participants evaluate themselves (also known as metacognition or their awareness and understanding of their own thought processes), they were asked to complete a computer game, which asked them to help the residents of a fictional town, named ""Fruitville"", to complete their farming jobs.

These jobs required skills involving fine-grained vision (to distinguish different fruits) as well as memory (to remember which fruits were picked). For each completed job, participants were also asked to report their confidence in their performance.

Then at the end of each session of the game, they reported how well they thought they performed on the entire session (i.e. overall self-belief about their ability).

During the game, an auditor occasionally appeared to give people feedback on how well they were doing.

The researchers found that people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression did not differ in their performance on the games than those with less strong symptoms.

They also found that positive feedback boosted overall self-belief, and negative feedback reduced it in all participants – regardless of whether they had symptoms of anxiety or depression.

However, people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression still had lower overall self-belief. This is because they tended to ignore those jobs within the game where they felt confident in their choices and instead, focused on times when they were less confident.

This reduced sensitivity to their own confidence helps explain why people with certain mental health conditions have persistent low self-belief - despite their actual performance not differing from others and despite receiving similarly positive feedback.

Lead author, Dr. Sucharit Katyal who completed the work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and is currently at the University of Copenhagen, said: ""Overall, our findings offer a simple yet powerful message – that the persistent negative self-beliefs experienced by people with anxiety and depression are often illusory, and may be rooted in a dysfunctional view of how they evaluate themselves . This would also explain why anxiety and depression symptoms are also closely linked to imposter syndrome where some people persistently doubt their achievements despite being competent.

""When forming beliefs about ourselves, we should take our own metacognitive estimates with a pinch of salt, and perhaps adequately rely on the feedback provided by others.""

The researchers now hope that their findings will help pave the way for more effective interventions and support strategies for people with anxiety and depression.

By understanding how these individuals respond differently to their own performance and feedback, we can develop better strategies to support them in building and maintaining confidence – so they can flourish in the workplace and beyond.""

A recent video produced by Vapourtec highlights the patented automatic Variable Bed Flow Reactor (VBFR) demonstrating fully automated solid phase peptide synthesis.

The process begins with swelling Tentagel S resin in DMF, preheating and Fmoc deprotection using 20% Piperidine in DMF. A reduction in resin volume marks this deprotection step, tracked on the VBFR's volume graph and detected by UV at 365 nm, producing a distinct Fmoc peak.

Following deprotection, activated amino acids (AAs) are introduced, causing the resin volume to expand. This step is visualized by a darker orange slug travelling through the resin. The reagents flow through the resin in a single pass only rather than traditional recirculation. 

Vapourtec's unique single-pass process provides higher purity crude peptides. The VBFR's automated system efficiently manages repeated cycles of Fmoc deprotection and AA coupling, elongating the peptide chain while maintaining precise control over the resin ensuring no channeling or dilution of reagents.

The VBFR demonstrates its ability to both identify and mitigate aggregation events. GLP-1 sequence aggregation is identified during the coupling of F and E amino acids. By operating at elevated temperatures and maintaining a controlled environment, the process minimizes aggregation severity compared to room-temperature or batch methods.

The Vapourtec software interface keeps users informed of each step providing real-time UV and resin volume data, simplifying the process and allowing researchers to focus on optimizing reaction conditions and results without manual monitoring.”

Employing too few permanent nurses on hospital wards is linked to longer inpatient stays, readmissions, patient deaths, and ultimately costs more in lives and money, finds a long term study published online in the journal BMJ Quality & Safety.

Redressing the balance is cost-effective, saving an estimated £4728 for each year of healthy life gained per patient, but not if temporary agency staff are used to plug the gaps, the findings indicate. 

Inadvertent understaffing–through unfilled vacancies–or deliberate–through cost cutting measures–of ward nurses risks harming hospital patients, and is a key contributor to nursing recruitment and retention issues, say the researchers.

Much of the existing research on the impact of the nursing staff:patient ratio is cross- sectional and so of limited use in determining causal factors, they add.

To find out if investing in higher nurse staffing levels to offset understaffing would be cost-effective, they set out to estimate the associations between registered nurse and healthcare assistant staffing levels and risk of patient deaths, readmissions, and length of stay in acute adult inpatient wards.

They drew on data provided by four NHS hospital trusts with diverse nurse staffing levels, sizes, teaching status, serving diverse local populations in England. Three of the trusts provided acute inpatient services predominantly from single hospital sites, and the fourth provided inpatient services across four sites within one city.

The data were derived from electronic healthcare records and staffing rosters and spanned the period April 2015 to March 2020 for a total of 626,313 patients in 185 different acute care wards.

Two main nursing team roles were included in the study: registered nurses (RNs) who have completed university degree level training and are registered with the profession's regulator; and nursing support staff (such as healthcare assistants) who don't have this level of training and who are largely unregulated.

The incremental cost effectiveness of eliminating the understaffing of these two roles was estimated from the costs and consequences of moving from the observed staffing shortfall averaged over the study period to the planned staffing level. 

Patients spent an average of 8 days on the ward. Over the first 5 days of their inpatient stay, patients were provided with a daily average of just over 5 hours of care from RNs and just under 3 hours of care from nursing support staff.

The calculations showed that patients on wards understaffed by RNs were more likely to die (5% vs 4% for those with adequate RN staffing levels), to be readmitted (15% vs 14%), and to stay in hospital longer (8 days vs 5 days), with similar figures for inadequate numbers of nursing support staff. 

Patients who experienced understaffing received an average care shortfall of 1 hour 9 minutes/day in the first 5 days, while those who didn't experience understaffing, received an average of 3 hours 22 minutes of care above the ward average. 

During the study period, 31,885 patients died. Each day a patient experienced RN understaffing (staffing below the ward average) during the first 5 days of their stay, the risks of death and readmission within 30 days increased by 8% and 1%, respectively. When all 5 days after admission were understaffed, length of stay increased by 69%. 

Days of nursing support understaffing were also associated with similar increases in the risks of death and length of stay within 30 days: 7% and 61%, respectively. But the risk of readmission within 30 days fell by 0.6%.

The estimated total cost of providing care for the 626,313 adults included in the study amounted to £2,613,385,125, or £4173 per admission.

The researchers calculated that eliminating understaffing of both nursing roles would cost an additional £197 per patient admission, avoiding 6527 of the 31,885 deaths during the study period and gaining 44,483 years of life in good health. 

This equates to an additional staff cost of £2778 per healthy year of life, and £2685 if reduced sick leave and averted readmissions are taken into account. But accounting for reduced length of stay amounts to savings of £4728 per additional year of healthy life gained-an overall cost saving from increasing staffing levels.

If agency staff are used to eliminate understaffing instead, staff costs for each additional healthy year of life gained were higher, ranging from £7320 to £14,639.

""The findings give no indication that it makes rational economic sense to target efforts to rectify low staffing only on the most acute patients. Not only is this logistically difficult for patients whose acuity is emergent (occurring while on a general ward), it also gives much less benefit at a considerably higher cost per unit improvement in outcome,"" explain the researchers. 

""Steps to address low staffing for the general (lower acuity) population are likely to benefit high-acuity patients as well, in so far as they are in the same units, whereas the opposite is unlikely to occur if interventions are targeted on high-acuity patients in high-acuity units,"" they add.

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that the data came exclusively from hospitals in the English NHS, so may not be more widely applicable. Understaffing was also judged relative to ward norms rather than a validated assessment of staffing need.

But the researchers conclude: ""When considering alternative policy strategies, this study indicates the importance of prioritising investment in RNs employed on wards over support staff, as well as showing there are no shortcuts to employing enough RNs, as using temporary staff is more costly and less effective.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Exercise helps mitigate cancer treatment side effects","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250429/Exercise-helps-mitigate-cancer-treatment-side-effects.aspx","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 02:17:00 GMT","

Exercise can counter the detrimental effects of cancer treatment, such as heart and nerve damage and brain fog, suggests an overarching review of the existing pooled data analyses of the most recent research, published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Exercise also seems to boost psychological wellbeing and overall quality of life, lending weight to its routine inclusion in treatment protocols for the disease, say the researchers.

Several pooled data analyses of the available research have evaluated the impact of exercise on health outcomes in people with cancer, but significant gaps remain in our understanding, explain the researchers.

And to date, no comprehensive evaluation of the results of existing pooled data analyses on exercise and health outcomes in people with a broad range of cancers has been published, they add.

To plug this gap, with the aim of strengthening the evidence base and informing clinical care, the researchers carried out an umbrella review of the existing pooled data analyses of randomised controlled trial results, published between 2012 and July 2024.

The review included 485 associations from 80 articles, all evaluated as being of moderate to high quality. 

Among these associations, the types of exercise of any length, intensity, and duration included mind–body (138, 28.5%), such as Qigong, tai-chi, and yoga; aerobic and resistance exercise (48,10%), high intensity interval training (HIIT) (18,4%); and other types (281,59%). 

These associations were explored in people with cancers of the breast (244, 50%), digestive system (20,4%), blood (13, 3%), lung (47,10%), prostate (12, 2.5%) plus others (149, 31%).

In all, 260 (54%) associations were statistically significant, and 81 (17%) and 152 (31%), respectively, were supported by high and moderate certainty evidence, according to GRADE criteria-used to assess the certainty of scientific evidence and the strength of recommendations in health care. 

Exercise significantly reduced various side effects associated with cancer and its treatment compared with usual care or no exercise. For example, it lessened heart and peripheral nerve damage associated with chemotherapy, brain fog (cognitive impairment), and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). 

It also changed body composition and key physiological indicators of health, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and C-reactive protein in people with cancer. And it improved sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, the normal workings of the body, and social interaction, while boosting overall quality of life. 

And there was evidence of high to moderate certainty that preoperative exercise reduced the risk of postoperative complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and risk of death.

The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings. The pooled data analyses included in the review differed considerably, including the number of studies on which they variously drew.

Participants with cancer able to exercise might also have been healthier, the researchers suggest. And side effects of treatment vary, depending on cancer type and how advanced the disease is, they point out.

But they conclude: ""Incorporating mind–body exercises into the exercise guidelines for people with cancer may be a valuable consideration. Future high quality research is needed to explore additional outcomes, clarify underlying mechanisms and refine exercise prescriptions tailored to cancer type, treatment timing, exercise modality and individual characteristics, ensuring more precise and clinically relevant interventions for diverse cancer populations.""

AVI-4773 and related MPro inhibitors outperform existing treatments like nirmatrelvir in preclinical studies, offering a promising path toward pan-coronavirus therapies.

 Study: Structure-based discovery of highly bioavailable, covalent, broad-spectrum coronavirus MPro inhibitors with potent in vivo efficacy. Image Credit: H_Ko / Shutterstock.com

Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous novel antiviral therapeutic agents have been developed to target key proteases involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication. Nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir, for example, are main protease (Mpro) inhibitors that are currently approved for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.

The continuous emergence of highly transmissible, pathogenic, and immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants has weakened the efficacy of existing antiviral agents. Moreover, the looming threat of future pandemics due to coronaviral reservoirs in bats and other small mammals emphasizes the importance of identifying novel therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity.

A recent study published in Science Advances reports the recent discovery of Mpro inhibitors that exhibit broad activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

Previously, the researchers of the current study screened 862 million custom molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, which led to the identification of several scaffolds with micromolar inhibitory activity. AVI-1084, for example, exhibited a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 29 μM.

This scaffold was subsequently used to contract a library of over 17,000 analogs that were evaluated for their binding activity to and docking into Mpro. Seven of these analog compounds exhibited in vitro Mpro activity, the most potent of which was AVI-3570 with an IC50 of 1.5 μM. The improved potency of these compounds was attributed to fluoro- and chloro- substitutions in the thiophene ring of AVI-1084 that increased their interactions with the Mpro S2 pocket.

However, none of the seven identified compounds were capable of modifying the key pyridinone group occupying the S1 pocket. When an isoquinoline group was used to replace the pyridinone ring, AVI-3318 was created and found to be 50-fold more potent than AVI-1084.

X-ray crystallography of the AVI-3318-MPro complex provided similar results to the docking simulation assay and confirmed all hypothesized major interactions between the compounds and both the S1 and S2 pockets of Mpro. Additional structure-activity relationship (SAR) expansion involved adding various side chains at the remaining two positions of the dihydrouracil core in an effort to further improve compound potency.

AVI-4303, which is a C5 benzotriazole analog, exhibited ten-fold higher potency than AVI-3318. Comparatively, N1 propargyl analogs including AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 successfully bound to the S1 site with a nanomolar IC50, which is 100-fold more potent than the des-propargyl molecule AVI-4375, which had an IC50 of 7.4 μM.

Mouse in vivo studies demonstrated powerful antiviral activity of AVI-4516 against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant of concern (VOC). AVI-4692 and AVI-4694 also exhibited potent activity against human common cold coronaviruses like α-HCoV 229E and β-HCoV OC43, as well as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the SARS-CoV-2 Beta, Delta, and BA.2 variants.

Most analogs lost activity against nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants; however, AVI-4516 remained highly potent against the SARS-CoV-2 E166Q variant. AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 retained similar potency to nirmaltrevir, whereas AVI-4692 and AVI-4694 were more potent than nirmatrelvir when tested against a triple mutant containing the most common mutations associated with drug resistance.

AVI-4773 reduced viral titers to undetectable levels  after three doses, which is a three-log reduction in viral load as compared to ensitrelvir treatment.

The combination of C6-aryl substitution with the propargyl warhead [AVI-4694] has great potential to produce an agent that effectively targets recently emergent variants of SARS-CoV-2.”

The inhibitory activity of AVI-4773 and other compounds in this series is likely due to the unactivated N-propargyl side chain. Despite being a weak electryophyl, the N-location of the terminal alkyne of this side chain helps to stabilize the compound to facilitate its reaction with the Mpro Cys145. The alkyne warheads cause powerful and permanent inhibition, which is comparable to the reversible inhibition produced by the noncovalent binding of the nitrile warheads in nirmatrelvir.

AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 exhibit potent MPro inhibition, which warrants additional research to optimize the chemical structure of these tool compounds for the development of future pan-coronavirus therapeutics.

Some of the key advantages of this distinct chemotype include easy modification by functional groups or substitutions at different binding sites, simple synthesis protocol, reduced manufacturing costs, potent pan-coronaviral activity, as well as superior pharmacokinetic properties and tissue distribution.

Good fitness can reduce the risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging. This recognition should be included in updated health recommendations, say researchers behind the new review.

The news that even small amounts of physical activity can provide major health benefits received a lot of attention in Norway when NTNU researchers Ulrik Wisløff and Atefe R. Tari published their book “Microtraining – 7 weeks to boost fitness and strength” in January this year.

Now the same researchers have looked at the connection between physical activity, or being in good physical shape, and brain health. This research was conducted with colleagues from the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia.

 

The study, which has been published in the British medical journal The Lancet, shows that the brain definitely benefits from physical activity.

Even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain. This should be communicated more clearly - it may be what motivates people to get started.

Endurance training and good fitness can reduce the risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.

"" And it is never too late to start,"" says Atefe R. Tari, the study's first author.

Even small amounts of physical activity may be enough to protect the aging brain, the researchers concluded.

""We summarize research that clearly indicates that exercise is not only important for the heart, but also for the brain. Physical activity appears to be one of the most promising measures we have to prevent cognitive decline and dementia,"" Tari said.

The article evaluated evidence from both animal and human studies, and shows how physical activity affects inflammation, blood flow, immune function, brain plasticity and the release of protective molecules in the blood - processes that weaken with age and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

""These are mechanisms that play an important role in the development of dementia and cognitive decline,"" Tari said.

Tari and Wisløff are researchers at the Cardiac Exercise Research Group (CERG) at NTNU, and have previously promoted the idea that microtraining - going from no activity to incorporating small doses of pulse training into everyday life - be included in the recommendations from Norwegian health authorities.

Today, the recommendation is at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of high intensity per week.

""Fully 50 to 70 per cent of the population does not manage today's activity recommendations, Wisløff said.

The researchers point out that exercising much less than what the current recommendations recommend can provide great benefits - as long as the intensity of the training is high.

Tari and Wisløff believe that this new study makes it even more important to get the message out.

""We believe it's time for health authorities to provide clearer advice on how important exercise is for the brain. Our review shows that even small doses of high-intensity activity - equivalent to brisk walking where you can't sing - can reduce the risk of dementia by up to 40 per cent,"" Wisløff said.

International research supports the NTNU researchers' findings. In a commentary in Nature Medicine in January, American researchers argued that public guidelines need to be updated. Even small doses of physical activity provide health benefits.

""Today's recommendations emphasize total activity, but we show that even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain. This should be communicated more clearly - it may be what motivates people to get started. A little is better than nothing - and it's never too late to start,"" says Tari.

As life expectancy increases, cognitive decline and dementia are becoming a major public health challenge. Since there is still no cure, prevention is crucial.

""Exercise is cheap, accessible and has no side effects. It should be considered a first-line measure to preserve brain health,"" Tari said.

A higher tax on cigarettes in low and middle-income countries can help to reduce child mortality, especially amongst the poorest children, a new study led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet and published in The Lancet Public Health suggests.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a tax of at least 75 percent on the retail price of cigarettes, but most countries impose a much lower tax than that.

If all 94 countries included in the study had raised their cigarette tax to the level recommended by the WHO, the lives of over 280,000 children could potentially have been saved in a single year. Not only that, it would narrow the socioeconomic gap in child mortality rates in line with the UN's sustainable development goals.""

Márta Radó, principal investigator, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden

The study examined the link between cigarette taxes and under-five mortality among different income groups in 94 low and middle-income countries.

The study is based on publicly accessible data from the WHO, the World Bank and the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) covering the years between 2008 and 2020. The researchers analysed the links between child mortality and different types of cigarette tax, such as specific excise duty (a fixed tax per packet regardless of sale price), ad valorem duty (a percentage of the product's value), import duties and VAT.

Their calculations suggest that higher cigarette taxes can improve childhood survival among all socioeconomic groups, while reducing differences in survival between the richest and poorest groups. Excise duties had the most salient effect.

""Smoking related morbidity and mortality among children is disproportionately high in low and middle-income counties,"" says lead author Olivia Bannon, researcher at Karolinska Institutet and Linköping University in Sweden. ""An increase in cigarette tax is a vital policy measure that can improve the health of children worldwide, especially in the most vulnerable groups.""

 ""We know that the tobacco industry has a number of well-established tactics to undermine, disrupt and delay the implementation of effective tobacco control measures globally, including increasing taxation. Our study provides compelling evidence for governments to overcome tobacco industry interference and other obstacles to implement higher taxes on tobacco in LMICs."" says Dr. Rado.

The study was conducted in close collaboration with Jasper Been, paediatrician and researcher at Erasmus MC (the Netherlands) and researchers at McGill University (Canada) and Imperial College London (the UK). It was financed by Forte (the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare), Riksbankens Jubileumsfond and the EU Horizon 2020 Programme.

What is Berberine, and how does it work?
The ozempic comparison: Where it comes from 
Evidence review: Berberine for weight loss and metabolic health
Regulatory and safety concerns
What do experts say?
Conclusion – A natural alternative or just hype?

Berberine, a bioactive alkaloid derived from various plants, including Berberis species, has garnered significant attention as a nutraceutical agent due to its potential benefits in metabolic health.

Recently, it has been popularly labeled ""nature's Ozempic,"" referencing its claimed similarities to the pharmaceutical agent Ozempic (semaglutide), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and facilitating weight loss.

​​​​​​​Image Credit: Anna Hoychuk/Shutterstock.com

Ozempic functions primarily by enhancing insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon release, and reducing appetite, mechanisms distinctly tied to GLP-1 receptor activation. The rising popularity of Berberine is largely attributed to anecdotal claims and preliminary studies suggesting comparable metabolic effects, including improved glycemic control, weight management, and lipid profile modulation.1

However, despite this surge in interest and the compelling narrative equating it with Ozempic, the central scientific question remains: Is there clinical and molecular evidence that justifies the comparison of Berberine to semaglutide?

Exploring this question necessitates a careful examination of existing pharmacological data, clinical trials, and mechanistic studies to ascertain whether Berberine's effects truly parallel those mediated by GLP-1 receptor agonists or whether the analogy may oversimplify and misrepresent the distinct biological pathways involved.1

Berberine has long been utilized in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine to treat conditions including inflammation, skin disorders, infections, diabetes, gastrointestinal ailments, and respiratory issues. In Ayurveda, plants containing Berberine, such as Berberis aristata, are specifically applied for wound healing, jaundice management, and addressing eye, ear, and digestive system conditions.1,2

Pharmacologically, Berberine activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is crucial for regulating cellular energy balance. It also modulates lipid and glucose metabolism, showing promise in managing metabolic diseases like diabetes and hyperlipidemia.1,2

Berberine's primary natural sources include Berberis vulgaris (barberry), Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal), Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape), and Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread).

Typically, roots, barks, and stems of these plants contain the highest berberine concentrations. Ongoing research continues to explore Berberine's potential therapeutic benefits in treating metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory disorders.1,2

The Natural Molecule That Could Rival Ozempic

Ozempic (semaglutide) works as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, stimulating insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Its effectiveness in diabetes and weight loss has spurred the media and wellness industry to coin the term ""Ozempic-like,"" used loosely to describe natural products that supposedly mimic these metabolic effects.3,4

Berberine, for instance, frequently labeled as ""nature's Ozempic,"" has gained popularity through anecdotal claims of weight reduction and improved glycemic control. However, scientifically, the mechanisms differ significantly.

Ozempic directly activates GLP-1 receptors, triggering distinct hormonal pathways. In contrast, Berberine primarily modulates AMPK, influencing metabolism indirectly by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism pathways.

While both may result in improved metabolic health, equating Berberine's AMPK modulation to Ozempic's direct hormonal influence oversimplifies complex pharmacological realities.2

Current evidence does not strongly support a direct comparison between Berberine and Ozempic; rather, they share superficially similar outcomes through fundamentally distinct mechanisms. Thus, the popular ""Ozempic-like"" label appears driven more by marketing appeal and anecdotal evidence than scientific validation.

Berberine has demonstrated significant potential in managing metabolic health and obesity through various mechanisms. Clinical trials indicate that Berberine effectively reduces blood glucose, insulin resistance, and improves lipid profiles.

In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, a 3-month trial showed significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and postprandial glucose levels, comparable to metformin. Additionally, significant decreases in triglycerides and cholesterol were observed, highlighting Berberine's beneficial impact on lipid metabolism.

Similarly, berberine supplementation in patients with poorly controlled diabetes notably lowered HbA1c, fasting insulin levels, and insulin resistance, indicated by a substantial reduction in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).5,6

A systematic review of Berberine's role in weight loss further supports its efficacy. Animal studies have demonstrated Berberine's anti-obesity mechanisms, including the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation through downregulation of adipogenic genes such as Liver X Receptors (LXRs), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), and Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs).

It also decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose accumulation through modulation of AMPK. In humans, Berberine positively impacts obesity by modulating gut microbiota diversity at doses as low as 500 mg/day and significantly improving cholesterol metabolism at 300 mg/day. Despite these promising outcomes, notable gaps remain in the research.

Most studies involve limited sample sizes, short duration, or lack comprehensive safety evaluations. Further long-term, randomized controlled trials across diverse populations are necessary to definitively establish Berberine's clinical effectiveness, optimal dosage, and long-term safety profile in managing metabolic health and obesity.5,6

What's Next for Semaglutide? Beyond Diabetes and Weight Loss

Berberine is not regulated as strictly as pharmaceutical drugs like Ozempic (semaglutide). Unlike prescription medications, dietary supplements such as Berberine are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to market release, meaning their safety, quality, and efficacy are not thoroughly reviewed.6,7

Berberine, typically dosed around 500 mg three times daily, has demonstrated therapeutic potential for diabetes and lipid disorders, comparable to pharmaceuticals like metformin. However, gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal discomfort, have been reported in approximately 35% of patients, especially during initial usage.6,7

Importantly, Berberine may interact adversely with hypoglycemic medications, potentially causing excessive lowering of blood glucose levels, and it can also interact with antibiotics. In contrast, prescription drugs such as Ozempic undergo rigorous FDA evaluations to confirm their safety and proper dosing.

Concerns have arisen regarding compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs, with the FDA receiving over 700 adverse event reports due to dosing errors or unapproved formulations. The FDA explicitly warns against using illegally marketed or compounded drugs without proper medical oversight, emphasizing the critical safety advantage of regulated pharmaceuticals over unregulated supplements like berberine.6,7

Experts remain cautiously optimistic about Berberine's therapeutic potential, especially in managing type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorders. Jun Yin, an endocrinologist at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, conducted a pilot study showing that Berberine significantly reduced hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, and lipid levels, with efficacy comparable to metformin.

However, he also noted transient gastrointestinal side effects in over 30% of patients, emphasizing the need for monitoring and longer-term studies to assess safety and sustainability.6

Clinical pharmacologists have pointed out that Berberine modulates glucose and lipid metabolism by activating AMPK, inhibiting gluconeogenesis, and improving insulin sensitivity. Yet, they urge caution due to its complex pharmacokinetics and potential interactions with other drugs, especially hypoglycemics and antibiotics.1

A systematic review by the Endocrinology and Nutrition Unit, University of Pavia, concluded that Berberine positively influences gut microbiota and cholesterol absorption at doses around 300-500 mg/day, supporting its role as an adjunct in obesity and diabetes care. Still, they emphasized the absence of standardized dosing and long-term trials.5

In summary, while Berberine shows promise, experts advocate for regulated clinical use, appropriate patient selection, and more rigorous studies to validate its safety and efficacy across broader populations.

Berberine offers promising metabolic benefits, including improved glucose control and lipid profiles, supported by preliminary clinical and mechanistic studies. However, unlike semaglutide (Ozempic), Berberine lacks robust long-term trials, standardized dosing, and regulatory oversight.

Its media portrayal as “nature's Ozempic” oversimplifies the science and may mislead consumers. While it may serve as a complementary option for some individuals with metabolic disorders, it should not replace clinically approved therapies.

Experts urge responsible use, especially due to potential drug interactions and side effects. Readers should view Berberine as a potentially beneficial supplement—used cautiously, not as a substitute for evidence-based medications.

Researchers have shown that better cardiovascular and mental health, as measured by the Life's Crucial 9, correlates with lower infertility rates in women; however, its predictive power offers no advantage over existing tools.

Study: Life's crucial 9 is inversely and linearly associated with female infertility prevalence: a cross-sectional analysis from NHANES 2013–2018. Image Credit: FotoDuets / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored the associations between Life's Crucial 9 (LC9) and female infertility.

Female infertility is a common reproductive condition. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study found that female infertility prevalence has increased by over 56 million cases in the past three decades worldwide, and is also projected to increase over the next decade. Female infertility can cause emotional and psychological stress. Besides, female infertility may be linked to the development of various gynecologic cancers, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular disease.

As such, exploring risk factors for infertility for the reduction of disease burden and early prevention has important implications for reproductive health. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) is a tool for cardiovascular health assessment by the American Heart Association. Recently, LC9 was proposed, building on the LE8, and includes a mental health assessment component. LC9 is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, but with a limited increase in predictive power over LE8.

The present study examined the associations between female infertility and LC9. Female participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2013 to 2018 were included. Females not of reproductive age and those with missing data were excluded. LE8 was assessed by pooling four health behaviors (sleep health, physical activity, diet quality, and nicotine exposure) and four health factors (body mass index [BMI] and blood pressure, glucose, and lipids).

The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 was used to assess diet quality. Sleep health, physical activity, and nicotine exposure were self-reported. The blood glucose score was determined based on glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, or a history of diabetes, while the blood lipid score was derived from serum levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A depression score was calculated from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

The LC9 score was calculated as the average of the scores from the eight LE8 components and the depression score, each scaled from 0 to 100. Female infertility was ascertained from the self-reported Reproductive Health Questionnaire. Covariates included age, ethnicity/race, education, marital status, income-poverty ratio, alcohol intake, age at menarche, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) history, and intake of birth control pills.

Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between female infertility and LC9. The models were unadjusted (crude), partially adjusted (model 1), or fully adjusted (model 2). Furthermore, restricted cubic spline models were examined to investigate non-linear associations between the independent variable and female infertility. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether LC9 improves over LE8 in predicting female infertility.

The study enrolled 2,088 females, with an average age of 32.6 years. The prevalence of infertility was almost 14%. The infertile population was more likely to be non-single, non-Hispanic White, and older than females without infertility. Infertile females had lower LE8 and LC9 scores. As LC9 scores increased, subjects were younger, non-Hispanic White, free from infertility, moderate/light or never drinkers, and had higher age at menarche and no PID history.

The fully adjusted model indicated that a 10-point increment in LC9 reduced the odds of female infertility by more than 21%. Similarly, a 10-point increment in LE8 decreased the odds of infertility by nearly 18%. Both LE8 and LC9 showed negative linear associations with female infertility. Further, higher scores for BMI, sleep health, blood glucose, and depression were each independently and inversely associated with infertility. Other LC9 components—diet quality, physical activity, nicotine exposure, blood lipids, and blood pressure—were not significantly associated.

Further, the team identified ethnicity/race and age as significant effect modifiers. That is, the associations between infertility and LC9 were more pronounced in the Mexican American population and in women under 35 years. The ROC curve analysis revealed that LC9 and LE8 had comparable predictive capabilities for female infertility, with modest area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.594 and 0.590, respectively, indicating limited predictive utility.

The findings reveal inverse linear associations of LE8 and LC9 with female infertility. Depression, blood glucose, BMI, and sleep health were the components of the LC9 that were (inversely) associated with female infertility. However, LC9 did not significantly outperform LE8 in predicting female infertility. These results suggest that incorporating a depression score into LE8 may not be essential for infertility prediction, despite depression's association with infertility. The authors note that the overlap between depression and other cardiovascular risk factors may reduce its added predictive value, and that depression assessment tools like the PHQ-9 may introduce subjectivity. Future research should examine the benefits of LC9 in other health domains, particularly in young women and underserved ethnic groups, and explore interventions targeting modifiable LC9 components, such as sleep and mental health. Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported measures, and the inability to infer causality.

A new systematic review has found that parents and other child caregivers who have alcohol-related diagnoses are twice as likely to maltreat children in their care than parents and caregivers with no alcohol-related diagnoses. 'Alcohol-related diagnoses' included alcohol-related hospitalisation, alcohol-related service use, or a history of clinically determined alcohol dependence. 'Child maltreatment' included physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse; neglect; and other types of maltreatment such as harsh parenting.

The study pooled the results from twelve studies of child maltreatment. All were cohort studies in high-income countries: three in Australia, one in Denmark, one in New Zealand, two in South Korea, one in the United Kingdom, and four in the United States. The sample size ranged from 501 to 84,245 (median 4782). Caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses were associated with higher child maltreatment incidence (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.89) and recurrence (1.92; 1.13-3.28) compared with caregivers without alcohol-related diagnoses.

Lead author Dr. June Leung, of the SHORE & Whariki Research Centre, Massey University, says ""To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the relationship between caregiver alcohol use and all types of child maltreatment. We found consistent associations between caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses and child maltreatment. We also could not rule out a link between any caregiver drinking and child maltreatment. Our findings call for stronger actions to limit alcohol harm, including child maltreatment.""

ByManuel Veth,

 Contributor. 

How much will Bundesliga clubs Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund make at the upcoming 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States? A report by the German magazine kicker this week shed light on the finances of the tournament.

The world soccer governing body FIFA had previously communicated that the tournament would include a $1 billion prize pool distributed to the 32 teams. The winner of the tournament could earn up to $125 million.

For European clubs like Bayern and Dortmund that would have been €923 million when FIFA made the announcement. The collapse of the US dollar, however, means that the prize pool to be earned by clubs from UEFA has dropped to just €877 million.

The prize pool is divided into two categories. The first category is the sporting performance pillar which is worth $475 million. The second category is the participation pillar worth $525 million.

While all teams from South America ($15.21 million), Oceania ($3.58 million), and all other confederations ($9.55 million) will receive the same guaranteed amount of money this isn't the case for Europe. According to FIFA, clubs from UEFA, the participation money will vary between $12.81 million and $38.91 million.

How does this break down for the two Bundesliga clubs? While Austrian club RB Salzburg is the lowest end of the prize pool available for European clubs. This is determined by the UEFA club co-efficient ranking and the club's contribution to UEFA marketing over the last four years.

Based on that, kicker have calculated that Manchester City ranks ahead of Real Madrid within UEFA's ranking. Man City will, therefore, receive around $38 million from participating in the tournament. Real Madrid ranks second with $35.8 million.

The two Bundesliga clubs Bayern and Dortmund rank third and sixth respectively. This means that Bayern will earn a guaranteed $33.5 million and Dortmund $26.6 million. The report adds that Man City could earn a maximum of €110.4 million ($125 million).

With Bayern ranked only marginally behind the Premier League giants, the expectations in Munich are that the Rekordmeister could earn over $100 million from playing in the tournament. Dortmund would come in just under the $100 million mark should the Black and Yellows win the tournament.

Both clubs have aspirations to go deep in the tournament. The Rekordmeister has been very aggressive in its pursuit to sign Florian Wirtz from competitor Bayer Leverkusen. With Leverkusen expecting €140 million ($160 million) for the player, a deep run at the Club World Cup would help Bayern.

For Dortmund, in the meantime, the expectation was that the tournament would help alleviate the financial impact of missing out on Champions League football. But recent results in the Bundesliga have put Dortmund back in the race for a top-four spot. Hence, the tournament could now be a significant financial bonus rather than an insurance policy for Dortmund.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Liverpool may be the new champion of England, but that won't be enough to give it a shot at being crowned the world champion this summer.

The party on Merseyside continues after the Premier League title was won at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a resounding 5-1 win over Tottenham. Having secured a 20th league title, the Reds are now back on their perch, as Sir Alex Ferguson would say, after going back level with Manchester United's tally.

And, no matter what Rio Ferdinand says, there can be no debate now about who the most successful team in England is, with Liverpool's next task being to go beyond its Old Trafford rival once again.

Despite boasting more silverware than any other team in England, Liverpool won't be traveling to the United States to represent the Premier League in this summer's revamped Club World Cup.

FIFA's expanded tournament gets its first run-out in June, with 32 teams from the six continental confederations set to battle it out to be crowned champions of the world.

AFC - Al Hilal, Urawa Red Diamonds, Al Ain, Ulsan HD

CAF - Al Ahly, Wydad Casablanca, Esperance de Tunis, Mamelodi Sundowns

CONCACAF - Monterrey, Seattle Sounders, Pachuca, Inter Miami, TBD

CONMEBOL - Palmeiras, Fluminense, Flamengo, Botafogo, River Plate, Boca Juniors

OFC - Auckland City

UEFA - Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, PSG, Inter Milan, Porto, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg

Liverpool misses out on a place at the tournament, with qualification restricted to the winners of the respective confederations' top club competitions between 2021 and 2024. That's why Chelsea and Manchester City are both involved, having won the Champions League in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

As you may have noticed though, that criteria doesn't cover every club. In fact, it only applies to three of the 16 teams from UEFA.

Prices vary

Additional places are determined by a club ranking over the four-year period, with FIFA imposing a two-team-per-nation rule, hence why Liverpool misses out despite reaching the 2022 Champions League final. In fact, had the Reds beaten Real Madrid in Paris that year, they would have taken Chelsea's place at the tournament due to their superior ranking in Europe.

In truth though, Liverpool shouldn't be too disappointed with its snub by FIFA. After a long season which came off the back of a hectic international summer, Arne Slot will no doubt relish the opportunity for his players to take a well-earned break before embarking on their Premier League title defense.

One of his current squad could be involved in the US though, with Real Madrid reportedly hoping to have Trent Alexander-Arnold available for the tournament - assuming he doesn't choose to extend his stay at Anfield.

Manchester City have a busy Summer ahead of them as they take part in the first-ever edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, which gets underway in the middle of June and concludes a month later. 

Manchester City are set to see their season come to an end in the next few weeks, with their final aims coming as finishing in the top five of the Premier League and also winning the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. 

The FIFA Club World Cup is set to start on the 15th of June and run all the way until the 15th of July. This will be the first time this worldwide competition will take place. 

32 of the world's biggest clubs are participating in the group stage, where eight groups of four have been drawn. Then, the tournament will feature the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and then the grand finale, where one club will become the first to lift the trophy and become champions of the world. 

""We will see how we finish the season and see how we arrive in that tournament together, and then we will see what happens.""

""Normally, whenever I start a competition, for example, like the Premier League, never do I start thinking, 'Oh, we are going to win, etc.' So, one step at a time.""

""Try to play better than we played in the league, arrive in better conditions everyone and after we see.""

DAMAC Properties will be Chelsea's front-of-shirt sponsor for the remainder of the 2024-25 season — but the agreement will not cover this summer's Club World Cup.

The Emirati property development company will sponsor Chelsea's shirts for the side's remaining four Premier League games of the campaign, alongside their Conference League semi-final tie against Swedish club Djurgarden and a potential final in the competition. The men's team's semi-final first leg in Stockholm on Thursday will see the debut of the new sponsor.

Club sources say a competitive process is continuing for Chelsea's long-term front-of-shirt sponsor, having not had one yet this season, including potentially one covering their participation in this summer's Club World Cup. Chelsea will play at least three group games in the tournament, which is taking place in the United States and will run from June 14 through to July 13.

The 2024-25 season is the second consecutive year that Chelsea have not had a front-of-shirt sponsor for the full campaign. Infinite Athlete only signed up to a one-year deal, worth around £40million ($53.4m) in September 2023 before later agreeing to continue to be on the club's shirt during pre-season.

Proud to unveil @DAMACOfficial on the front of our shirts for the rest of the 24/25 season! 💙

— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 30, 2025



DAMAC will oversee the development Chelsea-branded residences in Dubai, a project costing upwards of £1bn, which is described by the club as “luxury living”.

Chelsea's chief operating officer Jason Gannon has said “the collaboration will bring Chelsea to life in Dubai”.

The reaction of many Chelsea supporters to this news might well be something along the lines of, ‘What's the point?'

DAMAC is only guaranteed to adorn the front of the Chelsea shirt for a maximum of seven matches if Enzo Maresca's team reach the final of the Conference League. The 2024-25 season has one month left to run, and the fact the deal does not cover the Club World Cup raises questions about just how much revenue this particular sponsorship will actually raise.

Chelsea will point to the fact that DAMAC has signed up to a longer-term commercial partnership which will see club-branded residences in a £1bn development in Dubai. This is the most interesting aspect of the deal, which club officials believe is the first arrangement of its kind, and could potentially unlock a lucrative new revenue stream.

In the meantime, the endless questions about Chelsea's lack of a front-of-shirt sponsor will go away, if only for a little while.

The club are in talks with multiple companies with a view to shirt sponsorship during the Club World Cup and beyond, and will hope to avoid a repeat of this season's unbranded shirt fronts. Securing qualification for next season's Champions League would help their chances of getting the long-term deal they want considerably.

After a rather irregular season, Ancelotti's departure from Real Madrid is practically a reality. With some LaLiga matches still pending, these are likely to be his last games with Real Madrid. An event that would confirm that, looking ahead to the Club World Cup, Real Madrid would have another coach.

While Ancelotti's future seemed to be leading the Brazilian national team toward the 2026 World Cup, everything seems to have changed. Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia has presented an interesting offer of 50 million euros per year for Carlo Ancelotti. A considerable amount, especially for such a historic coach as Carlo Ancelotti.

If Carlo Ancelotti accepts this offer, the coach would have to face Real Madrid. This is because, for the Club World Cup, Al Hilal is one of the teams that will face Madrid to try to win this championship.

Having two successful periods with Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti is preparing to end the second one. Despite all the titles he has achieved with Real Madrid, this season ended with his chances of staying at the club. Eliminated from the Champions League and losing the Copa del Rey, Ancelotti only aims to win LaLiga.

A championship that, while not insignificant, falls quite short of what was desired from Ancelotti and the club this season. Although his farewell is planned to be appropriate for him, Madridists could quickly change their opinion.

This is because, if he accepts Al Hilal's offer, he will form a team difficult to overcome for the Club World Cup. His experience at Real Madrid could work against a club that seeks to make history by being the first to win this tournament.

With Real Madrid focused on finding their next coach, facing Ancelotti has been quite a surprise. Although Ancelotti is expected to accept being Brazil's coach, Real Madrid must prepare for any occasion.

CBF reportedly considering red jersey ahead of World Cup but rightwingers consider the colour anti-patriotic

“Our flag will never be red!” rightwing Brazilians took to chanting during the heyday of the left-bashing former president Jair Bolsonaro.

But their football shirts soon might be, amid incendiary reports that the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) is considering introducing a crimson jersey for the national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Those claims have sparked predictable outrage among hardcore rightwingers who consider red the anti-patriotic colour of Brazil's leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Workers' party (PT) and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST).

“Our team's shirt will never be red – and neither will our country!” thundered Romeu Zema, a conservative governor hoping to claim the mantle of Bolsonaro, who faces jail for allegedly masterminding a failed rightwing coup after losing the 2022 election. In a social media video, Zema hurled a mock-up of the red shirt on to the ground in theatrical disgust.

Bolsonaro's politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn't red – and it never will be.”

But Bolsonaristas are not the only ones up in arms about the reported attempt to swap Brazil's blue away shirt – in use since the country won the first of its five World Cup, in 1958 – for a red one.

Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday in a viral report by the football website Footy Headlines.

The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year's World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil's official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed.

Walter Casagrande, a Lula-voting former player and commentator who is associated with Brazil's left and pro-democracy movement, called the scheme “idiocy”.

Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelho said the move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven.

Galvão Bueno, Brazil's most famous TV commentator, called the idea “a crime” and a “gigantic insult” to the glorious history of a national team which has won more World Cups than any other country.

Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. Over the past decade the country's iconic yellow jersey has become a symbol of the far right and is regularly worn at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. Many progressives now refuse to wear it.

In a pro-red shirt manifesto, columnist Milly Lacombe declared that she would wear the jersey with pride and rejected the outbreak of “collective hysteria” over the mooted shirt. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote.

Juca Kfouri, a left-leaning football writer who is among those who shun the yellow shirt, also rejected the “bad taste” change, arguing that a red shirt would further fuel the toxic politics swirling around the national team's attire and divide supporters.

“Red doesn't have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree called pau-brasil (brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century, had red in its first flag.

Kfouri suspected the red shirt story was “a trial balloon” devised to see how the money-making ruse went down with fans. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said.

For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil's next manager and a compromising exposé in a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Jackson Irvine will have foot surgery and miss Australia's World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Saudia Arabia.  (AAP :Joel Carrett)

Jackson Irvine has confirmed he will miss the Socceroos' final two World Cup qualifiers to undergo foot surgery.

Australia is currently second in their group and is holding an automatic qualification spot with two matches left.

Australia will face Japan in Perth on June 5, followed by Saudi Arabia in Jeddah on June 11.

Jackson Irvine has confirmed he will miss the Socceroos' final two World Cup qualifiers to undergo foot surgery, placing fresh stress on the depth at Tony Popovic's disposal.

Irvine backed the Socceroos to get past Japan and Saudi Arabia in crunch qualifiers and seal their passage to next year's World Cup in North America after writing on social media that he would go under the knife.

With World Cup qualification now within reach, the Socceroos are still in search of a first-choice number nine.

""I have complete confidence that both the teams I love can take the final steps towards our ultimate goals,"" Irvine posted on Instagram.

""I will be watching and supporting alongside our amazing fans every step until the end.""

The influential Australian midfielder has been sidelined for Bundesliga side St Pauli for the past fortnight with the club sending him for scans, the results indicating an operation was the best course of action for the 32-year-old.

His absence is a blow for St Pauli, who are on the cusp of avoiding relegation from the German top flight with just three games left in the season.

It's an even bigger concern for Socceroos boss Popovic, whose side hope to beat the already-qualified Japanese in Perth on June 5 and then conquer the Saudis — their closest challengers for the final automatic spot — in Jeddah on June 11 to reach next year's tournament.

The loss of Irvine comes at a time when the Socceroos are already without defensive leader Harry Souttar and wingback Jordan Bos.

In the midfield specifically, Massimo Luongo has been overlooked due to a lack of game time at Premier League side Ipswich Town, Aiden O'Neill has recently moved to the MLS with New York City, while Irvine's St Pauli teammate Connor Metcalfe has only just returned from an ankle injury.

FIFA World Cup used Argentina superstar Lionel Messi to make a special wish for Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma on the latter's 38th birthday. Rohit, who quit T20Is last year, has witnessed some unmatched highs and traumatic lows in the past one year but, still remains one of the greatest stories in Indian cricket.

Taking to social media, the FIFA World Cup collaged a picture of Rohit's T20 World Cup 2024 celebration with that of Lionel Messi during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar to wish the 'Hitman'.

During the final prize distribution ceremony at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi made a slow-motion walk to collect the coveted trophy. Rohit emulated the same when India won the T20 World Cup last year in Barbados, beating South Africa in the final.

FIFA World Cup captioned the post, “Two (emoji of crown). #HBD.”

Meanwhile, Indian cricketers, past and present wished Rohit. "" Happy birthday Ro, Wish you the very best,"" KL Rahul posted on his Instagram story. Rohit's former opening partner, Shikhar Dhawan, posted on his official Instagram handle,"" From chasing runs to sharing laughs, it's been a legendary journey together. Happy Birthday, partner in crime.""

Former Indian legend Yuvraj Singh posted on his official X handle,"" Some build records, some build legacies - you've done both brotherman! Hope you have an amazing year ahead! Happy birthday, Loads of love always @ImRo45.""

Former Indian cricketer Suresh Raina posted on his official Instagram handle,"" Happy Birthday, Rohit! Wishing you an incredible year ahead, brother! From sharing the field to sharing laughter, it's always been a pleasure watching you lead with calm and class. Your journey has inspired millions, and I know there's still so much more to come. May this year bring you great success, happiness, and time with your loved ones. Keep hitting those big sixes--on and off the field! Cheers to many more milestones ahead! @rohitsharma45.""

Irvine will be sidelined for at least three months after having surgery on a foot injury suffered when playing for Bundesliga club St. Pauli.

Popovic said Irvine's absence was ""certainly a blow"" for the Socceroos as their hopes of an automatic ticket to the 2026 finals hang in the balance ahead of a home qualifier against Japan (June 5th) and a trip to face Saudi Arabia (June 10th).

""He played very well for us in the last (international) window and has been doing very well at St. Pauli,"" Popovic told Australian media.

""It's a blow, but we have to find a solution. There are solutions.

""We've got an eye on the A-League players that are playing, but we've got a lot of midfielders playing overseas at the moment, getting regular minutes, so we're monitoring everyone.

""There's an opportunity for someone to come in.""

Popovic said uncapped Europe-based midfielders Max Balard and Nectarios Triantis could come into consideration in the absence of 78-cap veteran Irvine, who scored in the 2-0 qualifier win over China in Hangzhou in March.

Second in Asia's Group C on 13 points, Australia will qualify directly for the World Cup in North America if they can hold their place.

Japan have already qualified on 20 points, while third-placed Saudi Arabia, three points behind the Socceroos, are also in the hunt for the automatic berth which comes with a top-two finish.

The third and fourth-placed teams will have further chances to qualify in the fourth round, though.

Australia will have a training camp in late-May in Abu Dhabi that will allow staff to assess all the options for the qualifiers.

Popovic said an assistant coach would also run the rule over young Italy-based defender Alessandro Circati as he closes in on a return to action for Serie A side Parma following an ACL injury.

""Paul Okon will be going to visit him in the next few days to have a really close look at where he's at in terms of his training and to see his level,” Popovic said.

""(Circati) feels he's ready, but we have to consider all factors before selecting him.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

The processes cover three tournaments (two men's, one women's), with a deadline for bid submissions of May 27.

Soccer's global governing body FIFA has launched tender processes in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands covering the next three FIFA World Cups – two men's and one women's.

Specifically, a tender has been launched covering the 2026 (Mexico, the US, and Canada) and 2030 (mainly Portugal, Spain, and Morocco) men's World Cups in New Zealand, as well as the 2027 Women's World Cup (Brazil). In the Pacific Islands, meanwhile, the tender covers the 2026 and 2027 tournaments.

Interested parties should email newzealandmediarights@fifa.org, or fwc26-media-rights@fifa.org and fwwc2027-media-rights@fifa.org for those in the Pacific Islands. The deadline for bid submissions is May 27 at 10am Central European Standard Time.

The Pacific Islands tenders stretch across the following territories: the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu; French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna; and American Samoa.

New Zealand qualified for the 2026 men's World Cup earlier this year – the country will make its first appearance at a men's World Cup in 16 years – with the Oceania Football Confederation's qualifying process for the 2027 women's tournament set to begin in November.

The country jointly hosted the previous Women's World Cup, alongside its neighbor Australia, with the New Zealand national team eliminated in the group stages.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

In terms of previous rights-holders in these markets, the 2022 World Cup was shown in New Zealand by pay-TV heavyweight Sky NZ, while the 2023 women's edition was covered live domestically by both Sky NZ and the Stuff multi-media hub.

In the various Pacific Islands, meanwhile, the Women's World Cup was shown free-to-air by Pasifika, while the 2022 men's tournament was aired by pay-TV's Digicel.

Regarding recent FIFA tenders for its next men's and women's World Cups, late last week (April 25), the governing body launched a process for the 2027 Women's World Cup in select European and Central Asian territories.

Entities that want to participate in the tender process can request the ITT documents by emailing fwwc2027-media-rights@fifa.org. The bid submission deadline is 12pm CEST on June 3.

The 2027 Women's World Cup, the first edition of the tournament to be hosted in South America, will see 32 teams competing in at least eight host cities.

For the men's 2026 and 2030 tournaments, meanwhile, late March saw processes get underway in the Caribbean, Greece, and Cyprus.

As for completed rights deals, Spanish public-service broadcaster RTVE and sports rights agency Mediapro unveiled an agreement for the 2026 tournament last week, reportedly bidding €55 million ($60.1 million) to secure the package.

The 2030 edition will see the vast majority of games held across Iberia and Morocco, with three split equally between the South American countries of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the first-ever FIFA World Cup.

Rafael Nadal has been enjoying retirement since hanging up his racket in November, when he took on the Davis Cup for one last time.

Nadal finished his career happy, despite the Spaniard having been plagued by injuries towards the latter stages.

Legendary figure Nadal won a stunning 22 Grand Slam titles during his time on the court, bettered only by the 24 of Novak Djokovic.

The Serbian is currently chasing a 25th, although many tennis fans think Djokovic must retire now amid a poor run of form.

He has just suffered a third successive defeat, and most recently won an ATP title at the 2024 Paris Olympics last summer.

But the veteran has seemingly been handed a new lease of life by Andy Murray, his former rival who is now his coach.

That is, however, not a career trajectory that is currently on the cards for Nadal, who told CNN of becoming a coach: “I mean in this life you can never say never.

“It's difficult to imagine myself now doing this kind of thing… it's not my moment, at all. I am in a different moment of my life and I don't see myself travelling now with a player.”

In an exclusive interview with @AmandaDCNN, Spanish tennis legend @RafaelNadal says that he ‘100%' believes Jannik Sinner is innocent, as the Italian prepares to return from doping suspension.Read more and watch the full interview here: https://t.co/3aX9mbIR3e pic.twitter.com/UsJUpKsmuV

Tennis fans will love to hear that while Nadal isn't ready for coaching anytime soon, the possibility has not been ruled out.

Stranger things have, of course, happened in the sport, not least Murray deciding to link up with his former rival Djokovic shortly after retiring last summer.

But for now, Nadal can look back on his playing career with fond memories, with absolutely no need to rush into anything new.

His stunning achievements and indeed personality and approach to tennis and life have ensured that a superb legacy will be left.

Asked what he wants to be remembered for after that unforgettable playing career, he said: “The results are the results, you know. I won what I won, I lost what I lost, that's the results and nobody can change that.

“Of course, I will be remembered as a good tennis player, but for me, it's important to be remembered as a good person, a player who fights as hard as possible but with positive values, being always fair and correct with everyone on court. Trying to respect every single moment, for me that's the most important thing.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Djokovic, who turns 38 three days before the year's second Grand Slam begins on May 25th, has been woefully out of form and was comprehensively beaten in his opening matches at Masters tournaments in Monte Carlo and Madrid this month.

The Serb was expected to jumpstart his clay campaign in Rome before returning to Paris, where he won Olympic gold last year, but on Tuesday, he said he was skipping the Masters 1000 event, without providing a reason.

""That's troubling. It's worrying for me as a Novak fan,"" Courier, who won back-to-back Roland Garros titles in 1991 and 1992, said on the Tennis Channel.

The American added that Rome would have been the perfect venue for Djokovic to find his rhythm as it had similar conditions to Paris without the challenge of playing at altitude in Madrid.

""If you're going to play one between Madrid and Rome (then) Rome would be the one you would want to play to get ready for Roland Garros,"" he said.

Djokovic, who is chasing a 100th tour-level title and first since his ATP Finals triumph in 2023, said after his loss in Madrid that he was trying to come to terms with a ""new reality"" in tennis where he is just ""trying to win a match or two.""

""I don't know what to make of it, but I don't like the way it feels in the gut,"" Courier added.

Stan Wawrinka has played and beaten some of the best ATP players in history including Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

Wawrinka and Federer are compatriots, winning both the Davis Cup and an Olympic gold medal together.

The Swiss has reached four Grand Slam finals in his career, with all of them coming against either Djokovic or Rafael Nadal.

Djokovic has recently praised Wawrinka, but the three-time major winner was put in a tricky situation when asked to rank the Serbian amongst other tennis greats.

In a blind ranking with Eurosport France, Wawrinka was asked to position 10 of the best ATP players in history.

It started with Andy Murray, who Wawrinka believes is better than him, and placed in seventh place.

The first of the big three to come out of the hat was Nadal, who Wawrinka notably placed straight into third place ahead of 14-time Grand Slam champion Pete Sampras.

Current world number one Jannik Sinner was then mentioned to Wawrinka, who notably placed him straight into 10th position, while he later put Carlos Alcaraz in fifth.

Wawrinka put himself in ninth place, before positioning record 24-time major winner Djokovic in top position.

Federer was the final name in the hat to come out of the draw, falling into the last remaining spot in Wawrinka's rankings of number two.

Wawrinka positioning Sinner in 10th spot is particularly noticeable, as he has been quite outspoken about his recent ban from tennis.

Sinner has received many critics since accepting a three month ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) back in February.

Wawrinka sent a strong reaction to Sinner's ban in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, and has recently spoke further about why he disagrees with the handling of the case.

I don't believe in a clean sport anymore …

“We have seen it in several cases in recent years,” Wawrinka told Eurosport France. “Some have been suspended for two years because they forgot to properly report their address. 

“It has been handled in a way that I believe harms tennis because, in the end, you wonder what battle you are trying to win. Whether you are really looking for players who test positive or if it all comes down to having a good lawyer who can get you out in the best possible way.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Djokovic, who turns 38 three days before the year's second Grand Slam begins on May 25th, has been woefully out of form and was comprehensively beaten in his opening matches at Masters tournaments in Monte Carlo and Madrid this month.

The Serb was expected to jumpstart his clay campaign in Rome before returning to Paris, where he won Olympic gold last year, but on Tuesday, he said he was skipping the Masters 1000 event, without providing a reason.

""That's troubling. It's worrying for me as a Novak fan,"" Courier, who won back-to-back Roland Garros titles in 1991 and 1992, said on the Tennis Channel.

The American added that Rome would have been the perfect venue for Djokovic to find his rhythm as it had similar conditions to Paris without the challenge of playing at altitude in Madrid.

""If you're going to play one between Madrid and Rome (then) Rome would be the one you would want to play to get ready for Roland Garros,"" he said.

Djokovic, who is chasing a 100th tour-level title and first since his ATP Finals triumph in 2023, said after his loss in Madrid that he was trying to come to terms with a ""new reality"" in tennis where he is just ""trying to win a match or two.""

""I don't know what to make of it, but I don't like the way it feels in the gut,"" Courier added.

""It's a very strange thing to announce a pullout now, well in advance of it, and we'll see what it all means when we get to Roland Garros.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Former ATP star John Isner has cast doubt on Novak Djokovic's chances of winning the French Open as he claimed the great Serb “only cares about Wimbledon at this point.”

Djokovic withdrew from the Italian Open on the back of his second round defeat to Matteo Arnaldi at the Madrid Masters.

The move means Djokovic is set to arrive at the French Open having lost the two clay-court matches he has played in 2025 in straight sets.

The 37-year-old's last win on clay was his stunning victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the Paris Olympics gold medal match in August.

Djokovic has won two of the previous four editions of the Roland Garros, having secured his second and third titles on the Parisian clay in 2021 and 2023.

The Serbian, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major, won his maiden French Open crown in 2016 to complete the Career Grand Slam.

Speaking on the Nothing Major Podcast, Isner argued Djokovic will already have his sights set on Wimbledon — where he is a seven-time champion.

“Obviously, it's really hard for us to say, but if I have to guess, I think he only cares about Wimbledon at this point,” said the former world No 8.

Novak Djokovic's Rome decision labelled ‘troubling' and ‘very strange' as two tennis icons react

Novak Djokovic's retirement announcement would no longer be a shock

“It's very unlikely that he can win Roland Garros and maybe he might even understand that now.

“Three out of five sets over two weeks on clay, with all the great players, with [Jannik] Sinner coming back – it is very unlikely. It's not his best surface to begin with, he is playing poorly on it right now.

“He was very frustrated, I don't know if you guys saw, in Madrid on the practice court. You know, he just had a frustrated moment on the practice court, which we've all had, but it's pretty amazing to see for the guy who has completed the game of tennis.

“He still wants more, it's always so admirable. He is still getting frustrated on the practice court, he wants to continue to get better and try and compete for these big tournaments like in Madrid. That obviously did not happen this week, did not happen in Monte Carlo.

“I think give him another day, he'll put this loss behind him and we all know his goals for the rest of his career are try to win another Grand Slam, which would be ridiculous for him to do at 37 or 38 years old.”

Clay tennis courts have recently had a strong resurgence with tennis clubs springing up with a popular artificial version. The Wilson Roland Garros Clay Court tennis ball is ITF approved for competition, made of gum and felt, comprising of 100% natural rubber and has been the official ball of French Open since 2020.

Pairing the right tennis ball with this surface, is of the utmost importance and will get the best out of your game. Tennishead is unable to ignore the calling of sliding into action and review the Wilson Roland Garros clay tennis ball. On y va!

Wilson Sporting Goods have formed a strong partnership with this special slam played on ‘Terre Battue' or clay as we know it and claim to have produced a high performance ball which boasts a specially designed ‘x Core for longer rallies and their ‘ClayShield x Felt' which limits moisture and the pick-up of clay court debris.

Wilson say this contributes to “peak consistency … during gruelling points and produces performance fit for the zenith of the clay court season.”

Tennishead are expecting this specific surface type tennis ball with it's Grand Slam status to truly be a ‘magnifique' bouncing delight on the red dirt.

Gareth Richman opens a can to see how perfectly the Wilson Roland Garros tennis ball lands on the artificial clay court. Who doesn't enjoy cracking open a fresh tube of fuzzy yellow balls and hitting the court!?



On first inspection the balls feel nice and firm (but not too ‘bullet' hard) with a plush quality finish. The bounce and feel is pretty springy (as expected), but this regulates within the first 10/15 minutes of practice hitting.

The Wilson RG Clay Court tennis ball takes centre stage and plays exceptionally well. When hitting the ball felt just that little bigger and extremely balanced. I sensed a gorgeous hitting (but not massively weighted down) sensation as I ripped through my topspin strokes – they kicked with superb bite off the racket stringbed and ground alike. Spin is king here (much like Nadal or Alcaraz) and where the ball excels.

Thee ball fuzzed up nicely (which gave me optimum volume hitting). The Wilson RG is built to withstand longer rallies and this is what it exactly does. When the ball fluffed up, the felt stayed pretty much as is and I continued happily hitting with lush spin and a consistent bounce for way longer than I expected.

I tested a tube of 4 balls for over 4 hours on an artificial clay court in warm dry conditions with a resting period of 24 hours split into two 2 hour sessions. The first two hours the balls were awesomely crisp, fluffed up nicely, and maintained a fantastic feel and responsive bounce.

In the second two hours a slight drop in performance was detected – naturally air pressure decreases and the felt roughed up a bit more, but no major alarm bells rung out. Considering how long they had been on court, the Wilson RG Clay Court tennis ball continued to impress and punch at a high level. Play still cleared club match standard

Yes, some purists might opt for a change of new balls after 2/3 hours. Others might make a little noise on the price tag, but from where I'm standing, it's a complete no brainer for the quality performance and longevity you get.

I actually added on an extra 2 hours practice hitting session the following day and they still had life left inside them. That's how good they are!

In all honestly, this is a difficult one to answer as there are lots of factors in play here. Weather conditions, court surface, how stringent you are with tennis balls, as well as, your style and or level of play.

Some balls have a lighter feel, some are much harder and simply do not suit you, perform inconsistently or just go bald or dead.

This specific tennis ball (in my opinion) plays better than any other I have jumped on the (artificial) clay court, if it didn't, I would be worried and be asking some serious questions.

The Wilson Roland Garros Clay Court tennis ball stands out as a real top performer in terms of consistency, feel, weight, durability and is made for a real clay, but performs just as brilliantly on it's sister artificial surface.

Notably hitting topspin brought the most out of the ball. Weight and firmness had an awesome feel to it. Speed of the ball wasn't ridiculously zippy nor slow – just pitched nicely in between with a sound bounce with next to nothing debris pick-up.

Wilson clearly have hit the mark here and produced a true Roland Garros Grand Slam tennis ball winner on the clay.

From May 19 to June 8, 2025, the Roland Garros clay-court tennis tournament takes place in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, at Porte d'Auteuil. For three weeks, from qualifying to the final draw, hundreds of players battle it out on the orange clay under the Parisian sun. Armed with their trusty rackets, they string together backhands, drop shots and aces, slaughtering many a tennis ball with their powerful strokes. But how many of these little yellow balls are used each year at Roland-Garros?

It's hard to say for sure how many balls were used, but in 2017, our colleagues at Le Parisien reported that around 70,000 balls were used over 15 days of competition, or around 5,000 per day. If the figures haven't changed since then, we can count on more than 100,000 tennis balls being used over the three weeks of the tournament! In the course of a tennis match, balls are changed every 9 games. As clay wears out the balls more than any other surface, you need to count on more than for any other Grand Slam tournament.

However, there's no question of throwing away these balls, which are still almost new after use! Some are resold in the tournament store, but the majority are sold to tennis clubs, where they are largely used up. They are then recycled thanks to Opération Balle Jaune, run by the FFT since 2009, crushed in factories and reused to create sports floors and courts!

      MATTHEW LAMBWELL



Last week in Madrid, Novak Djokovic was heard chuntering in his practice session with coach Andy Murray. It was in Serbian but the gist was: 'F*** this sport, f*** tennis, f*** everything.' On Tuesday evening he withdrew from next week's Italian Open in Rome.

If any sportsman in history has earned the right to decide when it's time to go, it is Djokovic. But that time is beginning to feel very close.

The 37-year-old's form is in tatters and his aura of invincibility is dissipating. He cannot retire before Wimbledon, which surely represents his last chance to win that elusive 25th Grand Slam. 

But after that I cannot see how he can continue to contend with the forces of youth in the majors - the only events that matter to him now. He looks lightyears away from the level Jannik Sinner produced in winning the US and Australian Opens. 

Once the sun has set on the Championships in mid-July, whether on glory or defeat, it looks like a pretty good time to draw a line under the greatest career this sport has ever seen.

The most damning aspect of the great Serb's 6-3, 6-4 defeat by Matteo Arnaldi at the Madrid Open last Saturday is that it was not especially surprising. The Italian has had a wretched year, as had Alejandro Tabilo before he beat Djokovic in Monte Carlo. But at the moment - and this feels an almost heretical thought to verbalise - Djokovic feels like a good player to face when you really need a win.

Historically a byword for consistency, Djokovic has been littering the court with errors recently, with 32 against Arnaldi.

He has now lost the first match in four of his last five tournaments. To place that in context, before that run he had lost the first match in four of his last 78 events. But even if this recent slump has been sudden, the deterioration has been going on for some time. Since winning three out of the four Grand Slams in 2023 he has played 16 tour events, made three finals and won zero titles.

Amid this horrible run he won the Olympic gold medal, and with each passing week that triumph looks even more extraordinary. With his powers fading, his motivation faltering and his body rebelling, he somehow summoned everything he had into one last push for his one last goal. In retrospect, that 7-6, 7-6 defeat of Carlos Alcaraz might be Djokovic's finest-ever performance.

It is as if that one last great effort has left him spent, incapable of rousing himself for run of the mill events.

He will not be like coach Murray, who battled away for years on the more modest reaches of the tour after hip surgery. Asked after the defeat in Monte Carlo what his goals were for the clay court season, he replied: 'Roland Garros. That's it.'

After Madrid came some hints of his uncertainty over how long he will go on. 'I'm not sure if I will come back,' he said when asked if he expected to return in 2026. 'I don't know what to say. I mean, I'll come back, maybe not as a player, of course. I hope it's not, but it could be.

'Things are different, obviously, with my strokes, with my body, with my movement, it's the reality that I have to accept. I'll try to make the most out of these new circumstances that I have, particularly on Grand Slams, where it counts the most for me, at least where I would like to do my best. So let's see what happens.'

What is left to motivate him? His final peak is the quarter-century, a 25th Grand Slam title to overtake Margaret Court and sit atop the pile for both men and women. He is also frozen on 99 career titles, trying to join Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors in the century club. Given he is yet to win a match on clay this year - and could do so before Roland Garros only at a lower-level event - a fourth title in Paris looks an incredibly tall order.

But the fact he reached last year's Wimbledon final just six weeks after meniscus surgery shows how far know-how can carry you on the grass.

He did it once at the Olympics; could he gather up the dying embers of his fire into one last blaze at the All England Club? I honestly cannot see it - but this is not a man to be written off. What a way that would be to go: an eighth Wimbledon crown to tie Federer, a 100th ATP title, a 25th Grand Slam. 

They say there's no such thing as a perfect ending in sport. Then again, we thought there was no such thing as a perfect tennis player - and then this guy came along.

Among the mayhem this week as power drained from swathes of Europe, the focus from a tennis point of view was on those players in Madrid, eating by candlelight and struggling to get back to their hotels. 

That was luxury compared to what Australian former doubles No 1 Storm Sanders (nee Hunter) had to endure. Heading to the Catalonian city of Vic for a Challenger event, Sanders was stuck on a train for 14 hours with limited food and water and no access to toilets. 

Having been evacuated to Barcelona and facing a night sleeping on the floor of the town hall, she eventually managed to find an Uber willing to take her to her hotel. 

At 12.20am she was finally there - on the day of her first singles match for a year, after a ruptured achilles tendon. With that context, a 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 defeat by Ruth Roura Llaverias seems almost heroic.

The ATP tour knew there would be teething problems when they decided to replace line judges with electronic line calling on clay but presumably an enormous power outage disabling the system was not something they anticipated. 

Far more predictable was that Alexander Zverev would be among the loudest moaners. 

In Madrid he received a wrap on the wrist for taking out his phone to snap a picture of a mark which he felt was out, begging umpire Mohamed Lahyani to get down from his chair to inspect the mark, like the old days. 

Eleven months ago in the French Open final Zverev again rowed with the umpire, over a Carlos Alcaraz serve he felt was wide. Had electronic line calling been in place there he would have been vindicated, so he cannot have it both ways - we either trust the technology or we don't. 

Humans or robots, the common denominator is Zverev and his whingeing.

The 21-year-old Californian has had a tough time since swapping the University of Georgia for the school of hard knocks. 

Quinn saved a match point to win the NCAA singles title as a freshman in 2023, then decided to leave college and go pro. His transition was far from smooth, with some rough runs of form on the Challenger Tour. 

But at the back end of last year something clicked, and qualifying runs in Barcelona and Madrid have him closing on the top 100. 

With a massive forehand and a lanky athleticism, he is one to add to the packed roster of talented young Americans.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Jack Draper to be thrown into the line of fire as he is set to face his biggest test","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/jack-draper-ranking-wimbledon-pressure-hype","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 09:46:58 GMT","

British tennis players face a challenge that is unrivalled in world tennis when Wimbledon rolls around each year and that juggernaut is about to rush towards Jack Draper.

Draper made a huge leap in the tennis world as he lifted his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells last month, with his rise into the top 10 of the rankings for the first time a fitting reward for that achievement.

Yet tennis in his British homeland tends to be a sport that only captures the wider public's attention when Wimbledon gets underway and that is when Draper will feel the full impact of his breakthrough in tennis.

There is a big chance Draper could be one of the top four seeds at Wimbledon if he continues his run at the Madrid Open, wins more matches at the Rome Masters and then makes a mark at the French Open.

Draper has just 70 ATP Ranking points to defend from 2024 and he can compete for 4,000 during the clay court season, with the opportunity he has in front of him.

Patrick Mouratoglou reveals who has ‘greatest potential' out of Fonseca, Draper, Fils & Mensik

Yet if Draper achieves his targets over the next few weeks, the hype machine that is at a different level in the English media will be given even more fuel than they have already got.

Draper has been a rising star in tennis for some time, but this is the first British summer when he will be THE star.

Tim Henman lived through this experience and then Andy Murray took it to the next level as he won two Wimbledon titles, with Draper now set to be thrown into the fire they had to learn to deal with.

A familiar format will be followed with Draper in the British summer of 2025.

He can be expected to be third on Centre Court at Wimbledon for all of his matches this summer, with that slot designed to capture the biggest TV audiences in the UK as it will grab viewers who get home after being at work all day.

The domestic newspapers and rolling news channels will hype up Draper as Britain's next Wimbledon champion and as former world No 1 Andy Roddick suggests, the attention will be relentless.

“Murray mania all the time. To give you a sense of how nuts it is there, I made the semis in 2009,” said Roddick on his Served podcast.

“You go to Aorangi Park [Wimbledon practice courts] or wherever to hit and his practice court is surrounded. You cannot get a 40-minute hit in without some picture being taken.

“He has an energy bar and it's like what is this? They actually treat this as news. It's absurd.

“I woke up in 2009 and at this point, I had won Queen's four times and I was the second-best player in the world on grass for a moment in time.

“I had made the finals of Wimbledon twice, the semis again. It wasn't like I was a dud. I find myself in the semis, beat Hewitt in five in the quarters and I wake up to a preview of the final – Murray vs Federer. And so I am seeing that and thinking this is ridiculous, I can only imagine what Murray's life looked like for a moment in time.

“I always equate it to the Red Sox not having won since whenever, the Cubs not having won, there were 10's of millions of people – and if I am hyperbolic saying 100 million people, it's not by much. Around the UK, they had screening parties. Imagine when a team wins a game at the World Cup, that was when Murray won. In an individual sport, one person.

“I am sure some of that is probably mitigated by Murray's successes [for Draper], you are not trying to break Fred Perry's record from the 1920s,” he added. “So him having done it probably softens the first time thing a little bit, but it is mania.”

Draper has grown into his role as a leading star in tennis after initially struggling to display his emotions on court and in interviews, but he will face a whole new challenge this summer and it will test him to the full.

There is no doubt that this big-serving star who has beaten Carlos Alcaraz twice in the last year will be a contender to win his first Wimbledon title this summer, but he will need to deal with more pressure than anyone else in the draw if he is to achieve that dream.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner is set to make his return to the world of tennis after a three-month suspension. The Italian tested positive for clostebol last year at Indian Wells, and the news got leaked to the press in August, shortly after his Cincinnati Open win. Despite getting criticized immensely, he played throughout the 2024 season and finished the year ranked No. 1.

This year, after winning the Australian Open, he agreed with WADA on a three-month suspension. With his suspension ending on May 4, there are plenty of talking points surrounding Sinner. As his return looms large at the Rome Masters, his form will be under a microscope. However, we will share three reasons why the Italian will maintain the form that has made him unbeatable in the past 16 months.

Sinner has been the undisputed best player in the world since January last year. Although much was discussed about his talent, his mentality has grown even more in the past 9-10 months after the doping scandal. After the doping case came to light in August, Sinner was under intense criticism from Stanislas Wawrinka and Nick Kyrgios.

Critics claim that the World No. 1 should have been put in the same boat as Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova, who were suspended for more than a year for their doping cases. However, Sinner could not do much but keep his head down and perform on the court. His performance was immaculate as he won the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup to close his 2024 season. Then, he won the Australian Open to start the year.

Considering that he is coming from a three-month suspension in front of his adoring fans, his expectations would remain the same. However, Sinner has shown he can perform when the critics are loud. That reminds tennis fans of Novak Djokovic and how the Serb used to dismantle crowd favorites during his prime years.

Since the start of the 2024 season, Jannik Sinner has won against every player he has faced except Carlos Alcaraz. The young Spaniard has developed one of the best modern rivalries with Sinner as the duo is set to take over from the “Big 3.” However, in terms of head-to-head battles, Sinner failed in all three attempts against Alcaraz in 2024.

One of those losses came at the Roland Garros semifinals, where Alcaraz won in five sets to reach the final and win his first title on the Paris dirt. The Spaniard's injury issues in the past few weeks add to the positivity around Sinner. The Italian is unbeatable against almost everyone, but if his nemesis has issues with injuries, that opens the path for him.

Outside of Alcaraz, the rest of the field has been like a house of cards in 2025. From Alexander Zverev to João Fonseca, each player has had lapses in consistency. There is a reason why, despite being away from the sport for three months, no one has come close to toppling Sinner from the No. 1 ranking.

These are encouraging signs for Sinner, who has been anything but inconsistent since the start of the 2024 season. He has won the most Grand Slams, titles, and matches since the start of the last season. With an inconsistent field, he knows that he just needs a few matches under his belt to click into gear.

Daniil Medvedev said he'd be willing to pay for Novak Djokovic's services as a coach, when the Serbian eventually retires. The 37-year-old, 24-time Grand Slam winner is still a formidable opponent on the court, but has many more tournaments behind him than in front.

Medvedev, who faces Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open, is no stranger to Djokovic's remarkable skill set and mastery of the game. The Russian acknowledges that Djokovic has stopped him from winning numerous titles, including the 2023 US Open, which the World No.5 won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

With Djokovic currently leading their head-to-head 10-5, Medvedev expressed a desire to collaborate rather than clash with the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the future.

In an interview with the Serbian publication Sportal, Medvedev admitted: ""I would pay for Novak to be my coach. I don't believe that Novak will be a coach right away.

""It is more realistic that he will give advice and share his experience with his friends who are closest to him on the Tour. Therefore, if there is such a possibility, I would also be happy to be in such a situation.

""Of course, that won't happen while Djokovic is playing, because that would put him in the wrong position. It would be embarrassing for him, but he certainly wouldn't share his secrets. That's why it will happen when he ends his career.""

When prodded about the timeline of Djokovic hanging up his racket, Medvedev said with a grin, ""In five years.""

He then dropped an astounding revelation that Djokovic has already made a pact to coach another competitor, specifically Alexander Zverev, after his retirement.

Medvedev added: ""I heard in Australia that Sasha Zverev said that Novak promised him that he would work with him for a year when he finished his career.""

Following Medvedev's statements at the Madrid Open, Djokovic acknowledged his interest in teaming up with the Russian in the future, but stressed that there's ""no price"" that could entice him at this moment.

The Serbian champion opened up by saying: ""It's very flattering that he thinks I can help him and be useful to his career. I really like Medvedev a lot, we always had a great relationship off the court.

""I am sure that because of my relationship with Daniil, I would always like to work with him if I could. As an advisor or mentor. One day I would consider becoming a member of their team.

""First, I have to end my career in order to think about that offer, and I don't know when that will happen yet. I said before, as long as I'm playing it's early for that. That's why there is no price.""","{'href': 'https://www.themirror.com', 'title': 'The Mirror US'}","tennis"

Iga Swiatek avenged a heartbreaking Australian Open defeat in dramatic fashion at the Mutua Madrid Open on Wednesday, the defending champion rallying from a first-set bagel to defeat Madison Keys, 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.""It was one of the weirdest matches I've ever played,"" Swiatek said on court after the match. ""Madi was just playing perfectly at the beginning and I wasn't really proactive with anything. But I didn't feel like it was that bad; I felt the ball well. It just went super long most of the time.

Keys' Australian Open run saw her beat both Swiatek and world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who was aiming to win a third straight title Down Under, but the American suffered a dip in form following a semifinal loss at the BNP Paribas Open. Winning just one match at each of her next two appearances in Miami and Charleston, Keys was looking for a reset ahead of the second major tournament of the seasons, and appeared to have found it at the Caja Magica.Rolling into the last eight without dropping a set, she found herself across the net from Swiatek, who has enjoyed a solid, if unspectacular season. The former world No. 1 has reached at least the quarterfinals in all of her 2025 tournament appearances but has not reached a final since last June, when she won her fourth Roland Garros title.Looking to lock back into dominant form on her favorite surface, the 23-year-old Swiatek suffered a sixth straight defeat to Jelena Ostapenko at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart and has been made to battle through multiple three-settes through her Madrid title defense. She rallied from a set and a break down against Alexandra Eala, who had shocked Swiatek last month in Miami, and needed a third set to solve Diana Shnaider in the fourth round.That discomfort was magnified in the face of Keys' heavy groundstrokes, allowing the American to roar through the opening set without losing a game.

Tennis

After 20 minutes on the clay courts of Madrid, Iga Świątek threw her racket down on to her bag in frustration. She was experiencing something that she has inflicted on numerous opponents throughout her tennis career: the fear of humiliation.

A couple of minutes later, the fear became reality, as Madison Keys served up the first 6-0 set, or bagel, that Świątek has received in almost four years. Not since a match against Daria Kasatkina at Eastbourne in England in June 2021 had she lost a set 6-0.

Advertisement

In the end, the bagel from Keys will register as little more than a new statistic for commentators, because Świątek recovered to win the next two sets and take the match 0-6, 6-3, 6-2, gaining a measure of revenge for her defeat to the American in January's Australian Open semifinals. The result gives her a 3-0 record on clay in matches in which she lost the first set 6-0.

It also offers another data point during what has been a strange Madrid Open for the defending champion. Świątek, who has won 10 clay-court titles including four French Opens, has looked more vulnerable than perhaps she ever has on her favorite surface while never getting into real jeopardy because she is so otherworldly on it when she finds her game. The prodigious topspin on her groundstrokes rears up and pulls players off the court, creating short replies which she can devour. Her defense is often impregnable. And when matches do get more complicated than she expected, she has a wellspring of winning experience to draw from.

Her matches in Madrid have been so in her control that she has determined their closeness for good and for bad. Against Alex Eala in her opening match, she was the dominant player in almost every point — to the extent that her errors accounted for 22 of the 35 points that Eala needed to take the opening set. The same thing happened against world No. 13 Diana Shnaider in the fourth round. After winning the first set 6-0, Świątek lost the second in a tiebreak, but of the 48 points Shnaider won in that set, 34 were unforced errors from the world No. 2's racket.

Against Keys, Świątek was truly overrun for the first time. Having handled Linda Noskova's aggression with relative comfort in between her matches against Eala and Shnaider, Świątek had no answer to Keys' forehand and, though she said she was “feeling the ball,” sprayed groundstroke after groundstroke long. She repeatedly changed her racket and asked for restrings, looking for the higher tension that would give her more control. Her first serve faltered. The match was no longer on her racket.

After beating Eala, Świątek said of the changes she made: “I wanted to keep my margins and play a little bit more safe, to just play more balls in because I was making some unforced errors that weren't really necessary.” That quote could just have easily come from her match with Keys.

As soon as the 6-0 set was over and the second set had begun, Świątek started easing the ball deep, particularly in backhand-to-backhand rallies. She dragged Keys wider using sharper angles. She moved the ball, rather than trying to blast it. Keys duly started producing more mistakes, and from there Świątek flowed.

She faces either Mirra Andreeva or Coco Gauff in the semifinals May 1.

Analysis from tennis writer Charlie Eccleshare

Clay season is the time to start making more of a judgement on Świątek's form in 2025 — or so it appeared. It is her favorite part of the year, but also the part at which she is under the most pressure. Winning tournaments is par for her, so much so that if she were to win the Madrid Open, the Italian Open and the French Open, she wouldn't even gain any points on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka — because she won them all last year.

She has also hardly had a bad year by any rational tennis measure. Świątek has reached the quarterfinal or better in every tournament she's entered. She was one point away from the Australian Open final. Of her seven losses in 2025, five have come either in a final or to the defending champion and two have come against Ostapenko, one of the only active players against whom Świątek has a negative head-t0-head. In many of those defeats, she came up against someone playing one of their best matches of the season, if not their career.

Against Keys in Madrid it initially looked like more of the same. The American has been visibly unshackled by her acceptance that tennis results need not define her, taking her to her first Grand Slam title in Australia and to a 23-4 record in 2025 prior to this encounter. Keys destroyed Świątek in the second set of their Australian Open semifinal, and the quicker conditions at Madrid's altitude make it more hospitable to big-serving hitters like her, even more so than they do Świątek.

All this means that a comeback win for Świątek should suggest that her form is in a very healthy place, but external factors and some elements of her game make it hard to reach that conclusion with any certainty. Her serve let her down against Keys in the first set, but even her movement, normally such a weapon, was slightly hesitant. Normally so decisive, Świątek was second-guessing herself, exemplified by the short forehand she sprayed long to fall down 5-0. In numerous matches in Madrid, she has hit shots straight to her opponent from seemingly unassailable positions with expanses of the court gaping, extending points that could have been over in just one strike.

Despite four wins in Madrid, frustration appears to be a watchword for Świątek right now. After beating Eala in her opening match, Świątek was so dissatisfied with her performance that she put in some extra practice before speaking to the media. Once in the interview room, Świątek referenced that after the Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, where she suffered a dispiriting loss to Ostapenko, “she had some other stuff going on”.

After beating Noskova, Świątek clarified that she'd had to go home to Poland between Stuttgart and Madrid, “for private reasons.”

“Then coming here being in a little bit of rush for sure wasn't super comfortable,” she said. She has not looked super comfortable in most of her matches in Madrid, but nevertheless is into another semifinal for 2025.

Sinner accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him.

The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol, which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy.

Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis.

""Yes, yes. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping,"" Sinner said.

""I didn't feel really comfortable in the locker room, where I ate. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently, and I didn't like it at all. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way.

""I didn't feel comfortable, and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense that I take a little break, it will do me good.""

Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month.

""Slowly, I'm getting back into the rhythm of real training with a goal in front of me,"" Sinner said.

""Sometimes it goes very well, sometimes there is a drop, and I don't know why, so I will certainly be very happy to return to the court.

""Especially in Rome, it is a special tournament for me, but I certainly enter with a slightly different mentality. I miss the competition. 

""I am certainly very happy that this phase is now over and we are ready to start again.""

Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion.

""I mean, I don't even want to answer. Everyone is free to say what they want, everyone can judge, but that's okay,"" Sinner said.

""It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all, also what I went through, and it was very difficult.

""I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

The 23-year-old, who will return to action at Italian Open after short ban, ‘wasn't in a very happy place' before year's first grand slam

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner said this week he considered quitting the sport because of the turmoil surrounding his doping suspension.

When asked in a Rai TV interview on Tuesday if there was ever a moment when he wanted to give it all up, the 23-year-old hesitated briefly before responding: “Yes. I remember that I wasn't in a very happy place before the Australian Open this year.”

At the start of January in Melbourne – a grand slam that he won – it was still unclear whether Sinner would face a lengthy suspension before his doping case from 2024, when he blamed a masseur for giving him a banned cream.

In the end, a deal was made whereby he would receive a short three-month ban and return for the Italian Open starting next week.

He said he was anxious around the turn of the year about what 2025 might bring.

“I arrived in Australia and didn't feel comfortable, whether in the locker room or while eating. The players were looking at me differently,” he added. “That wasn't nice.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner said he “didn't feel at ease” during the Australian Open in January and considered taking a break from tennis after he was sanctioned for two anti-doping violations.

Sinner, men's world No 1, twice tested positive for banned anabolic steroid clostebol in March 2024. The Italian, who was found by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) to bear “no fault or negligence” for the two violations, accepted a three-month ban in February after reaching a case resolution agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

Sinner opened his 2025 season by winning his second consecutive Australian Open title in January, defeating Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the final. In an interview with Italian broadcaster TG1, Sinner said he “thought about taking some time off” after the Melbourne major and felt a shift in how he was perceived by his peers.

“I remember the Australian Open this year. I didn't really feel at ease in the locker room, in the player dining area,” said Sinner. “There were some players that looked at me differently, and I didn't really like it. It's heavy, to live tennis this way — I was always someone who joked around, who went in the locker room talking with this person, that person, anyone — and at that time I was a different person, I didn't feel at ease.

“At that time I said to myself, maybe some time off after Australia, a break for a little bit, would do me good.”

Sinner withdrew from the Rotterdam Open, the ATP 500 event in the Netherlands that takes place just over a week after the Australian Open final. At the time, he said he needed to give his body “time to rest,” missing an event at which he was defending champion.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the ITIA's finding in September and sought a period of ineligibility of at least a year, but later deemed a three-month ban an “appropriate outcome.”

Sinner was free to resume training from April 13, having parted ways with trainer Umberto Ferrara and physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi following the initial decision in his case. He is set to return to competition at the Italian Open in May.

“Sometimes it goes very well, at other times there is a drop and I don't know why,” he said about his level in training. “I will be very happy to return to the match court, especially in Rome, a very special tournament for me … I miss competition.”

The defending champ shook off a 0-6 first set to avenge an Australian Open defeat.ByDavid KanePublished Apr 30, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 30, 2025

Iga Swiatek avenged a heartbreaking Australian Open defeat in dramatic fashion at the Mutua Madrid Open on Wednesday, the defending champion rallying from a first-set bagel to defeat Madison Keys, 0-6, 6-3, 6-2.""It was one of the weirdest matches I've ever played,"" Swiatek said on court after the match. ""Madi was just playing perfectly at the beginning and I wasn't really proactive with anything. But I didn't feel like it was that bad; I felt the ball well. It just went super long most of the time. I just tried to play a bit shorter, put it in. I think I let Madi do a little bit more mistakes by putting the ball back.""The No. 2 seed has gone the distance in three of her four matches this week but saved her biggest comeback for the fifth-seeded Keys, edging into the semifinals after one hour and 46 minutes on Manolo Santana Stadium.""The momentum changed but I'm not sure why!"" said Swiatek. ""I just stayed in there and obviously it wasn't easy to lose the first set 6-0, but I just tried and at the end I'm happy I did.""

Keys' Australian Open run saw her beat both Swiatek and world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who was aiming to win a third straight title Down Under, but the American suffered a dip in form following a semifinal loss at the BNP Paribas Open. Winning just one match at each of her next two appearances in Miami and Charleston, Keys was looking for a reset ahead of the second major tournament of the seasons, and appeared to have found it at the Caja Magica.Rolling into the last eight without dropping a set, she found herself across the net from Swiatek, who has enjoyed a solid, if unspectacular season. The former world No. 1 has reached at least the quarterfinals in all of her 2025 tournament appearances but has not reached a final since last June, when she won her fourth Roland Garros title.Looking to lock back into dominant form on her favorite surface, the 23-year-old Swiatek suffered a sixth straight defeat to Jelena Ostapenko at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart and has been made to battle through multiple three-settes through her Madrid title defense. She rallied from a set and a break down against Alexandra Eala, who had shocked Swiatek last month in Miami, and needed a third set to solve Diana Shnaider in the fourth round.That discomfort was magnified in the face of Keys' heavy groundstrokes, allowing the American to roar through the opening set without losing a game.

""At least it's fast!"" Swiatek joked of the first-set bagel. ""That's the only positive thing, but for sure, staying on the court and having 0-6 is just weird.""Though she continued to press Swiatek early in the second set, Swiatek quickly found her rhythm and took a 5-1 lead of her own before ultimately serving out the set two games later.A tense deciding set unfolded as the pair traded service holds through the first four games. Keys saved two break points in the fifth but Swiatek outrallied the American to earn a third and a netted forehand from Keys gave Swiatek the first break.

Swiatek, who played remarkably clean tennis in the final two sets, made no mistake on her second opportunity and edged over the finish line in just under two hours.Having avenged her loss to Keys, Swiatek is guaranteed another opportunity for revenge as she awaits the winner of the quarterfinal between No. 4 seed Coco Gauff and No. 7 seed Mirra Andreeva. Both women won their last two matches against the Pole, Gauff at the 2024 WTA Finals and 2025 United Cup and Andreeva at this year's Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships and BNP Paribas Open.

Kick Sauber have revealed a striking special livery that will adorn their car for the Miami Grand Prix weekend, with the design inspired by the vibrant art scene of the city.

Described as a “bold canvas of modern art”, the one-off colour scheme is dominated by neon green paint, designed to evoke the feeling of freshly applied paint as if completed by the artist before the car hits the track.

To match the special livery of the C45, drivers Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto will be wearing race suits that reflect the theme, while the design is also set to feature throughout the team's garage and on pit stop equipment.

With this marking Kick Sauber's first new look of the campaign, the squad have promised that there will be further surprises and special moments to come in the year ahead.

Stefano Battiston, Chief Commercial Officer, commented: “This livery is more than just a new look – it's a celebration of Miami's creative spirit and our commitment to energising the sport for our fans.

“Our objective when developing this livery with Stake was to stand out, not only for our dedication on the track, but also for our boldness and creativity off track.

Five races in, Williams currently hold the ‘best of the rest' tag, lying fifth in the Teams' standings behind the big four teams: McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari.

It represents a very significant improvement on last year as Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have taken a solid 25 points between them. But in trying to close the performance gap to the big teams, there are clear limitations to their car in its current guise, something which the arrival of Sainz from Ferrari has helped define.

“One of the things Carlos finds very different to the Ferrari is that they could carry a lot more ‘combined' into certain corners,” explained Williams Team Principal James Vowles in Japan, “and that's not an area we have worked on over the years.”

Chris Hemsworth is taking a deep dive for Amazon MGM Studios.


	The actor, last seen in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, is set to star in Subversion, a submarine thriller that Patrick Vollrath will direct for Amazon MGM.




	Lorenzo di Bonaventura is producing via his di Bonaventura Pictures banner. The project is eying a production start this fall in Australia.


	Written by Andrew Ferguson, the story has been described as a “Die Hard on a submarine” style thriller that centers on a once-promising Naval commander (Hemsworth) who is blackmailed by a cartel-like operation into piloting a dangerous submarine carrying illegal cargo across international waters. Thrust into a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, the man must outmaneuver blockades and navigate perilous threats both in and outside of the submarine.

	Vollrath already proved his mettle with a story set in a contained environment. He made his feature directorial debut with 7500, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a pilot stuck in his cockpit while his plane is hijacked. The filmmaker, whose live-action short film Everything Will Be Okay was nominated for an Academy Award in 2016, is repped by Gotham Group and Davis Law Group.




			Popular on THR		







	Ferguson's scripts frequently land on the Black List (four times, to be exact), with one titled Blood Rush currently in development at Amazon MGM.  


Subversion reunites Hemsworth with Amazon MGM as he's also starring in Crime 101, an all-star thriller that also counts Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Halle Berry and Monica Barbaro in its cast. The company is giving the feature a theatrical release in 2026. Hemsworth, who is among the cast of Avengers: Doomsday, is represented by CAA and Greenberg Glusker.

‘Carl the Collector' writer Ava Xiao-Lin Rigelhaupt wraps Autism Acceptance Month with a personal story — and a plea for greater acceptance in Hollywood.


							By 

	Ava Xiao-Lin Rigelhaupt



	Being autistic in the entertainment industry can make life more challenging, especially when you add the fact that I am also a Chinese, Jewish, transracial adoptee. On top of that, I grew up with a single mom in Columbus, Ohio. But, back to autism and Hollywood. It's Autism Acceptance Month and it's time for the industry to accept more of us.


	I belong to the less than one percent of all employed disabled TV writers. The statistics for disabled characters, actors, and those behind the scenes aren't much better. Just five percent of disabled characters are played by actors with disabilities, and less than one percent of characters in children's TV have a disability. It's clear that more needs to be done, both in front of and behind the camera.

	Part of the problem is a lack of understanding. We also didn't understand. For years, my mom and I had concerns that were unaddressed. It wasn't until my senior year of high school that an acting professor at a Brown University summer program identified my neurodivergence. He suggested to my mom that I might be on the autism spectrum. For her, this was an “aha” moment. And I finally had a word to explain why I felt like everyone read a social skills rule book except me, yet I was still expected to take the test. From there, we worked towards an official diagnosis. 


	Prior to that point, my life was filled with confusion, loneliness and frustration. In middle school, I was a perpetual outcast. Like an alien that no one knew how to talk to, my classmates gradually stopped interacting with me. But at home, my mom, creative and quirky in her own right, embraced my idiosyncrasies. Nevertheless, it still felt like there was an impenetrable gap in our communication.


	My diagnosis answered our questions and forced me to re-examine a lot of what I thought I knew about myself. Heading off to Sarah Lawrence, I wasn't sure I wanted to fully embrace this autism thing. Would I tell my roommate? Professors? Would they understand? Freshman year was tough.


	Luckily, the summer after my sophomore year, I landed an internship with Trinity Rep, Rhode Island's Tony Award-winning theatre. There, I worked on sensory-friendly performances and established relationships with local autistic artists. This experience led to a leap of faith and an unexpected gap year enhancing their accessibility initiatives. While scary (autistic people typically don't like change), this was a formative year — my first foray into accessible theatre. It was also the first time I had autistic friends. Our group broke stigmas, culminating in a professional performance at the Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival. And perhaps, more importantly, it was the first time I felt fully accepted and supported in theatre. 

	











	I graduated virtually during the pandemic. Stuck at home, I applied to Disability Belongs' (fka: RespectAbility) virtual Summer Entertainment Lab for Professionals with Disabilities, another big leap. And I got in! Through this program, I was introduced to other disabled professionals and learned how they found their place in a tough-to-break-into business. I could now see myself working in the same industry that had provided me with childhood “friends” like Hannah Montana, Zack and Cody and Sharpay Evans when I didn't have many real ones. The potential of creating “friends” for future audiences tugged even harder.


	At Disability Belongs, I consulted on more than 80 indie and major studio projects featuring autism-related storylines. Through a general meeting with Blue's Clues & You, I got my first TV writing job! This led to more work with 9 Story Media Group — writing for all the characters, not just the disabled ones. Through Disability Belongs, I began to carve out a niche at the intersection of entertainment, accessibility, and disability.


	I never could have imagined my next step would be Broadway! — as an Autistic Creative Consultant. The musical How to Dance in Ohio is a coming of age story that follows seven autistic young adults at a social skills center in Columbus, Ohio (ironically, where I grew up) as they prepare for a spring formal. My job was to ensure authentic autistic representation and accessibility in all aspects of production, both internal and external. What does that mean? It means working with the writer and composer to ensure the script has authentic characters and proper disability language, to having unscented soap in the bathrooms. It means creating a space where everyone is welcome, acknowledged, celebrated and can thrive. Our work was so groundbreaking, the Drama Desk committee gave us a special award for Authentic Autistic Representation. Another gift was seeing the standing ovations and long lines at the stage door with autistic fans, their families, and friends — thrilled and overwhelmed to finally see themselves on a Broadway stage. 

	











	While working on the musical, a colleague told me that PBS Kids was looking for writers for their new show Carl the Collector, featuring an autistic raccoon who collects things and lives with his friends and family in Fuzzytown. I submitted. Many emails and months later, it was greenlit! The series creator, Zachariah OHora, asked me to join the writing team, which was committed to an authentic, fun show with autistic voice actors as well as production staff. Head writer, Adam Rudman, encouraged me, helped me when I was stuck and genuinely wanted my nuanced experiences on the page. 


	I am especially proud of an episode named “The Fall,” where things get so hairy, Carl decides to tell his friends (and the audience) about his autism. In the story, based on a personal experience with my mom, Carl's friend, Nico, falls and hurts herself while playing. Carl freezes. He wants to help but doesn't know how. Nico misinterprets Carl's inaction as not caring. With help from his mom, Carl explains to his friends that his “brain works differently” and sometimes it takes him longer to process new situations. This episode, and the series as a whole, is also important because it will hopefully help both autistic and neurotypical kids communicate and better understand and empathize with each other — and isn't that all that really matters?!


This is what representation should look like. So, let's continue to build awareness for meaningful change. With today marking the end of Autism Acceptance Month, my hope is that autistic people and allies will continue advocating and advancing opportunities for communities like mine, especially in light of all the misinformation that is out there right now.

The singer-songwriter was a relative unknown when she signed her first label deal. Now, 15 years later, she returns to relaunched Lost Highway Records a country superstar who fought to make music on her terms, expanding the genre in the process. With a divorce in the rearview and blue skies ahead, she talks to THR about why she wanted to go home again.


							By 

	Lori Majewski



	It's a warm, cloudless April Saturday in Tennessee, and right now, Kacey Musgraves' life is a Kacey Musgraves song. The singer-songwriter is driving southbound to rural Williamsport — exactly an hour from her Nashville home — where she'll be going horseback riding and rambling along the river with a few friends.  


	“A good friend of mine has a beautiful farm on hundreds of acres,” she says in her Texas twang. “It's on the Duck River, which is one of the most biologically diverse rivers in the world. It has all these specific species of things that don't exist anywhere else. It's really clean and beautiful, organic and peaceful. My friends and I go out there, bring a picnic and just live our best lives — barefoot, dirty, in the river. It's so fun.”

	Excursions like these have colored her songwriting on tracks like “Space Cowboy,” “Oh What a World,” “Butterflies” and “Cardinal,” and they're good for her mental health, too. “Horses have given me such an outlet for tranquility. It's something that takes me outside of looking at my phone screen,” Musgraves says. “It gets me to look up, look out, breathe oxygen in.”


	It's a day before Easter — and 4/20. There was a time when it'd be a sure bet to think Spacey Kacey would be out there in nature, lighting up in early celebration. But on the title track to last year's Deeper Well, the singer-songwriter admits she “used to wake and bake,” and follows that up with, “I'm getting rid of the habits that I feel are real good at wasting my time.” 


	Last year, a cover story with The Cut suggested she'd quit weed, though today, she laughs at the idea that she's totally sober. “Um, I never said I don't ever partake,” she says. “I just don't wake up and hit a gravity bong the size of my face anymore, which is what I did for a long time. But, hey, more power to whatever suits you.”


	Beyond those idyllic moments out in nature, now over a year removed from Deeper Well, Musgraves is entering a new era in her career that has one of country's most innovative superstars going back to her beginnings. 


	As The Hollywood Reporter can announce, Musgraves is returning to the newly relaunched Lost Highway Records as the famed country label's first signee since Interscope announced the revival a month ago, with Robert Knotts and Jake Gear taking the helm. It's a full-circle moment for Musgraves, who got her start at Lost Highway in 2011 as its final artist signing, before the label folded into Mercury Nashville a year later after respected label head Luke Lewis retired. 

	











	It's a major moment in the country music industry and the latest sign of the coasts' presence in Nashville as country has become one of the hottest genres in the world. To celebrate the occasion, she recorded her own version of “Lost Highway” — the 1949 Hank Williams classic and the label's namesake. The move is a logical fit for Musgraves, who's spent much of her career unafraid of going against the grain of how the Nashville establishment operates. The same could be said of Lost Highway, which cemented its place as a home for nontraditional successes, like 2000's O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack, a multiplatinum selling album that won the Grammy Award for album of the year in 2002.


	“Kacey is exactly the type of artist we are looking for with Lost Highway,” Interscope CEO John Janick tells THR. “We wanted someone who's going to move and shape culture, not follow it. Kacey marches to the beat of her own drum, she does what she feels creatively is exciting and makes sense for her, and she's happy to push boundaries and not conform to what someone tells her to do. That's what Lost Highway was, and that's why we were so attracted to bringing it back.” 


	Speaking exclusively about her label move — over the phone while she drives “on the literal lost highway,” Mugraves quips — the eight-time Grammy winner opens up about where she started, her fight to create music the way she wants, and what the future looks like for herself and for Nashville.

	











You've re-signed with Lost Highway and recorded a version of “Lost Highway” as its theme song. Listening to your straight country cover, I imagine some may see this as your return to traditional country music.


	While some might think of it as a “return,” I want to make it super clear that I never left. It's always been a home base, and it's truly where I'm sonically the most happy. But since the beginning, I've always had an exploratory foot out the door a little bit, allowing myself to infuse all these other genres that speak to me.


Maybe it's not quite right to say you're “going back” — you just won the Grammy for country song of the year. But people have looked to you as an artist who stretches the boundaries of what a country song could be. That said, your “Lost Highway” cover feels much more traditional.


	From the age of 7, 8 years old, I was singing all the country standards and classics: Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Snow, Cindy Walker. It's such a part of me, I can't escape even if I wanted to. 


	And it really feels good to wholeheartedly embrace that sound, because I'm always listening to that kind of thing. There may be a misconception that country music is easy to replicate. When you look at the bones of traditional country — the structure, the sounds, the subject matter — it's not easy to replicate. It comes across as very simple, and the best country music is. 

	











	But it's full of so many layers of heart and real life, real stories. And there's a lot of restraint. Really good traditional country music, there's a lot of space for the lyrics, the story, for the heartbreak and the texture. I really appreciate that about that era of country music. It paints a picture, but it's subtle and it's simple.xx


What was your reaction when you were asked to be the first signee to the new Lost Highway?


	My manager, Jason [Owen], was at my house for dinner, and he asked, “What would you think of doing this?” I was so excited, like, “Absolutely, yes!” It's a no-brainer. It made me very emotional, because it brought back so many memories and an aerial view of looking at all I've gotten to do, all the wonderful people I've gotten to meet, and the songs that have come out of that. (Editor's note: Listen to Musgraves' “Lost Highway” below.)


You were also the last artist to sign to Lost Highway before it folded.


	I have always been such a massive fan of Lost Highway. It was my dream to be signed there. Luke Lewis, whom I adore, signed me. Luke is a true risk-taker, always a champion of the artist. I was devastated when he left. He retired halfway into the making of my first record, and Lost Highway went under the bigger umbrella. So, being asked to be part of the relaunch, it's awesome. 


	There's talk about other creative ventures within this as well, like merch capsules and me helping to shape things outside of my own projects. We're still looking at what that exactly means, but it's a true passion project for me. In this world where there are so many varying degrees of genre, to have a home for artists who are left of center is necessary.

	











Lost Highway was home to a certain type of artist — call it the outlaw: Willie Nelson, Shelby Lynne, Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier.


	I am a huge fan of Mary Gauthier. What a diverse roster, right? Lyle Lovett, Tift Merritt. Ryan Adams — I've always loved his music. Wasn't Morrissey there for a minute?


You're right. Do you think that being in their company helped you to envision your future self as someone who could color outside traditional country's lines?


	Definitely. When you can look at artists who have made it work doing it their own way, not chasing a prior mold, it does give other artists permission to say, “That's what I want to do.” There's a reason people on the creative side and people on the business side traditionally, stereotypically, have rubs: because they are looking through different lenses. 


	It makes sense that when labels basically serve as a bank to fund things, they're going to want the least risk involved. Unfortunately, that doesn't work with creativity, because creativity, at its core, is risky. To have the opportunity to bring something back that honors the relationship between creativity, being unique and risk, we need more of that. I find it so interesting that we point to these artists who were outliers and outlaws, like Willie Nelson. He has had a long-standing struggle with Nashville; he was pissing off a lot of people. Now we all point to him as this icon, a new north star for normal. It takes someone breaking out and doing something different.

	











The same can be said about you. “Follow Your Arrow” embraced cannabis and homosexuality and ruffled a lot of conservative feathers.


	Oh my gosh, it was so controversial. I was told not to [release the song] and all these reasons why. I was nervous, because Luke Lewis had left, Lost Highway had folded, and I was already halfway through making [2013's Same Trailer, Different Park], my first real creative statement to the world. I was just scared [Mercury Nashville] wouldn't accept what I was already putting my heart into. “Arrow” was the last song I turned in for that record.


	It ended up tanking — it was banned by country radio. But I would never trade that for the love and the people it brought to my world. I'm not going to present a watered-down version of myself to be accepted. I'll fucking shovel shit for a living at a horse barn, and I'll be really happy. Or I'll just be a songwriter. Anyway, it ended up working out.


As a vocal ally for the LGBTQ+ community, can you see how “Arrow” helped establish the more inclusive country music scene we're seeing now?


	Yeah. It's funny, though, because I wasn't setting out to be some martyr or freaking rule-breaker. I'm just doing my job as a songwriter. When you look at country music as a genre and where it started, it is really textured, beautiful layers of real stories, heartbreak, things that aren't always easy to talk about. It's stories for the everyday person. And that's what always draws me back to country music: It's there for you, no matter what you're going through.

	











How did you approach recording your version of “Lost Highway?”


	I didn't think it needed some avant-garde reimagining. I wanted to bring it back to life. When I was in the studio, I looked into the genesis of the song, and I was taken aback to find it has real ties to where I'm from. Hank Williams [recorded] the version we know and love, but the songwriter is Leon Payne. 


	The story goes he was attempting to hitchhike from California to Alba, Texas. His mother was sick, and he was trying to get to her. I almost fell out of my chair — Alba is the next town over to the teeny, tiny town I'm from, Golden. Alba has no more than 500 people; I've never heard it referenced anywhere in pop culture. This song is full-circle for me, in terms of where I started and where I am now, my label.


Your take has a nod to old-school Nashville radio. It starts with the sound of someone tuning a lo-fi radio and a DJ introducing you.


	That's my sweet grandpa bringing me onto like a country-music hour. He's 88. He was visiting Nashville and I wanted his voice on this, so we convinced him to get in the vocal booth. He was always one of the biggest champions of my singing and learning traditional country music. It's hard to put into words just how beautiful that is for me. I'll have that forever, you know?

	











	Also, this is kind of interesting. When I was down in Texas, I was at this weird, little junk shop, and they had this rattlesnake tail for sale — a rattler from a real rattlesnake. It sounds like a shaker instrument. I bought it and thought, “I'm going to use this somehow, somewhere.” I'm playing the rattlesnake tail on “Lost Highway.” It's just a little percussive part, but there's a rattlesnake tail on there. Back in the era that this song was written, it was common for folk artists to have rattlesnake tails in their guitars because they thought it would bring good mojo.


Is the more traditional country sound of your “Lost Highway” cover indicative of where you're going next musically?


	I've written a ton of songs already. I love being in a period of time where I'm not rushed by a deadline and have the space to mosey and poke around. I'm not sure yet where it's going to end up. 


	There was Same Trailer, then Pageant Material went even harder in the country direction — it was a love letter to all the classic country I love. Naturally, it felt good for me to explore some other sounds, and I went into Golden Hour territory. Then I went through a divorce and was in a really intense place in my life, and I went in the opposite direction with Star Crossed. With Deeper Well, I swung back in toward my center. 

	











	I've been feeling really good playing around with some more — I want to say “traditional” — but at the same time, there always has to be a modern edge there in some way. There has to be a balance between tradition and future. 


You're now in your Lost Highway era, but you're not quite done with Deeper Well either. You're about to announce international tour dates?


	I'm going to South America, then Asia and Australia. I'm playing Brazil for the first time. I know the energy and the fans there are unlike anywhere else. I'm playing this massive rodeo [São Paulo's Jaguariúna], which is really cool. Rodeo is huge in Brazil. It's been really cool to see the rest of the world come to love country music, because, really, country is more about a mentality and an attitude versus geography. Real country music is based on real emotions all humans have, no matter where you're from.

The new project also boasts duets with Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and Hozier.

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


	Eighteen months ago, Barbra Streisand released My Name Is Barbra, an anecdote-rich memoir about her 60-plus years of blazing trails in music, film, Broadway, activism and beyond. But the story isn't over. On Wednesday (April 30), the eight-time Grammy winner and five-time Billboard Hot 100 topper announced a new studio album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, is coming out on her longtime label Columbia Records on June 27.


	A sequel to 2014's Billboard 200-topping album Partners (which made her the only artist to have a No. 1 album in six different decades), this new project also features a cross-genre, cross-generational list of duet partners. And some of the names on this tracklist are likely to leave more than a few jaws on the floor.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	There are duets with classic rock royalty, including Sir Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Taylor and Sting (separately); Irish rocker Hozier; Icelandic jazz singer-songwriter Laufey; English crooner Sam Smith; country hitmaker Tim McGraw; Josh Groban, fresh off his celebrated Broadway stint in Sweeney Todd (he also appeared on her 2014 Partners album); and British soul mainstay Seal. Plus, there's a collab with not just one but two vocally dynamic divas – Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande — that is sure to set the Internet aflame when it lands.


	The first taste of the album, Streisand's duet with Hozier, is already here. Listen to their take on Roberta Flack's 1972 Hot 100 No. 1, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” below.


	“Barbra Streisand is one of the most enduring and iconic vocalists of our time, and somebody who defined an era with the sheer force of her voice, her talent, charisma and vision. To be asked to join her on a duet was a huge honor and came as a wonderful and welcome surprise,” Hozier said in a statement. “Ewan MacColl's ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face', made famous by the stunning Roberta Flack recording, has always mystified me. It is, to me, one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. Like so many, I was deeply saddened to hear of her recent passing. Along with the honor I have to sing on this record with Barbra, I hope this duet offers something of a gesture to Roberta Flack's incredible legacy.”

	











	“I've always loved singing duets with gifted artists. They inspire me in unique and different ways…and make our time in the studio a joy,” Streisand said in a statement. “My new album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, gave me the chance to work and play with some of my old friends, label mates, and new artists too. I admire all of them… and I hope that you'll enjoy listening to our collaborations as much as I enjoyed recording with all of my wonderful partners.”


	Check out the full tracklist for The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two below. The album is produced by Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher, with orchestrations provided by William Ross and David Campbell. Streisand and Jay Landers, her longtime A&R executive, are the album's executive producers.

	West originally premiered the album with a listening party inside Miami's LoanDepot Park in February 2022, but many of the tracks were unfinished and never made it to streaming services as Ye focused on the Stem Player technology. 


	Ye also threw in cuts like “City of Gods” featuring Fivio Foreign and Alicia Keys, which arrived just prior to the Donda 2 listening party, and served as the lead single for the Brooklyn drill rapper's B.I.B.L.E. album. The track reached No. 46 on the Billboard Hot 100. 


	“530” was one of the unfinished standouts on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's Vultures 2 album, but West felt strong enough about the cleaned-up version to include it on Donda 2‘s streaming release. 


	Kim Kardashian's 2021 Saturday Night Live monologue is still included on “Sci-Fi.” “I married the best rapper of all time,” she can be heard saying to start the track. “Not only that, he is the richest Black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids.”


	West has been holed up in Spain for much of April. A masked Ye hosted a live stream premiere for Donda 2 with popular streamers Digital Nas, Sneako and N3on on Tuesday night (April 29). 


	West has been under fire in recent months for controversial X rants filled with hate speech. On the music side, he released a visual edition of his Bully album in March.

Katy Perry has assured fans that she's “ok,” despite a recent barrage of online vitriol that has come her way.


	The singer addressed the recent negativity from online commentators in an Instagram comment on a fan page, expressing her gratitude toward her fans for their ongoing support during what she labels an undoubtedly difficult time.


	“I'm so grateful for you guys. We're in this beautiful and wild journey together,” Perry wrote. “I can continue to remain true to myself, heart open and honest especially because of our bond. I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year!”

	Perry has found herself as something of a lightning rod for negativity in the past few weeks, with much of the discourse related to her spaceflight aboard the Blue Origin NS-31 on April 14.

	











	While the likes of Kesha had been roped into the ongoing drama following an online post that seemingly referenced fast-food chain Wendy's' snarky jab at the “Firework” singer, English musician Lily Allen recently walked back her comments about calling Perry and her spaceflight “out of touch.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“There was actually no need for me to bring her name into it, and it was my own internalized misogyny,” Allen said on her Miss Me? podcast. “I've been thinking about it a lot, and it was just completely unnecessary to pile on with her. I disagree with what it was that they did, but she wasn't the only person that did it. She was possibly the most famous and the one that divides people the most.”


	The Instagram post which Perry responded to was a video of a Times Square billboard that congratulated the singer for the opening week of her Liftimes tour, and ostensibly aimed to serve as comfort amidst the online backlash. 


	As Perry continued, she explained that much of her ability to survive the barrage of negative comments has come about through plenty of therapy and personal growth.


	“Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,” she noted. “My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘no one can make you believe something about yourself that you don't already believe about yourself' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it's an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it. 


	“When the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.”

	











	Perry recently launched her Liftimes tour in Mexico on April 23, with each night also featuring fans being brought onstage during a special request section of the set. “What's real is seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth,” she concluded. “I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that.


	“I'm not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I'm on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS.”


	Perry will bring her Lifetimes tour to the U.S. next week, with a headline date in Houston, TX set to take place on May 7.

The viral-turned-radio hit expands to also tackle pop, R&B/hip-hop and even Latin airplay charts.

	Trevor Anderson



	Riding a hot streak that has already established her among 2025's buzziest names, Doechii lands a historic win on Billboard's Rhythmic Airplay chart as the first artist to send her first three charting titles as a lead artist to No. 1 on the radio ranking.


	The feat comes as “Anxiety” storms 6-1 to crown the list dated May 3 and was the most played song on U.S. panel-contributing rhythmic radio stations in the tracking week of April 18-24, according to Luminate, a 20% surge from the prior week. Thanks to the boon, “Anxiety” wins the week's Greatest Gainer award, given to the song with the largest increase in play count.

	











	Doechii, Billboard's 2025 Woman of the Year recipient, traces her Rhythmic Airplay achievement to her first No. 1, the one-week champ “What It Is (Block Boy),” featuring Kodak Black, in June 2023. She returned to the summit in March with “Denial Is a River,” which reigned for three weeks, before “Anxiety” completed her third trek to the top spot. As noted, the trio makes Doechii the first act to send her first three entries as a lead artist to No. 1 in the 32-year history of the Rhythmic Airplay chart.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Expanding to include lead and featured credits, Doechii is the third act in the overall club. There, she joins Ashanti, whose first two No. 1s were through featured slots on Ja Rule's “Always on Time” and Fat Joe's “What's Luv?,” before her own chart-topping “Foolish,” all in 2002. The next year, Beyoncé inaugurated her solo career with three Rhythmic Airplay champs — a featured slot on Jay-Z's “'03 Bonnie and Clyde,” and her own “Crazy in Love,” featuring Jay-Z, and “Baby Boy,” featuring Sean Paul.


	Beyond the three aforementioned No. 1s, Doechii has one other Rhythmic Airplay entry in her account, a featured slot on Sleepy Hallow's “A N X I E T Y,” which reached No. 31 in February. That track, from 2019, received a second wind thanks to TikTok-fueled virality, that in turn sparked Doechii's own “Anxiety” single's release.


	Elsewhere, “Anxiety” leaps 10-5 on the Pop Airplay chart with a 21% rally in weekly plays and pushes 15-11 on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart (up 14%), and even debuts on the Latin Airplay chart at No. 50. From the developments at pop, rhythmic and R&B/hip-hop and Latin sectors, “Anxiety” explodes 9-3 on the all-genre Radio Songs chart to 45.9 million in all-format audience for the week, a 24% improvement from 37.1 million in the week prior, and enough to win the Greatest Gainer prize.

	











	“Anxiety,” initially a standalone single, was added to the digital and streaming editions of Doechii's Grammy Award-winning mixtape, Alligator Bites Never Heal, in March. The hit single's inclusion has helped the project break barriers of its own, including its first time in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 this week.

Obermann joins Newman, a 16-year Apple Music veteran, from his previous role as global head of music business development at ByteDance.

	Chris Eggertsen



Apple Music has named Ole Obermann and Rachel Newman as the company's new co-heads, Billboard has confirmed.


	The news was first reported by Music Business Worldwide.


	Obermann, who left his role as global head of music business development at ByteDance earlier this year, worked at the Chinese company for more than five years, having started as vp/global head of music at TikTok. Before that, he worked at Warner Music Group as chief digital officer/executive vp of strategy and business development and at Sony Music, where he worked on striking licensing renewals with Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and other DSPs. During his time at TikTok, the platform became a prime music discovery engine, leading to a massive shift in the way music was created and marketed. It also went through a tense period with the record labels, including a prolonged standoff with Universal Music Group that ended when the two companies struck a licensing deal last May. Obermann was succeeded in his role at ByteDance by Tracy Gardner.


	Newman, meanwhile, is an Apple Music veteran, having been with the streaming platform for more than 16 years, most recently as global head of content and editorial. This year, she was named to Billboard‘s Women in Music list alongside several of her colleagues. “We have really leaned into one of our most core attributes as a company this past year: weaving the humanities into everything we do,” she told Billboard at the time.


	Along with its continued role as the sponsor for the Super Bowl halftime show, Apple Music's recent initiatives include its 100 Best Albums editorial initiative and its Apple Music Live series, through which it has produced live performances for artists including Björk, SZA, Camila Cabello, Jennifer Lopez and Kacey Musgraves.

Big Mouth, Netflix's long-running animated comedy, is premiering its eighth and final season next month but its creators have remained busy.


	The team behind the Nick Kroll-voiced series are working on Mating Season, a new animated series for the streamer.


	The show, which will launch in 2026, is set in the animal world starring a cast of bears, raccoons, deer, foxes and a host of other horny, lovable forest critters, as they navigate love, sexual relationships and the universal need to hook up and find a partner.

Big Mouth, which launched in 2017, has racked up 375M views, per Netflix, over its seven seasons and season eight launches on May 23. It featured voice work from the likes of Maya Rudolph, Cynthia Erivo, Megan thee Stallion, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Zach Galifianakis, Seth Rogen, Martin Short, Kristen Bell, Wanda Sykes, Tyler the Creator, Jeff Goldblum, Ira Glass, Steve Buscemi, Billy Porter, Padma Lakshmi, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Jean Smart.


	Voice cast for Mating Season was not revealed.


	“Big Mouth broke new ground in the world of adult animation with heart, humor and total chaos — they took the awkwardness of adolescence and turned it into something universal and deeply human,” said John Derderian, VP, Animation Series, Netflix. “Working with Nick Kroll and the brilliant minds at Brutus Pink over the course of eight seasons has been legendary. Now, with Mating Season, they'll bring that same bold and hilarious creativity into the animal kingdom. We're beyond excited to unleash this next chapter together.”

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


Sgt. Rock, DC's superhero flick to team Luca Guadagnino and The Penguin‘s Colin Farrell, has halted production plans, sources have confirmed to Deadline.


	Reps for DC couldn't be reached for comment. The film was supposed to enter production in England this summer. Whether the project will get off the ground at a later date or is dead is not yet clear, nor are the reasons for this development.


	In Sgt. Rock, a World War II-set superhero actioner, Farrell was set to play Sgt. Franklin John Rock, the character created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert, who first debuted in the 1959 DC issue Our Army at War as a WWII infantry soldier. The character gained stature in 1977 when he got his own comic book series, which ran through 1988.

Sgt. Rock was conceived as part of the DC universe overseen by studio chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, rather than as part of the world inhabited by Farrell's The Penguin and overseen by The Batman's Matt Reeves. Farrell agreed to take on the title role following the exit of Daniel Craig, who kicked tires for a moment to reteam with Guadagnino on the heels of the duo's collaboration on A24's Queer.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Pre-production had recently been underway, with casting in process. The project was set to reteam Guadagnino with Justin Kuritzkes, his screenwriter on Challengers and Queer. 


	Guadagnino will next see the release of After the Hunt, his #Me Too-themed thriller for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will be released on October 10. The filmmaker had also recently been looking to mount a revamp of American Psycho for Lionsgate, but we'll have to stay tuned to see which project the filmmaker commits to next, as he steps back from Sgt. Rock.


	Next up for DC Studios is Gunn's Superman, which hits theaters on July 11. THR broke the Sgt. Rock news.

International Features Editor


EXCLUSIVE: The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey, Babygirl's Harris Dickinson, Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan, The Outrun's Paapa Essiedu and How to Have Sex filmmaker Molly Manning Walker are among more than 400 industry professionals who have signed an open letter calling for industry action on trans rights following the UK Supreme Court ruling on April 17 that defines a woman based on biological sex. 


	The letter, which was started by development producer Sid Strickland of Motive Pictures and script editor Jack Casey, expresses solidarity for the trans, non-binary and intersex communities impacted by the supreme court ruling. The ruling and subsequent Equalities & Human Rights Commission guidance will see trans people excluded from many single-sex facilities, which will have an impact across the industry from sets to cinemas.

	The letter calls on industry bodies and cultural institutions such as Bectu, BAFTA, BFI, Directors UK, Picturehouse, BBC, Writers Guild and Channel 4 to commit to protecting trans people within the industry and their respective organisations. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 17,” the letter said. “We wish to add our voices to the 2000+ signatories of the Open Letter from UK Writers to the Trans Community published last week and call upon members of our industry and cultural bodies to join us. 


	“The Supreme Court's ruling that, under the Equality Act, ‘woman' is defined by biological sex, states that ‘the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man'. We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the UK.”


	It added: “Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.”


	The letter has acquired more than 400 signatures in 24 hours and has also been signed by talents such as writer Jack Rooke (Big Boys), actor Faye Marsay (Adolescence) and writer-director Kate Herron (The Last of Us). 

	











	Execs from companies such as New Pictures, Sister Pictures, Motive Pictures, Balloon Entertainment, World Productions, Federation Stories, Red Planet Pictures and Objective Fiction have also signed the letter, which can be found here. 


	The UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously earlier this month that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. The guidance now says in places like restaurants, shops and hospitals “trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities.” 


	The ruling continues to divide those who are pro-trans rights and who are in opposition of them. J.K. Rowling, a longtime critic of transgender rights, celebrated the ruling on social media.

Meghan Markle is giving her Instagram followers a rare glimpse of her adorable redheads- and we don't mean Prince Harry!

After a whirlwind trip to New York City to be a part of the TIME 100 Summit, Meghan celebrated being back home in Montecito, California with she and Prince Harry's two children- Archie, who turns 6 on May 6, and Lilibet, 3.

The Duchess of Sussex took advantage of California's sunny weather to spend time with her brood in the garden, posting pictures that show both kids' vibrant red hair, just like their dad!

While Meghan rarely posts pictures or videos of her kids, when she does she's careful to only show them from the back. But that was the perfect view to capture Lili's long red locks and Archie's dark Auburn hair.

A post shared by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (@meghan)

A post shared by @aseverofficial

We're guessing that navy blue shirt is a favorite of young Archie's, since he was also wearing it the last time Meghan posted a picture with her kids five weeks ago.

But it wasn't his shirt but his mouth that his mom was focused on while she was in the Big Apple.

While on stage speaking with Jessica Sibley, CEO of TIME Magazine at the Time 100 Summit, Markle admitted she expects Archie to lose his first tooth any day now, saying, “and I just hope we're back home in time for it!” 

In fact, while Prince Harry traveled with his wife to New York City for the TIME 100 Summit, the couple did not appear on the red carpet at the TIME 100 Gala. Instead they jetted back to California to keep from missing Archie's milestone moment. 

Neither Harry nor Meghan has revealed whether or not they made it in time– or if the tooth has come out just yet.

Meghan also gave fans a little hint at what's to come on season two of her Netflix lifestyle show “With Love, Meghan.”

When Sibley asked her what guests are on her wish list for her podcast and lifestyle show, Meghan let slip, ” I can apologize in advance for saying José Andrés is going to be on season two. We love José so much,” Meghan said. “So I think my wishlist has been, I've been fortunate to have the people that I want on the show… I've been really lucky. We have a great, great lineup.”

According to PEOPLE, Andrés is a longtime friend and collaborator of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In fact, Meghan and Harry's Archewell Foundation has supported the celebrity chef's charitable World Central Kitchen since Archewell's inception in 2020. 

The chef and restauranteur, 55, teamed up with the royal couple to participate in relief efforts following the Los Angeles wildfires in January.

A post shared by Sussex Royal Family (@sussexroyal_life)

Meghan tapes her “With Love, Meghan” show at a home owned by philanthropists Tom and Sherrie Cipolla near the $14-million mansion she shares with Prince Harry and their kids in Montecito, California.

And at the Time 100 Summit, she told Jessica Sibley there's a very good reason she doesn't shoot the show at her own home.

“On this show, it's a crew of 80 people,” Meghan said. “People said, ‘Why didn't you film the show in your house?' I said, ‘My kids are coming home for their nap.' Eighty people in the kitchen isn't really the childhood memory I would love for them to have.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","John Brotherton Becomes a Real-Life Superhero After Wildfires: ‘There is Constant Need'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/john-brotherton-relief-efforts-la-roww/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:52:10 GMT","

He's dodged bullets in action movies like “Furious 7” and left viewers swooning in many Hallmark rom-coms. But for the last three months, actor John Brotherton has stepped into the role of real-life superhero in Los Angeles, where wildfires burned thousands of homes and businesses to the ground in January 2025, mere miles from where he lives. 

Like most superheroes, though, Brotherton downplays his efforts and doesn't want any credit for all the heavy lifting he's done since tragedy struck. While driving to sort donations for displaced families on in late April, the actor told EntertainmentNOW he simply wants to spread the word that the need for donations and volunteers remains high because “the devastation is so massive.”

Having worked for many years with late actor Paul Walker's foundation, Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Brotherton knows that after a natural disaster, “everyone kind of plays that superhero right away. It's our instinct to give, give, give, give, give. And then life takes over, and you kind of get back (to) your own stuff.” 

“But the need is constant,” Brotherton said, acknowledging that while he'd been an ambassador for ROWW for a dozen years, having a disaster happen in his own backyard is a different experience. “And I can see now, having now been in the community for a while, the need will probably be here for another two years.” 

A post shared by John Brotherton (@johnbrotherton)

Brotherton and his wife Alison, whom he called “the real hero” in their relationship, have been on the frontlines of ROWW's work in L.A. since the fires began blazing across entire communities, including the hardest-hit Altadena neighborhood and Pacific Palisades. 

The organization collects donated, new merchandise from individuals and companies and matches the items with families who have specifically requested those items, from furniture to clothes to kitchenware. Displaced people — thousands of whom are still living in hotels, apartments or makeshift housing — come to ROWW's “depot” by appointment to receive a curated collection of donations specifically pulled together for them by volunteers, including Brotherton. 

Wearing a Romance University hoodie as he chatted with EntertainmentNOW, Brotherton said Benjamin Ayres' initiative — an online collective of generous Hallmark fans that holds fundraisers for various charities — provided them with a cash infusion of over $7,000 in February, raised in just one week, that allowed them to purchase specific items for families. 

“We were able to spend every dollar exactly where we wanted it to go,” Brotherton marveled. “We bought a bunch of air fryers and air purifiers to put in our curated care packages, and they were such a hit.” 

“With big (nonprofit) organizations, often you give a check, and it's hard to understand exactly where those dollars are going,” Brotherton continued. “They're doing amazing things, but it's like, where does my $100 go? I don't know. This was fun to be able to say, ‘Okay, Ben, you've got a piggy bank of whatever the final number was, and we got to go shopping for exactly what we needed. It's fun to be part of something that I know I can be completely transparent, totally proud of.” 

As families come to ROWW's collection site for individual appointments to receive their care packages, Brotherton said almost all of the recipients wind up crying. 

“For anyone who knows what that's like (to lose your home), it's why we're trying to provide a moment to take a breath,” he said. “Have your needs met, have a conversation, come back if we can fulfill more as your needs unfold — anything from a bed to toothpaste.”

Brotherton told EntertainmentNOW that the need is still great in L.A., but that contributing is easy — whether financially, physically or even through social media. Those who'd like to volunteer in-person in L.A. or in other hard-hit areas of the country where ROWW has deployed response teams, can sign up on their website or send an email to responders@roww.org. 

Financial donations of any amount are always welcome, Brotherton said, because it all adds up, and companies can coordinate donations of merchandise; his “Fuller House” castmate and friend Candace Cameron Bure, provided many items from her clothing line. But for those who'd like to know exactly where their money is going, they can purchase items on ROWW's Amazon wish list for displaced families in L.A., from kitchen utensils to laundry baskets to nonstick cookware. 

“And then, you know, there's also (building) awareness,” Brotherton said, noting how helpful it is when people share ROWW's mission with friends or social media followers. “Sharing on Instagram, that's awesome. Even re-posting a story. There's a million ways that people can give, even if they don't have $1 to spare.”

In HGTV's newest series, the network goes where it's never gone before: to renovate an entire European castle. “Castle Impossible” premieres on April 29, 2025, chronicling the adventures of married couple Daphne Reckert and Ian Figueira as they renovate a 500-year-old French chateau they inherited from her grandpa, per a press release from the network. 

According to HGTV, the sprawling estate once welcomed royal guests including King Louis XIII. Now, the couple have taken over the chateau — a popular wedding destination site — and are using their skills in carpentry, conservation, and landscaping to restore the centuries-old castle.

A post shared by Daphne and Ian Fig (@thewildfigs)

The couple, who call themselves the Wild Figs on social media, have been filming their renovation adventure for YouTube video updates since 2022. According to their channel's profile, the chateau they inherited includes a “500-year-old medieval dungeon, hunters lodge, 18th century farmhouse, 28 horse stables, and a large forest with two lakes.” 

Known as Chateau de Lesigny, which the couple casually calls the Beau Chateau, the castle is located only 12 miles south east of Paris, according to the venue's website, in Lésigny. To escape the stress of the never-ending renovations, the couple told TV Insider they spend time outdoors on the property's 130 acres or go into town. 

“We really like outdoor time,” Reckert said. “We'll take walks around the lake. We go to the village to have an ice cream or go to the market. We'll go to Paris every once in a while.”

Figueira added, “Before we really entrenched ourselves with these renovations, we'd go to Paris more often because we're really close. It's about 30 minutes by car. The fun is endless in Paris, but once we really kicked up the renovations, it has been overwhelming.” 

Sometimes, when the stress of it all gets to be too much, Reckert admitted they just head home to California for time away. It's not just about the complications of restoring something built in the 1500s, but all the extra issues that come with such a massive estate — including trespassers, which they deal with in the premiere. 

“The thing is the chateau property is about 130 acres total,” Figueira told TV Insider. “There are boundaries and fences that cover the whole property, but once you go past the lakes behind the chateau, it kind of turns into forest land. People have found ways or breaks through the fence so they can come in and walk around. Usually, they are just high school kids and we'll catch them and tell them to leave. We've been trying to fix the fences, but every once in a while we'll find they are broken again. It has been frustrating.” 

A post shared by Simon Galfe (@simongalfe.piano)

An area of the property featured on “Castle Impossible” is available to rent out for private events, from weddings to conferences. Reckert told TV Insider that she has tripled the number of weddings booked at the site to help offset costs of renovations. 

They now host about 80 weddings per year there, she said, in areas of the property that have already been updated. According to the website, prices start around $3800. 

Clients can host up to 300 guests for a standing cocktail reception, 250 guests for a seated dinner, and up to 350 guests can be seated for for an interior or exterior ceremony. 

Five of the estate's 130 acres are available for events and three main rooms are open for rental. The site boasts the restored areas feature the “authentic craftsmanship of the renaissance era. This includes the ceilings, chimneys and parquet floors.” It notes that a “marble staircase of honor” was added to the space, “adding to the magnificent charm of the venue.”

“Castle Impossible” premieres on April 29 at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Luke Bryan Sweetly Brings Make-a-Wish Kids Backstage at ‘American Idol' (VIDEO)","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/luke-bryan-make-a-wish-day/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:45:58 GMT","

Before the whirlwind, two-hour live episode of “American Idol” got underway on April 28, 2025, judge Luke Bryan took a break from wondering who would make it into the top 10 and focused, instead, on two very special audience members. 

Nine-year-old Adira and 10-year-old Brantley got to meet the country superstar before the show, thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation. According to ABC's “Good Morning America,” the children have both overcome significant medical challenges and have now, incredibly, become the 58th and 59th kids Bryan has granted wishes to during his career.  

As part of World Wish Day on April 29, “GMA” shared footage of Bryan meeting Adira and Brantley, who both told ABC they were huge fans of the country star, singing his songs since they were “little.”

The kids and their families, were treated like superstars as part of Disney's first-ever Week of Wishes, during which dozens of kids are living out their dreams, according to ABC News, from a princess-themed ball at Disney World for 50 families to a child who will meet one of her heroes from Marvel Cinematic Universe.  

Video from GMA showed Adira and Brantley arriving at the “American Idol” studios via a luxury sprinter van and walking around the soundstage with their families, posing for photos. They got to meet some of the contestants, including Kolbi Jordan, Slater Nalley, and Filo — hours before he was eliminated from the show that night. 

Before meeting Bryan, Adira smiled as she told GMA, “I'm pretty excited about it 'cause he's my favorite singer and I know a lot of his songs.”

“I've always liked him my whole life,” Brantley echoed, as GMA shared home videos of the kids dancing and singing along with Bryan's songs. “When I was littler, I would sing a lot of Luke Bryan's songs.”

While the kids were standing on the “blue carpet” where the stars conduct press interviews, Bryan burst onto the scene and they both looked star struck as he got down on his knees to chat with them. He then took them backstage, admitting he'd never brought kids back there before, and showed them where he, Lionel Richie, and Carrie Underwood stand before the wall opens for their grand entrance at the start of each live show.

“These walls come open and then everybody starts screaming,” he told them. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Although GMA did not disclose the Adira and Brantley's specific medical conditions, Make-a-Wish says it grants wishes to children ages two-and-a-half to 18 who've been diagnosed with a critical illness, defined as “a progressive, degenerative or malignant condition that is placing the child's life in jeopardy.”

Ryan Seacrest gave a shout out to Adira and Brantley during the April 28 live show, and said that Disney is the world's largest wish for Make-a-Wish, “granting one wish every hour of every day.” Over the last 45 years, per ABC, the company has granted 165,000 wishes to kids facing serious medical issues.

Bryan also posted some pics on Instagram and wrote, “Backstage at #idol with my new friends from @makeawishamerica. Thankful to have met both of you!”

Underwood is also a big supporter of Make-a-Wish, donating a dollar from every ticket to her Las Vegas residency to the organization, which resulted in presenting them with a check for $236,844 in April, according to the Tennessean. 

On the last night of her residency, April 12, she brought Noel Miller onstage, a woman who'd met Underwood as part of her own Make-a-Wish experience when she was just 12 in 2008. As part of their reunion, Underwood and Miller sang “American Girl” together.

Chris Hemsworth, the “Thor” star whose family means the world to him, couldn't stop grinning when his 10-year-old son Tristan zoomed into his first motocross race on April 29, 2025. Living in Byron Bay with wife Elsa Pataky and kids India Rose and twins Tristan and Sasha, the Hemsworths are all about outdoor thrills. Tristan's third-place finish in his class lit up the track and their hearts, making it a day of pure family joy. Here's the scoop on Tristan's big race and why it's got his family and fans of the sport cheering.

A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth)

Tristan, rocking a bright red jersey with “Triz” splashed across it, tackled the motocross course like he was born for it. The Hemsworths have turned their Byron Bay land into a dirt bike paradise for the kids to hone their skills, as the Daily Mail shared. “Stoked for my boy competing in his first ever race finishing 3rd in his class,” Chris posted on Instagram, sharing a snap of their post-race hug. X fans ate it up, one tweeting, “Tristan's got Thor-level guts!”. The local race saw Tristan master jumps and curves, a testament to years of family dirt bike fun.

Elsa, a motocross fan herself, has been cheering the kids on since they were tiny, posting clips of Tristan and Sasha soaring over ramps. “Not competitive at all,” she teased in a 2023 post about their backyard race days. Chris, who's been snagging dirt bikes for the twins since they could walk, has nurtured their bold streak, as Dirtbike Lover noted. On race day, Elsa whooped from the sidelines while India and Sasha waved signs. “It's about letting them chase their spark,” Chris told PEOPLE, glowing with pride.

Tristan's podium finish didn't just make his family proud, it put a spotlight on motocross. Australia's dirt bike scene got a Hollywood glow-up, with Dirtbike Lover calling Chris's posts a boost for young riders. Starting on a Yamaha Peewee 50 at age 5, Tristan's got skills that had coaches buzzing, one telling Chris, “He's a natural”. The Hemsworths celebrated with a backyard bash, grilling steaks and reliving every turn of the race.

Tristan's race was a win for the whole Hemsworth crew, who live for adventures from surfing to jiu-jitsu. Chris, who's big on building confidence through sports, shared in a Centr interview that these moments shape his kids. Tristan's debut has fans dreaming of more Hemsworth motocross magic. As Tristan held his third-place medal, Chris's smile said it all: family and passion make the best victories. This motocross moment is just the start for a kid with this much talent.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Katy Perry Speaks Out, Thanking Fans for Defending Her Against 'Unhinged & Unhealed' Critics","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/katy-perry-comments-katycat-fans-defend/","Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:42:55 GMT","

During the seven years Katy Perry spent as a judge on “American Idol,” she was frequently the focus of online outrage over comments she made or costumes she wore on the show. But since her May 2024 departure, the vitriol has only intensified, from harsh critiques of her new music to backlash over her Blue Origins space flight. 

On April 29, 2025, a week after launching her world tour, Perry thanked fans for defending her “when the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata.” The pop star issued a lengthy response to the online buzz in the comment section of a video posted by several fan accounts that pooled their money to put up a digital billboard in New York's Times Square, celebrating her first week on tour. 

Expressing her gratitude for the bond she has with her fans around the world, Perry told them, “Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me. My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘no one can make you believe something about yourself that you don't already believe about yourself' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it's an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it.”

A post shared by Katy Perry Brasil (@katyperrybrasil)

Perry kicked off her “Lifetimes” world tour in Mexico City on April 23 and has concert dates scheduled through December.  

The Times Square ad created by fan groups dedicated to Perry features white text on a blue background that said, “Congratulations on the opening week of the tour. We are so proud of you and your magical journey. And we love you to the moon and back! Know that you are safe, seen, and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning!”  

The ad was signed by “your worldwide cats,” given that Perry calls her fandom the KatyCats. The post's caption said the ad would be live for 24 hours in Times Square. 

In the comment section, Perry replied by writing, “I'm so grateful for you guys. We're in this beautiful and wild journey together. I can continue to remain true to myself, heart open and honest especially because of our bond. I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year!”

Addressing all the buzz surrounding her, Perry wrote, “When the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.” 

She continued, “What's real is seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth. I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that ♾️” 

“I'm not perfect,” Perry wrote, “and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I'm on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS ♥️”

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

Also on April 29, Perry posted a video of herself playfully greeting and hugging a look-alike fan wearing a costume from her “Play” residency in Las Vegas, who was allowed to join her onstage. 

“Never forget this is the whole point,” she put in text over the video, which also showed a packed arena. 

Perry received harsh criticism online, in the media, and even from some fellow celebrities after her eight-minute trip to space on April 14, as part of an all-female crew that also included “CBS Mornings” anchor Gayle King and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Blue Origins founder Jeff Bezos. Celebs including Olivia Munn and Amy Schumer ridiculed the flight as a publicity stunt, per Variety. 

She was also widely criticized in July 2024 over her first single in four years — “A Woman's World.” The first track and music video from her “143” album failed to climb the charts in the U.S. or Europe, prompting  Rolling Stone to call it a “catastrophic flop” and potentially the “worst comeback song of all time.”

Originally calling it an ode to female empowerment, Katy responded to the criticism on July 15 by calling the video “satire,” according to E! News.

Paapa Essiedu, who is set to star in the HBO “Harry Potter” series, has made a public statement in support of trans, non-binary, and intersex communities. Essiedu signed an open letter calling for film and TV industry action to protect trans rights after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that gender is defined by biological sex. That action goes directly against Essiedu's producer, J.K. Rowling, who created the “Harry Potter” franchise and is producing the Max series. 

In addition to Essiedu, stars Harris Dickinson, Nicola Coughlan, Bella Ramsey, Jack Rooke, Faye Marsay, Kate Herron, director Molly Manning Walker, and more than 400 other filmmakers supported the open letter, which was first circulated by Motive Pictures producer Sid Strickland and script editor Jack Casey. The letter asks organizations such as BAFTA, BFI, Directors U.K., Picturehouse, BBC, Writers Guild, and Channel 4 to commit to protecting trans people.

“We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 17,” the letter, as circulated by Deadline, reads. “The Supreme Court's ruling that, under the Equality Act, ‘woman' is defined by biological sex, states that ‘the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man'. We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the U.K. Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history […] We wish to add our voices to the 2000+ signatories of the Open Letter from U.K. Writers to the Trans Community published last week and call upon members of our industry and cultural bodies to join us.” 

Read the full letter here.

The U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 17 that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. Public spaces such as restaurants, theaters, shops, and hospitals will no longer allow trans women to use the women's restrooms, as stated by the Equalities & Human Rights Commission guidance. 

Of course, notorious TERF-er (and Essiedu's soon to be collaborator) Rowling celebrated the ruling on social media. “‘Womanhood' is not some quasi-mystical state into which men can identify. Pretending it is makes both studying the harms done to actual women, and enforcing women's rights, impossible,” Rowling wrote. “A straight man who likes wearing stockings is not a lesbian. Wanting breasts doesn't make a teenaged boy a girl. Both are male, and giving them access to women's single-sex spaces has caused proven harm to women and girls. How does taking away single-sex spaces away from vulnerable women advance feminism? How did three men occupying the medal podium at a women's sporting event help female athletes? You cannot describe what you're too frightened to admit. You cannot defend what you can't define. The last decade has seen a wholesale attack on the rights our foremothers fought for. It continues to astound me that privileged young women who've benefited from those advances all their lives are proudly urging on the dismantling of the protections and spaces that were so hard won, and pretending this is progressive.”

 










HBO CEO Casey Bloys previously said that Rowling was “fairly involved in the process of selecting the writer and director” for the series and that she also gave her “opinions on casting.” He added that Rowling's anti-trans statements “haven't affected the casting or hiring of writers or production staff” for the series.

John Lithgow, who also will star in the “Harry Potter” show, told The Times of London that he did not expect to receive backlash for joining the cast. There too was an open letter directed to Lithgow in particular, titled “Please Walk Away from Harry Potter,” due to Rowling's political views. Lithgow said that “a very good friend who is the mother of a trans child” first gave him the letter; however, he did not reconsider taking the role of Dumbledore because of it. 

“I thought, ‘Why is this a factor at all?' I wonder how JK Rowling has absorbed it,” Lithgow said. “I suppose at a certain point I'll meet her, and I'm curious to talk to her.”

From con men to real estate closers, David Mamet has made a career out of writing characters who know how to spot a sucker. And with “Henry Johnson,” his first film in 10 years, he invites his devotees to look under the hood and examine the psyche of one of the weak, easily manipulated individuals that his most memorable characters spend their lives exploiting.

Adapted from his play of the same name, which premiered in Los Angeles in 2023 before mounting a Chicago production this spring, “Henry Johnson” unfolds over the course of four two-handed scenes. Like any Mamet endeavor, the real star is the language. Major plot events happen almost entirely offscreen, with its ensemble of characters using them as jumping off points to soliloquize about everything from the value of therapy to Snow White's vagina. Everyone has preconceived opinions about his writing style, but Mamet puts it to use, with more substance than recent misfires like the endless phone conversation in “China Doll” or the critically panned Harvey Weinstein play “Bitter Wheat.” The Pulitzer winner has something to say, but whether anyone still wants to hear it is another question entirely.

From the moment Henry Johnson (Evan Jonigkeit) appears on screen, he's working in service of more powerful men. He timidly approaches Mr. Barnes (Chris Bauer), his boss at an unspecified job, with a request to hire a friend of his who is eligible for parole. Mr. Barnes — who emasculates Henry with his body language and confident presence before he ever opens his mouth — doesn't understand why he should help someone who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and proceeds to grill his employee about his affection for this imprisoned man. 

While Henry initially tries to spin his behavior as a benevolent act of kindness, Barnes effectively makes the case that Henry was merely manipulated by a charming sociopath. Furthermore, he reveals that he knows Henry embezzled $300,000 from the company to help pay the man's defense attorneys, and Barnes has every intention to press charges.

The rest of the film takes place in a prison, where Henry's gruff but philosophical cellmate, Gene (Shia LaBeouf), tries to teach him the ways of the world. Henry still views the embezzlement as a noble deed, but Gene is certain that only a chump would go out on a limb for someone else without getting something in return. He encourages Henry to be more aggressive in life, no matter the cost. Henry eventually complies in the form of actions that will have to remain unmentioned, as it's quite easy to spoil a film with only four scenes.

 










For a character whose actions set so many consequences in motion, Henry is remarkably passive. The kind of empty suit who, as Shiv Roy so memorably put it, will always suck the biggest dick in the room, his only function in life is to make himself useful to one strongman before jumping ship to another when he's inevitably cast aside. Both Mr. Barnes and Gene subject him to scoldings about how he needs to stand up for himself when other people manipulate him, but he's never clever enough to see that they're simply diverting attention from their own schemes to deploy him for their personal benefits.

A prominent Trump supporter whose outspoken opinions have overshadowed his work for the past decade, Mamet presents a fairly damning indictment of weakness in our society that has a wide berth of interpretations depending on where your own views fall. In one sense, Henry is the kind of useless man who creates hard times with his own passivity. Nearly all the film's tragedy could be avoided if he could just grow a backbone for five consecutive seconds and stand up to a bully. I'm sure there's someone who'd make the case that a childhood spent replacing seed oils with beef tallow and saying slurs in school could have fixed all of it, but Mamet mercifully never goes there. If anything, the selfish voices in Henry's ears are closer to the MAGA grifters selling male vitality supplements on the most vile podcasts you've ever heard. His own lack of a sense of self creates a vacuum that is immediately filled by nefarious actors who are eager to sell him an illusion of masculinity that hides the fact he's completely under their thumbs.

 










Many critics have hailed “Henry Johnson” as Mamet's best play in years. And while I have not taken in a stage production, I see no reason to disagree with that praise (however faint). But theater and film are wildly different media, and Mamet's movie does not attempt to adapt his work for a new visual language. The film was unsurprisingly shot in under a week, and the only words added to the shooting script may have been “Fade In” and “Fade Out.”

Mamet's loquacious characters have always been most at home on stage because there's no reason to expect them to do anything other than talk. Even the most realistic kitchen sink dramas ever staged aren't true “realism,” because there's always the inherent absurdity of watching live actors whose entire world is confined to a small stage. Mamet never takes advantage of film's capacity to offer a more naturalistic portrayal of human life, and watching two men chew scenery for 20 uninterrupted minutes in an office seems considerably goofier when it's shot in high definition. There's also no reason for so much of the action to take place offscreen. The approach worked for Sophocles (and probably for the stage productions of “Henry Johnson” as well), but what comes across as clever in one format simply seems lazy in another.

“Henry Johnson” offers Mamet fans reason to believe that the playwright still has more to offer us than starry “Glengarry Glenn Ross” revivals and Fox News screeds, and the small ensemble cast all make convincing work of the material. But as a film, Mamet's adaptation should leave you with little more than a desire to see the play. 

 










“Henry Johnson” opens at the Aero Theatre in Los Angeles and becomes available on VOD on Friday, May 9, with more theatrical markets added throughout May.

Vicky Krieps, arguably France's Cate Blanchett, is leading the ultimate vacation FOMO film of the year: “Hot Milk.” With a title that begs the question of whether or not its spoilt, the queer drama balances the cream of romance with the sourness of a fraught mother-daughter dynamic. It's Emma Mackey who leads the feature, and is torn between pursuing the allure of a fellow traveler (Krieps) and tending to her ailing mother (Fiona Shaw) while in the seaside town of Almería, Spain. 

The official synopsis reads: “Set in the scorching heat of a Spanish summer, the film follows Rose (Shaw) and her daughter Sofia (Mackey) as they travel to the seaside town of Almería to consult Gómez (Vincent Perez), an enigmatic healer who may hold the key to Rose's mysterious illness, which has led her to now use a wheelchair. But in the sun-drenched town, Sofia, trapped till now by her mother's condition, begins to shed her inhibitions as she is drawn to the magnetic charms of a free spirited traveler, Ingrid (Krieps). Sofia's increased freedom becomes too much for her controlling mother, and as the hot sun beats down, their relationship simmers with pent-up resentments and bitterness, threatening to tear the fragile threads that hold them together.”

“Hot Milk” is based on Deborah Levy's 2016 novel. Rebecca Lenkiewicz (“She Said,” “Disobedience”) writes and directs the film, which premiered at Berlin. The film is produced by Christine Langan, Kate Glover, and Giorgos Karnavas. 

The IndieWire review credited cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt with infusing the film with a “sun-stroked detachment” that embodies the sudden relationship between Mackey's Sofia and Krieps' Ingrid. 

IFC Films releases “Hot Milk” in theaters on Friday, June 27. Check out the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

It will be a challenge to find a 2025 film that Josh O'Connor is not in. The “Challengers” breakout star is leading the third “Knives Out” feature (all we know is that he's playing a priest), plus is starring alongside Paul Mescal in “The History Of Sound” and will be in Steven Spielberg's next project about UFOs. First, though, O'Connor is starring in Kelly Reichardt‘s latest, “The Mastermind.” 

The film will debut in competition at Cannes. Oliver Hermanus' “The History Of Sound” will also be in the main competition so O'Connor has two shots at being in a Palme d'Or winner this year.

 










For “The Mastermind,” O'Connor plays JB Mooney, an unemployed carpenter who becomes an aspiring amateur art thief. The only issue is that JB's first big heist goes haywire, leading him to confront his life choices. The film is set in rural Massachusetts in the 1970s. Alana Haim, John Magaro, Hope Davis, Bill Camp, Gaby Hoffmann, Amanda Plummer, Eli Gelb, Cole Doman, Javion Allen, Matthew Maher and Rhenzy Feliz co-star.

Reichardt most recently directed 2022 film “Showing Up” which starred her frequent collaborator Michelle Williams. She has also helmed “First Cow,” “Meek's Cutoff,” and “Wendy and Lucy,” all of which were co-written by Jon Raymond. “The Mastermind” is also Reichardt's third film with actor Magaro. 

Neil Kopp, Anish Savjani, and Vincent Savino of filmscience produce the feature, reuniting with Reichardt. The company has financed all of Reichardt's films since “Old Joy.” “The Mastermind” will be distributed by MUBI in North America, U.K., Ireland, LATAM, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Turkey, and India, with The Match Factory handling international sales. This is the second time MUBI has worked with Reichardt, the first being for “First Cow” in 2021. 

“The Mastermind” is one of six female-directed features debuting in competition at Cannes. The others include Julia Ducournau (“Alpha”), Mascha Schilinski (the buzzy “Sound of Falling,” previously titled “The Doctor Says I'll Be Alright, But I'm Feelin' Blue”), Hafsia Herzi (“La Petite Dernière”), Chie Hayakawa (“Renoir”), and Carla Simón (“Romeria”), among the main competition at the Croisette.

Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks are keeping it in the family after a gruesome murder. The highly-anticipated Prime Video limited series “The Better Sister” brings Alafair Burke's bestselling novel to life with the two actresses leading (and executive producing) the thriller show. 

Biel plays Chloe, a high-profile media executive who seems to have the perfect life with her lawyer husband Adam (Corey Stoll) and teenage son Ethan (Maxwell Acee Donovan). The only stain on Chloe's family is her estranged sister Nicky (Banks), who struggles to stay clean. Yet after Adam is brutally murdered, Chloe realizes she has to have Nicky by her side to solve the case. The official synopsis teases that the “prime suspect sends shockwaves through the family, reuniting the two sisters as they try to untangle a complicated family history to discover the truth behind his death.”

Kim Dickens, Maxwell Acee Donovan, Bobby Naderi, Gabriel Sloyer, Gloria Reuben, Matthew Modine, and Lorraine Toussaint co-star. 

The series will debut with all eight episodes, which are produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Tomorrow Studios (part of ITV Studios). Olivia Milch (“Ocean's 8”) and Regina Corrado (“Mayor of Kingstown”) are the executive producers and co-showrunners. 

Craig Gillespie directs and executive produces with Annie Marter through Fortunate Jack Productions alongside executive producers Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements, and Alissa Bachner through Tomorrow Studios (One Piece). Lead stars Biel and Banks also are EPs, as well as Michelle Purple and Kerry Orent. 

Biel recently starred in Hulu series “Candy” from creators Robin Veith and Nick Antosca, and USA Network anthology series “The Sinner.” She also produced teen mystery “Cruel Summer.” 

“Anytime you're sort of putting on a new hat and exploring your business from a different outlook, there's so much to learn, and there's just so much more you can get out of it. Which is why I love it when directors say that they've taken an acting class, or actors will write as well. I love it when everyone is doing multiple jobs,” Biel told IndieWire about both acting and producing. “What I've learned from a technical standpoint is I really understand how challenging it is to create the schedule, and as an actor, if you're looking at your week or your day, and you're like ‘What? This doesn't make any sense. Why? Why do I have to do this scene, and then I have to change looks, and then I have to go back? This doesn't make sense.' But from the producers' standpoint you're like, ‘Well, there's a location issue, and here's the deal with the locations,' or, ‘An actor has a personal thing they need to get out of,' or whatever it may be.”

Lorde has announced a new album. Her fourth studio album is titled Virgin, and it arrives on June 27 via Republic. See the new album's cover below.

The announcement of Virgin follows last week's release of the comeback single “What Was That.” Lorde made the song with Jim-E Stack, Daniel Nigro, and others. It is one of 11 tracks that will feature on Virgin.

Lorde produced Virgin with Jim-E Stack. The album has additional contributions from Nigro, Fabiana Palladino, Inc. No World's Andrew Aged, Buddy Ross, and Blood Orange's Devonté Hynes. In addition, Spike Stent and Tom Elmhirst mixed Virgin, while Chris Gehringer mastered it.

In an email to fans, Lorde wrote:

THE COLOUR OF THE ALBUM IS CLEAR. LIKE BATHWATER, WINDOWS, ICE, SPIT. FULL TRANSPARENCY. THE LANGUAGE IS PLAIN AND UNSENTIMENTAL. THE SOUNDS ARE THE SAME WHEREVER POSSIBLE. I WAS TRYING TO SEE MYSELF, ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A DOCUMENT THAT REFLECTED MY FEMININITY: RAW, PRIMAL, INNOCENT, ELEGANT, OPENHEARTED, SPIRITUAL, MASC.

I'M PROUD AND SCARED OF THIS ALBUM. THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE. I BELIEVE THAT PUTTING THE DEEPEST PARTS OF OURSELVES TO MUSIC IS WHAT SETS US FREE.

Although Lorde's last album, Solar Power, came out back in 2021, she continued to trickle out visuals for the record over the ensuing years, including videos for “Oceanic Feeling” and “The Path.” She went on to follow that album with an EP of re-recorded Solar Power songs sung in Māori.

Outside of that album, Lorde stayed busy in other ways. She joined Euphoria's Hunter Schafer for a conversation on The A24 Podcast, launched a Sonos Radio station called Solarsystym, and covered Rosalía's song “Hentai.”

More recently, she covered “Take Me to the River,” joined Charli XCX for “Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde,” and collaborated with Marlon Williams on “Kāhore He Manu E.”

Say it with me now: Gloorp. Didn't that feel good? Still not sure? Maybe this will clear things up: Gloorp 'Em Up, the second release by Philadelphia electro-percussionist Garrett Burke, is a frothy little dance tape in which every rhythm is recorded by hand. Many of them were played on a MIDI controller known as a DrumKAT 3.5, a digital drum kit with small ear-shaped pads that make it look like Mickey Mouse. Between this, an SPD-SX, and other acoustic instrumentation, Burke whisks together bits and bobs from footwork, gabber, acid, and breakbeat, imbuing their clubby rhythms with a blood-pumping pulse without sacrificing the mechanized momentum of a good DJ set.

A high school marching band kid with a drumming resume that includes stints with Mothers and of Montreal, Burke has spent plenty of time behind the kit. But Gloorp 'Em Up gives him a chance to really shred; he brings the same half-organic/half-electronic MIDI meld of fellow Philly cult acts Body Meat and Palm, only dialed into an even more undiluted strain of slamming polyrhythms and gonzo sound effects. There's hardly even any melodies or samples taking up space—just one skull-rattling fill after another, a daisy-chained string of mulching beats that's casual, light, and fun as hell.

At a snappy 23 minutes, Gloorp 'Em Up doesn't waste any time picking up the ball. “Angggry” kicks its footwork-y stride into gear with bouncing bass throbs, a wispy vocal sample weaving its way between the beats like it's gasping for air. Though a couple other stray voices appear here and there—a vomitous appearance from noise extortionist Morgan Garrett on “Gangggsta,” a phased-out spoken-word passage from poet Myene Trimble-Yanu on “Gunk Body”—they're all similarly abstracted, used more like extra grease to keep Burke's water slide nice and slippy. His drums speak for themselves; “Glimpse” ping-pongs up and down with bongo beats that scatter and pop like bubbles, while “Pergggus” works itself into a frenzy of tabla-like footwork triplets that keep maniacally switching up the groove, digging in deeper as the track hurtles toward its climax.

It's all very low-key, in that special way an album best heard blasting through beat-up car speakers should be. Burke taps into the same goofy energy of Delroy Edwards and Beat Detectives tapes, that wonderfully esoteric zone of DIY lifers committed to club music that once upon a time we used to shrug at and bundle up as “outsider house,” even when the label didn't totally fit. Gloorp 'Em Up is similarly happy to wiggle through its own world: “Ugggly” makes it halfway through without anything resembling a proper beat, rattling dissonant sounds as if rolling them around inside a big tin can. Then suddenly the floor drops out, a wub-wub-ing bassline starts to seep through the low end, and everything seems to flip upside down. It's a ridiculous moment—a Gloorp if there ever was one.

American instrumental guitarists often conjure sprawling frontiers, but those visions can confine them. William Tyler, among the tradition's preeminent 21st century practitioners, has a diverse catalog—he's released a rolicking, jammy rock LP; backed his trusted Martin acoustic with delicate brass; and let out billows of vaporous feedback on his solo recordings. Yet his relentlessly tuneful approach, which seeks serene resolution, and his geographical inspirations—whether muggy Tennessee or the sun-dried Southwest—mean his music is always a hair's breadth from sentimentalizing American dreams that he wants to interrogate. With the nation in free fall and everyone's horizons narrowing, Tyler has tempered his optimism: The 45-year-old's latest, the haunting Time Indefinite, includes a dimmed palette and a downcast scope. The shift makes for his most ambitious full-length yet.

Time Indefinite is still steeped in the American mythos, but this time the focus is on small remnants of life, not sweeping evocations of wide expanses. Tyler incorporates found sound, notably from a reel-to-reel he discovered while combing through his late grandfather's belongings in Jackson, Mississippi. The machine's damaged whirring and Tyler's waltzing, Victrola-ready melodies recall British ambient icon the Caretaker, known for digging up pre-World War II big-band recordings and layering them into faded, postmodern palimpsests. But Time Indefinite reaches for an atmosphere that's a bit closer to home. It often feels like a television tuned to a religious station on Christmas, glowing and murmuring with speech and song after everyone has drifted off to sleep.

The LP's 48 minutes are filled with tiny snatches of AM-style theme music, inaudible intonations, God-fearing hymns, and mechanical racket, and swathed in ghostly, deteriorating production that suggests these warped snippets have lasted into a post-cataclysmic future. Voices echo on several inclusions, the garbled speech of the long dead. The wind whistles on “The Hardest Land to Harvest,” as though through a barren, apocalyptic landscape. Tyler plays archaeologist of the modern era, imagining how elements of today's society could one day become relics.

Surprisingly, his preoccupation with impermanence and mortality isn't exactly somber—often, it spotlights a hard-won sense of hope. Tyler uses major-key guitar melodies judiciously, instead of sprinkling them throughout, which makes their shapes more memorable: After the blown-out tape distortion of opener “Cabin Six,” his six-string enters at the start of “Concern” like morning sun through a window. Acoustic strumming blends with gaping maws of synthesizer on “Anima Hotel”; the central guitar figure on “Howling at the Second Moon” grows into an unexpected string accompaniment. Tyler's discography has been so consonant, and Time Indefinite could only seem grating in comparison. In fact, it's a narrative, transformative work whose deserts of noise set its staggering peaks in relief.

Past releases such as 2021's Lost Futures and 2019's Goes West dealt in existential despair and winking critiques of manifest destiny—qualities that Tyler balanced with an obvious love for the cultural history of his country. Time Indefinite replaces this ambivalence with an unforeseen response: acceptance. In conversation with The Guardian last month, Tyler described coming to terms with various forms of grief—for people he lost, and also for what he terms “macro-tragic” universal changes. The album's title, a reference to Ross McElwee's probing and profound 1993 documentary of the same name, points toward a fear of death, exploded into the grander question of how much time humanity has left. Time Indefinite is the product of adjusting to a period marked by apparent doom, and realizing that potential still exists in the years ahead.

The record's open-endedness comes through in the three-dimensionality of the sound, its simultaneous forward locomotion and its stacks of speech, melody, and feedback. Tyler and producer Jake Davis fit chintzy orchestra swells, programmed percussion, and a fuzzy choral rendition of the Christian traditional “My Jesus, as Thou Wilt” under the same roof. Time Indefinite benefits from its disjunction. Various parts feel as though they have been recorded and mastered with starkly different settings. Smartphone demos bump up against a jumble of analog technologies; inputs buzz in and out from what seem like sundry consumer electronics. The dynamic range feels enormous—sounds dissipate in the background while others, notably Tyler's guitar, take over, as though he's dueting with his radio at home. The wispy atmosphere of “The Hardest Land to Harvest” and the midpoint of closer “Held,” with its gentle electric guitar, set up a gorgeous, fingerpicked finale. After nine tracks of sound collage, Time Indefinite's most striking moment comes from a gesture of comfort, even resourcefulness: The low-tech act of a person playing a vulnerable acoustic.

Tyler continues to commune with America's soul on Time Indefinite, not by examining the nation's tendency toward territorial expansion, but by reflecting how real lives, including his own, flare up and fizzle out within the empire. The disc's most transportive song, “Electric Lake,” thrums with speech, treated with what sounds like heavy delay, its idiosyncrasy and repetition suggesting something personal, rather than a skeptical twist on imperial folklore. This record isn't about the frontier, but rather the lack of one. Time Indefinite asks us to reconsider the world as it exists, which inevitably means cultivating the land inside of ourselves.

Real Estate have announced a new rarities album. Out this Friday, May 2, The Wee Small Hours will feature B-sides, covers, and previously unreleased songs from the New Jersey band's 14-year tenure with Domino. It includes also Real Estate's renditions of Television's “Days,” the Nerves' “Paper Dolls,” and the Strokes' “Barely Legal.” See the new album's full tracklist below.

“This is something we've talked about doing for a while now,” Real Estate frontman Martin Courtney said in a press statement. “The title comes from the lyrics to an unreleased song we recorded during the Atlas sessions at Wilco's loft in Chicago back in 2013, which in turn references a great Frank Sinatra record. This feels to us like a worthy addition to the catalog and we hope you all love it.”

Real Estate's latest studio album, Daniel, came out in 2024. Today, they've also shared a Micah Welner–directed music video for “Pink Sky,” which opens The Wee Small Hours and previously appeared on the Cardinals at the Window benefit compilation. Watch the video—featuring Martin Courtney dressed as a wizard—below.

Real Estate released their self-titled debut via Woodsist in 2009. They joined Domino in 2011, and the label issued the group's next five studio albums: Days (2011), Atlas (2014), In Mind (2017), The Main Thing (2020), and Daniel.

Metallica will revisit their 1996 album Load with a remastered reissue that includes a “Super Deluxe” edition that clocks in at 30 hours, much of it unreleased music.


	Out June 13 via their Blackened Records, the Load reissue will be released as a remastered 2LP, CD, and cassette, as well as an expanded 3CD version. Both the 2LP and 3CD versions feature the album closer “The Outlaw Torn” unedited for the first time, as time constraints forced the track to be cut short on the original 78-minute-and-59-second-long album.


	Ahead of the reissue's arrival, Metallica shared the lyric video for the remastered version of “Until It Sleeps,” which remains a fixture in the band's setlists:


	However, the real draw is the loaded “Limited-Edition Deluxe Box Set,” which includes, as Metallica said, “the whole kitchen sink.” The 15CD/6LP/4 DVD set boasts the remastered Load on CD and vinyl plus tons of unreleased extras from the Metallica vaults, including one of the band's headlining gigs from the 1996 Lollapalooza, five CDs of “Riffs, Demos, Session Takes, Rough & Alternate Mixes,” a collection of B-sides and rarities, more live shows, soundboard tapes and more. In total, the set houses 245 unreleased songs.

	











	The DVDs feature making-of footage from the studio, plus two European concerts and all the music videos from the era. “All said and done, the Deluxe Box Set delivers a fully loaded (and then some) total runtime of 1839:31!” Metallica calculated.


	“To complete the experience, immerse yourself in memorabilia including a pack of 14 Rorschach Test cards, a Pushead patch, an 11×17 Lollapalooza poster, a Rolling Stone cover reproduction, a 5-pack of guitar/bass picks, lyric sheets, two laminated tour passes, and a deluxe 128-page book filled with unreleased photos and stories from those who were there,” the band added.

	From the Slums of Beverly Hills to the heart of Silicon Valley: actress, writer, and director Natasha Lyonne isn't shying away from artificial intelligence, even as fellow creatives in Hollywood fret over what the tech means for their industry.


	As revealed by The Hollywood Reporter, Lyonne is teaming up with The OA co-creator Brit Marling and virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier on a sci-fi film called Uncanny Valley. The movie will include AI-generated visuals from Asteria, a self-described “artist-led generative AI film and animation studio” co-founded by Lyonne and her partner, the filmmaker and entrepreneur Bryn Mooser. Asteria and its partner Moonvalley AI recently debuted the video model Marey, which they tout as “clean and ethical” because it was trained only on licensed content, whereas similar models have scraped publicly available or copyrighted material without permission.


Uncanny Valley, co-written by Lyonne and Marling, co-stars both actresses, with Lyonne making her feature directorial debut. It follows Mila, a teenage girl who becomes immersed in an open-world augmented reality video game, with the boundaries between physical and digital realities increasingly blurred. In a statement, Lyonne described working on the project with Marling as if “Dianne Wiest and Diane Keaton, at their loquacious best, decided to take a journey through The Matrix for sport, only to find themselves holding up an architectural blueprint.” It's not yet clear whether the film, which Lyonne has also compared to the films of the Wachowski sisters, who wrote and directed The Matrix, is intended for theatrical release or a streaming platform.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Presumably, generative AI will figure into sequences involving the game played by Mila. An Asteria representative told The Hollywood Reporter that the movie “will blend traditional storytelling techniques with cutting-edge AI technologies to create a radical new cinematic experience.”


	AI has been a fractious issue across the entertainment industry and was a major sticking point in the 2023 Hollywood strikes, which found screenwriters and actors fearful that studios could use it to churn out scripts or insert a movie star's likeness into visual content long after their death. Hundreds of actors, directors, and other film insiders — led by Lyonne — recently signed a letter urging the federal government not to loosen copyright protections preventing AI companies from training their models on a wider pool of writing, visuals, and more.

	But while unions have pushed back on these tools, companies like OpenAI, which in West Hollywood this March staged a festival of shorts made with its text-to-video model Sora, have sought to convince Hollywood of their potential. Some studio executives, meanwhile, are eager to implement such models in their production flows, not least for achieving impressive visual effects with far less human labor.

	All of which makes Uncanny Valley a precarious proposition for Lyonne and her creative team. On the one hand, it sounds like the story aims to comment on the latest innovations in tech while showcasing them, and Asteria has clearly marketed itself as a non-predatory AI company. On the other, the public has a generally negative view of AI, and is far less optimistic about its prospects than those currently working in the field. Among 2024's Oscar favorites, more than one film faced criticism for relying on AI.


	That said, it's anyone's guess whether Hollywood can fend off the machines in the long run, and those who embrace them now may just be adapting to the inevitable. As for Uncanny Valley, audiences will decide for themselves if it represents the future they want to see.

	Carson. Letterman. O'Brien. Baira. Rahma. Williams. You may not recognize those last few names, but there's a direct line between them and some late-night legends. They're part of the wave of TikTok talk-show hosts who are remixing old-school late-night tropes — breezy interview segments, parlor games, silly characters — for a digital audience. Gone are hosts sitting behind bulky desks; the stars of the future are mics on the move.


	“My job is to share the mess,” says Tiff Baira, host of the dating show Street Hearts, in which she coaches two complete strangers through an impromptu first “date” on a New York City sidewalk. Donning one of her signature sparkly, furry, and/or pink hats, Baira uses her charm to smooth over awkward moments and move the conversation along. “We've all cried about our ex in the back of an Uber. It's OK!” she says. “No matter who you are, even if you are a big celebrity, there's one thing we can all talk about. And that's love.”

	











	Baira's show feels like a hybrid of two slightly earlier internet-era hits that emerged from the late-night-meets-cringe-comedy bloodline: Billy Eichner's shouty 2010s masterpiece Billy on the Street and British comedian Amelia Dimoldenberg's Chicken Shop Date. Both shows grew from focusing on mere mortals to featuring regular appearances by celebrities. Dimoldenberg's flirty chats with Andrew Garfield have been dissected so much she's now done interviews about their interviews. Similarly, Street Hearts has become a stop on the media circuit for some stars: Lil Nas X and Florence Pugh, among others, have appeared next to Baira's microphone.

	Much like their broadcast predecessors, as these creators draw more eyeballs with big-name guests, they also refine their hosting personas, becoming a cheery, reliable presence on people's phones. “There's this parasocial relationship — you feel like you're with people you know,” says Anne Libera, an associate professor of comedy at Columbia College Chicago. “I'm going to show [this guest] as a fun person, and you're going to see them, through me, as someone you trust.”

	Shorter attention spans are driving even shorter content that can take comics — and one easily repeatable shtick — to a new life. There's the music-trivia TikTok Track Star, which host and creator Jack Coyne operates like a snappy discography quiz show. Caleb Simpson's apartment tours are a Gen Z version of MTV's Cribs. And the genre has become so popular that entire production companies have sprung up with the sole purpose of turning creators with big followings into the next It talk-show host.

	











	Anania Williams was already a popular creator when she was approached by Mutuals Media. The company wanted a host for a street show that combined comedy with queer-history education. Williams, meanwhile, wanted to let people know that she was more than a drag queen with an iPhone. Enter Gaydar, which she describes as “gay roulette of a stranger freaking out” because they don't know more about historic queer figures or community icons. “To be a good host, you have to roll with the punches,” she says. “[With] my intersection as a drag queen, a trans person, a Black person in America, I'm able to keep [things] moving forward and find the heart of what someone's trying to say.”


	This change isn't limited to online content only — classic late-night shows are taking note. Clippable bits of traditional 60- or 90-minute programs have become a major aspect of the social strategies for The Tonight Show, The Late Show, and Late Night, even as real-time viewership declines. While shows that appear exclusively on social media often have an advantage in viewership, alternative media companies are benefiting from this new understanding of late night as well.

	Vic Michaels hosts Very Important People on the indie comedy streamer Dropout, a show that puts funny people like Bobby Moynihan and Chris Redd into detailed SFX makeup and asks them to make up their own character and backstory in an on-the-spot late-night format. VIP clips posted to TikTok average millions of views per post — drawing subscribers and acting like a reel for potential guests. “We're basically convincing comedians to come be in hair and makeup for one to four hours and then come and do improv,” Michaels says. “It's been a very cool way to interact with people and get them to watch the full show.”


Kareem Rahma, one of the most famous digital talk-show hosts, wears sunglasses and a tie when he clocks in as the host of Subway Takes, an ambitious short-form show where everyone from average New Yorkers to celebrities, influencers, and even vice-presidential candidates drop by to plug a project and spew a nonsensical take next to him (e.g., “Air travel should be treated like surgery” or “We should throw all chiropractors in prison”). With more than 1.6 million followers across platforms, Rahma is direct about why modern comedians are taking late-night's style and making it work in their own way: It's a better gig. “If I was offered Jimmy Fallon's spot, I would say, why?” he says. “You have to show up five nights a week for the rest of your life and interview people that you don't want to interview. Why would you want to do that?”

Donald Trump has been on quite a press tour around his first 100 days in office, the latest stop of which was a sit-down interview with ABC News that aired tonight. It wasn't always cordial between the president and correspondent Terry Moran — particularly as Moran tried to tell Trump that an obviously edited image of “MS-13” appearing across the knuckles of Kilmar Abrego Garcia was not, in fact, real.


	“On his knuckles he had MS-13,” Trump said of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Trump administration must facilitate his return. Trump and his allies have baselessly tried to cast Abrego Garcia as a terrorist gang member they were justified in expelling from the country without due process (even though the administration itself has admitted in court his deportation was due to an “administrative error”).


	“He had some tattoos that were interpreted that way,” Moran replied.


	Abrego Garcia has four symbols tattooed across his knuckles, and the White House has been circulating an image onto which someone photoshopped — or just superimposed with a basic paint app, really — “MS13,” purporting that it's what Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos represent. Trump even posed with a printout of the photo in the Oval Office.

	











	Trump kept insisting the text overlaid across Abrego Garcia's knuckles were the actual tattoos. “Wait a minute. Terry, Terry, Terry. Don't do that. It says ‘MS13.'”


	“That was photoshopped,” Moran said.


	Trump then started mocking Moran. “That was photoshopped? Terry, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I'd never heard of you, but that's OK,” Trump said. “You're not being very nice.”


	Moran again tried to move to another question, but Trump wasn't having it.


	“Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?”


	“I saw the picture.”


	Moran kept trying to move on — even saying “agree to disagree” — but Trump kept insisting: “No, no: He had ‘MS' as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.' This is why people no longer believe the news, because it's fake news.”

	The exchange was emblematic of the Trump administration's unconstitutional deportation agenda, which seems to be predicated on doing anything possible to label immigrants gang members and then banishing them to a Salvadoran prison without due process. When Moran pressed Trump about the apparent illegality of the deportations and the court orders blocking them, the president passed the buck to the Justice Department. “I'll have to ask the lawyers about that,” was a typical response.

	











	Of course, the interview touched on several other lowlights from Trump's second first 100 days. Moran asked the president what he said to people who felt that the president was acting recklessly in his tariff and economic policy, and that they “didn't sign up for this.” 


	Trump replied that the people who voted for him “did sign up for it, actually.” 


	“This is what I campaigned on,” Trump added. “I said that we have been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We were losing $3-5 billion a day on trade.” 


	When asked if he had a message for “small businesses who are saying we can't live two months with these tariffs,” or was willing to offer them a break like his administration did for Apple and other major companies, the president deflected: “Not only Apple. We have $7 to $8 trillion being invested in our country in two months. Biden didn't have that for over a year. I mean, if you look at Biden, nobody was really investing in this country. Everybody was ripping off our country.”

	There was tension between Trump and Moran for most of the interview.


	When Moran asked Trump whether he had “100 percent confidence” in Pete Hegseth, his scandal-plagued defense secretary, the president replied, “I don't have 100 percent confidence in anything,” adding that it was a “stupid question” and that he doesn't even have “100 percent confidence that we're going to finish this interview.”

Barbra Streisand‘s upcoming album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, is a collaborative effort that will feature duets with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, James Taylor, Sting, Hozier, Laufey, Sam Smith, Tim McGraw, Josh Groban, Seal, and Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande.


	It arrives in stores on June 27, but Streisand released her first single, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” featuring Hozier, today.


	“I've always loved singing duets with gifted artists,” Streisand says in a statement. “They inspire me in unique and different ways … and make our time in the studio a joy! My new album gave me the chance to work and play with some of my old friends, label mates, and new artists too. I admire all of them … and I hope that you'll enjoy listening to our collaborations as much as I enjoyed recording with all of my wonderful partners.”


	Streisand and Dylan have never appeared on a song together before. But a 1971 letter from Dylan to his friend Tony Glover surfaced in 2020 that said “Lay Lady Lay” was originally written for Streisand. And in 2016, The New York Times revealed that Dylan saved a 1978 letter from Streisand thanking her for sending flowers, and suggesting they record a song together.

	











	“I was so touched to find out he had saved a note from me,” she wrote in response to The New York Times. “It prompted me to go back into my own archive and retrieve a letter I had saved from him. As I remember it, first he sent me flowers and a lovely note, asking me if I would like to sing with him. In return, I sent him the note that's in his archive, thanking him for the flowers and the invitation. But for whatever reason, it never happened at the time.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's taken 47 years, but the Dylan/Streisand collaboration dreamed up in 1978 is taking the form of a duet on the Thirties pop standard “The Very Thought of You.” (By coincidence, Dylan recorded an original song in 1985 also called “The Very Thought of You.”)

The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two was produced by Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher. It was recorded at the Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, California, and at Abbey Road Studios in London with the London Symphony Orchestra.

One whistleblower has been left fearing for his life after leaking controversial Pentagon documents containing vital UFO and alien-related secrets, yet believes his sacrifice was worth it to report 'the truth'.

Alien hunting has become a favored pastime for many across America, and you can even head to some of the most popular UFO sighting locations if you want to raise the chances of spotting an extraterrestrial creature.

However, what many UFO believers really want is government proof of the existence of alien life, and while astronomers have discovered a planet over 100 light-years away with the potential for life, a recent major leak could indicate that it's reached Earth already.

Former Pentagon officials have already debated and hinted at the existence of UFOs and UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena), but whistleblower Matthew Brown, as reported by the Daily Mail, has now revealed a secret program inside the Pentagon that was supposedly tracking UAPs and other alien-like objects.

He claims in the Immaculate Constellation Field Report that the Executive Branch has been operating and managing UAP programs in secret for several decades, entirely without the oversight of congress.

He says he first came across the information revealed in Immaculate Constellation by accident, as 'clearly misfield' documents were found on a shared server that Brown had access to.

They not only revealed the existence of a program ran by the Executive Brand that congress wasn't aware of, but also former operations which involved 'cloaked' UFOs and global surveillance of UAPs.

Detailing the reason why he decided to breach confidentiality rules and go public as a whistleblower, Brown revealed on Jeremy Corbell's WEAPONIZED podcast:

""Ultimately, my biggest fear is what humanity will do to itself out of fear and greed. We have built a prison around ourselves. It's invisible, but it's not complete, and there is still time to maybe alter our trajectory.""

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Corbell added in reference to Brown's decision to release the information: ""The time is now... not just to report the truth, but to protect those who will not - or cannot - protect themselves.""

Following his whistleblowing actions, Brown has expressed significant concerns surrounding the consequences of his actions, and even has begun to fear for his life - which is part of the reason why he revealed his full identity.

""This is absolutely what I did not want to do,"" Brown revealed on Corbell's podcast. ""I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try and make for a family.

Don Pettit marked his 70th birthday on April 20 by plunging through the atmosphere in a Russian Soyuz capsule to wrap up a seven-month mission at the International Space Station.  Returning to Earth has always been “a significant challenge” for his body, Pettit said from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut has returned to Earth after spending more than seven months in space, telling reporters he still feels ""like a little kid inside"" despite turning 70 during his mission.  During a press conference Monday at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, veteran astronaut Don Pettit reflected on his latest 220-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  The accomplished astronaut has now accumulated 590 days in space over four missions, ranking third on NASA's all-time list.

One whistleblower has been left fearing for his life after leaking controversial Pentagon documents containing vital UFO and alien-related secrets, yet believes his sacrifice was worth it to report 'the truth'.

Alien hunting has become a favored pastime for many across America, and you can even head to some of the most popular UFO sighting locations if you want to raise the chances of spotting an extraterrestrial creature.

However, what many UFO believers really want is government proof of the existence of alien life, and while astronomers have discovered a planet over 100 light-years away with the potential for life, a recent major leak could indicate that it's reached Earth already.

Former Pentagon officials have already debated and hinted at the existence of UFOs and UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena), but whistleblower Matthew Brown, as reported by the Daily Mail, has now revealed a secret program inside the Pentagon that was supposedly tracking UAPs and other alien-like objects.

He claims in the Immaculate Constellation Field Report that the Executive Branch has been operating and managing UAP programs in secret for several decades, entirely without the oversight of congress.

He says he first came across the information revealed in Immaculate Constellation by accident, as 'clearly misfield' documents were found on a shared server that Brown had access to.

They not only revealed the existence of a program ran by the Executive Brand that congress wasn't aware of, but also former operations which involved 'cloaked' UFOs and global surveillance of UAPs.

Detailing the reason why he decided to breach confidentiality rules and go public as a whistleblower, Brown revealed on Jeremy Corbell's WEAPONIZED podcast:

""Ultimately, my biggest fear is what humanity will do to itself out of fear and greed. We have built a prison around ourselves. It's invisible, but it's not complete, and there is still time to maybe alter our trajectory.""

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Corbell added in reference to Brown's decision to release the information: ""The time is now... not just to report the truth, but to protect those who will not - or cannot - protect themselves.""

Following his whistleblowing actions, Brown has expressed significant concerns surrounding the consequences of his actions, and even has begun to fear for his life - which is part of the reason why he revealed his full identity.

""This is absolutely what I did not want to do,"" Brown revealed on Corbell's podcast. ""I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try and make for a family. My hope is that the stakes are not paid out, but they are life imprisonment and the possibility of execution.""

This isn't the first time that national security leaks have seemingly threatened the life of a whistleblower, as the recently released JFK files reveal the strange death of a former CIA agent that had speculated about the president's assassination.

Wednesday April 30, 2025 

The Department of Business Administration (DBA) of the University of Asia Pacific (UAP), in collaboration with the Club of Finance and Accounting (CFA), successfully organised a session of its prestigious Distinguished Lecture Series on Sunday, 27 April 2025 at the UAP Auditorium.

The event featured Dr. Selim Jahan, renowned economist and former Director of the Human Development Report Office at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as the keynote speaker. Dr. Jahan delivered an insightful lecture on ""The Development Journey of Bangladesh: Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities,"" captivating the audience with his deep analysis and vision for the nation's future.

In his keynote speech, Dr. Jahan stated that the deterioration of the law and order situation negatively impacts social life. Despite significant progress in physical infrastructure, he noted that the country has yet to achieve the desired level of development.

Dr Jahan also highlighted a significant economic slowdown, warning that the achievements made so far could be undermined if economic stagnation continues. Speaking about reforms, he stressed the urgent need for both short-term and long-term measures. He emphasised that immediate reforms must be implemented according to the prevailing situation, especially when people's backs are against the wall, in order to provide much-needed relief.

Architect Mahbuba Haque, the UAP Board of Trustees Chairperson, graced the occasion as the Chief Guest. Professor Dr. Qumrul Ahsan, Honorable Vice-Chancellor of UAP, attended as the Special Guest. Their addresses emphasised the importance of fostering academic dialogue for national development.

Other distinguished attendees included Dr Mohammad Alauddin, a Member of the Board of Trustees; Mr Qayum Reza Chowdhury, Member of the Board of Trustees; Professor Dr. M. A. Baqui Khalily, Dean of the School of Business; and Mr. Sarwar R. Chowdhury, Head of the Department of Business Administration at UAP, along with faculty members, students, and other guests.

The session concluded with an engaging question-and-answer segment, where students and participants could interact directly with Dr. Jahan, further enriching the discussion.

Earlier, Professor Dr. Nazma Begum, Convener of the Distinguished Lecture Series, delivered the welcome address, greeting the distinguished guests, faculty members, and students. She also highlighted the significance of such sessions in enhancing academic knowledge and inspiring future leaders.

Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: countdown, Jensen Ackles

Jensen Ackles shared what we can expect from Showrunner Derek Haas and Prime Video's Countdown and the theme it shares with Supernatural.

Earlier today, we learned that Showrunner Derek Haas (NBC's ""Chicago"" franchise) and Amazon MGM Studios's Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys)-starring Countdown would unleash its first three episodes on June 25th. When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum, portrayed by Ackles, is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions. Joining Ackles for the series are Eric Dane (Grey's Anatomy, Euphoria), Jessica Camacho (The Flash, Watchmen), Violett Beane (Death and Other Details), Elliot Knight (The Boys), and Uli Latukefu (Young Rock).

 

""There's plenty of action and adventure, but there's also humor and a lot of heart in the show, especially in the way the characters relate to each other,"" Ackles shared during an interview with Men's Health. ""Which feels like it aligns with a lot of the things I've done before. For example, with 'Supernatural,' yes, we were dealing with demons and ghosts, but the heart of the show was the brothers' relationship, that they would die for each other, or for the greater good. I think there's a similar theme here. These are outcast officers that don't necessarily find comfort with their unit; they're renegade mavericks in their departments, and they see themselves within each other. I think the fans will react to that.""

""In the wake of 'The Boys,' I signed a deal with Amazon. They wanted to develop something with me in mind, so I had a few meetings with different writers and different kinds of takes for shows,"" Ackles shared regarding how the series came to be during a previous weekend fan event. ""When I met Derek Haas, who created 'Countdown' and has written all 13 scripts, I just clicked with him immediately. He and I actually grew up in the same town; we went to neighboring high schools, so we had a lot in common right off the bat. But he's just a really great storyteller, and he comes from a long line of writing really kind of intense stuff. And so the character that he created, I just felt like I could tell that story in the world that he was also creating. That led to more meetings, and then that led to some outlines. I got to read the first script, and I just really liked where it was going. I liked the kind of world that he was setting it in, and I got excited about it,"" he added.

Along with being able to connect with the showrunner, the show's universe, and his character, Ackles also appreciated being in on the project at an early stage. ""I was fortunate enough to be in a position to do that and be there from the beginning, the genesis of it all, 'cause that's not normal,"" Ackles explained. ""For most actors, everything is kind of already cooked, and then they come in – they get cast in a role that's already happening. I was kind of – not involved creatively, but I was already on the train from the beginning in the station, so that was nice."" As for what viewers can expect from Countdown? ""There are some twists and turns with this show; there are some big reveals, so to speak. So I'm excited for you guys. I'm excited to get it done – we're about halfway done with the season right now. I think they're shooting for June, probably – release next summer, and I'm excited to see what you guys think and to see it once it's on its feet.""

The Nike Air Foamposite One “Psychic Blue” is officially dropping on May 23, bringing a clean, icy look to the iconic basketball silhouette. First introduced in the late '90s, the Foamposite was ahead of its time. 

Its molded shell construction and futuristic look made it stand out on the court and the street. Now, Nike brings back this classic colorway with a fresh release. Originally designed for Penny Hardaway, the Foamposite One quickly became a staple in sneaker culture. 

Its distinct one-piece upper and full-length Zoom Air cushioning offered unmatched support and durability. While newer silhouettes have pushed boundaries, the Foamposite's unique shape and feel still resonate with collectors and athletes alike. 

The “Psychic Blue” edition adds a sleek, seasonal twist to the legacy. Its light blue shell glows against jet-black overlays, offering contrast and nostalgia all at once. It's a look that doesn't beg for attention, but gets it anyway. The photos highlight all the signature details: the smooth molded upper, icy outsole, and Hardaway's 1 Cent logo stitched proudly into the heel. 

This release continues Nike's commitment to reviving timeless designs without compromising their original edge.

Claims made on social media by a right-wing conspiracy theorist concerning an alleged arson attack in south Wales have been debunked by police.

Alex Jones said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that a fire at a chapel in Port Talbot town centre was started by two ""Pakistani invaders"".

But South Wales Police were quick to label this as ""false information"" and arrested two teenagers from the area days after the attack.

Mr Jones' post has so far been viewed 1.6m times along with thousands of reposts and reactions.

More than 20 firefighters were sent to Bethany English Calvinistic Methodist Chapel last Thursday.

Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said crews stayed at the scene until the early hours of Friday to monitor the building.

Three days after the incident, Mr Jones claimed that Christianity was ""under attack"" as a result of the fire.

He added that the ""thought police"" would make arrests if anyone complained about the nature of his accusations.

In a direct response to the claims, South Wales Police said on X: ""This is completely false information. Two teenagers, both from Neath Port Talbot, have been arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with this incident.""

The pair arrested were a 14-year-old boy from Sandfields and a 15-year-old boy from Bryn.

This is not the first time Mr Jones has been embroiled in controversy after making claims on social media.

He was ordered to pay almost $1.5bn (£1.2bn) for falsely claiming the Sandy Hook shooting was staged.

For years he claimed the attack - which included the murders of 20 young children and six staff members - was part of an elaborate conspiracy to limit gun rights.

Jones eventually conceded that the school shooting was ""100% real"" and that it was wrong to call it a hoax.

Eluned Morgan called for Westminster to provide ""significant share"" of £2.5bn earmarked for steel.

As a woman is jailed, how did this tragedy happen and how can we prevent it happening again?

More than 20 firefighters tackled the fire at the 18th Century church.

Anthony Felton is jailed for attacking his friend and colleague in his office at school.

Anthony Felton's attack was motivated by  jealousy and ""entirely without precedent"", a judge says.

Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. The question facing humanity now is not whether we will confront these pressures, but how we will choose to do so.



When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Climate change is increasingly recognized not merely as an environmental crisis but as a threat multiplier, worsening political and economic tensions worldwide. Two factors — water scarcity and mass migration — are poised to completely reshape global conflict dynamics.

Without coordinated global action, these pressures may induce a vicious circle of interlocking issues: destabilization of livelihoods, unprecedented waves of civil unrest and political violence, mass migration and surging border conflicts.



The world is interconnected. A shift in one location will impact another. Fresh water is a resource we all need to survive, and as it dwindles, conflicts can flare. At the same time, rising sea levels and soaring temperatures will make many cities and huge swathes of land uninhabitable. Put together, these human-induced changes will lead to the widespread movement of people into countries that are hell-bent on protecting their resources.

In response, governments will likely deploy ever-more sophisticated military technology to protect their own citizens, becoming more insular in the process. Once capitalism is at risk of crumbling, social divides increase, and nations, corporations, or even ultra-wealthy individuals may begin to take matters into their own hands — addressing climate change in a way that benefits them, potentially at the expense of others.

Civilizations first emerged along fertile downstream river valleys — the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates and Indus. Nowadays, upstream states increasingly control the water that downstream populations rely upon — and in a warming world, that could fuel explosive conflicts.

Consider Iraq: The once-rich agricultural areas near Basra have become increasingly barren due to upstream Turkish dams and accelerating climate change. This scarcity has heightened tensions between Iraq's diverse regions, including the upstream Kurdistan Regional Government (which has proposed adding 245 dams to the governorate), central Baghdad, and the downstream southern populations near Basra.



Similar conflicts are brewing in the Nile Basin, where Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam has heightened Egypt's anxieties over future water security. While Egypt's recent history of internal unrest has many roots, projected water shortages linked to the dam and increasingly erratic rainfall have amplified fears about food insecurity, unemployment and migration, all of which could compound domestic instability.

As global warming accelerates, it's possible that downstream states may clandestinely carry out or finance acts of ecoterrorism against their upstream neighbors, for instance by destroying dams, as Russia did in Ukraine.

Closer to home, recent tensions between the United States and Mexico over water rights have spilled over into economic policy. President Donald Trump recently threatened sanctions and tariffs against Mexico over disputes related to water treaties involving the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers, which have had dwindling flow in recent years thanks to climate change.

In 2020, conflict began when Mexican government forces sought to release the water in La Boquilla dam in Chihuahua, Mexico, downstream to the United States. They clashed violently with local farmers whose farms would be receiving less water.

As hostilities over water grow, climate-driven migration will also fan the flames of conflict in and between countries. After climate-affected people have exhausted all other options for adapting in place, they may resort first to internal migration and then south-to-north mass migrations that may overwhelm national borders.

Sea-level rise threatens coastal cities worldwide — including Miami, Venice, Lagos, Jakarta and Alexandria — potentially displacing millions of people and intensifying competition over dwindling livable land and resources.

As migration pressures mount, wealthier nations may increasingly militarize their frontiers rather than let in these climate refugees. They are already doing so.

Of course, history reveals the limitations of this approach. Rome's sophisticated border fortifications eventually failed as climate change fueled the in-migration of rival groups like the Huns and Goths. To avoid this fate, modern states are going beyond simply building physical barriers; they are also deploying drones, artificial intelligence surveillance and even autonomous defense systems to keep refugees out.

Border hardening may go hand-in-hand with policy shifts that mean governments only protect the rights of those who can pay. This shift is already underway. The recent proposal for restructuring the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) into the US International Humanitarian Agency explicitly prioritizes American ""taxpayers"" and companies rather than its citizens, reflecting a broader global trend toward commodifying citizenship.

This trend will worsen inequality, insulating the wealthy from climate change while the poorest suffer.

Effectively addressing these challenges requires strong democratic governance. Democracies that prioritize distributing resources equitably and adapting to climate change are more resilient. Unfortunately, many countries today are backsliding, becoming less democratic and even rolling back climate policies.



The potential collapse of insurance markets due to climate impacts, highlighted recently by Allianz, vividly illustrates what will happen if governments fail to adequately respond to climate change. Günther Thallinger, a member of the insurance giant's board, warned that pretty soon the company won't be able to cover climate risks — an impact that will ricochet through financial services. ""The financial sector as we know it ceases to function,"" he wrote in a LinkedIn post. ""And with it, capitalism as we know it ceases to be viable.""

When climate risks make large segments of global assets uninsurable — think entire districts or even cities vulnerable to flooding or wildfire — the foundations of capitalism wobble. Without significant political intervention, these pressures will dramatically widen social divides, fueling migration or even revolutionary movements.

The above scenarios could collectively heighten the risk of an often overlooked possibility: one where a single nation or group of nations unilaterally decides to deploy a stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) — a type of geoengineering that, theoretically, reduces the effects of climate change by lowering overall solar radiation entering the atmosphere. However, the effects of such geoengineering strategies on rainfall patterns may inadvertently alter downwind rainfall patterns, or even cause ""termination shocks"" to temperature when ceased.

—The US is squandering the one resource it needs to win the AI race with China — human intelligence

—'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever

Middle-income ""buffer zone"" countries, like Mexico or Turkey, that may be overwhelmed by a surge of migration, could view an SAI as a way of reducing migration pressure. So, too, might democratic countries whose governments want to take action on climate change but can't find a global policy consensus. Craig Martin, co-director of the International and Comparative Law Center at the Washburn University School of Law, and Scott Moore, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist, have described the SAI scenario as a conceivable cause for war, possibly declared by autocratic or oligarchic nations that are negatively affected, or that are looking for excuses to seize resources or territories.

To prevent this spiraling scenario of violence, economic disruption and political breakdown, we need urgent, proactive international cooperation. In addition to dramatic climate change prevention efforts, we must include legally binding resource-sharing treaties, humane migration frameworks and collaborative adaptation efforts, where richer nations help poorer ones.

Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. The question facing humanity now is not whether we will confront these pressures, but how we will choose to do so: through cooperation and proactive governance or through escalating militarization, inequity and instability. Our collective response today will define the peace and stability of tomorrow's world.

The ways that statisticians and governments measure the economy were developed in the 1940s, when the urgent economic problems were entirely different from those of today. Diane Coyle argues that the framework underpinning today's economic statistics is so outdated that it functions as a distorting lens, or even a set of blinkers. When policymakers rely on such an antiquated conceptual tool, how can they measure, understand, and respond with any precision to what is happening in today's digital economy?

Coyle argues that to understand the current economy, we need different data collected in a different framework of categories and definitions, and she offers some suggestions about what this would entail.

Diane Coyle is a Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge and the author of The Soulful Science: What Economists Really Do and Why It Matters and GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History.

Negotiators from Ukraine are in Washington ironing out the final details of an agreement to develop the country's natural resources that they hope will strengthen their economic partnership with the US, according to people familiar with the discussions. 

The two sides have agreed on the main accord and are now working on some technical elements in separate texts, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. While both sides see agreement as close, the Ukrainians were hoping to sign the overarching deal before nailing down the details but the US is insisting all components are agreed together, one of the people said.

China removed sanctions against European lawmakers amid speculation that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs could lead to a reset of relations with the European Union.  

The lifting was confirmed by European Parliament president Roberta Metsola on Wednesday. “Our parliamentary committees must be able to discuss European interests with their Chinese counterparts without fear of repercussions,” Metsola said, according to a statement.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

China's tech world isn't getting distracted by whether the U.S. and China will talk on trade.

From new artificial intelligence models to the world's largest auto show, Chinese tech companies are flaunting new developments thick and fast. Online delivery companies JD.com and Meituan are even publicly waging a competition for users, evoking the heyday of China's internet boom that spawned Alibaba.

At the opening of the Shanghai auto show on April 23, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD announced five new models and Zeekr debuted its new hybrid 9X SUV. Robotaxi operator Pony.ai showed off three new vehicles that it claimed would slash costs for autonomous driving by 70%, helping the U.S.-listed company move closer to profitability.

A day earlier, Huawei announced that this year, its latest driver-assist system will be able to automatically park a car, similar to valet service at a restaurant. Huawei sells the software to electric car manufacturers.

""The intense competition has pushed innovation in [China's new energy vehicles] ... things we thought were still a decade away, are more or less now at our fingertips,"" said Tu Le, founder and managing director at consulting firm Sino Auto Insights. He pointed to examples such as high-speed charging and driver-assist systems in mass market cars.

Generative AI and supportive Chinese policy have both played a role in local tech development.

IQiyi, dubbed China's ""Netflix,"" last week in Beijing touted its AI tools for cutting production costs and refining scripts. The company showed off its virtual studio set, and how generative AI can quickly transform the style of a TV show with human actors to one using 3D animation.

""This conversion effect was not achievable last year, or even in March,"" Liu Wenfeng, president of iQiyi's infrastructure and intelligent content distribution business group, told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. ""It's only recent technology that can achieve better consistency and stability in [generating] images.""

But he cautioned that AI still has a long way to go for it to generate videos that show actors, products and scenes with the same consistency as a live-action shot. In the meantime, he said virtual production and AI-supported efficiencies allow the company to respond more quickly to audience interests.

Other Chinese companies are also trying to use AI for video. On April 15, Chinese short-video company Kuaishou released an update to its AI video generation model, Kling, spurring worries from media blog The Ankler about the consequences for Hollywood.

A few days after the Kling upgrade, Alibaba released its latest open-source AI video generation model, while Beijing-based startup Shengshu Technology upgraded AI video product Vidu Q1, which claims to ""rival cinematic-grade visual effects."" Alibaba on Tuesday also released its latest AI model, Qwen 3.

""We're seeing a significant acceleration in AI investment in China,"" said Tim Wang, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Monolith Management, where he manages a $400 million public equity fund.

""Key breakthroughs in foundational models are closing the gap with global leaders,"" he said, ""and we're optimistic about the future of consumer AI applications, regardless of current trade headlines.""

Chinese companies are also turning to e-commerce and tech tools to mitigate the impact of tariffs.

Several hundred exporters are now using tech company Baidu's AI-powered virtual human tool to sell products online via livestreams, said Xiaoli Ping, Baidu vice president and general manager of its e-commerce business. She claimed the tech cuts livestreaming costs by more than 80%, and can generate a higher purchase rate than employing human livestreamers.

Baidu last week released what it claims is a ""more persuasive"" virtual human, as well as new AI models that are even cheaper to use than prior versions.

Excitement around Chinese AI picked up in late January after homegrown DeepSeek released a free AI model and chatbot that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT. That breakthrough shattered perceptions that U.S. restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors would limit local AI development.

Particularly for startups in critical tech industries, the Chinese government has many policies to help them connect with local suppliers and receive financing, said Beiping Tan, general manager at Beijing-based Tourongbang Management Consulting.

China has also increased its efforts to develop and train talent, he said. His consulting firm has highlighted state policies for attracting individuals from outside China, especially those with doctorate degrees in engineering and natural science.

Individual benefits include a 3 million to 5 million yuan ($410,000 to $690,000) one-time payout and an 800,000 yuan rental subsidy, while the employer can also receive subsidies for the majority of the individual's salary and 3 million yuan in research funding.

DeepSeek and other Chinese tech breakthroughs this year are the cumulation of years of research spending and education development, pointed out Ding Wenjie, investment strategist for global capital investment at China Asset Management Co. ""We believe China will have more homegrown champions to surprise the world in the future.""

Even if that prediction comes true, that doesn't mean it will be a straight path up given the overall economic headwinds. Goldman Sachs pointed out that first-quarter industrial profit data indicated there was no growth outside of high-tech industries.

China didn't meet all its lofty ""Made in China 2025"" targets set a decade ago, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said, noting the policy also fueled unhealthy overproduction in certain sectors.

Intense competition in China's EV industry has also meant its development has plateaued for now, said Yichao Zhang, partner at consulting firm AlixPartners. He pointed out that automakers will need to work harder to create distinctive brands, traditionally the edge of foreign companies.

But as China's rapid transformation into a global EV leader has shown, Zhang expects the Chinese dominance of the local market — and their international ambitions — to continue regardless.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent: It's up to China to de-escalate trade tensions

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss the latest developments on President Trump's trade negotiations with other countries, the state of tariff negotiations with China, how soon countries will reach trade deals with the U.S., and more.

China released a plan to encourage companies to hire more recent graduates. The greater emphasis on employment support came after a high-level Politburo meeting on April 25 that called for targeted measures to help businesses in face of trade tensions.

U.S. President Donald Trump claims he talked to Chinese President Xi Jinping. But there's no date and Beijing is saying there isn't any contact. Meanwhile, Xi emphasized AI and tech development during a trip to Shanghai on Tuesday. A few days earlier, China's finance minister and central bank governor were both in Washington, D.C., for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings.

China is ramping up its alternative energy development to reduce reliance on U.S. crude. The country on Monday said it approved five nuclear power projects, while releasing plans to develop hydrogen energy research and services this year.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks swung between gains and losses in a choppy session on Wednesday.

Mainland China's CSI 300 was flat while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes several major Chinese companies — was up 0.22% as of 11:20 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 has lost over 4% while the Hang Seng Index has gained nearly 10% so far this year.

The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield was slightly down at 1.625%.

The offshore Chinese yuan was marginally stronger at 7.266 against the greenback.

US homeland security secretary said Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador ‘not under our control'

Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said that if Kilmar Ábrego García was sent back to the US, the Donald Trump administration “would immediately deport him again”.

Noem repeated White House assertions about Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported from Maryland last month, in a new interview with CBS.

“[Ábrego García] is not under our control. He is an El Salvador citizen. He is home there in his country. If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again,” Noem said of the 29-year-old who entered the US illegally around 2011 after fleeing gang violence.

Ábrego García was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. Despite the order, on 15 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials deported Ábrego García to El Salvador where he was held in the Center for Terrorism Confinement, a controversial mega-prison.

Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego García's deportation was an “administrative error”, it has repeatedly cast him as an MS-13 gang member on television – a claim his wife, a US citizen, and his attorneys staunchly reject. Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US, according to court documents.

Since Ábrego García's deportation, the Trump administration has refused to bring him back to the US – despite the supreme court unanimously ordering it to “facilitate” his release. Trump officials claim that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because Ábrego García is a Salvadorian national and no longer in the US.

Noem asserted the Trump administration's claims to CBS, saying: “President Trump and his administration has adhered to the court and respects the court and its decision,” adding, “This individual is not under the United States of America's jurisdiction and he is not one of our citizens. He is home in his home country. And that's up to that country to decide what to do.”

Last week, a federal judge accused the White House of “bad faith” in the case, arguing that “defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court's orders”.

Yet, Noem maintains that the Trump administration spends “hours and hours” building cases against alleged gang members.

Upon being asked about the administration's claims against individuals who have been deported without due process, the homeland security secretary said: “Obviously, we're relying on the expertise of our investigators, our teams, double-checking, triple-checking, going through the paperwork, making sure that we have done everything absolutely correctly.”

Noem also accused federal judges who have issued court orders the Trump administration dislikes as “activist judges”.

“I'm sure that these judges will continue to challenge every single thing that this administration does. We have several activist judges across the country,” she said, despite some of the judges who have ruled against Trump's immigration policies being nominated by Republicans.

Earlier this month, J Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan-appointee and conservative appellate judge, called the Trump administration's claims in Ábrego García's case “shocking”, saying: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
