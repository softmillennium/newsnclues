                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, the Texas Senate passed a law targeting abortion pills in efforts to dramatically expand the state's near-total abortion ban. Dubbed the Women and Child Protection Act, SB 2880 would allow lawsuits against anyone manufacturing, mailing, or delivering abortion pills to someone in Texas for up to $100,000. These lawsuits can center around “injury sustained by an unborn child” or the “wrongful death of an unborn child” (which the bill specifies can be filed by either parent). Per the Texas Tribune, the bill's current language means it cannot be challenged in state court before it goes into effect. In fact, a state court judge could be sued for $100,000 if they say that it's unconstitutional. Furthermore, any lawyers who try to challenge the bill would be responsible for both sides' legal fees. This use of civil lawsuits was central to Texas's original anti-abortion legislation in 2021, as it allowed the state to expand its reach by effectively handing over the policing and enforcement of laws to private citizens. When it was originally introduced in March, it included felony charges for paying for or reimbursing abortion-related costs or destroying evidence. It also criminalized things like helping with travel or lodging. An average of 2,800 Texans receive abortion-inducing medication by mail from shield states whose laws protect abortion providers, helpers, and patient medical records from any civil or criminal proceedings. Recently, Texas tried to circumvent New York's law by suing a doctor for mailing abortion pills. But last month, a county clerk refused to file the judge's fine of over $100,000. Per the Texas Tribune, bill author Sen. Bryan Hughes said that pills “are being mailed…directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without any follow-up care after…This is illegal in Texas, but it is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.” This includes anyone who makes a website about abortion access or exchanges emails. The Senate is considering testing sewage for abortion pills, and also passed SB 31, which clarifies when doctors can perform medically necessary abortions. Per the outlet, two women died from sepsis after doctors refused to evacuate their incomplete miscarriages because that would be an abortion. Although once again framed as protecting women, the Texas Equal Access Fund described it as a “political distraction” that “only exists to provide anti-abortion politicians cover for their decision to ban abortion, while keeping care inaccessible.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A young man with no government experience who has yet to even complete his undergraduate degree is working for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and has been tasked with using artificial intelligence to rewrite the agency's rules and regulations. Christopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and most recently a third-year at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month. “I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,'” Scott Langmack, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED. (He has also been given read access to HUD's data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.) The document, written by a who's who of far-right figures, many of whom now hold positions of power within the administration, pushes for deregulation in areas like the environment, food and drug enforcement, and diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. “It all sounds crazy—having AI recommend revisions to regulations,” one HUD source says. “But I appreciated how much they're using real people to confirm and make changes.” One HUD source says they were told that the AI model being used for this project is “being refined by our work to be used across the government.” To do this, the source says they were told in a meeting attended by Sweet and Jacob Altik, another known DOGE member who has worked as an attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Mangesthat, the model will crawl through the Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR), Another source told WIRED that Sweet has also been using the tool at other parts of HUD. The spreadsheet details how many words can be eliminated from individual regulations and gives a percentage figure indicating how noncompliant the regulations are. Sweet did not respond to requests for comment regarding his work. In response to a request to clarify Sweet's role at HUD, a spokesperson for the agency said they do not comment on individual personnel. It's unclear how Sweet was recruited to DOGE, but a public GitHub account indicates that he was working on this issue even before he joined Musk's demolition crew. The “CLSweet” GitHub account, which WIRED has linked to Sweet, created an application that tracks and analyzes federal government regulations “showing how regulatory burden is distributed across government agencies.” The application was last updated in March 2025, weeks before Sweet joined HUD. (This law dictates how agencies are allowed to establish regulations and allows for judicial oversight over everything an agency does.) Another HUD source said Sweet's title seemed to make little sense. The biography also mentions that Sweet “will be joining Nexus Point Capital as a private equity summer analyst.” The company has headquarters in Hong Kong and Shanghai and describes itself as “an Asian private equity fund with a strategic focus on control opportunities in the Greater China market.” DOGE representatives have been at HUD since February, when WIRED reported that two of those staffers were given application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside the agency. Earlier this month, US representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said DOGE had “infiltrated our nation's housing agencies, stealing funding Congress provided to communities, illegally terminating staff, including in your districts, and accessing confidential data about people living in assisted housing, including sexual assault survivors.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI-generated computer code is rife with references to non-existent third-party libraries, creating a golden opportunity for supply-chain attacks that poison legitimate programs with malicious packages that can steal data, plant backdoors, and carry out other nefarious actions, newly published research shows. These non-existent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. Also known as package confusion, this form of attack was first demonstrated in 2021 in a proof-of-concept exploit that executed counterfeit code on networks belonging to some of the biggest companies on the planet, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla included. It's one type of technique used in software supply-chain attacks, which aim to poison software at its very source in an attempt to infect all users downstream. “Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users,” Joseph Spracklen, a University of Texas at San Antonio Ph.D. student and lead researcher, told Ars via email. In AI, hallucinations occur when an LLM produces outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely unrelated to the task it was assigned. Of the 2.23 million package references contained in those samples, 440,445, or 19.7 percent, pointed to packages that didn't exist. One of the things that makes package hallucinations potentially useful in supply-chain attacks is that 43 percent of package hallucinations were repeated over 10 queries. “In addition,” the researchers wrote, “58 percent of the time, a hallucinated package is repeated more than once in 10 iterations, which shows that the majority of hallucinations are not simply random errors, but a repeatable phenomenon that persists across multiple iterations. This is significant because a persistent hallucination is more valuable for malicious actors looking to exploit this vulnerability and makes the hallucination attack vector a more viable threat.” In other words, many package hallucinations aren't random one-off errors. Attackers could seize on the pattern by identifying nonexistent packages that are repeatedly hallucinated. The attackers would then publish malware using those names and wait for them to be accessed by large numbers of developers. The average percentage of package hallucinations produced by open source LLMs such as CodeLlama and DeepSeek was nearly 22 percent, compared with a little more than 5 percent by commercial models. Code written in Python resulted in fewer hallucinations than JavaScript code, with an average of almost 16 percent compared with a little over 21 percent for JavaScript. “This is a difficult question because large language models are extraordinarily complex systems, making it hard to directly trace causality. Most estimates suggest that ChatGPT models have at least 10 times more parameters than the open-source models we tested, though the exact architecture and training details remain proprietary. Interestingly, among open-source models, we did not find a clear link between model size and hallucination rate, likely because they all operate within a relatively smaller parameter range. These processes are intended to improve model usability and reduce certain types of errors, but they may have unforeseen downstream effects on phenomena like package hallucination. We speculate that it stems from the fact that JavaScript has roughly 10 times more packages in its ecosystem than Python, combined with a more complicated namespace. With a much larger and more complex package landscape, it becomes harder for models to accurately recall specific package names, leading to greater uncertainty in their internal predictions and, ultimately, a higher rate of hallucinated packages.” With Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that 95 percent of code will be AI-generated within five years, here's hoping developers heed the message.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rivian built up a stockpile of batteries for its trucks, SUVs, and commercial vans before and after the election of Donald Trump, a strategy used to soften the blow of the president's tariffs, according to Bloomberg News. The company apparently bought an undisclosed number of lithium iron phosphate batteries from Chinese firm Gotion before the election. After the election (although it's not clear exactly when) Rivian worked with Samsung SDI “to move a large amount of battery inventory to the U.S. from South Korea,” Bloomberg reports. The stockpiles should help reduce the pricing pressure caused by Trump's auto tariffs, which are applied to components that car companies bring into the U.S. to use in vehicles. Trump altered those tariffs this week, providing some relief compared to his original plan of applying an across-the-board 25% tax on imported parts; Trump's revised tariff plan will still likely lead to price hikes on new cars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have trained a new kind of large language model (LLM) using GPUs dotted across the world and fed private as well as public data—a move that suggests that the dominant way of building artificial intelligence could be disrupted. Flower created techniques that allow training to be spread across hundreds of computers connected over the internet. Vana provided sources of data including private messages from X, Reddit, and Telegram. Collective-1 is small by modern standards, with 7 billion parameters—values that combine to give the model its abilities—compared to hundreds of billions for today's most advanced models, such as those that power programs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Lane adds that Flower AI is partway through training a model with 30 billion parameters using conventional data, and plans to train another model with 100 billion parameters—close to the size offered by industry leaders—later this year. “It could really change the way everyone thinks about AI, so we're chasing this pretty hard,” Lane says. He says the startup is also incorporating images and audio into training to create multimodal models. AI companies currently build their models by combining vast amounts of training data with huge quantities of compute concentrated inside data centers stuffed with advanced GPUs that are networked together using super-fast fiber-optic cables. They also rely heavily on datasets created by scraping publicly accessible—although sometimes copyrighted—material, including websites and books. Even open source models, like Meta's Llama and R1 from DeepSeek, are built by companies with access to large data centers. Distributed approaches could make it possible for smaller companies and universities to build advanced AI by pooling disparate resources together. Creating an LLM involves feeding huge amounts of text into a model that adjusts its parameters in order to produce useful responses to a prompt. Inside a data center the training process is divided up so that parts can be run on different GPUs, and then periodically consolidated into a single, master model. The new approach allows the work normally done inside a large data center to be performed on hardware that may be many miles away and connected over a relatively slow or variable internet connection. Last year, researchers at Google demonstrated a new scheme for dividing and consolidating computations called DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo) that enables more efficient distributed learning. The process is slower than conventional training but is more flexible, allowing new hardware to be added to ramp up training, Lane says. Flower AI's partner in the effort to build Collective-1, Vana, is developing new ways for users to share personal data with AI builders. Vana's software allows users to contribute private data from platforms like X and Reddit to training a large language model, and potentially specify what kind of end uses are permitted or even benefit financially from their contributions. Anna Kazlauskas, cofounder of Vana, says the idea is to make untapped data available for AI training and also to give users more control over how their information is used for AI. “This is data that isn't usually able to be included in AI models because it's not publicly available,” Kazlauskas says, “and is the first time that data directly contributed by users is being used to train a foundation model, with users given ownership of the AI model their data creates.” Mirco Musolesi, a computer scientist at University College London, says a key benefit of the distributed approach to AI training is likely to be that it unlocks new kinds of data. “Scaling this to frontier models would allow the AI industry to leverage vast amounts of decentralized and privacy-sensitive data, for example in health care and finance, for training without the risks associated with data centralization,” he says. Would you contribute your data to a model like Collective-1?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since it launched nearly 20 years ago, Speedtest.net has been one of the most popular tools used to measure internet speeds. However, Doug Suttles, the founder and former CEO of Ookla, the network testing company behind Speedtest, felt that just measuring speed was not enough to tell people all they wanted to know about their internet connections. That's why Suttles is now launching a new tool called Orb that measures latency, packet loss, jitter, and speed to give you a measure of how stable your internet connection is. Suttles, who started Orb with Ookla exec Jamie Steven in 2023, said Speedtest.net was the right tool for its time, but as internet speeds became less of an issue around the world, he felt people needed new, more holistic ways to assess their internet connections. “Speed tests are like the dipstick in your car, which will tell you that you ran out of oil once your car breaks down. Combining all three variables, the tool gives you a score to indicate how stable your network connection is. Orb has apps for various platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. The company also provides a guide for installing the tool on Raspberry Pi, Onewrt, Docker, Steam Deck, Prox Max, WLAN Pi, older smartphones, and other platforms for those who would want to monitor their connections more frequently. The startup is also working on a feature that would let users set up an Orb and share it with someone else to have them monitor your connection. Both users will receive notifications if the connection quality wavers. Steven, who also worked on creating Down Detector, said Orb also aims to create recipes for different services that help you detect if you can access a particular site, like Zoom, Netflix, X, or Google Drive, to check if the services are working.

Many of these bots are harmless, but there are a few that attempt to hijack his system by injecting malicious attacks or probing for a response. However, Diallo has flipped the script and is now using zip bombs as a way to defend against malware attacks.Diallo says he made a 1MB file that decompresses into 1GB to disable bots trying to break into his system. He also has a 10MB-to-10GB compressed file for bots with more resources, ensuring that their memory is overwhelmed by this massive archive. This is how this defensive bombing system works: when Diallo detects an offending bot, his server returns a 200 OK response and then serves up the zip bomb. If he faces a more advanced scraper with a few gigabytes of memory, he'll feed it the 10GB zip bomb, which will most likely crash it.If you want to try this system for yourself, Diallo outlines how you can create your own bot-targeting zip bomb on his blog. He notes that you should be careful when doing that, though, as you can potentially self-detonate (i.e., accidentally open the zip bomb), and crash your own server. But for most simple bots, this should be more than enough to cause its server to freeze and take it out — at least until its system is restarted.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

TSMC on Wednesday officially started building its third semiconductor facility — Fab 21 phase 3 — near Phoenix, Arizona, according to a report from Bloomberg. The development coincides with rising political pressure on TSMC, as just last week Taiwan's parliament passed a law under which TSMC cannot export its most advanced fabrication process to overseas facilities and must get approval from the Taiwanese government to invest in its projects abroad. By late 2028, TSMC will have started production of chips on its A14 manufacturing process in Taiwan, so it will have the legal right to begin making chips on its N2P, A16, and derivative nodes in the U.S. Construction of TSMC's Fab 21 phase 3 is a part of the company's project to invest $165 billion in its American production facilities, which was announced in March. Although TSMC is investing a huge amount of money in its Fab 21 site — which will eventually house not only six fab modules, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center — and plans to make it one of its major production hubs, it does not look like the contract chipmaker will be legally able to transfer its most advanced production technologies to Fab 21. Lutnick has reportedly indicated that companies may need to deepen their U.S. presence to access federal semiconductor funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, suggesting that subsidies could be withheld from companies who do not meet expectations. However, the U.S. government is also legally bound to provide CHIPS Act funding to companies such as TSMC, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and others through the end of 2026.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

A detailed breakdown of AMD's planned CPU releases has been shared by leakers Olrak and InstLatX64, via VideoCardz. These upcoming products span across the desktop, mobile, and workstation designations. All these will employ the same Zen 5 architecture, and most appear to be refreshes of current offerings. For desktop, or specifically the AM5 platform, AMD is reportedly planning Ryzen 9000G APUs alongside server-grade EPYC 4005 CPUs. According to the leak, the Ryzen 9000G family is based on Gorgon Point, which earlier leaks revealed to be rebadged Strix Point silicon. Last year, AMD introduced Raphael-based EPYC 4004 processors (AM5) for commercial users with enterprise-grade features. Given that manufacturers are already preparing their motherboards for support, we expect these processors will be announced at Computex, alongside Ryzen 9000WX (Shimada Peak) offerings for workstations.We also have another version of Krackan Point (dubbed Krackan2). Krackan2 might enable AMD to expand Zen 5 to a wider range of customers as it should be cheaper to produce, but we aren't sure of the specifications or how cut-down it will be.Following that are several Gorgon Point variations: GorgonPoint1, GorgonPoint2, and GorgonPoint3. Using the never-before-seen FF5 socket, AMD is also allegedly working on a new lineup of mobile offerings dubbed Soundwave. The rumor mill positions this as a low-power, Arm-based device from AMD, employing Radeon graphics. This might be AMD's response to Nvidia's rumored N1X SoCs for the WoA (Windows on Arm) ecosystem. If these SoCs are anywhere near their launch, we'll probably hear more about them at Computex.Finally, as spotted by InstLatX64 at AMD's Technical Information Portal, next-generation Zen 6 based APUs (Medusa Point) will reportedly use the FP10 socket, meaning they won't be compatible with existing designs. Following AMD's typical two-year cadence, Zen 6 should be announced by Q3 - Q4 2026, so we might see these APUs spring up at CES 2027 or later.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duolingo is introducing 148 new language courses that were created with generative AI, the company announced on Wednesday. The launch comes as Duolingo has been facing backlash this week after sharing that it was going to replace contractors with AI and become an “AI-first” company. “This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners. This launch reflects the incredible impact of our AI and automation investments, which have allowed us to scale at unprecedented speed and quality.” While Duolingo is touting its use of AI, the company is facing backlash from users who are disheartened by its plans to use the technology to replace workers and use it more deeply in its app. On Monday, von Ahn told staff in an email that the company was shifting to AI and that it would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.” He also wrote that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.” “Al isn't just a productivity boost,” he wrote. As for the new language courses, Duolingo says they are primarily designed to support beginner levels. Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Twin Peaks: The Return hit Showtime in 2017, there was one very poignant presence tucked amid all the signature David Lynch style and weirdness. It wouldn't be a true Twin Peaks revival without the Log Lady, and Catherine E. Coulson—whose portrayal of the enigmatic character made her a cult-beloved icon—got to play her one last time before her death from cancer in 2015. Richard Green's new documentary, I Know Catherine, The Log Lady, reveals just what went into creating that final performance while also celebrating the life and career of a woman David Lynch called “one of my dearest, closest friends.” With Lynch himself now having departed, there's an extra layer of melancholy woven into the documentary, though he looks in perfect health here as he looks back on his longstanding relationship with Coulson. Coulson, who'd met Nance when they were both part of the late-1960s theater scene in San Francisco, shot a role that didn't make it into the final film, but she mostly worked behind the scenes, building skills that led to a career as a camera assistant on films like Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Though she was a talented behind-the-scenes craftsperson, performing was clearly Coulson's first love, and I Know Catherine follows her career trajectory to the role she became most famous for, as well as beyond that as she continued acting, mostly on stage. Throughout, it incorporates stories from her friends and colleagues as Coulson's health began to get worse; they all marvel at the amount of drive and energy she managed to hold onto until the very end. Though I Know Catherine makes clear that there was a lot more to her than the Log Lady, Twin Peaks is still a big part of Coulson's story, and cast mates including Kyle MacLachlan appear to reminisce about the spirit she brought to the production. “She loved the joy it brought to people,” one associate remembers, and she was pleased when Lynch's offbeat ABC soap opera became a TV sensation. Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost also pops up to talk more about what Coulson brought to the character—who everyone agrees was nothing like Coulson in real life—and why the Log Lady resonated so strongly with fans. A mix of humor and seriousness, the Log Lady (real name: Margaret Lanterman; she was a character Lynch had been pondering since the Eraserhead era) was a person everyone in Twin Peaks took very seriously despite her oddities. As Frost explains, she was respected, a little bit feared, and if her log had something to say to you, it was understood that you would listen. Coulson conveyed all of that in her measured performance, and as a result the Log Lady made a big impact every time she was onscreen. (Lynch, who was on location filming the series, directed her over Skype.) David Lynch fans—Twin Peaks fans in particular—won't want to miss this heartfelt doc, an exceptionally intimate portrait of Coulson's life story constructed by some of the people who knew and loved her best. I Know Catherine, The Log Lady opens in NYC May 1 and in Los Angeles May 9; you can find a list of screenings at various theaters nationwide here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joby successfully flew one of its six-rotor aircraft from vertical hover to horizontal cruise flight and back again with a pilot onboard, showcasing the aircraft's versatility in the air—a key value proposition of Joby's sleek, electrically powered design. The test flight took place on April 22 at the company's facility in Marina, California, and was piloted by James “Buddy” Denham, Joby's chief test pilot. Denham is no stranger to envelope-pushing aircraft—he previously helped design flight control systems for the F-35B fighter jet. But the recent aircraft, called N544JX, is designed to be an air taxi, not a fighter jet. The electric aircraft makes vertical lift-offs and landings (eVTOL), allowing it to fly to and land in dense urban centers or places otherwise devoid of runways. “Designing and flying an aircraft that can seamlessly transition between vertical and cruise flight has long been considered one of the most challenging technological feats in aerospace,” said Denham in the Joby release. “The aircraft flew exactly as expected, with excellent handling qualities and low pilot workload.” The company has completed 40,000 miles (64,374 km) of test flights to date and hundreds of transitions from the aircraft's vertical takeoff to its cruise flight position. Joby's fleet of five electric air taxis is routinely performing piloted vertical-to-cruise transitions, most recently completing the full flight cycle from horizontal cruise to vertical landing under pilot control. But there's a long road ahead towards type inspection authorization (TIA) flight testing with FAA pilots aboard the craft. TIA testing is one of the final steps in certifying the aircraft to hold commercial passengers, and crucially checks whether the aircraft is up to snuff in terms of performance and safety metrics. The company still has some testing hurdles to clear, including a foray into the Middle East, but Joby's unique-looking air taxis may make their way into America's skyways very soon.

Intel is testing a new way to tackle the growing heat output of its power hungry chips. At its recent Foundry Direct Connect event, the company showcased an experimental package-level water cooling solution designed to more efficiently cool CPUs . Intel has working prototypes for both LGA (Land Grid Array) and BGA (Ball Grid Array) CPUs, with demos using Intel's Core Ultra as well as Xeon server processors. Intel claims the system can dissipate up to 1,000 watts of heat using standard liquid cooling fluid. That kind of thermal load isn't typical for consumer CPUs, but it could be relevant for high-end AI (Artificial Intelligence) workloads, HPC (High Performance Computing), and workstation applications. The cooling assembly is also said to make use of solder or liquid metal TIM (Thermal Interface Material), which is said to offer better contact than polymer based TIM. The company has reportedly been working on this technology for years. With rising thermal demands from modern chip designs, Intel is now exploring how to produce this system for real-world deployment. While Intel refines its prototype, the enthusiast community is already experimenting with similar concepts. YouTuber octppus recently modified the heatspreader of an Intel Core i9-14900KS, machining it into a functioning miniature water block. With internal channels carved into the IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) and sealed under acrylic, the mod somewhat mirrors Intel's concept in DIY fashion. Intel hasn't confirmed when or if this cooling approach will hit mainstream products, but the demonstration is critical for CPU thermal design. As power consumption and package density increase, direct cooling may become a necessity for both professional and enthusiast hardware in the coming future.

Greg Ernst, CVP of Intel's sales and marketing division, will step in as interim leader, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Christoph has worked tirelessly on behalf of our customers during his time with Intel and we are grateful for his many contributions to our business,” the spokesperson said. Schell's departure comes as Intel undergoes a dramatic transformation under recently appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan. He also appointed a new AI chief and plans to greatly reduce the company's workforce. Earlier this month, Tan mandated four days in the office for all employees (the company had previously allowed some hybrid and remote work), and announced that Intel wouldn't spin off its Intel Capital corporate VC arm as previously planned.

The fact that a major company like Microsoft relies so much on AI underlines how this technology is revolutionizing software development. Still, it also draws attention to the growing unease and uncertainty experienced by fresh software developers. Almost every company uses Artificial Intelligence to a certain extent. As it stands, AI is mostly there to power repetitive, data-heavy, and predictable tasks, which would yield a noticeable gain to corporate efficiency by cutting down on entry-level jobs. While it is true that AI-generated code has improved significantly over the recent years, it still requires senior developer oversight to ensure the production environment doesn't go haywire. Mark and Satya spent part of their discussion detailing each company's AI adoption scale. AI generates one-third of the code in Microsoft's repositories and projects. The Meta CEO didn't provide an exact figure, but did outline plans for a future AI model to build and create future iterations of their Llama AI models. Microsoft is seeing better results with AI-generated Python code than C++, remarked Satya Nadella. There are several good reasons, including Python's simpler syntax, dynamic typing style, error handling, and memory management, since C/C++ don't natively feature a garbage collector. You probably wouldn't want AI to be writing the next major Windows update. Though the future is hard to predict, this percentage will probably change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump keeps talking about how his policies will supposedly bring manufacturing jobs to the United States. But Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, keeps accidentally admitting those jobs are going to be done by robots. Lutnick was asked about his previous comments on CNBC Tuesday during an interview where the secretary tried to downplay the harm Trump's tariffs are already causing. CNBC host Brian Sullivan pointed out that Lutnick was “taking a lot of guff” about his “robot comments.” I mean, it's a serious question,” Sullivan said. Lutnick said that the factory being built behind them by TSMC would have plenty of jobs for workers. They all need a technician to fix them. They need the air conditioning system to fix them. And then Lutnick seemed to suggest that generation upon generation of people would work in these factories, the kind of idea that seemed antithetical to what's commonly called the American Dream. This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here. Typically, the American Dream involved parents working hard so that their children could have some social mobility, achieving greater wealth than the previous generation. But Lutnick's idea of a permanent underclass is pretty common among the ruling class, even if it's rarely articulated so bluntly. Lutnick first got a lot of flack back in February after repeatedly saying that jobs would be coming back to the U.S. but characterizing it as something that would only allow American workers to either “screw little screws” or complete menial tasks. Lutnick also suggested robots would be doing most of the work. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can't those be made with robotics in America?” Lutnick told CNBC earlier this month. “And you know what President Trump has said? Lutnick also claimed on Tuesday that Apple CEO Tim Cook wanted to bring jobs to the U.S., again emphasizing the role of automation while getting defensive about past comments. “So I talked to Tim Cook the other day. I said, when are you going to bring the iPhone? “When are you going to bring the iPhone? He said, I need to have the robotic arms, right? And the day I see that available, it's coming here because I don't like to employ all these people foreign, that's my biggest risk. What if in China there was a strike?” He's going to build it here,” but didn't provide a timeline. “Americans are going to be the technicians who drive those factories. They're not going to be the ones screwing it in. People just take my statements out of context,” Lutnick said. The Dow rose 300 points after Lutnick appeared on CNBC Tuesday, where he also claimed that a trade deal had been achieved and just needed to be announced. The rumors, as suggested on Fox Business, were that it was a deal with India, but it's not clear whether that was true. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S.-based consumers should have one expectation for the future: your tech will be more expensive. The most obvious culprit is Trump's tariffs, and already prices for TVs, wearables, PC gear, gaming devices, chargers and many more product categories demand more from your wallet than they did a month ago. Companies have made radical changes in their pricing structure without telling customers or even using the word “tariffs.” While big tech tries to keep in President Donald Trump's good graces, the rest of the U.S. is going to pay for it—literally. Some tech brands, such as Acer, have explicitly blamed tariffs for why they increased prices by 10% across the board for their products. Nintendo initially pulled preorders of its Switch 2 earlier this month, citing tariffs. After offering a new preorder date, the company told customers it had raised the price of multiple controllers and other accessories. This year's slate of TVs, such as Sony's Bravia 8 II, now cost $4,000 at 65 inches, when the previous A95L OLED display from 2023 went for $3,500 at launch. Samsung's latest 8K TV, the QN990F, will sell for $6,500 at 75 inches. Last year's QN900D sat at $6,300 for the same size. Even when they're caught raising prices, few companies will use the “T” word out loud, whether that's out of concern for how consumers may react or in an effort to not catch the ire of America's capricious chief executive. On Tuesday, retail giant Amazon was caught in a political firestorm of its own design. Punchbowl News, citing a single anonymous source, suggested Amazon would display the tariff markup on each impacted product. CBS cited data from analytics software maker SmartScout that showed sellers as big as Anker—the maker of popular home gadgets and portable chargers—have raised prices an average of 30% since April 2, aka “Liberation Day.” Unfortunately for buyers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a cushy relationship with Trump. After White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “this is a hostile and political act,” Amazon told Gizmodo the idea for “listing import changes on certain products” was only a consideration for Amazon's Temu and Shein clone, Amazon Haul. The Trump world can live in their imaginary bubble where companies don't increase costs when faced with 145% tariffs from China, but companies themselves are hoping consumers won't notice when prices are jacked up. As compiled by YouTuber Cameron Dougherty, PC accessory maker Logitech increased costs on nearly half of all its most popular gear, like the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse and MX Keys S, whose prices both went up by $20. Its G915 X Lightspeed TKL gaming keyboard went from $200 to $230. Logitech did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment. Smaller brands and companies in more-niche hobbies have been more willing to talk about the impact of tariffs, but others have kept mum. You would be lucky to buy an MSI product in the U.S. currently, and that's a shame considering the handheld just received a performance boost through an update to Intel's ARC 140V integrated GPU. In some cases, prices have gone up by closer to 50%. OnePlus shocked fans of its wearables earlier this month when it took its OnePlus Watch 3 from the expected $330 all the way to $450. Companies may be waiting to learn if Trump eventually backs down from his trade war targeting every landmass on Earth, whether it's occupied by fellow humans or waddling penguins. Many tech companies, like Apple, have already started to reorganize supply chains, moving manufacturing to India and away from countries that were harder hit by Trump tariffs. That costs money, and if every company is raising prices in tandem, we can only expect today's inflated costs to be our new normal. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, the US Department of the Interior announced that it would speed up the approval process for certain fossil fuel projects, proclaiming that environmental analyses that previously would have taken years must now be taken down to, at maximum, a month. While the new procedures are seemingly a gift to the industry, this may actually be terrible news for pipeline developers, drillers, and miners. “If I were a developer of any of these projects, I would look at this order and smack my forehead,” says Sam Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, the United States' biggest environmental nonprofit law organization. The new procedures use President Donald Trump's “national energy emergency,” proclaimed in an executive order in the first week of his presidency, to shorten timelines for federal reviews, including environmental reviews and reviews attached to cultural landmarks. Reviews that take into account a project's impact on the environment are particularly truncated under this new policy. Processes that would normally take a year, the Department of the Interior says, must now be completed within just two weeks, while those reviews that might last longer than a year must now be done in under a month. Mass ongoing layoffs inside the federal government—including at Interior, where The Washington Post reported that a quarter of the agency's staff may eventually be cut—means that there may soon be far too few staff to handle reviews that would be near impossible to fulfill even in normal circumstances. The good news is that it's all so manifestly illegal that virtually anything they do under these new legal procedures will be ripe for a legal challenge.” These fast-forwarded processes are tied to a part of NEPA that states that agencies can bypass environmental reviews in case of an emergency. Ryan Hathaway, who worked on NEPA-related issues within Interior for more than a decade, says that this emergency justification has been used in the past for concrete events that pose an immediate threat to health and public safety, like wildfires or floods, with specific actions that needed to be taken—rather than a vague and open-ended energy “emergency.” It's clear these new rules are exclusively a gift to extractive industries like drilling and mining. Solar and wind projects—which the administration has repeatedly attacked, withdrawing leases for offshore wind and ordering a construction halt on projects already underway—are notably absent from the list of projects allowed to undergo accelerated timelines. But ironically, these orders are only contributing to an increasingly uncertain environment for fossil fuel producers under the new Trump administration. After prices bottomed out during the pandemic, investors became more careful about unrestrained production. It's Wall Street,” says Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, DC. Despite President Joe Biden's climate focus, the US oil and gas industry became the world's biggest crude oil producer in 2023, and reached a record high of producing 13.4 million barrels per day late last year. There cannot be ‘US energy dominance' and $50 per barrel oil; those two statements are contradictory.” "'Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” another wrote. Meanwhile, Interior is also reportedly assembling a list of fossil fuel deposits on public lands that it plans to open up for production. Like the accelerated timelines for environmental permitting, these gifts come with significant strings attached. And while opening up public lands to drilling may sound like an industry wish-list item, companies faced with an uncertain American regulatory environment—from the looming threat of tariffs, to accelerated permitting timelines that could get projects held up in court, to promises made under a Republican administration that may be withdrawn the next time a Democrat is president—may not want to invest years and capital in starting up a project in a risky area. “For more than a century, energy companies have looked at projects in part based on the host country's political risk, but the United States wasn't on that list,” Seigle says.
