                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a troubling trend for Juventus. Could this summer be their return to the top? Led by U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie and winger Tim Weah, Juve have a lot of hills to climb. On their third manager since last spring, the Italian club aren't flourishing. They can't seem to find a consistent striker to lead their line, multiple formations have been used amid different coaching philosophies and despite having a plethora of attacking options, they're not scoring at winning rate. They always manage to impress at some point. The Club World Cup could present them with a sort of reset button. And if they manage to do so? Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field. Next up is Juventus, with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the Italian side at the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Women's Champions League final is set: two-time defending champs Barcelona will take on Arsenal at Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon on May 24. Barcelona flat-out embarrassed Chelsea, advancing to the final after an 8-2 aggregate win. Later, Arsenal shocked Lyon by coming back to beat the French superpower 5-3 on aggregate to clinch a spot in its first UWCL final in 19 years. Under new head coach Sonia Bompastor — the former Lyon manager who took over for Emma Hayes after she left for the U.S. women's national team — had enough weapons. Chelsea didn't have star forwards Sam Kerr or Lauren James, but won the 2025 transfer window by adding defender Naomi Girma and midfielder Keira Walsh (who came from Barcelona). Even so, Bompastor's formidable roster wasn't enough to overtake the inevitable Barça. The Gunners also made some quality additions during the January window, including USWNT defender Jenna Nighswonger and England forward Chloe Kelly. Lyon manager Joe Montemurro, who previously coached Arsenal, described the final result as "unexplainable." Now Arsenal, the only English team that's ever won a Women's Champions League title back in 2007, has a chance to hoist the trophy next month. Staying overseas, USWNT forward Mia Fishel scored her first goal for Chelsea since tearing her ACL in February 2024. Fishel, who had been earning regular national team call-ups at the time of her injury, was angling to contend for a 2024 Olympics roster spot. She's been building back minutes and was invited to the last USWNT camp as a training player. Fishel came on as a substitute in Chelsea's April 23 match vs. Crystal Palace and scored the fourth goal in Chelsea's 4-0 rout. Chelsea is on track to win its sixth consecutive WSL title, sitting six points ahead of Arsenal at the top of the table with three games left. The news was first reported by CBS Sports. The report detailed that NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman sent a letter to U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson on April 1, proposing a Division II league that was "imperative" to the league's growth. According to the report, the NWSL would initially have eight Division I teams affiliated with a Division II team: North Carolina Courage, Kansas City Current, Racing Louisville, NJ/NY Gotham, Orlando Pride, Bay FC, Seattle Reign and the Washington Spirit. The proposal states that ideally, all Division I teams would have a Division II team within the first four years. Similar to the NWSL's Division II proposal, WPSL Pro also aims to be a transitional space for rising talent. There is currently no second-division professional league for women's soccer in the U.S. The USL Super League, which debuted in 2024, was initially going to be a second division until it changed course and has the same Division I designation as the NWSL. These new proposed leagues can only help continue growing the game. Elsewhere, 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and Olympic gold medalist Croix Bethune returned to the Washington Spirit after recovering from a torn meniscus, while Houston Dash goalkeeper Jane Campbell recorded her 40th clean sheet in 1-0 win over the Utah Royals. She previously wrote for Sports Illustrated, USA Today and The Indianapolis Star. She is the author of "Strong Like a Woman," published in spring 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary of Title IX.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White was named MLS Player of the Month for April 2025 on Wednesday. And while he's certainly earned the honor with five goals in league play and seven in all competitions, perhaps he should also send U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino a bottle of wine to say thanks for the confidence boost. And frankly, compared to other strikers in the fold, it was probably a victory for his national team future that he didn't set himself apart in a bad way. (Only Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang could be considered to have had a truly positive impact among the strikers who played in the losses to Panama and Canada) We've seen similar form recently from Diego Luna since his return from the USMNT to Real Salt Lake, where he's scored a pair of braces this month in two RSL victories. Luna's case is slightly different; many USMNT followers actively wanted him in the March camp with the closer-to-full-strength squad after his strong showing with a mostly MLS-based USMNT in Pochettino's January camp. He also likely has a considerably higher ceiling at age 21, compared to the 29-year-old White. Calling up players into a national team with a deliberate intention of boosting confidence can be an extremely delicate matter, and shouldn't be a standard MO when there are other more obvious choices. But Pochettino's masterstroke may have been recognizing the particular situation allowed for it in a way that wouldn't be an undue disservice to other USMNT hopefuls. Injuries to Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun created an obvious opening at center forward. In central midfield, the most disputable omission was probably Leeds United's Brendan Aaronson. But if Pochettino truly went into the Nations League games with the longer view of 2026 in mind, White and Luna's current league form may validate that approach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please note that your preferences are browser specific. The 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup is a matter of weeks away, and one MLS starlet continues to make a case for himself to be heavily involved for Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. Men's National Team. The Argentine's first Gold Cup since taking charge in September, and his last opportunity to test his players in a competitive environment before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the upcoming tournament will also be a valuable opportunity to win back the hearts of fans following two underwhelming losses in the Nations League Finals. One player who came out of the Nations League with something to be proud of was Real Salt Lake attacker Diego Luna. In Salt Lake's most recent game, a 3-1 away win against San Diego FC, Luna made his way to the scoresheet yet again, with his second brace since his March international break. This latest in a string of impressive performances from the four-time international prompted his head coach, Pablo Mastroeni, to laud the young star when speaking with reporters post-game. “I don't think we can talk about Diego developing anymore. Despite this high praise, Luna intends to remain grounded and focused on the process. “For me, it doesn't change what I'm doing on the daily or what I'm trying to do for myself and the career I'm trying to build for myself,” he explained. The former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea boss is soon set to call up his team for their back-to-back friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland on June 7 and 10, before they head to California for their Gold Cup opener on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago. Along with Trinidad and Tobago, the USMNT's Group D also consists of Haiti and guest participants Saudi Arabia, with Pochettino expecting the group to be “difficult.” “We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA,” Pochettino told U.S. Soccer. “It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are. “This is type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did in Los Angeles (at the Nations League Finals).”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of soccer's most revered professional clubs are headed to Seattle in June for a major international event that serves as a dress rehearsal for the men's World Cup coming to North America next year. Once an afterthought on the international soccer calendar, the revamped Club World Cup offers Cascadian fans an opportunity to see their favorite players and teams in a bona fide competition. “It's an opportunity to really spoil ourselves with soccer,” said Craig Waibel, general manager of Seattle Sounders FC. “It is an opportunity to watch some of the top teams in the world not play exhibition games, which has always been a thing that we've digested in America.” The action begins in Seattle on June 15 at 68,700-seat Lumen Field with Sounders FC facing Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro in a Group B stage match. High-profile cases of foreign nationals being arrested at the U.S. border this year have also alarmed potential visitors. Global sports and government leaders are expected to scrutinize the handling of visiting fans, even as U.S. officials have offered assurances over security concerns for this year's tournament and the 2026 World Cup. “We'll bring the world to the United States of America,” said Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. He recently told reporters, “The world will be welcomed.” Tourism Economics, a travel forecasting firm, expects a significant decline in foreign tourists over the summer, which could help explain why tickets for the tournament are still available. Waibel, who also serves as Seattle's chief soccer officer, has found that many people still don't know much about the event. In an incentive to attend the club championships, FIFA officials are offering a ticket package that will guarantee access to the 2026 World Cup. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.” It culminates with the championship on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The challenge increases after facing Botafogo, one of four renowned Brazilian clubs competing. Seattle will play Spanish powerhouse Atletico de Madrid on June 19 before finishing the group stage on June 23 against France's most decorated club, Paris Saint-Germain, which already has won another Ligue 1 title with a month left in the season. “We get to show up, play a little loose and try to be as dangerous as we can.” The Sounders have struggled in their domestic season because of injuries. Participating in the Club World Cup adds wear and tear to a depleted roster, “but it's so worth it from an experience standpoint,” Waibel said. “This could be the one time that we get to do this for some of us as executives, for some of us as players.” Another storied club playing in Seattle is River Plate of Buenos Aires, a team that has been a pipeline to Argentina's No. Los Millonarios will play Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds on June 17 and Italian superclub FC Internazionale, also known as Inter Milan, on June 25. Another game in Seattle on June 21 features Inter Milan against Urawa. Inter Miami earned the host country's lone berth after Messi led his team to the MLS's best regular-season record last year. However, FIFA might hold a play-in game between the MLS's Los Angeles FC and Mexico's Club America to replace Club Leon, which has appealed its removal from the tournament. World Cup organizers placed six games in Seattle next year, including the United States' second match of group play on June 19, 2026. BC Place in Vancouver has secured seven games of the expanded 48-team tournament from June 11 to July 19, 2026. Local Seattle organizers designated Bellingham as one of nine 2026 World Cup “Fan Zones” in the state. Greg Brisbon, the Western Washington men's coach, said both tournaments resonate with local soccer junkies who closely follow international leagues. Getting a chance to see players in Seattle “is such a different lens than watching them on TV,” he added. Waibel described the back-to-back tournaments as once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for fans: “Who knows if a Club World Cup match will ever be played in Seattle again,” he said. All club tournament games are scheduled to be shown for free on DAZN.com, a live-streaming platform.</p>

Brazil's iconic yellow soccer jersey has become such a potent conservative political symbol that many leftists refuse to wear it. Now, rumors the team might don a different color with deep associations to the left at the 2026 World Cup are inflaming the right.

The Brazilian Football Confederation denied that the country's national team would wear red secondary uniforms next year in a statement Tuesday night, a day after the website Footy Headlines reported that the country planned to replace the blue kits that typically complement its more famous yellow shirts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CBF reportedly considering red jersey ahead of World Cup but rightwingers consider the colour anti-patriotic Those claims have sparked predictable outrage among hardcore rightwingers who consider red the anti-patriotic colour of Brazil's leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Workers' party (PT) and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST). “Our team's shirt will never be red – and neither will our country!” thundered Romeu Zema, a conservative governor hoping to claim the mantle of Bolsonaro, who faces jail for allegedly masterminding a failed rightwing coup after losing the 2022 election. Bolsonaro's politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn't red – and it never will be.” Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday in a viral report by the football website Footy Headlines. The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year's World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil's official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed. Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelho said the move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven. Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote. “Red doesn't have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree called pau-brasil (brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century, had red in its first flag. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said. For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil's next manager and a compromising exposé in a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How much will Bundesliga clubs Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund make at the upcoming 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States? The world soccer governing body FIFA had previously communicated that the tournament would include a $1 billion prize pool distributed to the 32 teams. For European clubs like Bayern and Dortmund that would have been €923 million when FIFA made the announcement. The collapse of the US dollar, however, means that the prize pool to be earned by clubs from UEFA has dropped to just €877 million. The prize pool is divided into two categories. While all teams from South America ($15.21 million), Oceania ($3.58 million), and all other confederations ($9.55 million) will receive the same guaranteed amount of money this isn't the case for Europe. According to FIFA, clubs from UEFA, the participation money will vary between $12.81 million and $38.91 million. How does this break down for the two Bundesliga clubs? While Austrian club RB Salzburg is the lowest end of the prize pool available for European clubs. Based on that, kicker have calculated that Manchester City ranks ahead of Real Madrid within UEFA's ranking. Man City will, therefore, receive around $38 million from participating in the tournament. Real Madrid ranks second with $35.8 million. Both clubs have aspirations to go deep in the tournament. The Rekordmeister has been very aggressive in its pursuit to sign Florian Wirtz from competitor Bayer Leverkusen. With Leverkusen expecting €140 million ($160 million) for the player, a deep run at the Club World Cup would help Bayern. But recent results in the Bundesliga have put Dortmund back in the race for a top-four spot. Hence, the tournament could now be a significant financial bonus rather than an insurance policy for Dortmund.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia has presented an interesting offer of 50 million euros per year for Carlo Ancelotti. If Carlo Ancelotti accepts this offer, the coach would have to face Real Madrid. This is because, for the Club World Cup, Al Hilal is one of the teams that will face Madrid to try to win this championship. Having two successful periods with Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti is preparing to end the second one. Despite all the titles he has achieved with Real Madrid, this season ended with his chances of staying at the club. A championship that, while not insignificant, falls quite short of what was desired from Ancelotti and the club this season. Although his farewell is planned to be appropriate for him, Madridists could quickly change their opinion. This is because, if he accepts Al Hilal's offer, he will form a team difficult to overcome for the Club World Cup. His experience at Real Madrid could work against a club that seeks to make history by being the first to win this tournament. With Real Madrid focused on finding their next coach, facing Ancelotti has been quite a surprise. Although Ancelotti is expected to accept being Brazil's coach, Real Madrid must prepare for any occasion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live Fantasy Analysis of the 2025 NFL Draft The Emirati property development company will sponsor Chelsea's shirts for the side's remaining four Premier League games of the campaign, alongside their Conference League semi-final tie against Swedish club Djurgarden and a potential final in the competition. Club sources say a competitive process is continuing for Chelsea's long-term front-of-shirt sponsor, having not had one yet this season, including potentially one covering their participation in this summer's Club World Cup. Chelsea will play at least three group games in the tournament, which is taking place in the United States and will run from June 14 through to July 13. Infinite Athlete only signed up to a one-year deal, worth around £40million ($53.4m) in September 2023 before later agreeing to continue to be on the club's shirt during pre-season. DAMAC will oversee the development Chelsea-branded residences in Dubai, a project costing upwards of £1bn, which is described by the club as “luxury living”. Chelsea's chief operating officer Jason Gannon has said “the collaboration will bring Chelsea to life in Dubai”. Chelsea will point to the fact that DAMAC has signed up to a longer-term commercial partnership which will see club-branded residences in a £1bn development in Dubai. This is the most interesting aspect of the deal, which club officials believe is the first arrangement of its kind, and could potentially unlock a lucrative new revenue stream. In the meantime, the endless questions about Chelsea's lack of a front-of-shirt sponsor will go away, if only for a little while. The club are in talks with multiple companies with a view to shirt sponsorship during the Club World Cup and beyond, and will hope to avoid a repeat of this season's unbranded shirt fronts. Securing qualification for next season's Champions League would help their chances of getting the long-term deal they want considerably.</p>

Rohit, who quit T20Is last year, has witnessed some unmatched highs and traumatic lows in the past one year but, still remains one of the greatest stories in Indian cricket. Taking to social media, the FIFA World Cup collaged a picture of Rohit's T20 World Cup 2024 celebration with that of Lionel Messi during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar to wish the 'Hitman'. FIFA World Cup captioned the post, “Two (emoji of crown). Meanwhile, Indian cricketers, past and present wished Rohit. " Happy birthday Ro, Wish you the very best," KL Rahul posted on his Instagram story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Irvine will be sidelined for at least three months after having surgery on a foot injury suffered when playing for Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Popovic said Irvine's absence was "certainly a blow" for the Socceroos as their hopes of an automatic ticket to the 2026 finals hang in the balance ahead of a home qualifier against Japan (June 5th) and a trip to face Saudi Arabia (June 10th). "He played very well for us in the last (international) window and has been doing very well at St. Pauli," Popovic told Australian media. "We've got an eye on the A-League players that are playing, but we've got a lot of midfielders playing overseas at the moment, getting regular minutes, so we're monitoring everyone. "There's an opportunity for someone to come in." Second in Asia's Group C on 13 points, Australia will qualify directly for the World Cup in North America if they can hold their place. Australia will have a training camp in late-May in Abu Dhabi that will allow staff to assess all the options for the qualifiers. Popovic said an assistant coach would also run the rule over young Italy-based defender Alessandro Circati as he closes in on a return to action for Serie A side Parma following an ACL injury. "Paul Okon will be going to visit him in the next few days to have a really close look at where he's at in terms of his training and to see his level,” Popovic said. "(Circati) feels he's ready, but we have to consider all factors before selecting him."</p>

Jackson Irvine has confirmed he will miss the Socceroos' final two World Cup qualifiers to undergo foot surgery, placing fresh stress on the depth at Tony Popovic's disposal. Irvine backed the Socceroos to get past Japan and Saudi Arabia in crunch qualifiers and seal their passage to next year's World Cup in North America after writing on social media that he would go under the knife. With World Cup qualification now within reach, the Socceroos are still in search of a first-choice number nine. "I have complete confidence that both the teams I love can take the final steps towards our ultimate goals," Irvine posted on Instagram. "I will be watching and supporting alongside our amazing fans every step until the end." We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. It's an even bigger concern for Socceroos boss Popovic, whose side hope to beat the already-qualified Japanese in Perth on June 5 and then conquer the Saudis — their closest challengers for the final automatic spot — in Jeddah on June 11 to reach next year's tournament. The loss of Irvine comes at a time when the Socceroos are already without defensive leader Harry Souttar and wingback Jordan Bos. In the midfield specifically, Massimo Luongo has been overlooked due to a lack of game time at Premier League side Ipswich Town, Aiden O'Neill has recently moved to the MLS with New York City, while Irvine's St Pauli teammate Connor Metcalfe has only just returned from an ankle injury.

The World Cup 26 logo has been controversial with its move to a standardised design (compare with our pick of the best World Cup logos). The artwork for major sports events can often be as memorable as the sporting action (see our pick of the best Olympics posters), so we're always pleased to see more being made of it. Big international events are also a chance for host cities to promote themselves on the world stage, so it makes sense for each to have a design showcasing its culture. Euro 2024 took a step in this direction with artwork for each host city. FIFA's World Cup 26 designs go further giving each host city a full-size poster illustrated by a local artist, from Dave Murray's Cassandre-esque cubist piece (Toronto) to Matt Cliff's bicycle kicking cowboy (Dallas) and a vibrant mix of symbolism from illustrator Mario Cortés, AKA Cuemanche, (all three posters for Mexico's host cities). Houston's poster features an astronaut playing keepy uppy, and Boston's stars a giant lobster flicking the ball with its tail. Meanwhile, Miami is unmistakable with its pink hues, flamingo and palm trees. Each design seeks to capture the landmarks, cultural identity and distinctive characteristics of these cities, integrating iconic elements that represent them while showing a shared passion for the artistry of football.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool may be the new champion of England, but that won't be enough to give it a shot at being crowned the world champion this summer. Having secured a 20th league title, the Reds are now back on their perch, as Sir Alex Ferguson would say, after going back level with Manchester United's tally. And, no matter what Rio Ferdinand says, there can be no debate now about who the most successful team in England is, with Liverpool's next task being to go beyond its Old Trafford rival once again. Despite boasting more silverware than any other team in England, Liverpool won't be traveling to the United States to represent the Premier League in this summer's revamped Club World Cup. FIFA's expanded tournament gets its first run-out in June, with 32 teams from the six continental confederations set to battle it out to be crowned champions of the world. As you may have noticed though, that criteria doesn't cover every club. In fact, it only applies to three of the 16 teams from UEFA. Additional places are determined by a club ranking over the four-year period, with FIFA imposing a two-team-per-nation rule, hence why Liverpool misses out despite reaching the 2022 Champions League final. In truth though, Liverpool shouldn't be too disappointed with its snub by FIFA. One of his current squad could be involved in the US though, with Real Madrid reportedly hoping to have Trent Alexander-Arnold available for the tournament - assuming he doesn't choose to extend his stay at Anfield.</p>
