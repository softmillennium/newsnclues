The law “cannot create a healthy home environment where one doesn't already exist,” an abortion advocacy group noted.

A federal judge has placed a temporary injunction on an anti-abortion law in Nevada that requires parental notification before a minor can obtain the procedure.

Abortion rights advocates oppose notification or permission abortion laws for minors, noting that they can pose a danger to those who have difficult home lives with their parents or guardians.

The Nevada law was passed in 1985 but has never been enforced, as it was immediately challenged and deemed unlawful due to precedents established by Roe v. Wade. However, after Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022, the 1985 law was deemed enforceable, and was set to go into effect this month.

Planned Parenthood of Nevada filed a challenge to the law, arguing that it is “unconstitutionally vague.” Responding to that challenge last week, U.S. District Judge Anne Traum placed a temporary hold on the law. Traum also told Planned Parenthood that if they wanted to extend the block beyond April, they would need to file another brief to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Parental notification or permission laws exist in around three-quarters of U.S. states. Nevada's law allows a minor who wants an abortion to obtain a “judicial bypass” from a judge if they worry about their safety due to their parents' potential reactions. But such exemptions come with obstacles that render them almost meaningless, including transportation barriers and minors not knowing about the bypass or how to obtain one. Judges with anti-abortion biases can also ignore safety concerns and simply say “no” to minors seeking an exemption.

Several health organizations are opposed to parental notification laws, including the American Medical Association, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and more, according to Advocates for Youth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting sexual health rights for minors.

“Parental involvement laws often delay young people's abortion care, leading to costlier, later-term abortion procedures,” the group noted on its website.

Other abortion rights advocates in the state say enforcement of the law is redundant and ineffective.

“Most minors already consult their parents beforehand” if they're seeking an abortion, Wild West Action Fund said in a Facebook post, adding that, “for many others, abuse incest, safety threats and a myriad of other concerns keep them from disclosing their abortion.”

“Minors are capable of making these decisions for their own bodies and futures,” the organization added. “Parental notification will not and can not create a healthy home environment where one doesn't already exist.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

US homeland security secretary said Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador ‘not under our control'

Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said that if Kilmar Ábrego García was sent back to the US, the Donald Trump administration “would immediately deport him again”.

Noem repeated White House assertions about Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported from Maryland last month, in a new interview with CBS.

“[Ábrego García] is not under our control. He is an El Salvador citizen. He is home there in his country. If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again,” Noem said of the 29-year-old who entered the US illegally around 2011 after fleeing gang violence.

Ábrego García was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. Despite the order, on 15 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials deported Ábrego García to El Salvador where he was held in the Center for Terrorism Confinement, a controversial mega-prison.

Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego García's deportation was an “administrative error”, it has repeatedly cast him as an MS-13 gang member on television – a claim his wife, a US citizen, and his attorneys staunchly reject. Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US, according to court documents.

Since Ábrego García's deportation, the Trump administration has refused to bring him back to the US – despite the supreme court unanimously ordering it to “facilitate” his release. Trump officials claim that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because Ábrego García is a Salvadorian national and no longer in the US.

Noem asserted the Trump administration's claims to CBS, saying: “President Trump and his administration has adhered to the court and respects the court and its decision,” adding, “This individual is not under the United States of America's jurisdiction and he is not one of our citizens. He is home in his home country. And that's up to that country to decide what to do.”

Last week, a federal judge accused the White House of “bad faith” in the case, arguing that “defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court's orders”.

Yet, Noem maintains that the Trump administration spends “hours and hours” building cases against alleged gang members.

Upon being asked about the administration's claims against individuals who have been deported without due process, the homeland security secretary said: “Obviously, we're relying on the expertise of our investigators, our teams, double-checking, triple-checking, going through the paperwork, making sure that we have done everything absolutely correctly.”

Noem also accused federal judges who have issued court orders the Trump administration dislikes as “activist judges”.

“I'm sure that these judges will continue to challenge every single thing that this administration does. We have several activist judges across the country,” she said, despite some of the judges who have ruled against Trump's immigration policies being nominated by Republicans.

Earlier this month, J Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan-appointee and conservative appellate judge, called the Trump administration's claims in Ábrego García's case “shocking”, saying: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”

Vietnamese and US descendants of those exposed to Agent Orange continue to face diseases and congenital anomalies.

Today marks 50 years since the end of the U.S. War in Vietnam, which killed an estimated 3.3 million Vietnamese people, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians, tens of thousands of Laotians and more than 58,000 U.S. service members. But for many Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian people; Vietnamese Americans; and U.S. Vietnam veterans and their descendants, the impacts of the war never ended. They continue to suffer the devastating consequences of Agent Orange, an herbicide mixture used by the U.S. military that contained dioxin, the deadliest chemical known to humankind.

The United States used Agent Orange as a weapon of war. From 1961-1971, the U.S. military sprayed toxins that contained large quantities of dioxin in order to destroy food supplies and improve visibility for the U.S. military by killing broad swathes of vegetation throughout southern Vietnam. As a result, many people have been born with congenital anomalies in the formation of the spinal cord, limbs, heart, palate, and more. This remains the largest deployment of herbicidal warfare in history.

In the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the Nixon administration promised to contribute $3 billion for compensation and postwar reconstruction of Vietnam. But that promise remains unfulfilled. Although the U.S. has funded the cleanup of two of the largest dioxin-contaminated “hotspots” and there has been some remuneration for U.S. veterans, there has been none for the Vietnamese people, the intended victims of the deadly spraying.

In order to achieve justice for Agent Orange victims, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) introduced a legislative package on April 28. The Agent Orange Relief Act of 2025 provides for medical care and related assistance for Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange; provides additional environmental remediation for hotspots; and orders a health assessment and assistance to affected Vietnamese American communities.

Tlaib also introduced The Victims of Agent Orange Act of 2025, which provides benefits for children of male U.S. veterans who served in Vietnam affected by congenital anomalies; these children are unprotected by current law, which only covers congenital anomalies for children of women veterans. The bill also supports greater research into Agent Orange-related health issues and directs a health assessment and provision of assistance for affected Vietnamese American communities.

“Together, these two bills serve as an act of repair for the profound harms caused by the United States' use of Agent Orange and other herbicides. Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect the lives of American veterans, Vietnamese people, Vietnamese Americans, and their children,” Tlaib stated in a press release. “The lives of many victims are cut short, and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, which are often untreated or unrecognized. As we mark 50 years after the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam, it is time to meet our moral and legal obligations to heal the wounds inflicted by these atrocities.”

Many continue to suffer the devastating consequences of Agent Orange, an herbicide mixture used by the U.S. military that contained dioxin, the deadliest chemical known to humankind.

The legislative package is co-sponsored by Representatives André Carson (D-Indiana), Sarah McBride (D-Delaware), Jerry Nadler (D-New York), Lateefah Simon (D-California) and Shri Thanedar (D-Michigan). The bills are endorsed by the Quincy Institute, Veterans For Peace, Vietnam Agent Orange Relief & Responsibility Campaign (VAORRC), CommonDefense.us, Minnesota Peace Project and Action Corps.

Tlaib told Truthout, “For there to be any justice for the war crimes committed in Vietnam, the United States must devote itself to repair: by cleaning these ongoing Agent Orange contamination sites, investing in the medical care of those affected, and removing unexploded ordnance.”

VAORRC, for which I serve as co-coordinator, assisted Tlaib in drafting the bills. In the congresswoman's press release, Susan Schnall and Ngo Thanh Nhan, also co-coordinators of VAORRC, thanked Tlaib for introducing this important legislation.

Schnall, president of Veterans For Peace, said:

The United States government used Agent Orange as an instrument of war from 1961-1971 on Vietnam, its people, and American soldiers on the ground. As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Vietnam, we celebrate these two pieces of legislation that promote healing for the American people and the Vietnamese people harmed, and cleanup of the contaminated land in Vietnam.

Ngo stated: “The Southeast Asian communities have victims of Agent Orange and were invisible to the public so far. These are very important acts for our communities in the U.S. to support and it takes great courage for Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib to show this example of solidarity.”

Between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian people, and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin during the spraying operations. Many other Vietnamese people were or continue to be exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin through contact with the environment and food that was contaminated. Many offspring of those who were exposed have congenital anomalies, developmental disabilities, and other diseases. Second, third and fourth generation victims continue to suffer.

The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes 19 diseases and illnesses to be associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the U.S. military in Vietnam. They include AL Amyloidosis, bladder cancer, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure (hypertension), Hodgkin's disease, hypothyroidism, ischemic heart disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, acute and sub-acute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers and soft-tissue sarcomas.

In 2009, I served as one of seven judges from three continents on the International Peoples' Tribunal of Conscience in Support of the Vietnamese Victims of Agent Orange in Paris. The panel heard two days of testimony from 27 witnesses, including Vietnamese and U.S. veteran victims, journalists and scientists. Some had visible disabilities due to their exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin.

Mai Giang Vu, who was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the Army of South Vietnam, carried barrels of the chemicals in the jungle. His sons were unable to walk or function normally. Their limbs “curled up” and they could only crawl. By the age of 18, they were bedridden. One died at age 23, the other at 25.

Between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian people, and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin during the spraying operations.

Nga Tran is a French Vietnamese woman who worked in Vietnam as a war correspondent. She was there when the U.S. military began spraying chemical defoliants and a large cloud of the agent enveloped her. Shortly after her daughter was born, the child's skin began shedding. She could not tolerate physical contact with anyone. The child never grew. She remained 6.6 pounds – her birth weight – until she died at age 17 months. Tran's second daughter suffers from alpha thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder rarely seen in Asia. Tran saw a woman who gave birth to a “ball” with no human form. Many children are born without brains; others make inhuman sounds. There are victims who have never stood up. They creep and barely lift their heads.

Rosemarie Hohn Mizo is the widow of George Mizo who served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. After refusing to serve a third tour, Mizo was court-martialed, received a dishonorable discharge and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. Before his death from Agent Orange-related maladies, Mizo helped found the Friendship Village where Vietnamese victims live in a supportive environment.

Jeanne Stellman, who wrote the seminal Agent Orange article in Nature, testified that “This is the largest unstudied [unnatural] environmental disaster in the world.”

Although a Biometrics study from 1965 showed that dioxin caused many congenital anomalies in animal experiments, the U.S. military suppressed those findings. The results of the study were leaked in 1969 but the spraying of Agent Orange continued until 1971.

The tribunal found that “The damages caused to the land and forests, water supply, and communities and the ecosystems can legitimately be called an ecocide, as the forests and jungles in large parts of southern Vietnam have been devastated and denuded, and may either never grow back or take 50 to 200 years to regenerate.”

In 2004, U.S. veteran and Vietnamese victims sued the chemical companies that knowingly manufactured Agent Orange and other herbicides, which they knew contained a lethal amount of dioxin. The victims were prohibited from suing the U.S. government because of sovereign immunity. Despite agreeing to compensate U.S. veterans in an earlier lawsuit for some illnesses caused by their exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides, the U.S. government and the chemical companies claimed before the courts, and to this day, that no evidence supports a connection between exposure and disease.

Efforts by veterans' groups and others to take care of U.S. vets produced a compensation scheme administered by the Veterans Administration. It annually pays out billions of dollars to veterans who can demonstrate that they were in a contaminated part of Vietnam and have an illness associated with Agent Orange exposure.

Shamefully, the Vietnamese people who were exposed to Agent Orange on a scale unheard of in modern warfare have been denied recompense.

After the 2009 Paris tribunal, while I was president of the National Lawyers Guild, I participated in a delegation to Vietnam to present our findings to President Nguyen Minh Triet. I told him I was baffled that even as U.S. bombs were falling on the Vietnamese people, they made a distinction between the U.S. government and the American people. The president responded, “We fought the forces of aggression, but we always reserved our love for the people of America … because we knew they always supported us.” He was referring to the powerful U.S. antiwar movement in which I was a proud participant.

The United States and Vietnam normalized relations 30 years ago following a 19-year trade embargo on the latter. “It's taken decades to build the current level of mutual trust and cooperation between the United States and Vietnam,” George Black, author of The Long Reckoning, an examination of U.S.-Vietnam relations since the war, told The New York Times. “And the whole process has been underpinned by our willingness to deal with the worst humanitarian legacies.”

But Donald Trump has started a new war on Vietnam, a tariff war, imposing a 46 percent tariff rate (temporarily on hold as the two countries “negotiate”). The U.S. and Vietnam conduct $160 billion in annual commerce. And while the Vietnamese people commemorate 50 years since the end of the American war in their country, the Trump administration has ordered its senior diplomats in Vietnam to avoid participation in the commemoration events.

Just compensation for victims of Agent Orange is a moral imperative. People who support Tlaib's legislation should contact their congressional representatives and urge them to sign on as additional co-sponsors.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Trump has demanded prosecutions against outlets that have published his low polling numbers, calling media “the enemy.”

New polling demonstrates that most voters see President Donald Trump as a dangerous politician and view his leadership style as dictatorial.

In Truth Social posts earlier this week, Trump seemed to confirm that point of view, expressing disdain for the press and demanding firings at news companies that published data showcasing voters' negative views of his presidency 100 days into his second term.

In a post on Monday, Trump called such surveys “FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS,” citing longtime conservative pollster John McLaughlin, who has described polls showing Trump's negative approval ratings as fraudulent. (Notably, McLaughin has counted the president among his clients, including during the 2024 presidential campaign.)

Trump further claimed that the surveys were weighted wrongly and did not include enough Republican voters — something that would be tough to replicate across multiple polls consistently showing majority disapproval among voters. He then demanded disciplinary action against those media organizations, including criminal inquiries. 

“These people should be investigated for ELECTION FRAUD,” Trump wrote in his post, referring to the press as “Negative Criminals.”

“They suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome, and there is nothing that anyone, or anything, can do about it,” Trump added, before calling media “THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” — an epithet he frequently hurls against journalists who publish factual reporting on him and his policies.

Numbers from a PRRI survey published last week demonstrate that most voters view the president's behavior as alarming.

The poll gave respondents two options to choose from, asking whether they believe Trump is a “strong leader who should be given the power he needs to restore America's greatness,” or “a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” Only 44 percent viewed him as a “strong leader,” while a majority of respondents, 52 percent, called him a “dictator” who posed a threat to the country's democratic norms.

Even a significant percentage of the president's own base said Trump was dangerous, with more than one in six Republican voters (17 percent) describing him as a dangerous dictator.

The poll also showed that voters are opposed to Trump theoretically expanding presidential power. Seventy-seven percent of respondents said Trump should not suspend the midterms in 2026 if he is unable to “get our country out of crisis in the next year,” while just 17 percent said he should take such an action. And only 20 percent believed that, “because things have gotten so far off track, we need a president who is willing to break some laws if that's what it takes to save the country,” while 76 percent of respondents disagreed with that viewpoint.

Despite his dismal 100-day polling numbers, Trump suggested to a crowd of his supporters in Michigan on Tuesday that he would continue to impose his far right agenda, even if it meant disregarding judicial rulings against his executive actions.

“Nothing will stop me,” Trump told his loyalists.

            Wildfires raging near Jerusalem forced evacuations in several areas and led to several major road closures on Wednesday, as firefighters struggle to contain the flames amid dry conditions and high winds.
    


            Israel is seeking international assistance to fight the fires, as the defense minister says the country is “in a time of national emergency.”
    


            “This is perhaps the largest fire ever in the country,” Jerusalem District Fire Department Commander Shmulik Friedman told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He warned that winds in excess of 60 miles an hour are expected “in the near future,” dramatically increasing the risk of the fires.
    


            The fire forced authorities to close Route 1, the major road connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Wednesday – Israel's Memorial Day.
    


            Videos from social media show people walking along the highway with thick smoke filling the air.
    


            Hours later, emergency workers ran amongst long lines of abandoned cars on the highway, looking for anyone who may still be in their cars, according to a video from United Hatzalah, an emergency response organization.
    


            “We don't know at this time what caused the fire. We don't have even a bit of a clue. We are still not dealing with it,” Friedman said. “We are far from control.”
    


            The fire is active on multiple fronts, authorities said, with one area concentrated around the town of Neve Shalom, located about 15 miles west of Jerusalem. In one clip, the flames can be seen next to the road along a packed section of highway.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar held a marathon of talks with other countries to bring in firefighting aircraft, according to his office, particularly nearby countries in Europe. Three aircraft from Italy and Macedonia will arrive “as soon as possible,” the National Security Council said in a statement.
    


            At least ten communities in the area have been evacuated, authorities said.
    


            “We are in a time of national emergency, and all available forces must be mobilized to save lives and bring the fires under control,” said Defense Minister Israel Katz Wednesday.
    


            There are about 120 teams fighting the fire, Israel's Fire and Rescue Services said, as well as 12 firefighting aircraft and helicopters.
    


            More than a dozen people have arrived at two separate hospitals as a result of the fire, according to Shamir Medical Center and Kaplan Medical Center.
    


            Meanwhile, Hadassah Medical Center on the outskirts of Jerusalem asked the public not to come to the hospital “unless absolutely necessary.” The hospital has begun evacuating patients who do not need to be hospitalized, even as it prepares to accept new patients who may have suffered injuries in the fires.
    


            The fire is in approximately the same location as a similar blaze last week.

Russia can mobilize for war on a scale comparable to the Soviet Union during World War II if necessary, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 30.

"If a great country needs to stand up, it will stand up at any moment. No one can have any doubts," Peskov said during a lecture at the Victory Museum in Moscow.

He claimed that "millions" of Russians are already assisting the military effort against Ukraine by collecting aid, sending equipment and ammunition to the front line with personal funds, and weaving camouflage nets.

"Somewhere around 30 million Soviet people... gave their lives in the fight against fascism," he added.

Peskov's comments come as Russian authorities recruit 30,000 to 40,000 people into the army each month, sources familiar with U.S. and EU intelligence told the Wall Street Journal. 

Instead of formal conscription, the Kremlin has leaned on financial incentives and aggressive recruitment campaigns to fill its ranks, including offering lucrative contracts to volunteers.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin has avoided another large-scale draft following the unpopular 2022 partial mobilization that triggered the exodus of over 261,000 Russians, military leaders are reportedly pressuring the Kremlin to initiate a broader draft. 

The current recruitment pace is sufficient to cover Russia's reported frontline losses, which NATO estimates at roughly 1,000 troops daily. Ukraine's General Staff said on April 30 that Russia has lost 951,960 troops since launching its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

Deputy Chairman of Russia's State Duma Defense Committee Alexei Zhuravlev said in January that a larger mobilization may be necessary in preparation for potential conflict with Western nations within the next three to four years. 

"It is necessary to prepare the male population and, naturally, to defend the homeland. We should talk about it and not be shy about it," Zhuravlev said.

Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told LB.ua on April 9 that Russia could mobilize up to 5 million trained reservists, with a total potential capacity of 20 million people.

On March 31, Putin ordered the regular spring conscription of 160,000 men — Russia's largest conscription call in 14 years. Though conscripts are formally barred from frontline combat, many are indirectly drawn into the war through various recruitment methods.

A federal judge ruled on April 29 that the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) must disburse the funding appropriated by Congress to the nonprofit news organization Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

Lamberth said the plaintiff had shown it would suffer irreparable harm absent a restraining order, noting that USAGM's actions to terminate the grants agreement “threaten the very existence” of the group.

The judge also stated that Radio Free Europe is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that USAGM had violated the Administrative Procedure Act by terminating the grants agreement.

Lamberth said the Trump administration must seek congressional approval to take such action, noting that it “has no residual constitutional power to refuse” to spend appropriations by Congress.

“It is, after all, Congress that makes the laws in this country. In this case, for example, it was Congress who ordained that the monies at issue should be allocated to RFE/RL,” Lamberth stated, referring to the acronym for Radio Free Europe.

The judge also determined that USAGM's decision to change the grant agreement after the start of the fiscal year was “arbitrary and capricious.”

According to the court order, USAGM presented “a radically different grant agreement” in mid-April, leaving little time for a meaningful negotiation as Radio Free Europe was running out of funding.

“If our nation is to thrive for another 250 years, each co-equal branch of government must be willing to courageously exert the authority entrusted to it by our Founders,” Lamberth stated.

The cutbacks affect the organizations and agencies under its umbrella, including Voice of America (VOA); the Office of Cuba Broadcasting; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and other organizations such as Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.

The organization filed a lawsuit against USAGM on March 18 and subsequently sought a temporary restraining order to block the funding cancellation.

Stephen Capus, president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, welcomed the ruling and said that they hope to receive the funding quickly. Capus said the group had to furlough staff and scale back some of its programming due to the funding cut.

The Epoch Times reached out to USAGM for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.

Cecot, a secretive 40,000-capacity facility built to house alleged gang members, ‘is meant for permanent exile, permanent punishment'

“Don't stop,” said the local in the backseat. “Just slow down and you'll see it.”

Soldiers watched the vehicle as it passed the turn-off and the checkpoint. Then a white building flashed through a gap in the trees, a few kilometres from the road.

Without permission from the government, that is as close as anyone can get to the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot), the prison at the core of relations between El Salvador and the US.

President Nayib Bukele bills the prison as the biggest in the Americas, capable of holding 40,000 people, and specifically members of MS-13 and Barrio 18, the two gangs that brutalised Salvadorian society for decades.

It is also where the Trump administration has paid to send 238 Venezuelan migrants, and a black hole from which no information escapes – except for what the Salvadorian government chooses to reveal. The Guardian requested to visit but received no response.

“It's like Guantánamo on steroids,” said Juan Pappier, Human Rights Watch's deputy director for the Americas. “These people are outside the US, in a country with no separation of powers. They're in a space essentially ungoverned by law.”

Three years ago, Bukele declared a state of exception that has continued ever since, suspending constitutional rights and unleashing the state to take on El Salvador's gangs, including through mass incarceration without due process.

About 85,000 people – 1.4% of the population – have been arrested since. Most are being held in pre-trial detention. Human rights organisations believe many people without ties to gangs have been swept up, and have documented almost 400 deaths in custody.

The mass arrests broke the gangs' territorial grip, brought homicides down and gave many Salvadorians a kind of freedom they hadn't known for years. The great majority approve of Bukele's government.

But at the same time, Salvadorians know they now live at the whim of a president who has accumulated near absolute power.

In Tecoluca, the rural district in the shadow of Cecot, most were afraid to speak with their names.

“If you criticise them, they accuse you of being a criminal,” said one man. “All you can say is amen, amen – otherwise they might take you from your home.”

César Cañas, a local councillor and activist, said that the prison was built without public consultation. Locals only found out when construction trucks started arriving in 2022.

The military had set up a checkpoint on the access road, so Cañas approached on foot from the other side to investigate, finding that farmers had been forced to sell their land or face expropriation.

“When Radio YSUCA published our findings, that forced the president to give his version,” said Cañas. “And he tweeted that they were building a mega-prison to house 40,000 terrorists. That's more than the population of the whole district.”

The 23-hectare (57-acre) prison was finished in less than a year, and the first prisoners arrived in February 2023.

Even now, locals say they know almost nothing about what happens inside the prison.

The secrecy around Cecot is not unique: the government has released little information from any of its prisons since the state of exception began.

But what is unique is that no information has leaked out.

This reflects the fact that only one prisoner is known to have left the Cecot alive: Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who was wrongly deported from the US and subsequently transferred to another prison, where he still has no contact with the outside world.

This tight control on information coming out of Cecot allows authorities to shape its image through choreographed visits from select media, influencers and US Republican politicians, making it the public face of the state of exception.

Those visits have shown large cells with three tiers of metal beds but no sheets or mattresses. There are up to 80 prisoners to a cell, where they share basic toilets and a basin of water to wash in.

Prisoners are allowed to leave their cells for 30 minutes a day, to exercise in the central area. They never see sunlight, but the lights inside are never turned off – except for the pitch-black solitary confinement cells. No visitors are allowed.

The government says 15,000 prisoners are currently held there.

“Cecot is not meant for rehabilitation,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organisation. “It is meant for permanent exile, permanent punishment.

“In that sense, it's intentionally cruel,” added Bullock. “And that's what is being communicated: that finally we have a leader strong enough to deal with these people how they should be dealt with, which is as something less than human.”

The propaganda doesn't reflect the reality of El Salvador's state of exception nor its prison system, where people who may have nothing to do with gangs are trapped in still more terrible conditions in prisons such as Izalco.

Nonetheless the image is part of what makes Cecot useful to the Trump administration, said Bullock. When Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, gave a speech in the prison, she did it in front of MS-13 members – not the Venezuelans they had just deported.

“The Venezuelans don't have the names of gangs tattooed on their chest. And when they had their heads shaved and their backs bent double, they looked sad. It generated some sympathy,” said Bullock. “When you stand in front of MS-13 members, you eliminate that doubt.”

The Wall Street Journal reported that Bukele plans to double the size of Cecot. In addition to deported migrants, Trump said he would “love” to start sending US citizens who commit violent crimes to prison in El Salvador.

People in Tecoluca were alarmed by the prospect of the prison's expansion.

In one community, El Milagro – the Miracle – locals complained about being caught in the penumbra of the mobile signal blockade, but also the trail of sewage, that emanates from Cecot.

The river has turned brown since the prison began dumping waste upstream. A young man took a stick and began poking the sediment along the banks, releasing a sickening smell.

“Cecot is the international mega-prison,” he said. “For me it's shameful that Tecoluca is associated with it.”

Still, he was resigned. “We aren't listened to. People don't have a voice any more.”

“I'd have preferred a mega-university,” he added quietly.

            Lawyers for an Australian woman accused of fatally poisoning three family members with deadly mushrooms have told the jury their deaths were a “terrible accident.”
    


Erin Patterson is standing trial for the 2023 deaths of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson – who all died in hospital days after Patterson served them a meal that contained death cap mushrooms.
    


            She is also charged with the attempted murder of Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, who was also at the lunch but survived.
    


            Crown prosecutors allege Patterson deliberately served lethal mushrooms to kill her lunch guests; her defense counsel claims the deaths were a tragic accident.
    


            During opening arguments on Wednesday, Patterson's lawyers admitted that she initially lied to police when she said she hadn't foraged for mushrooms and didn't own a dehydrator. They said when she learned how ill her guests had become after eating her meal, she “panicked” and acted in ways that may seem suspicious.
    


            The saga, which has gripped the nation for two years, began on a summer day in late July 2023 when Patterson hosted the four relatives of her estranged husband at her home, telling them she wanted to discuss a medical issue. Her ex-husband had also been invited but did not attend.
    


            The court heard she told her guests she had cancer and asked them for advice on how she should break it to her two children. The prosecution alleges she did not have cancer, and had used the “medical issues” discussion to ensure the children would not be at the meal; the defense admitted she had lied about the diagnosis.
    


            During the meal, Patterson served her guests individual beef wellingtons – a steak and pastry dish that incorporates mushrooms. Her guests fell ill hours later and were all admitted to hospital where doctors suspected mushroom poisoning, prompting a police investigation. Patterson was arrested and charged several months later.
    


            Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC alleged that Patterson served the guests death cap mushrooms – a highly poisonous variety of wild fungus – that she had picked herself.
    


            Patterson herself had gone to the hospital, claiming to feel unwell after the meal – but her tests did not show severe illness, and she voluntarily discharged herself against doctors' advice, prosecutors said.

            Prosecutors allege that cell data showed Patterson traveling to an area where death cap mushroom sightings had been detailed online, and that months before the lunch, she had posted online about dehydrating mushrooms for use in food, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.
    


            Patterson had told police she didn't own a dehydrator, but surveillance footage after the deaths showed her disposing of a unit at a local trash dump, which was later found to contain traces of death cap mushrooms, the court heard.
    


            Patterson insists she is innocent. Her defense lawyers told the jury they don't dispute that the guests died from her meal – but argued she had not intentionally poisoned them.
    


            “The defense case is that Erin Patterson did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests at that lunch on the 29th of July, 2023,” said defense lawyer Colin Mandy SC.
    


            “She didn't intend to cause anyone any harm on that day. The defense case is that what happened was a tragedy, a terrible accident.”
    


            Mandy admitted that Patterson had lied about the dehydrator and about foraging for mushrooms, saying she had simply panicked in the moment.
    


            “The defense case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food that she'd served to (them),” Mandy said. “Three people died because of the food that Erin Patterson served that day. So you'll need to think about this issue – how Erin Patterson felt about that in the days that followed.”
    


            Patterson has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The case is expected to continue for up to six weeks.

MOSCOW, April 30. /TASS/. Moscow sees no interest from Kiev in carrying out a dialogue; voices in the EU call for re-engaging with Russia; and Kiev levels the playing field in latest minerals deal proposal to the US. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

None of Russia's attempts to declare a ceasefire have been supported by Ukraine, which indicates that the Kiev regime is betting on war, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia. The Russian Foreign Ministry emphasizes that Moscow has no contact with the Ukrainian side, apart from coordination on prisoner exchanges. Nevertheless, Russia remains open to dialogue with Kiev without preconditions.

"Not a single attempt to declare a ceasefire has in practice been supported by the Kiev regime, which continued to violate the truce. This shows that the regime is staking everything on war," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia, adding: "moreover, Kiev's self-imposed legislative ban on negotiations with Russia remains in effect."

"There is no basis to suggest that Ukraine is ready to alter its actions on the ground in any way. We do not see this happening. All we observe is erratic, pseudo-peacekeeping rhetoric. Hollow declarations of peace are not enough, we do not see any indication that Ukraine is demonstrating or confirming a willingness to pursue a ceasefire," Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large for Crimes of the Kiev Regime Rodion Miroshnik said in an interview with Izvestia.

"At present, there is contact with Ukraine only on matters related to exchanges at the military level. There is also dialogue at the ombudsman level. There are no other official contacts - neither exploratory meetings nor negotiations about negotiations. The only efforts we see come from the Americans, who are attempting to act as mediators," Miroshnik added.

There have been no direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since the end of March 2022. The last meeting between representatives of the two countries took place in Istanbul.

"It is highly likely that such negotiations could resume in 2025, if only because Kiev is under considerable pressure from Washington and the international community to seek a diplomatic resolution," Tigran Melkonyan, analyst at the Center for Mediterranean Studies of the Higher School of Economics, told Izvestia. "Kiev is also facing serious challenges on the front lines - most notably a shortage of manpower. At the same time, it is important to remember that Zelensky has created a legal barrier by prohibiting himself, by law, from engaging in direct negotiations with Russia. Therefore, if talks do resume, they are likely to start at the level of technical working groups and Foreign Ministry representatives," he added.

 

Negotiations between Russia and the European Union may begin at the parliamentary level. While the EU leadership currently rejects the idea of dialogue with Moscow, members of the European Parliament interviewed by Izvestia have expressed readiness for renewed contact. Two European Parliament factions support the notion of restoring relations with Moscow, and many MEPs would back direct dialogue with Russia should there be significant progress in negotiations between the United States and Russia. Moscow has also indicated its willingness to resume dialogue if such an initiative comes from the European side, according to the Federation Council.

"I am a member of the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and if that group were to participate in talks, I would be happy to contribute to the re-establishment of contacts and mutually beneficial relations, which are important for Slovakia and Central Europe," Milan Uhrik, Deputy Chairman of the Europe of Sovereign Nations faction in the European Parliament, told Izvestia.

"Today, we cannot expect a majority of MEPs to support such resolutions. But their concerns may dissipate once more substantial progress is achieved in negotiations between the Russian Federation and the United States," he added.

Petar Volgin, a member of the European Parliament from Bulgaria, also expressed readiness to engage in dialogue with Russian counterparts. He noted that the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee could serve as a potential platform, though informal meetings in this format have not taken place since 2019.

Russia's Federation Council is open to resuming dialogue with the European Parliament if such an initiative comes from the latter, Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, told Izvestia.

"Dialogue is always preferable to no dialogue, especially given that we have no shortage of issues to discuss. Within the European Union, the depth of understanding regarding their own internal situation and what is happening in Ukraine is close to nil. Communication with Russian parliamentarians would be of benefit to them," Kosachev said.

At present, it is difficult to envision a shared agenda for discussion between Russia and the European Parliament, as the EP's current role is largely to produce anti-Russian resolutions. However, this does not mean that Russia should refrain from making proposals. Alexander Asafov, a member of Russia's Civic Chamber, noted in an interview with Izvestia, interparliamentary dialogue has proven effective, much like interparty dialogue within BRICS and with other allied nations.

 

According to Ukrainian officials, the agreement between Ukraine and the United States concerning Ukrainian resources has been transformed from a "predatory" deal into an "equitable" one following revisions. The updated version reportedly adheres to the Ukrainian Constitution and excludes any obligations to repay previously rendered assistance from Washington. However, if signed in its current form, the agreement would constitute a setback for US President Donald Trump, who had earlier pledged to recover American taxpayer funds spent on Ukraine, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. Moreover, despite promises and forecasts, the agreement remains unsigned. Experts noted that US officials are beginning to understand the difficulty of negotiating with Ukraine, particularly when the latter is unwilling to compromise.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal discussed the content of the agreement during a meeting late last week in Washington with US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. According to Shmygal, the two sides reviewed Ukraine's key red lines, agreeing in particular that the proposed agreement must not contradict the Ukrainian Constitution or the country's obligations to the European Union. He also noted that, during the Ukrainian delegation's visit to the United States, arrangements were made with representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue supporting Ukraine.

Meanwhile, The Financial Times also reported that Washington and Kiev are close to finalizing a deal. The outlet suggested that the agreement - which could be signed as early as this week - would cover all of Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas, and other key energy assets.

Speaking to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for International Studies at MGIMO University Nikolay Silayev said it would be prudent to wait and see what is ultimately signed. When that might happen remains unclear. "For Donald Trump, the current situation is certainly a failure, as he has repeatedly emphasized his interest in this agreement, describing it as part of his broader peace plan for resolving the conflict in Ukraine. The United States has now learned firsthand what it means to negotiate with Ukraine when it has no intention of reaching an agreement," he said.

Regarding the resource agreement itself, he noted that numerous questions remain, particularly as to whether it complies with the Ukrainian Constitution. Moreover, doubts persist regarding the legitimacy of President Vladimir Zelensky, whose official term expired on May 20, 2024. "Clearly, the agreement was initially disadvantageous for Kiev. When Ukrainian authorities eventually sign it, political repercussions are inevitable," the expert concluded.

 

Spain and Portugal had nearly fully restored their power grids by April 29 following the most extensive blackout in modern European history, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the Portuguese outlet Diaraias de Noticias, which cited a statement from local grid operator E-Redes. Experts told Vedomosti that the massive blackout in Spain and Portugal was caused by systemic vulnerabilities stemming from the rapid integration of renewable energy sources without adequate modernization of grid infrastructure, leading to reduced resilience and instability in the power system.

Blackouts of this scale are relatively rare in Europe. At this stage, the only certainty is that the disruption originated from within the system itself, without any malicious external interference, despite ongoing speculation about a possible cyberattack, Deputy Director of the National Energy Security Fund Alexey Grivach told the newspaper.

Sergey Rozhenko, Head of energy analytics at Kept, noted that the increasing integration of industrial-scale electronics into power systems to accommodate renewable energy sources "reduces resilience to system failures." According to him, the primary cause of the blackout was the drop in synchronous inertia.

Data from Ember indicates that around 43% of Spain's energy is generated from renewable sources, with nuclear accounting for another 20% and fossil fuels comprising 23%. Grivach emphasized that the European energy system, built around renewables, has become highly weather-dependent. "What happened in Spain and subsequently spread to neighboring Portugal and southwestern France shows this vulnerability. Ultimately, the restoration of electricity was achieved only by ramping up output from gas-fired power plants to five times the level they had been producing at the time of the blackout," he explained.

Spain and Portugal, where up to 50% of electricity is generated from renewables, remain particularly vulnerable, agreed Georgy Kutyrev, Research Fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Higher School of Economics. He attributed the incident to the push toward the green economy movement without corresponding modernization of infrastructure. "Rapid deployment of renewables without accounting for their intermittency creates systemic imbalance," Kutyrev concluded.

 

The global silver market is projected to remain in deficit for the fifth consecutive year in 2025, although the shortfall in metal supply is expected to decrease, according to an annual report from The Silver Institute. The organization forecasts that global silver demand will decline by 1% this year, reaching 1.15 bln troy ounces. Experts told Vedomosti that while the global silver market will remain in deficit in 2025, the shortfall is expected to narrow due to stable industrial demand and limited supply growth, with structural constraints, rising solar demand, and declining consumer interest creating a complex and imbalanced market.

The industrial sector continues to be the primary driver of silver consumption, the report said. Silver's high thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its corrosion resistance, make it a vital industrial material. According to the Institute's forecast, industrial usage of silver will remain virtually unchanged in 2025 at 677.4 mln ounces, marking a slight year-on-year decrease of 0.5%.

This year's global silver deficit is projected at 187.6 mln ounces - the lowest level in the past four years, the Institute noted. In 2024, the deficit amounted to 210.5 mln ounces, meaning the expected shortfall for 2025 represents an 11% reduction.

According to a report by Heraeus Precious Metals, a German technology company specializing in precious metals, the primary drivers of price growth are rising interest in solar energy and a resurgence in demand from the Indian market. Heraeus forecasts that silver prices in 2025 will fluctuate between $28 and $40 per ounce on the global market.

Independent industrial expert Leonid Khazanov told Vedomosti that the silver market deficit is structural, driven by the fact that a significant portion of the metal is extracted as a byproduct of mining other resources. He estimates Russia's annual silver consumption at 80-100 metric tons.

Despite the ongoing shortage, the silver market in 2025 remains subject to a range of opposing factors, analyst at Finam Financial Group Alexander Potavin told the newspaper. He pointed out that while industrial demand remains robust, consumer interest in jewelry and silverware is declining. On the supply side, output growth is expected to be limited due to deteriorating ore quality and high production costs, while secondary recycling will be insufficient to meet global needs.

Leaked documents indicate Harita, owner of key nickel mine in Indonesia, did not reveal water contamination

One of Indonesia's largest nickel-mining companies, which supplies a mineral critical to the global electric car industry, did not tell the public that local drinking water was polluted, according to documents seen by the Guardian.

Indonesia has become the world's biggest producer of nickel, used in the production of wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. But observers have voiced concerns that regulatory oversight in the country has failed to keep up with the rush to develop mines to satisfy booming global demand.

Leaked documents seen by the Guardian suggest a source of drinking water close to a $1bn (£800m) mining project owned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group on remote Obi Island, was contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in the Erin Brockovich story and film.

Cr6 can cause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harm when ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has also been linked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown that Cr6 in drinking water can be a result of industrial processes.

The leak comes after a Guardian investigation into pollution at the site in 2022 was disputed by the mining company, which extracts and processes nickel for use in EV batteries.

For the 2022 investigation, water samples collected from a spring in the village of Kawasi, less than 200 metres from the mining site, were tested at government-certified laboratories and suggested high levels of contamination from carcinogenic Cr6 of 60 parts per billion (ppb). The maximum contaminant level allowed by law in Indonesia is 50ppb.

In response to the Guardian's original investigation, a Harita company said its own results had shown that the spring water was suitable for consumption and met the quality standards set by the Indonesian government.

However, the leaked documents and emails suggest a Harita company found the Cr6 values in Kawasi spring, used as drinking water by villagers, in excess of Indonesian quality standards just one day after its statement to the contrary. It then found even higher values in subsequent days. It does not appear to have made this data public.

The Guardian was given a chance to review the material by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) in a joint investigation with the Gecko Project, a non-profit newsroom.

The material suggests tests of Kawasi's spring water undertaken by a Harita company found Cr6 concentrations of 70ppb on 1 February 2022, one day after the Harita company provided its statement to the Guardian. On 7 February 2022 a value of 128ppb was recorded.

A weekly environment report from December 2022 reported that values of 140ppb had been recorded at the spring.

Harita has not responded to requests for comment on the leaked material and test results but in a press release published on its website this month, the company said it conducts periodic monitoring of the water at Kawasi spring to ensure it is safe and uncontaminated.

Environmental health experts have said the test results suggest a significant issue with pollution.

Matthew Baird, an environmental lawyer based in south-east Asia, said: “These are figures that need to be taken into account not just by the company, but also the Indonesian government.”

“Nickel is meant to be one of the transition metals [to move to a green, low-carbon economy] and we require a just transition to ensure the protection of the environment, human rights and the community,” he said.

Hungary's Parliament voted on April 29 to approve the country's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on X.

The decision formalizes Hungary's intention, first announced in early April during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Budapest.

The move follows the ICC's issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza — a move Budapest has sharply criticized.

"With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility," Szijjarto wrote.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar welcomed Hungary's move, according to the Times of Israel. Following the vote, withdrawing from the ICC jurisdiction will take a year, once Budapest officially notifies the U.N. Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, of its decision

The ICC, established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, is a permanent tribunal based in The Hague that prosecutes individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. 

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the forcible deportation of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. 

Despite the warrant, Mongolia hosted Putin for an official visit in September 2024, citing energy dependence as its reason for not executing the arrest and saying it had limited options.

Deputy prime minister and economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko will reportedly be in Washington later today to sign the agreement

Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal has offered his take on the US minerals deal, with Reuters reporting his comments that the reworked agreement has become a “real partnership deal”.

He said the deal is to be signed within the next 24 hours, with two additional agreements to follow.

Shmyhal added that the deal will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament, with consultations set to start tomorrow, Reuters said.

He added that future US aid for Ukraine can be considered as part of US contribution to the investment fund to be established under the deal, according to Reuters.

Let's wait for more details or, ideally, the full text of the deal though.

It is believed that the text has evolved significantly since the first attempt at signing it in February, which ended with that Oval Office spat between Trump, JD Vance and Zelenskyy.

The announcement of the construction of a new road bridge connecting Russia and North Korea comes after reports that about 600 North Korean troops have been killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine.

North Korea has suffered about 4,700 casualties so far, including injuries and deaths, out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said on Wednesday, citing the country's intelligence agency.

In return for dispatching troops and supplying weapons to Russia, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance on spy satellites, as well as drones and anti-air missiles, they said.

Lee Seong-kweun, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters:

After six months of participation in the war, the North Korean military has become less inept, and its combat capability has significantly improved as it becomes accustomed to using new weapons such as drones.

On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent troops to fight for Russia in the war in Ukraine under orders from its leader, Kim Jong-un.

Russia and North Korea have begun construction of a road bridge between the two countries as part of an effort to strengthen their strategic partnership, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said.

Mishustin announced work had started on the bridge across the Tumnen river while in a video meeting with the chair of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Pak Thae-song, on Wednesday.

“This is a truly a milestone for Russian-Korean relations,” Mishustin said.

It symbolises our common desire to strengthen friendly, good-neighbourly relations and increase inter-regional cooperation.

The bridge is being built near the existing “Friendship Bridge”, a rail bridge which was commissioned in 1959 after the Korean war.

Pak was quoted as saying:

It will become an eternal historical memorial structure symbolising the unbreakable Korean-Russian friendly relations.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that some small groups of Ukrainian soldiers were still holed up in basements and hideouts in Russia's western Kursk region.

Putin earlier this week phoned his top commanders in Kursk to congratulate them on “victory” and the end of their operation to expel Ukrainian forces from the region after a Ukrainian force stormed across the border last August, Reuters reported.

Speaking at an event in Moscow, Putin said radio intercepts suggested that the few Ukrainians left behind were asking commanders to urgently evacuate them to safety.

Ukraine has said that some of its forces are still inside Kursk and in Russia's nearby Belgorod region.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he had no doubt that Moscow would sooner or later repair its relations with European countries.

Speaking at a forum in Moscow, Putin said many in Europe share Russia's position on certain issues.

Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting at Pope Francis's funeral was “indicative” of the “effort” being put in to secure a peace deal for Ukraine, UK foreign secretary David Lammy has said.

The US and Ukrainian presidents were pictured in discussion at the Vatican over the weekend, having both travelled to Rome for the service, PA reported.

The foreign secretary told the House of Lords International Relations and Defence Committee on Wednesday that Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron have done “a lot of the heavy lifting” in terms of trying to bring nations together to support any potential future agreement.

It comes as Ukrainian official indicated they are willing to sign a minerals resources agreement with the US, perhaps as soon as Wednesday, with the country's economy minister in Washington looking to iron out the final technical details.

The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on Saturday was the first since their fraught White House encounter earlier this year. In the hours after, the American president appeared to criticise Vladimir Putin, writing on TruthSocial that the Russian leader could be “just tapping me along”.

The United States wants Ukraine to sign two additional documents together with their minerals deal, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

However, Kyiv thinks the two supplements need more work, Reuters reported.

… and on that note, that's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, but I leave you with Tom Ambrose who will guide you through the evening and bring you all the latest updates on the minerals deal.

As we wait to hear more on the US minerals deal, let me bring you new comments from Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office.

Writing for the Guardian, Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's most senior aide, explained Moscow's seemingly contradictory logic as Russia calls for a three-day ceasefire in May, while stalling on a longer ceasefire and proper peace talks.

He said:

On Monday, the Kremlin offered a three-day pause in hostilities against Ukraine in May, to coincide with Moscow's celebrations of the end of the second world war.

In a context where Ukraine is calling for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, and the US a permanent one, Russia wants concessions before a lasting pause or permanent peace can even be discussed.

Central to the Kremlin's demands is the removal of sanctions – especially those restricting its aviation sector.

We must be cautious not to make concessions prematurely, under the guise of quick progress. The short pause offered would not make a meaningful difference to the war, and accepting it would enable a regime that has repeatedly shown intent to prolong its war of aggression and undermine this chance for a just, fair and lasting peace.

Yermak went on to explain the problem with removing the requested sanctions, saying that “the apparent humanitarian and economic nature of Russia's request masks the political and military advantage that any softening of aviation sanctions would hand the Russian president and his war machine.”

You can read his comment in full here:

There's a lot of conflicting reporting on when the minerals deal could be signed, and if it really could be as early as today – as some reports suggested earlier (14:33).

In the last few minutes, the Financial Times (£) said that the talks “ran into last-minute hurdles,” as a US source told the newspaper that the “negotiations had not concluded because Ukraine had sought to revisit terms agreed at the weekend.”

We will keep an eye on this for you and bring you all the latest updates here.

Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal has offered his take on the US minerals deal, with Reuters reporting his comments that the reworked agreement has become a “real partnership deal”.

He said the deal is to be signed within the next 24 hours, with two additional agreements to follow.

Shmyhal added that the deal will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament, with consultations set to start tomorrow, Reuters said.

He added that future US aid for Ukraine can be considered as part of US contribution to the investment fund to be established under the deal, according to Reuters.

Let's wait for more details or, ideally, the full text of the deal though.

It is believed that the text has evolved significantly since the first attempt at signing it in February, which ended with that Oval Office spat between Trump, JD Vance and Zelenskyy.

Elsewhere, the Kremlin claimed that president Vladimir Putin was open to peace despite its continuing aggression on Ukraine, but stressed that the conflict is so complicated that the rapid progress that Washington wants is difficult to achieve, Reuters reported.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov insisted that Putin “remains open to political and diplomatic methods of resolving this conflict” started by Russia.

But news agency TASS quoted Peskov as saying that the root causes of the war were too complex to be resolved in one day.

After the Kremlin's remark, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv was ready for peace talks in any format if Moscow signed up to an unconditional ceasefire, Reuters noted.

Ukraine expects to sign a much-anticipated minerals deal with the United States on Wednesday, a senior source in the Ukrainian presidency told AFP.

Deputy prime minister and economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko will be in Washington later to sign the agreement, the final draft of which the Ukrainian government “has yet to approve”, the source said, adding that the agreement provides for a “50/50” joint fund between Kyiv and Washington.

Reuters reminded that the two sides signed a memorandum on 18 April as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resources in Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials hope that signing the deal promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump will help to firm up softening American support for Kyiv in the war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion more than three years ago, Reuters added.

The way is now paved for the Merz administration to finally take up office.

On Monday, the coalition agreement will be signed, and we're also expecting the SPD to announce its cabinet posts. Then on Tuesday, Merz is due to be voted into office by the Bundestag, after which his government will be sworn in.

Rumour has it that Merz will hold his first cabinet meeting on Tuesday afternoon, sending out the signal that he means to get down to business straight away amid looming challenges, from economic malaise, to grave domestic concerns, such as how to tackle irregular migration, overburdensome bureaucracy, and not least how to outflank the far-right AfD (recent polls showing them to have overtaken the CDU/CSU for the first time).

There's also the question that has been on the minds of everyone since his controversial multi-billion Euro financial bonanza he pushed through parliament in March – what exactly is he going to do with the money, and how long will it be before malcontent Germans start to feel the effects of it?

That's even before touching on the myriad geopolitical complications.

Merz has long since sent out the signal that Ukraine will be at the top of his agenda, having appointed a pro-Kyiv ex soldier as foreign minister and pledged to continue Germany's support.

The closer he has got to taking office, the more cautious he has become in his rhetoric towards US President Trump, but Merz has made no mistake he knows what is at stake, saying on Monday:

“We have come to the realisation that we can no longer be certain of the transatlantic relationship in the spirit of freedom and the rules-based order.”

With this morning's news that the Social Democrats' party base has voted in favour of the party's coalition agreement with the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, the last hurdle has finally fallen for the long awaited new German government to be formed, ending six months of grindingly painful political gridlock and (hopefully also) the chronic national ennui.

Almost 85% were in favour of the deal, which at first glance looks high, yet, voter participation among the 358,000 members of Germany's oldest political party was only 56%, itself a clear expression of the disgruntlement – or, as the SPD's general secretary Matthias Miersch put it this morning, at the briefest of press briefings at the SPD's headquarters, the Willy Brandt Haus, in Berlin – the “scepticism” many members feel about participating at all in this new administration.

After all, the SPD, after three years of being at the helm under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is now the junior partner in the new government of Friedrich Merz, and the fear within the party is that its already diminished profile in the political landscape – having delivered its worst ever election result in February – will become even more watered down, as will its ability to imprint its social democratic principles on Europe's biggest economy.

“Yes, there is scepticism,” Miersch admitted, and many “open-ended questions”, but hopefully, he added, “this scepticism can be dispelled” once the government gets to work, stressing: “es geht nicht um uns, es geht um das Land” – “this isn't about us, it's about the country”. He thanked party members for their support and “trust especially in these times of great uncertainty”.

This is certainly the tenor of the new era. As Merz said on Monday, presenting his new ministers, this is “no time for euphoria”

US treasury secretary says he expects Ukraine to ‘reconsider' changes it made to agreement as deputy PM Yulia Svyrydenko will reportedly be in Washington to sign agreement today

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said Washington is “ready to sign” a minerals deal with Ukraine.

At a cabinet meeting at the White House, Donald Trump was asked by a reporter about the deal, which he then directed to Bessent.

“Our side is ready to sign,” Bessent said, adding that the Ukrainians had “decided last night to make some last-minute changes”. He added:

We're sure they will reconsider that, and we are ready to sign the afternoon.

Bessent said “nothing has been removed” from the agreement.

It's the same agreement that we agreed to on the weekend. No changes on our side.

It's 10.15pm in Kyiv and Moscow, and 3.15pm in Washington. Here's a recap of the latest developments:

Ukraine and the US said they were ready to sign a minerals deal, amid reports that a last-minute obstacle injected uncertainty into the timing. “Our side is ready to sign. The Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,” US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told reporters. “We're sure that they will reconsider that and we are ready, if they are.”

Ukraine's first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, is on her way to the US to sign the minerals deal, according to a senior source in the Ukrainian presidency. Ukraine's prime minister, Denis Shmyhal, said on Wednesday that the reworked deal would be signed within the next 24 hours and would have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament. But later reports claimed the US was pushing Ukraine to sign additional documents, but that Kyiv felt they were not ready yet.

Vladimir Putin said some small groups of Ukrainian soldiers were still holed up in basements and hideouts in Russia's western Kursk region. Speaking at an event in Moscow on Wednesday, the Russian leader said radio intercepts suggested that the few Ukrainians left behind were asking commanders to urgently evacuate them to safety.

The EU is preparing a “plan B” on how to keep economic sanctions against Russia should the US abandon Ukraine peace talks and seek rapprochement with Moscow, according to the bloc's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. “We see signs that they are contemplating whether they should leave Ukraine and not try to get a deal with the Russians because it's hard,” Kallas told the Financial Times.

Russia and North Korea have begun construction of a road bridge between the two countries as part of an effort to strengthen their strategic partnership, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said. It comes after South Korean lawmakers said about 600 North Korean troops have been killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, held a call on Wednesday during which the Ukrainian leader congratulated Carney on his victory in the Canadian federal elections on Monday.

Zelenskyy, in a post on X, said he and Carney discussed steps that could “bring us closer to a full, unconditional ceasefire and a dignified peace.”

We also talked about the prospects of Canada's G7 presidency this year and our cooperation within the Coalition of the Willing. We are preparing various formats of cooperation in the near future.

“Thank you, Canada, for your support. We are counting on effective cooperation,” Zelenskyy added.

The EU is preparing a “plan B” on how to keep economic sanctions against Russia should the US abandon Ukraine peace talks and seek rapprochement with Moscow.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's high representative for foreign and security policy, told the Financial Times:

We see signs that they are contemplating whether they should leave Ukraine and not try to get a deal with the Russians because it's hard.

Kallas said there was a “plan B” to maintain economic pressure on Russia should Hungary block the rollover of EU economic sanctions in July. She stressed that Brussels was still focused on keeping all EU member states aligned.

There is also a plan B but we have to work for plan A; because otherwise you concentrate on plan B and then that will happen.

Here's more on the reported “last-minute hurdles” that appeared amid reports that Ukraine and the US were poised to sign a minerals deal.

As we reported earlier, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko was due to be in Washington on Wednesday to sign the deal.

But a source told Reuters that the US was pushing Ukraine to sign two additional documents as well as the main minerals deal.

The Trump administration urged Ukraine to sign all three documents connected to the deal, but Kyiv felt they were not ready yet, Politico reported. A source told the outlet:

All three documents need to be signed today, but the Ukrainians are trying to reopen terms which have already been agreed upon as part of the package — this will be up to the Ukrainians, as the US is ready to sign.

The US told Svyrydenko not to travel to Washington on Wednesday unless the agreements were finalised, according to the outlet.

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said Washington is “ready to sign” a minerals deal with Ukraine.

At a cabinet meeting at the White House, Donald Trump was asked by a reporter about the deal, which he then directed to Bessent.

“Our side is ready to sign,” Bessent said, adding that the Ukrainians had “decided last night to make some last-minute changes”. He added:

We're sure they will reconsider that, and we are ready to sign the afternoon.

Bessent said “nothing has been removed” from the agreement.

It's the same agreement that we agreed to on the weekend. No changes on our side.

The announcement of the construction of a new road bridge connecting Russia and North Korea comes after reports that about 600 North Korean troops have been killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine.

North Korea has suffered about 4,700 casualties so far, including injuries and deaths, out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said on Wednesday, citing the country's intelligence agency.

In return for dispatching troops and supplying weapons to Russia, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance on spy satellites, as well as drones and anti-air missiles, they said.

Lee Seong-kweun, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters:

After six months of participation in the war, the North Korean military has become less inept, and its combat capability has significantly improved as it becomes accustomed to using new weapons such as drones.

On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had sent troops to fight for Russia in the war in Ukraine under orders from its leader, Kim Jong-un.

Russia and North Korea have begun construction of a road bridge between the two countries as part of an effort to strengthen their strategic partnership, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said.

Mishustin announced work had started on the bridge across the Tumnen river while in a video meeting with the chair of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Pak Thae-song, on Wednesday.

“This is a truly a milestone for Russian-Korean relations,” Mishustin said.

It symbolises our common desire to strengthen friendly, good-neighbourly relations and increase inter-regional cooperation.

The bridge is being built near the existing “Friendship Bridge”, a rail bridge which was commissioned in 1959 after the Korean war.

Pak was quoted as saying:

It will become an eternal historical memorial structure symbolising the unbreakable Korean-Russian friendly relations.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that some small groups of Ukrainian soldiers were still holed up in basements and hideouts in Russia's western Kursk region.

Putin earlier this week phoned his top commanders in Kursk to congratulate them on “victory” and the end of their operation to expel Ukrainian forces from the region after a Ukrainian force stormed across the border last August, Reuters reported.

Speaking at an event in Moscow, Putin said radio intercepts suggested that the few Ukrainians left behind were asking commanders to urgently evacuate them to safety.

Ukraine has said that some of its forces are still inside Kursk and in Russia's nearby Belgorod region.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he had no doubt that Moscow would sooner or later repair its relations with European countries.

Speaking at a forum in Moscow, Putin said many in Europe share Russia's position on certain issues.

            Britain's military launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Tuesday with US forces, its defense ministry said – the first public acknowledgment of a joint operation since the Trump administration escalated the US campaign against the militant group.
    


            The strikes targeted “a cluster of buildings” south of the capital Sanaa used by Houthis to manufacture drones, which the group uses to attack ships at sea, Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement released Wednesday.
    


            The Royal Air Force sent Typhoon fighter jets to target those buildings, dropping precision bombs after dark following “very careful planning … to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure,” the statement said. All the aircraft returned safely, it added.
    


            The Iran-backed Houthis began a military campaign in solidarity with Palestinians when Israel went to war in Gaza in October 2023. They have repeatedly attacked US Navy ships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden – two waterways that are critical to international shipping routes – and fired missiles at Israel.
    


            In response, the US has tried to disrupt the Houthis' capabilities by going after their primary weapons, and by destroying maritime drones and underwater drones.

            The UK has participated in joint strikes with the US against the Houthis before, including numerous operations in 2024.
    


            But Wednesday's statement marks its first acknowledgment of a joint strike since President Donald Trump launched his aggressive military campaign against the group, vowing to use “overwhelming force” to stop the Red Sea attacks.
    


            Tuesday's joint operation “was in line with long-standing policy of the UK government, following the Houthis initiating their campaign of attacks in November 2023, threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, striking international ships, and killing innocent merchant mariners,” said the ministry statement.
    


            John Healey, the UK's defense secretary, said the strikes aimed to prevent further Houthi attacks, adding that a 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea had caused regional instability and damaged the UK's economy.
    


            Since Trump began his campaign – known as “Operation Rough Rider” – on March 15, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites. The US military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in its  monthlong campaign, while analysts estimate dozens of Houthi military officers have been killed.
    


            But so far the US operation has had limited impact in harming the group's operations, and the militants have successfully shot down many multimillion-dollar American drones, hindering the US' ability to move into “phase two” of the operation, US officials told CNN last week.
    


            On Monday the Houthis alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing dozens.
    


            In response, US Central Command said it was “aware of the claims of civilian casualties related to the US strikes in Yemen, and we take those claims very seriously. We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on April 29 that Russia is preparing potential military aggression under the guise of joint exercises with Belarus this summer.

"Look at Belarus — this summer, Russia is preparing something there under the guise of military exercises. This is how its new attacks usually start," Zelensky said at the Three Seas Summit, according to Suspilne. 

"But where this time? I don't know. Ukraine? Lithuania? Poland? God forbid! But we all have to be prepared. All our institutions are open to cooperation."

Belarus will host the Zapad 2025 (West 2025) military exercises with Russian forces, part of a long-standing series of drills held every two years since 2009. 

The most recent iteration, Zapad-2021, involved over 200,000 participants and served as a prelude to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Despite not being directly involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus continues to host Russian troops and missiles on its territory.

Belarus shares borders with Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Russia, positioning it as a key strategic corridor between NATO and Moscow. 

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously said that the upcoming Zapad exercises could enable Russia to covertly assemble offensive forces under the guise of drills.

"All exercises have a purpose. And one of these goals is the covert creation of offensive troop groups," Syrskyi told Lb.ua on April 9. 

"The visibility of the exercises is the most acceptable way to relocate, redeploy troops, concentrate them in a certain direction, and create a group of troops."

Zelensky has repeatedly cautioned that Russia may escalate military actions beyond Ukraine.

On Feb. 14, during the Munich Security Conference, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to deploy up to 150,000 troops, primarily in Belarus, suggesting a possible buildup for future offensives against NATO countries. 

"Based on all the information I've gathered from intelligence and other sources, I think he is preparing for war against NATO countries next year (2026)," Zelensky said, though he added he could not be entirely sure.

Tensions between NATO and Moscow have intensified following Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine. 

Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a risk of a larger war in Europe within the next five years, pointing to Russia's growing militarization and hostile posture.

Temperatures south Asians dread each year arrive early as experts talk of ever shorter transition to summer-like heat

The summer conditions south Asian countries dread each year have arrived alarmingly early, and it's only April. Much of India and Pakistan is already sweltering in heatwave conditions, in what scientists say is fast becoming the “new normal”.

Temperatures in the region typically climb through May, peaking in June before the monsoon brings relief. But this year, the heat has come early. “As far as Asia and the Indian subcontinent are concerned, there was a quick transition from a short window of spring conditions to summer-like heat,” said GP Sharma, the meteorology president of Skymet, India's leading private forecaster.

South Asia, home to 1.9 billion people, is particularly vulnerable. Many live in areas highly exposed to extreme heat and lack access to basic cooling, healthcare or water.

In Delhi, where spring usually offers a short spell of mild temperatures, thermometers have risen past 40C in April – “up to 5C above the seasonal average” – according to a report by ClimaMeter, a platform that tracks extreme weather events.

“Human-driven climate change” is to blame for the “dangerous” kind of heat seen in recent weeks, it said.

“These spring heatwaves are not anomalies. They're signals. We need to move beyond awareness into action,” said Gianmarco Mengaldo, a climate expert at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report.

Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately.

Temperatures in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hit 44C, triggering heatstroke reports among construction workers and farmers. Other states are also grappling with intense heat.

The Indian Meteorological Department has reported an “above-normal number of heatwave days”. Temperatures are expected to climb steadily across the subcontinent, with the highest readings forecast for Wednesday and Thursday.

Pakistan is also reeling. In the city of Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, the mercury has soared to 50C – nearly 8.5C above the April average. In other parts of the country, temperatures have hovered in the high 40s.

“What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events,” said an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The country “remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis”, it said.

Urban heat is making things worse. Data comparing 1950–1986 with 1987–2023 shows that cities such as Delhi and Islamabad are now up to 3C hotter on average than nearby rural areas.

“When it comes to heatwaves, the question is no longer if they are linked to climate change, but what kind of thresholds we are reaching,” said Mengaldo. “Preparedness is essential. But right now, our infrastructure is not well adapted.”

Natural climate variability such as the El Niño cycle can affect regional weather, but it is now in a neutral phase.

ClimaMeter said: “Compared to pre-1986 levels, similar meteorological conditions now produce temperatures up to 4C higher – almost entirely due to human-driven climate change.”

South Asia is not alone. “In the northern hemisphere spring months, we are already seeing conditions in parts of the Middle East that are incompatible with human life,” said Mengaldo.

“This is very serious for the populations … we also expect summer temperatures in Spain and France to reach unprecedented levels in the next few years,” he said. “Many of the events predicted for 2050 or 2070 are already happening. We underestimated the speed of change. What we're seeing now is an acceleration – a failure of our predictive models.”

David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the report, said: “The only sustainable solution is to stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions. Without drastically reducing emissions and building climate resilience through better insulation, use of green energy, and other moves, the implications are alarming.”

“Even if we act now, the climate system will take decades – sometimes over a century – to cool down,” Mengaldo added. “The sea level rise is already locked in for hundreds of years.”

Both researchers stressed economic inequality and infrastructure played a critical role in determining who survives extreme heat. “There are different temperature thresholds – actual temperature, [humidity index] and others,” said Mengaldo. “Economic levels play a huge role in how people can cope and sustain themselves.”

Delhi has updated its heat action plan, focusing on vulnerable groups such as elderly people, construction workers, and street vendors. But implementation is inconsistent.

Faranda said adaptation was increasingly unaffordable for many heat-prone countries, with electricity grids buckling and causing widespread power cuts. “When multiple events occur, there's often no escape,” he said.

Mengaldo highlighted the need for innovation: “We need better-insulated housing, materials that prevent energy loss, and architectural designs that promote natural cooling. These can significantly reduce energy demand during extreme heat.”

Faranda also said people must change their lifestyles. “Energy demand keeps increasing. If we want to survive the coming decades, we must not only build more renewables but also reduce energy consumption overall: through lifestyle changes, efficient architecture, and better materials.”

After two years of destructive fighting, Sudan's civil war has reached an uneasy stalemate. Since the beginning of 2025, the Sudanese Armed Forces and allied militias have made significant gains against the Rapid Support Forces, the powerful militia accused of genocide, as the two factions vie for control of the country. By late March, the SAF had recaptured the capital, Khartoum, reclaiming Sudan's presidential palace and clearing most of the city of RSF fighters. Nevertheless, the SAF is unlikely to defeat the RSF outright: the militia continues to maintain strong control over approximately a quarter of the country's territory, largely in the west. And the RSF, in turn, seems unlikely to be able to retake the ground it has lost in the eastern, northern, and central parts of the country and is now focusing its efforts on fortifying its hold over the vast Darfur region. Over the past few weeks, fighting began to ebb, but it is again intensifying in North Darfur's provincial capital, El Fasher, the SAF's last remaining stronghold in Sudan's west.

Because the war's frontlines seem mostly set, historical precedent suggests that now would be an ideal time for a cease-fire or even peace negotiations. In many previous African conflicts, a battlefield deadlock encouraged international actors to push for negotiations, as happened in 2005, when U.S.-backed talks ended the second Sudanese civil war after more than two decades of fighting between southern rebels and Khartoum. Indeed, it might even seem that de jure partitioning, akin to the 2011 secession of South Sudan, could be the least bad option. The Sudanese people certainly need a reprieve: the latest conflict has devastated the country, leaving as many as 150,000 Sudanese dead, nearly 13 million displaced, and up to 25 million facing severe food insecurity or famine.

But in the case of Sudan's current civil war, any hope that negotiations, if they can be started, will result in lasting peace is illusory. The conflict has deepened existing ethnic and regional fault lines; the atrocities that the RSF, in particular, has perpetrated have made negotiations unpalatable for many of the SAF's backers. Simultaneously, a wide variety of actors—including powerful foreign countries—have an interest in seeing the factions they have backed stay as powerful as possible. That makes crafting a peace settlement that generates a single government difficult.

History strongly suggests, however, that any kind of territorial fragmentation will also fail to bring stability. South Sudan's secession did not dampen the conflict consuming the region; it merely displaced the fighting, as the rebel group that had fought Khartoum fragmented and its factions began to battle one another. If the warring sides continue to refuse a cease-fire or peace talks, that could yield a situation similar to what has occurred in Libya and Yemen: a de facto split in which Sudan remains intact in name only. Rival power centers will take hold in different parts of the country, and many of the groups that are fighting today, alongside new ones that will likely emerge, will continue to fight.

The current Sudanese civil war is far from a straightforward, two-sided conflict. It began as a brawl between two factions within the country's security apparatus—the SAF, under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti. Burhan and Hemedti had allied to topple the civilian-led transitional government that had emerged after the long-standing Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir's ouster in 2019 but then turned on each other in April 2023.

Over the course of two years, their rupture has metastasized into a much bigger war involving numerous Sudanese groups and well-resourced foreign patrons such as Egypt, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. New militias have emerged to align with each faction, and older armed groups have thrown their lot in with either the SAF or the RSF. The older groups include major tribal and regional militias, such as the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), both based in the Darfur region and aligned with the SAF, as well as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), a longtime rebel force that has allied with the RSF.



Neither the SAF nor the RSF claims to be waging war for ideological reasons. Although the SAF's leadership has branded its fight as a nonsectarian battle for the survival of the Sudanese state, Islamists have dominated its top officer corps for nearly four decades. After the Bashir regime armed Janjaweed militias to counter rebellions by non-Arab groups in Darfur, in 2013 it officially organized these militias into the RSF. Although the RSF's constituent militias have credibly been accused of genocide, the RSF now appropriates the very claims of marginalization and disenfranchisement once voiced by the ethnic rebel groups it was originally tasked with eliminating.

In reality, however, one of the current war's most important motivators is Sudan's vast mineral and agricultural wealth. The country has huge gold reserves and the second-largest amount of arable land in Africa, and both domestic and foreign interests are struggling for control of these resources. In addition, smaller factions have lined up behind one side or the other to wage more localized power struggles or to secure personal wealth: the JEM's leader, Gibril Ibrahim, for instance, has sided with the SAF, in part, to maintain his lucrative role as Sudan's minister of finance.

On the surface, the fact that Sudan's civil war is driven by material rather than ideological interests makes the prospect of a negotiated settlement appear more viable, even if hammering one out would be complex. If each important faction got something concrete that it wanted, one theory goes—if natural resource concessions or cabinet positions were distributed satisfactorily among the combatants—the fighting could stop. Hypothetically, a military stalemate could also induce the combatants to come to the table. The SAF has more troops and airpower. But the RSF's forces are battle-hardened and skilled at insurgency tactics, giving them an advantage in urban warfare, as evidenced by their ability to hold Khartoum and other major cities for two years. Numerous rounds of talks have been attempted, including formal negotiations led by Saudi Arabia and the United States and secret talks facilitated by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. But each attempt has failed.

Such efforts to resolve the Sudanese conflict misunderstood its dynamics. Although neither side can eliminate the other, both the SAF and the RSF have managed to make, and hold onto, territorial gains covering the parts of the country that their domestic and international constituencies consider the most important. Even as the fighting has begun to ebb, many of the war's key players are unwilling to engage in a settlement that would end the stream of profits generated by their war machines.

Early on, both sides sought external support to fund their war efforts. The United Arab Emirates has sustained the relationship it nurtured with the RSF from 2015 to 2019, when it hired RSF troops to serve as mercenaries in Yemen. To secure an export corridor for Sudanese goods, Abu Dhabi has sent cargo flights full of powerful weapons, drones, and armored vehicles to the RSF via its client state (and Sudan's western neighbor), Chad. Egypt, meanwhile, seeks a sympathetic ally in Khartoum as it aims to secure influence over the Nile in the face of Ethiopia's efforts to exercise power over the crucial waterway. To that end, Cairo has sent military aid to the SAF and has allegedly engaged in airstrikes against the RSF. Egypt also relies on Sudanese resources—often smuggled—to help prop up its flailing economy.

Other countries have backed one side or the other, too. Although Saudi Arabia has publicly positioned itself as a peacemaker, it has implicitly sided with the SAF during past rounds of negotiations, in part because of its regional competition with the United Arab Emirates. The SAF has also courted Russia, which wants to establish a military base on the Red Sea, and it recently secured drones from Iran and Turkey, two actors that also want greater influence over nearby shipping lanes.

For these international partners, an informal stalemate is not so different from a negotiated peace. As long as each coalition's area of control remains largely set, the kinds of economic activities important to these patrons can proceed without the bother of negotiating a politically difficult resolution. And foreign backers can maintain lucrative supply lines without the burdens associated with doing business with a legitimate state (such as regulations and tariffs) or popular protests against resource extraction that benefits a small elite.

Perhaps the greatest barriers to achieving a negotiated peace in Sudan, however, are internal. Each broad alliance is dangerously fragile, susceptible to infighting and splits. Given that neither the SAF nor the RSF have a rigid ethnic or sectarian identity, or a publicly professed ideological mission, little commands the loyalty of the smaller allied militias beyond the resources they are currently receiving. The war has already been marked by high-profile defections, such as that of Abu Aqla Kaykal and his Sudan Shield Forces. Kaykal initially aligned with the SAF and then defected to the RSF in mid-2023, proving instrumental to the militia's capture of Sudan's El Gezira state in the country's fertile center. But when the SAF recaptured the region in late 2024, he again switched sides.

Challenging simplistic narratives that cast Sudan's wars as disputes between Arabs and Africans, this conflict has transcended ethnic bonds, which makes each coalition less robust. In October 2024, for instance, as the SAF recaptured El Gezira, some SAF troops and associated militias attacked non-Arab ethnic groups. In retaliation and to protect other non-Arab groups, SLA and JEM forces in El Gezira clashed with SAF-aligned Arab militias, even though those two groups are officially allied with the SAF.

To the extent that the factions' territorial control continues to shift on the margins, that could push further defections. The RSF's recent retreat from central Sudan suggests that the militia may be willing to surrender that territory to focus on cementing its hold over Darfur. That would leave the two major Darfuri groups allied with the SAF—the SLA and the JEM—without any territory under their control, making defection tempting. These complex dynamics complicate peace talks because it is often unclear what each side is really able to offer.

Even if some short-term truce could be reached, the large assortment of ethnic groups and ideological camps that have allied with each side means that restoring social cohesion will be even more difficult. Even before the civil war, the variety of interests at play in Sudan were complicated. After two years of war, fault lines have hardened, and divides have become more emotional.

The country's de facto partition is already beginning. The map of territorial control in Sudan today suggests a bifurcated country, with the west—apart from El Fasher, North Darfur's capital—largely under the RSF's grasp, and the east, north, and center of the country held by the SAF. In February in Nairobi, the RSF and its partners signed a transitional constitutional agreement paving the way for the declaration of a parallel government over the large swaths of land they control.

A split may ostensibly seem an attractive outcome, but it is extremely unlikely to bring durable peace. Both the SAF and the RSF coalitions are fragile: the newly formalized RSF alliance makes strange bedfellows of the staunchly secular SPLM-N and a variety of breakaway factions from Sufi religious orders for whom secularism is a political third rail. The SAF's coalition includes both secular armed groups and Muslim Brotherhood–aligned Islamist militias, but its most important international patrons—Egypt and Saudi Arabia—are staunchly anti-Brotherhood. Furthermore, any new polities would not have contiguous ethnic boundaries. The project of governing heterogeneous regions would be tremendously complicated by Sudan's weak or absent state institutions, especially in historically marginalized territories held by the RSF. And if the country split further, its two nascent polities—one landlocked—would be far less economically viable than if they remained united. Additionally, both the SAF and RSF are moving away from land battles and instead seek to destabilize their rivals' territory with air or drone strikes, making the country as a whole increasingly ungovernable.

Paradoxically, the high degree of fragmentation that makes a unified government so hard to achieve in Sudan is the same thing that makes any solution that splits the country and establishes multiple governments unstable. At present, both broad alliances would be hard-pressed to identify a contiguous area of territory that they and their supporters would be satisfied to maintain and other zones that they are willing to cede. And given the many accusations of war crimes leveled against each side, neither alliance could boast a solid mandate to govern within the territory it controls.

Because the conflict is overwhelmingly driven by a struggle over regional power and resources, rather than any larger political vision for the country, it remains likely that alliances will keep shifting, militias will keep defecting, and breakaway groups will keep forming. Sadly, instead of either peace or partition, Sudan's most likely future is more war.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced a new policy that reduces the default withholding rate to 50 percent for recovering Social Security benefit overpayments under Title II, the federal program covering retirement and disability insurance.

Under the updated directive, any overpayment notice issued on or after April 25 will automatically carry a 50 percent withholding rate. Beneficiaries will have 90 days to respond—either by contesting the overpayment, requesting a waiver, or negotiating a lower repayment rate. If no action is taken within that window, the SSA will start withholding half the monthly benefit until the overpayment is fully repaid.

The updated rules do not apply to Title XVI overpayments, such as those involving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, who still face the 10 percent withholding rate. The revised policy also excludes cases involving fraud or similar fault, which follow different recovery procedures.

With its latest decision to cut the withholding rate in half, the SSA appears to be seeking a middle ground between fiscal responsibility and potential beneficiary hardship.

SSA's overpayment recovery practices have come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and watchdogs in recent years, particularly for the stress they impose on beneficiaries who may have had little or no role in the errors.

The SSA says it has launched an internal review and is working to expand data-sharing with payroll systems to help reduce payment errors.

The young children of a woman who was among 11 people killed when a man drove his vehicle into a Filipino street festival in Vancouver say they will never forget their mother's burst of laughter just a few minutes before her death. 

Ford Johansen, 15, and his seven-year-old sister, Darby, are still trying to accept that it was the last time they saw a smile from their mother, Jenifer Darbellay. They were looking for dessert from a food truck when the SUV came barrelling through.

They ducked down with their father, who saved them from smashing into the pavement, the children said. But Ms. Darbellay, 50, was hit hard and did not survive.

“If you'd ever met her, you'd remember how she was the light in every room she'd go in,” her husband, Noel Johansen, holding the crutches he now needs to walk, speaking along with his children, told The Globe and Mail on Tuesday. 

“Where do we go from here? How do we make sense of any of this? My own physical injuries mean nothing to me, because everything inside me is broken. Our hearts are completely shattered.”

A fuller picture of the victims of the attack at the Lapu-Lapu Day Block Party is emerging, as families and friends begin to identify their loved ones. 

Vancouver police have said 11 people – the youngest a five-year-old girl and the oldest a 65-year-old man – were killed at the festival, describing the Saturday attack as the darkest day in the city's history. 

Dozens of others are injured, including a 22-month-old boy, police said Tuesday. At least seven people – two women and five men, aged between 29 and 66 – are in critical condition.

Adam Lo has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, with more charges expected. Police are confident that the attack was not an act of terrorism, though a motive remains unclear. 

Vancouver resident Alejandro Samper said Tuesday that his mother, Glitza Maria Caicedo, father Daniel Samper and sister Glitza Daniela Samper were killed in the attack. 

He said he has not been able to see his parents' bodies yet to say goodbye, but was at Vancouver General Hospital with his sister's fiancé on Sunday, when she died in the early morning. 

“I'm just destroyed,” Mr. Samper said. “My whole world's taken away from me.” 

His family had escaped the violence in their home country, Colombia, in the early 2000s. “Canada is supposed to be a safe place,” he said.

“It's unacceptable this was allowed to happen.”

Kira Salim, a 34-year-old trans teacher-counsellor, was also identified as one of the victims by their colleagues at the New Westminster school district. They had moved to Canada from Brazil to live more safely as a queer person, said Nadia Sorban, their friend: “They were such a big, energetic, beautiful, smiling human.”

Toan Le said his brother, Richard Le, was killed at the festival with his five-year-old daughter, Katie, and wife, Linh Hoang. Had Katie's brother, 16-year-old Adam, not stayed home to do his homework that night, he also would have been there, Mr. Le said. 

“Just cherish your loved ones,” he said. “You never know when they might not be around, and you won't have a second chance.”

Several fundraising pages have been set up online, with tens of thousands of dollars donated thus far.Jimmy Jeong/The Globe and Mail

Among several fundraising pages set up online, with tens of thousands of dollars donated thus far, Rizza Azzir was confirmed as one of the victims by her cousin, Shelby Anne Marie Pacumio, who requested privacy to process the news. On her GoFundMe page, Ms. Pacumio said Ms. Azzir, “the sweetest soul,” moved to Canada from the Philippines, first to Winnipeg, then Vancouver.

Other victims include Jendhel May Sico, described by sister Maydhel Ann Sico to have always lived life to the fullest, whose death was confirmed by her employees at Winnipeg-based Taiga Building Products; and Maria Victoria Bjarnason, known to most people as Vicky, who was visiting her family in Vancouver.

Kristjan Bjarnason said Ms. Bjarnason, his stepmother, was at the festival with her son, Helgi, when she died. They had just celebrated her birthday the day prior, and she was going to fly back home on Tuesday. 

Helgi was holding his mother's hand and attempted to pull her away from the car, “but unfortunately she was ripped away from him,” Kristjan wrote to The Globe in a Facebook message, adding Helgi was also hit and has a broken leg.

Mr. Johansen and his children say the more stories they hear of the victims, the lesser their pain feels. They have been to several vigils over the last few days, including in the honour of “the sweet, charming and selfless” Ms. Darbellay. 

“It feels like we are all sharing this big terrible thing together,” Mr. Johansen said.

“But,” he added, “please remember what we went through. Please make it so it never happens again to anyone else.”

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was officially suspended by Wisconsin's Supreme Court on April 29, after she was arrested by the FBI on April 25 and accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities.

“It is ordered ... that Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan is temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge in the state of Wisconsin, effective the date of this order and until further order of the court,” the justices wrote in their statement.

Dugan faces one count of “obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency,” and another of “concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.”

Wisconsin's Supreme Court Justices said that it was in the public interest, to protect public confidence, to remove her from her post as she faces those two federal charges. They also noted that they were acting on their own initiative rather than at the request of anyone.

According to the affidavit, witnesses said she appeared “visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor,” upon learning of the arrest party's arrival. Witnesses also alleged that Dugan “escorted” Flores Ruiz and his lawyer “out of the courtroom through the ‘jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse” (the door is only used by defendants if they are in the custody of deputies), after she “ordered” the team of FBI and deportation officials to go to the chief judge's office.

Another officer noticed Flores Ruiz and his lawyer on an elevator and alerted the arrest team, who apprehended him after a foot race outside the courthouse.

Her next court appearance as a defendant is May 15, and she could face more disciplinary actions against her license to practice law.

A state court spokesperson told The Associated Press that a reserve judge began serving in Dugan's place on April 28 and will continue to do so for an indefinite period of time.

The Court's Christian right makeover of the Constitution enters its endgame.

by  Ian Millhiser

During an oral argument on Wednesday, the Supreme Court appeared all but certain to divide along party lines in a case that seeks to fundamentally expand the role religion plays in American public schools. 

This isn't surprising: Almost immediately after Republicans gained a supermajority on the Supreme Court, they started rewriting the Court's religion decisions to make them more favorable to the religious right. One month after Justice Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation gave the GOP their sixth vote on the Court, Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo (2020) revolutionized the Court's approach to religious objectors who seek exemptions from obeying the law — overruling a decision that was only a few months old in the process. 

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Since then, the Court has handed down case after case overruling previous religion decisions, usually to the benefit of the Christian right. The Court's new decisions give religious conservatives far more ability both to ignore laws they do not like, and to demand that the government fund their religious institutions. After less than five years in power, the Court's new majority has rendered the country's religion jurisprudence unrecognizable, even to a lawyer who would have been considered an expert in the Constitution's approach to religion less than a decade ago.

On the surface, Wednesday's argument in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond merely signaled that the Court's Republican majority will very likely take the next incremental step in its seemingly inexorable march toward integration of church and state. 

Upon closer inspection, however, the Oklahoma argument was unlike some of this Court's early forays into religion because some of the Republicans explicitly acknowledged that they are rewriting the Constitution's approach to religion, and a few of them even appeared to signal where they want this revolution to end.

As Justice Brett Kavanuagh said late in the Oklahoma argument, the Court now has a “different constitutional understanding” of whether separation of church and state is even permitted. That new understanding, Kavanaugh suggested, is this: So long as an American can choose not to participate in a state-backed religious operation, church and state do not need to be separate — indeed, separation of church and state is often unconstitutional under this framework.

In Oklahoma, which is about whether states must pay for religious charter schools using taxpayers' money, Kavanaugh's new regime would mandate a great deal of state funding for religious schools, so long as parents retain a “choice” about where to send their child. Under Kavanaugh's approach, if “no student is compelled to go to a religious charter school,” state charter school programs like the Oklahoma program at issue in this case must fund religious instruction.

Again, this approach to religion is fundamentally different from how previous generations of justices viewed the Constitution — in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), for example, the Court said that “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” But, at the very least, the Court's new majority now appears to have settled on the rule it will apply in future cases seeking to mandate government funding of religious faith.

Oklahoma is the culmination of a series of decisions which not only reject Everson, but seek to turn it on its head. The rule is no longer that church and state must be separated. The Court's current majority mandates that they must be entangled with each other.

In fairness, the right of citizens to choose whether to participate in religious institutions has animated the Court's religion cases for quite a while. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), a 5-4 Court ruled that states may voluntarily include religious schools in a private school voucher program, so long as parents ultimately got to decide whether to send their child to a religious school. But Zelman merely established that government funding of religious private schools is permissible, not that it is required.

That changed in a trio of cases that culminated in Carson v. Makin (2022). Carson held that, once a state sets up a private school voucher program, “it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.” So, once a voucher program exists, state funding of religion is now mandatory.

That said, Carson also held that states are still allowed to “provide a strictly secular education in its public schools.” The question in Oklahoma is whether state charter school programs — charter schools are classified as nonreligious public schools under both federal law and the laws of 46 different states, even though they are often run in partnership with a private entity — are allowed to provide the strictly secular education the Court spoke of in Carson.

After Wednesday's oral argument, there appeared to be broad willingness among the Court's Republicans (minus Barrett, who is recused from this case) to expand religious schools' access to public money once again. Those justices seemed ready to rule that Oklahoma's public charter schools are actually private schools, and therefore the state must fund religious charter schools. The specific school at issue in Oklahoma, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, would be the first religious charter school in the nation.

If you accept Carson as legitimate, it's not that much of a stretch to conclude that religious charter schools are mandatory. 

The state's best argument that Carson does not apply to charter schools is that the Court held, in Biden v. Nebraska (2023), that an entity which “was created by the State to further a public purpose, is governed by state officials and state appointees, reports to the State, and may be dissolved by the State” is a public institution, unlike the private schools at issue in Carson. Oklahoma law provides that charter schools cannot exist without state sponsorship, and the state exerts considerable control over charter schools — including approving their curriculum and requiring them to be audited by the state.

But none of the five Republican justices who heard the Oklahoma case appeared persuaded that charter schools count as public entities that are allowed to be strictly secular. Chief Justice John Roberts, the closest thing this Court has to a moderate Republican, compared Oklahoma's charter schools to government contractors — he pointed to the Court's decision in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021) a government contracting case which held that a city could not exclude religious adoption agencies that refuse to place children with same-sex couples from its broader adoption program. 

Meanwhile, many of the justices appeared genuinely angry that religious schools have been excluded from state and federal charter school programs for as long as those programs have existed. Justice Samuel Alito went on a rant about how current law permits charter schools which teach that being LGBTQ is a “perfectly legitimate lifestyle,” but doesn't permit the government to fund religious viewpoints. Kavanaugh, at one point, suggested that the longstanding rule establishing that charter schools must be secular is “rank discrimination against religion.”

In fairness, Kavanaugh at least acknowledged that his Court recently changed the rules. When Gregory Garre, the lawyer defending Oklahoma's ability to have a nonsectarian charter school program, pointed out that both federal law and every relevant state's law provides for secular charter schools, Kavanaugh responded that “at that point it was considered constitutional to discriminate against religious entities.”

Based on Wednesday's argument, it appears likely that the Court will adopt the rule Kavanuagh articulated shortly thereafter — that government funding of religious schools is required so long as individual citizens retain the choice to send their children to a non-religious school.

Democratic Justice Elena Kagan, for her part, spent much of the argument trying to draw out the implications of her Court's new approach to religion. What if a religious charter school refused to educate children who do not share the school's faith? Or suppose that a religious charter school wanted to toss out state curricular standards altogether? She brought up the example of an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva where instruction would focus almost entirely on the Talmud, to the exclusion of topics like math and English. Would taxpayers be required to fund this school as well?

Indeed, the implications of the Court's new rules could be quite significant if they are applied outside of the public school context. If a religious individual believes it is a sin to ride a bus with people of another faith, does that mean that the state must now provide faith-segregated buses? If a city council puts out cookies and potato chips for attendees to snack on, do they violate the Constitution if these snacks are not kosher or halal? What if they are both kosher and halal, but they cannot be eaten by someone who holds the idiosyncratic religious belief that it is a sin to eat unhealthy food? Is the government required by the Constitution to give this person carrot sticks?

Kavanaugh's view, at the very least, suggests that it is unconstitutional discrimination for the government to provide a benefit of any kind without also providing religious versions of that same benefit.

It's worth noting that Oklahoma is the second oral argument in the last several days where the Republican justices appeared eager to reshape public schools in a Christian conservative image. Last week, in Mahmoud v. Taylor, most of the justices sounded extremely sympathetic to religious parents who objected to books being taught in public schools that have LGBTQ characters. Depending on how the Court rules in Mahmoud, it could impose such high burdens on schools that want to teach such books that public school districts will have little choice but to exclude them — effectively imposing a “Don't Say Gay” rule on every public school in the country.

The Court's rulings in both cases will come in the next few months. But for now, it appears the Republican justices' religious conservative revolution is likely to march onward, remaking public schools, and potentially many other public institutions.

Trump filled the Supreme Court bench with anti-government saboteurs. But will they sabotage him?

Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.

Many of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.

The two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.

﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.

How can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said at a gathering of President Donald Trump's Cabinet that the agency was undergoing a restructuring to eliminate "well-documented politicization." 

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that a restructuring was underway at President Donald Trump's direction to eliminate "well-documented politicization" of the agency. 

Trump joked during a meeting of his Cabinet secretaries on Wednesday that perhaps Ratcliffe was the only one "who's not allowed to talk about the great job he's done," given the classified nature of the Central Intelligence Agency's work. 

"At your direction, the CIA has deployed our unique covert action, authorities in various places and continents, to successfully advance your national security and foreign policy priorities, to advance peace, to end wars, to take terrorists off the battlefield, and to keep illicit drugs from coming into this country and harming Americans," Ratcliffe reported to Trump, in front of news cameras. "Unfortunately, as much as I would love to detail your accomplishments in that regard, we can't do so with this crowd. But you and I both know, Mr. President, that you have had a profound positive impact on America's national security posture. And Americans are safer because of your leadership."

"Mr. President, the CIA is being restructured at your direction to focus on our core mission and to eliminate the political – the well-documented politicization that has taken place in the intelligence community from bad actors in the past to focus on our core mission and to Make America Safe Again," Ratcliffe added, thanking Trump for the opportunity without elaborating further. 

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also referenced efforts to combat "politicization" within the intelligence community at the Cabinet meeting. 

"I'm grateful to have the privilege of leading the intelligence community towards ending the weaponization. Politicization of the intelligence community has gone on for far too long," Gabbard said. "And building out what is truly a lean and agile and effective intelligence community that is helping you deliver that promise to the American people of safety, security, and freedom." 

"We're working every day to hold the deep state accountable to end the politicization of weaponization of the intelligence community," Gabbard continued. "This past week, I sent three criminal referrals for illegal and unauthorized leaks to the media of classified intelligence for prosecution. We have 11 more that are under investigation. We've revoked, at your direction, 67 security clearances, and we continue the work of declassifying documents." 

The U.S. government has already declassified documents surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and Gabbard said she was working to declassify more documents around the assassination of former U.S. Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy – the father of Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as the assassination of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.

TRUMP TO NAME HAITIAN GANGS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS: REPORT

"And we continue our extensive investigations around exposing the very serious issues we have related to election integrity, illegal abuses of FISA, Crossfire Hurricane, and others," Gabbard said. "Mr. President, under your leadership, we are working every day to bring about that transparency and accountability that the American people deserve." 

Last month, Trump signed an executive order instructing the FBI to immediately declassify files concerning the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, the agency probe launched in 2016 that sought information on whether Trump campaign members colluded with Russia during the presidential race.

At the Cabinet meeting, another U.S. intelligence leader, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, separately acknowledged that multiple federal agencies came together under the president's leadership to capture terrorists, including the "evil individual responsible for the Abbey Gate bombing" during the Biden administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal. Thirteen U.S. service members and roughly 170 Afghan civilians were killed when an ISIS-K suicide bomber detonated at Kabul's airport.

One of those agencies was the CIA. Ratcliffe told the gathering of Cabinet secretaries that the CIA "provided the intelligence that led to the apprehension of the Abbey Gate bomber, who is now being prosecuted by our great attorney general and providing a measure of justice to those 13 families that suffered as a result of that disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, during the last administration."  

Trump reiterated at the Cabinet meeting that what happened at Abbey Gate was a "disgrace" under the Biden administration and that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is working on prosecuting the alleged planner of the attack. The Justice Department announced last month that ISIS-K member Mohammad Sharifullah, also known as "Jafar," has been arrested on federal terrorism charges in connection to the attack and was extradited to the U.S. He made a brief appearance in Virginia federal court.

Ratcliffe also told the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the CIA, at Trump's direction, has negotiated and secured the release of Americans like Mark Fogel and Ksenia Karelina, "who had been wrongfully detained, sending the message that you will forget about no Americans that are being held in other places unfairly and unjustly."

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is ready to sign an agreement that would give the U.S. access to its valuable rare minerals in the hopes of ensuring continued American support for Kyiv in its grinding war with Russia, senior Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.

Ukraine's economy minister and deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal, according to two senior Ukrainian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.

“Truly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Ukrainian television. “This is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.”

U.S. President Donald Trump indicated in February that he wanted access to Ukraine's rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the war, describing it as reimbursement for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has given to Kyiv. But talks stalled after a tense Oval Office meeting of U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, and reaching an agreement since then has proven difficult and strained relations between Washington and Kyiv.

It wasn't immediately clear if the Trump administration was also ready to finalize the deal Wednesday.

The U.S. is seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.

After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.

According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine's path toward European Union membership — a key provision for Kyiv.

The Ukrainian Cabinet was expected to approve the agreement's text before it could be signed in Washington. The deal would then need to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it could take effect.

The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.

Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, “but before it's done, it's necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.

“We realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,” Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.

Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine's territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

Trump has chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for steps that he said were prolonging the killing, and he has rebuked Putin for complicating negotiations with “very bad timing” in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.

Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.

“We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,” department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.

Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine's mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.





Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.

Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.

The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.

Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia's Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student from the West Bank, after Mahdawi spent more than two weeks in immigration detention following his abrupt arrest during a naturalization interview.

The 34-year-old permanent U.S. resident was detained by armed Department of Homeland Security agents on April 14 while seeking U.S. citizenship in Vermont. Mahdawi has been held since then at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, and his case has drawn national attention over the Trump administration's targeting of pro-Palestinian student activists.

“The two weeks of detention so far demonstrate great harm to a person who has been charged with no crime,” said U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, according to ABC News. “Mr. Mahdawi, I will order you released.”

Crawford's order allows Mahdawi to be released on bail, pending the final outcome of his case in federal court.

The government cited national security concerns in seeking to keep him in custody.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the arrest in a DHS notice, stating Mahdawi's “presence and activities” in the United States would pose “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”

Prosecutors also alleged Mahdawi had expressed support for antisemitic violence and had “an interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose,” according to sealed government filings seen by NBC.

Originally from the al Fara'a refugee camp in the West Bank, Mahdawi immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and began studying at Columbia in 2021.

“I am saying it clear and loud to President Trump and his Cabinet: I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said outside the courtroom after his release, according to NBC News.

The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement actions against Middle Eastern students tied to pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Mahdawi is the second Columbia student in recent weeks to face detention. 

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T HAVE ARREST WARRANT FOR MAHMOUD KHALIL, CITING ‘FLIGHT RISK'

Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student who led protests against the war in Gaza, was arrested at his New York apartment on March 8. A judge ruled on April 11 that Khalil can be deported, though he remains in custody while appealing the decision.

The Washington Examiner contacted the Justice Department and DHS for comment.

Advice author Lysa TerKeurst has a devoted audience, a dozen bestselling books — and she's divorced.

by  Aja Romano

For decades, Christian relationship advice has trended toward regressive ideas about gender: namely, that women should be submissive to their husbands, who in turn are the head of the household. Those ideas arguably penetrated the mainstream with the rise of the tradwife and the idyllic image of the monogamous home life she represents. 

Yet the romantic lives of modern Christian advice-givers are often a lot more complex than the traditional marriage roles they espouse. Millions of Christian conservative women who follow these authors seem to recognize that the writers' imperfections are part of a longer journey toward self-improvement — a journey that might also reflect their own.

Nowhere is that contradiction more evident than in mega-successful Christian author and influencer Lysa TerKeurst. 

On her way to amassing 3 million followers across social media, writing half a dozen New York Times bestsellers, and launching her own media network, TerKeurst has made messy confessionals a core part of her brand. TerKeurst spent most of the 2010s building her brand out of affirmative, Instagram-ready self-help advice, leaning heavily on the wholesome image of her family and her 25-year marriage. But then, something happened that might have been a dealbreaker for other Christian authors: TerKeurst got a divorce. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Similar episodes have damaged the careers of Christian celebrities who were branded “false teachers” and could not overcome perceptions of having sinned. TerKeurst, however, not only acknowledged her own failed relationship — she mined it for further wisdom, placing her among a new wave of Christian self-help authors, who are writing more candidly about their struggles. TerKeurst's audience has responded by making her one of the most successful authors in the genre: She currently has not one, not two, but five books concurrently on the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association's Christian bestsellers list. 

TerKeurst's popularity appears to demonstrate a longing for a less rigid, more forgiving view of Christian relationships, even as her fans continue to revere the idea of a traditional marriage.

For decades, the average Christian self-help book has framed marriage as a divinely ordained arrangement that's ultimately about serving God and reifying gender roles. Classic texts like 1963's Fascinating Womanhood and 1984's Passion and Purity that are still popular today forward antiquated views on women (for example that man is “the initiator,” woman “the responder” and “helper”), while the purity culture that dominated the books of the '90s continues to influence today's authors. 

From the beginning, TerKeurst was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers.

The theme of women's submission to men was and is ubiquitous. To get a flavor, just read a passage from Stormie Omartian's 1996 bestseller The Power of a Praying Wife: “Lord, help me to be a good wife,” she writes. “Take my selfishness, impatience, and irritability and turn them into kindness, long-suffering, and the willingness to bear all things.”

It was into this crowded, archaic environment that TerKeurst, in the early 2000s, launched her long and determined writing career, peddling general advice aimed mainly at Christian women. From the beginning, she was an outlier in advocating mutual partnerships in marriages — a theme well out of step with her peers. 

In 2002, for example, she published a pair of guides, one for men and one for women, in which she outlined her marriage philosophy. She parroted the usual evangelical tropes about submission and gender difference (one chapter of her women's guide is titled “Boys will be boys”), but she also pointed out to men that “Your wife needs you to be her teammate in raising the kids and taking care of the home.”

TerKeurst also blogged incessantly, gradually building a following by focusing on lifestyle and dieting advice. Among her key attributes was vulnerability: In 2008, she wrote about getting an abortion a few months after she began dating her husband, and how the accompanying guilt and shame subsequently impacted her marriage. 

Her breakout success didn't come until her 14th release, 2011's Made to Crave: Satisfying Your Deepest Desire With God, Not Food. TerKeurst's spin on diet culture, and the divine stamp she put on the pressure to be thin, proved popular. The book wound up hitting the New York Times bestseller list, reportedly selling 200,000 copies in nine months. From there, TerKeurst became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today, helping her reach a wider audience. 

Her bite-sized, memorable aphorisms around the messages of self-image and empowerment (e.g. “those who constantly try to impress others will depress themselves”) were tailor-made for the early years of Instagram and other social media, alongside a perpetual barrage of family photos with attractive filters of her husband and their five kids. While her blog frequently embraced her struggles as a mother and wife, her social media image was a pastel montage of a cozy life of family, fabulous vacations, and famous friends, as well as loving tributes to her husband, businessman Art TerKeurst. 

From the start of her writing career, TerKeurst wrote about ongoing issues in her marriage; in 2002's Capture Her Heart, she wrote about starting off the marriage with a host of issues and seeing multiple couples counselors without success. A decade and a half later, in a since-deleted 2017 blog post, TerKeurst revealed that her husband had been having an affair for several years, as well as experienced substance abuse. “I've always encouraged women to fight for their marriages and to do everything possible to save them when they come under threat,” she wrote. “So, for the past couple of years I have been in the hardest battle of my life trying to save my marriage.” 

The news drew shocked reactions, but many of TerKeurst's fans were sympathetic. “Art and Lisa TerKeurst are a fairly ‘famous' Christian family,” one Christian blogger wrote after TerKeurst's post announcing her divorce. “Now, through her transparency in the demise of her marriage, I have learned something about my marriage ... At some point, Art TerKeurst made one bad choice that led to a slew of others. And so can I. And so can my spouse. And so can you and yours.”

Despite her intent to get a divorce, the following year the couple renewed their vows instead in a high-profile ceremony. That new recommitment didn't last, however; in 2022, TerKeurst detailed in an Instagram post that despite ongoing efforts to repair her marriage, her husband had continued to cheat, ultimately firming her resolve to choose divorce. 

“I've had to learn the hard way there's a big difference between mistakes (which we all make) and chosen patterns of behavior that dishonor God and the biblical covenant of marriage,” she wrote.

TerKeurst wasn't the only high-profile Christian advice author who was caught up in a divorce scandal through this period; Christian blogger Glennon Doyle had a similar experience in 2016, only to swiftly fall for another woman, break with evangelical culture, and start a hit liberal podcast. 

TerKeurst, though, chose a less rebellious path: She continued to publish her relationship advice to her audience of Christian women looking for love in a so-called traditional marriage — only now her emphasis shifted to processing the trauma of a failed relationship. Rather than sticking out a toxic situation at all costs, she now leaned into the idea of letting God help her and her audience heal from heartbreak and betrayal while learning to set boundaries. 

“We can't enable bad behavior in ourselves and others and call it love,” she wrote in 2022's Good Boundaries and Goodbye. “We can't tolerate destructive patterns and call it love.” And in 2024's I Want to Trust You, but I Don't: “Rebuilding trust requires a combination of three things: Time, believable behavior, and a track record of trustworthiness.” 

This message of empowerment and insistence on the right to exit a floundering relationship is a far cry from the vast majority of Christian advice literature, with its emphasis on submission and staying in the marriage at all costs. But it's increasingly a part of the literary and social media diet of Christian women.

“Christian women authors, as with many mainstream women authors, derive a lot of their authority from their vulnerability,” journalist Katelyn Beaty, author of Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church, told Vox in an email. “Self-disclosure in the form of storytelling is a kind of credentialing.” 

Writers like Rebekah Lyons and Ann Voskamp, for example, have opened up about their mental health struggles, while others like Jennie Allen have been painfully honest about their relationship struggles, such as Allen's husband's ongoing depression. 

Overly idealized social media feeds and stories from influencers have even drawn backlash from audiences for presenting a false view of Christianity. Women are now gravitating toward influencers like TerKeurst who offer a less glossy version of their lives. 

“Christian women want to feel that their favorite authors and Instagram follows are as flawed and ‘broken' as they are,” Beaty said, “even if they still appear on social media with perfect hair, beautiful families, and fashionable clothing.” 

“Christian influencers and self-help experts are still held to a high moral and spiritual standard,” she added, citing influential figures like Carl Lentz, who was fired from Hillsong Church after an affair and allegations of abusing his staff. “But authors may be held to a lower standard than people in official church and ministry leadership positions…Christians can relate strongly to a story of confessing sin, admitting brokenness, and seeking forgiveness and change.” 

While TerKeurst's embrace of her own relationship difficulties has only boosted her marketability, she isn't without controversy. Her conservative detractors have claimed that she's too liberal, while others have accused her of forwarding various “non-Biblical claims,” including “instructing men,” and for allying with proponents of the controversial prosperity gospel. Other critics have pointed out that her media company, Proverbs 31 Ministry, accepted $690,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loans following the pandemic, despite her lucrative income; her speaker fees alone reportedly range from $20,000 to $30,000.

In 2024, about two years after TerKeurst's divorce announcement, she remarried and restarted newlywed life. Her books, however, are still looking backward: Her next release, due this fall, is titled Surviving an Unwanted Divorce. 

TerKeurst has managed to develop a deep bond with her readers and constructed a durable fan base by strategically sharing bits of herself, knowing she wasn't alone in her experiences. “This beautifully honest, candid and encouraging book has been a therapist, a nurse and a friend to me throughout the darkest winter of my life,” one reviewer wrote of the 2023 devotional collection You're Going to Make It. “Thank you Lysa. By sharing your journey, you eased mine. I am very grateful.”

A decade and a half later, in a since-deleted 2017 blog post, TerKeurst revealed that her husband had been having an affair for several years, as well as experienced substance abuse. “I've always encouraged women to fight for their marriages and to do everything possible to save them when they come under threat,” she wrote. “So, for the past couple of years I have been in the hardest battle of my life trying to save my marriage.” 

The news drew shocked reactions, but many of TerKeurst's fans were sympathetic. “Art and Lisa TerKeurst are a fairly ‘famous' Christian family,” one Christian blogger wrote after TerKeurst's post announcing her divorce. “Now, through her transparency in the demise of her marriage, I have learned something about my marriage ... At some point, Art TerKeurst made one bad choice that led to a slew of others. And so can I. And so can my spouse. And so can you and yours.”

Despite her intent to get a divorce, the following year the couple renewed their vows instead in a high-profile ceremony. That new recommitment didn't last, however; in 2022, TerKeurst detailed in an Instagram post that despite ongoing efforts to repair her marriage, her husband had continued to cheat, ultimately firming her resolve to choose divorce. 

“I've had to learn the hard way there's a big difference between mistakes (which we all make) and chosen patterns of behavior that dishonor God and the biblical covenant of marriage,” she wrote.

TerKeurst wasn't the only high-profile Christian advice author who was caught up in a divorce scandal through this period; Christian blogger Glennon Doyle had a similar experience in 2016, only to swiftly fall for another woman, break with evangelical culture, and start a hit liberal podcast. 

TerKeurst, though, chose a less rebellious path: She continued to publish her relationship advice to her audience of Christian women looking for love in a so-called traditional marriage — only now her emphasis shifted to processing the trauma of a failed relationship. Rather than sticking out a toxic situation at all costs, she now leaned into the idea of letting God help her and her audience heal from heartbreak and betrayal while learning to set boundaries. 

“We can't enable bad behavior in ourselves and others and call it love,” she wrote in 2022's Good Boundaries and Goodbye. “We can't tolerate destructive patterns and call it love.” And in 2024's I Want to Trust You, but I Don't: “Rebuilding trust requires a combination of three things: Time, believable behavior, and a track record of trustworthiness.” 

This message of empowerment and insistence on the right to exit a floundering relationship is a far cry from the vast majority of Christian advice literature, with its emphasis on submission and staying in the marriage at all costs. But it's increasingly a part of the literary and social media diet of Christian women.

“Christian women authors, as with many mainstream women authors, derive a lot of their authority from their vulnerability,” journalist Katelyn Beaty, author of Celebrities for Jesus: How Personas, Platforms, and Profits Are Hurting the Church, told Vox in an email. “Self-disclosure in the form of storytelling is a kind of credentialing.” 

Writers like Rebekah Lyons and Ann Voskamp, for example, have opened up about their mental health struggles, while others like Jennie Allen have been painfully honest about their relationship struggles, such as Allen's husband's ongoing depression. 

Overly idealized social media feeds and stories from influencers have even drawn backlash from audiences for presenting a false view of Christianity. Women are now gravitating toward influencers like TerKeurst who offer a less glossy version of their lives. 

“Christian women want to feel that their favorite authors and Instagram follows are as flawed and ‘broken' as they are,” Beaty said, “even if they still appear on social media with perfect hair, beautiful families, and fashionable clothing.” 

“Christian influencers and self-help experts are still held to a high moral and spiritual standard,” she added, citing influential figures like Carl Lentz, who was fired from Hillsong Church after an affair and allegations of abusing his staff. “But authors may be held to a lower standard than people in official church and ministry leadership positions…Christians can relate strongly to a story of confessing sin, admitting brokenness, and seeking forgiveness and change.” 

While TerKeurst's embrace of her own relationship difficulties has only boosted her marketability, she isn't without controversy. Her conservative detractors have claimed that she's too liberal, while others have accused her of forwarding various “non-Biblical claims,” including “instructing men,” and for allying with proponents of the controversial prosperity gospel. Other critics have pointed out that her media company, Proverbs 31 Ministry, accepted $690,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loans following the pandemic, despite her lucrative income; her speaker fees alone reportedly range from $20,000 to $30,000.

In 2024, about two years after TerKeurst's divorce announcement, she remarried and restarted newlywed life. Her books, however, are still looking backward: Her next release, due this fall, is titled Surviving an Unwanted Divorce. 

TerKeurst has managed to develop a deep bond with her readers and constructed a durable fan base by strategically sharing bits of herself, knowing she wasn't alone in her experiences. “This beautifully honest, candid and encouraging book has been a therapist, a nurse and a friend to me throughout the darkest winter of my life,” one reviewer wrote of the 2023 devotional collection You're Going to Make It. “Thank you Lysa. By sharing your journey, you eased mine. I am very grateful.”

            President Donald Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that he could secure the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month but refuses to do so.
    


            The comments appear to contradict previous remarks made by him and his top aides who say the US does not have the ability to return Abrego Garcia because he is in the custody of a foreign government, despite the Supreme Court's ruling that the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return.
    


            “You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk,” ABC News' Terry Moran, said to Trump during an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday night.
    


            “I could,” Trump replied.
    


            Pointing to the phone, Moran said: “You could pick it up and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the President of El Salvador and say, ‘Send him back.'”
    


            “And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” the president added. “But he is not.”
    


            “I'm not the one making this decision,” Trump said, adding that he says government lawyers do not want to help bring Abrego Garcia back to the US.

How the deportation of a Salvadoran man has become a hinge point in US history



            The administration admitted in court last month that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, was deported because of an administrative error, ignoring a judge's 2019 ruling that he couldn't be sent back to his native El Salvador, where his life could be in danger.
    


            US officials, however, have since refused to return Abrego Garcia to the US, arguing they lack power to force El Salvador to do so.
    


            “That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters earlier in April.
    


            Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a recent meeting with Trump that his administration isn't “very fond of releasing terrorists” detained in his country and vowed to keep Abrego Garcia in prison.
    


            Abrego Garcia entered the US illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 withheld his removal, citing concerns for his safety. That meant he could not be deported to El Salvador but could be deported to another country. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            US officials detained the father of three on March 12 and deported him after alleging that he was confirmed to be a member of MS-13 by a “reliable source.”
    


            The Trump administration has designated the MS-13 gang as a foreign terrorist organization. Abrego Garcia and his wife, however, dispute the claim and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward it.



            “This is a MS-13 gang member,” Trump again said in the ABC interview, citing Abrego Garcia's tattooed hands which contain skulls covering their eyes, ears and mouth, which a police document described as “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture.”
    


            “He said he wasn't a member of a gang. And then they looked on his knuckles, he had MS-13,” Trump said, claiming Abrego Garcia's knuckles displayed the name of the gang.
    


            Moran responded that the Maryland man “had some tattoos that are interpreted that way” and that the numbers and letters were “photoshopped.”
    


            Trump repeatedly argued, however, in response that a photo that was posted on Truth Social of Abrego Garcia's knuckles was not photoshopped, while criticizing the ABC News journalist, telling Moran at one point, “No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted.”
    


            The online photo displayed Abrego Garcia's tattooed knuckles with the letters and numbers of the gang above each tattoo and was altered to show the correlation of each tattoo to what the Trump administration says relates him to the name of the gang.
    


            Experts have cast doubt over whether Abrego Garcia's tattoos prove gang ties.
    


            The judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case said last Tuesday that the Trump administration was not acting in “good faith” and accused officials of intentional noncompliance with their obligation to produce information.
    


This story has been updated to including additional developments and information from Trump's interview.

NEW YORK (AP) — A former TV production assistant told a jury Wednesday that Harvey Weinstein held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her after she told him: “No, no — it's not going to happen.” 

Dabbing her eyes, Miriam Haley recalled what ran through her mind during the alleged July 2006 assault: “The unthinkable was happening, I just thought any unthinkable thing could happen. I just didn't know where it ended.” 

Weinstein, sitting between his lawyers, shook his head as she spoke.

Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is the first of the ex-Hollywood honcho's accusers to testify at his rape retrial. It's happening because New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction. 

The 73-year-old former studio boss has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone. 

Haley testified at the original trial and was candid last year about her mixed feelings about repeating the experience. 

Weinstein's attorneys haven't yet had their chance to question her and potentially try to poke holes in her account. But the defense has sought vigorously — if often unsuccessfully — to rein in the scope of Haley's testimony by objecting to prosecutors' questions, such as multiple queries about whether she had any sexual interest in Weinstein. Haley said she did not.

The defense has argued that all of Weinstein's accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business. 




Haley began her testimony Tuesday by describing how she got to know Weinstein, briefly worked as a production assistant on his company's reality show “Project Runway” in June 2006 and had a series of interactions with him that were sometimes inappropriate and suggestive, but other times professional and polite. 

Throughout, Haley said, she was only looking for professional opportunity — not sex or romance — with the then-powerful producer of such Oscar winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Gangs of New York.” 

Weinstein's retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.

He's also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.

Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.

The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.

Michael Bolton refuses to go down without a fight.

Over the past year and a half, the two-time Grammy Award winner has been battling glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer, People magazine reported Wednesday in a cover story. The singer was diagnosed with glioblastoma in December 2023 after undergoing emergency surgery.

According to the outlet, the 72-year-old's short-term memory, speech and mobility have been impacted by his treatment. The outlet reported that Bolton "has purposely not been given a prognosis." Still, he's optimistic.

"You're reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought," the father of three told the outlet. "Succumbing to the challenge is not an option. You're really quickly drawn into a duel. I guess that's the way you find out what you're made of."

According to the outlet, doctors were able to remove Bolton's brain tumor in its entirety during his 2023 surgery. Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 following an infection. He finished radiation and chemotherapy treatment in October of that year. He now undergoes MRIs every two months to ensure his tumor hasn't returned.

Bolton first shared news of his illness with fans on Instagram in January 2024. At the time, he announced that he was taking a break from touring as he focused on his recovery. Bolton's website shared that the musician was expected to start his tour in February of that year with shows throughout 2024.

"It is always the hardest thing for me to ever disappoint my fans or postpone a show, but I have no doubt I am working hard to accelerate my recovery and get back to performing soon," he wrote at the time.

People revealed that Bolton's most recent scan took place in April – it was clear. Now it's all about monitoring. According to the Glioblastoma Foundation, the recurrence rate for the disease is about 90%.

Still, his battle goes on with "grace and humor."

On Christmas Day, Michael Bolton shared a new photo of himself with his family enjoying the holiday season. "Sending warm wishes for a holiday season filled with peace, love, and joy," the star captioned the post. "May the New Year bring health, happiness, and countless moments to cherish. Here's to fresh starts and beautiful moments in 2025!" (Facebook)

"Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you're not alone going through it is a big deal," said the star. "It actually helps people to know. It reminds them that they're not alone."

Bolton has turned to family for comfort. He's been healing at his home in Westport, Connecticut, where he's lived for more than 30 years. 

The outlet shared that he spends much of his time with his daughters, whom he shares with his ex-wife Maureen McGuire. He also dedicates his time to his six grandchildren: Amelia, 14, Olivia, 13, Dylan, 11, Grayson, 10, River, 9, and Jack, 8. They especially enjoy family trivia night, which takes place regularly.

Bolton also finds comfort in pursuing his love of music. He takes voice lessons and voice therapy with a coach online. He also keeps busy meditating daily, playing golf and working out with a personal trainer.

"I find comfort in general more easily," Bolton explained. "[The whole experience] gives me a heightened sense of appreciation. It's unthinkable for it to be OK not to make the most of your life. I think we develop capabilities and problem management, and we learn how to make the best out of a bad situation."

"You have to be a cheerleader for yourself," he stressed.

The outlet shared that Bolton now looks at his legacy differently. Before, it was about his lasting career as an artist. Throughout his 50-year reign in music, he's sold more than 75 million records. But now, it's about preparing his daughters for the future and sharing plenty of life lessons along the way. Family will always come first.

"How do I give things that they can take forward?" said Bolton. "Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give [them] – I want to be on the right side of that, so they feel great about who they are. It's a reality of mortality. Suddenly, a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?'"

"I want to keep going," Bolton continued. "I feel there's still a lot to do on the fight side. I got a title for a song – ‘Ain't Going Down Without a Fight.'"

"I got a title for a song: ‘Ain't Going Down Without a Fight,'" said Michael Bolton to People magazine. (Craig Barritt/Getty Images)

In 2023, Bolton told People magazine he deeply values his relationships with his daughters and other loved ones within his circle.

"I'm filled with more love and pride in my girls as they raise their own families," he said at the time. "Watching them parent, watching them speaking to their kids. I'm just so proud of them."

"Time brings wisdom," he reflected. "Experience brings wisdom. And the important things never really change. Love is the center of the universe.

"There's nothing greater, more powerful, more healing, more promising, than love. Your family, your friends, your significant relationships – that doesn't change. I think what you learn is that love is the most important thing, the people you love and care for in your life."

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House Monday that illegal immigration is not a ‘victimless crime.'

FIRST ON FOX: A plane full of Central Asian illegal immigrants is on its way from the U.S. to Uzbekistan under a deal brokered between the two governments, Fox News Digital has learned. 

More than 100 unlawful immigrants are flying back to Uzbekistan on Wednesday under an agreement with the U.S., with the Uzbek government footing the bill for the return of its own nationals – the first such deal by a foreign government since President Donald Trump took office. The flight, which took off this morning, had 131 migrants on board. 

People from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan were on board the flight, and Kyrgyzstan and Kazahkstan nationals are expected to continue on to their home countries from Uzbekistan.

The deal, which the Trump administration says is a model framework for how it wants other nations to engage with the U.S. on immigration, is the result of months of diplomatic engagement between State Department officials, DHS officials, the White House and the National Security Council with their counterparts from Uzbekistan.

The deal "underscores the deep security cooperation between our nations and sets a standard for U.S. alliances," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement.

"We commend Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev for his leadership in sending a flight to return 131 illegal aliens back to their home country," said DHS  Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement. "We look forward to continuing to work together with Uzbekistan on efforts to enhance our mutual security and uphold the rule of law."

Uzbekistan, with its more than 37 million people, is a security partner of the U.S. in Central Asia, situated in the neighborhood of Iran, China and Afghanistan.

The arrangement follows a deal brokered by the Trump administration after a showdown with Colombia, by which the South American country agreed to accept its nationals, including those on military planes, after President Gustavo Petro originally rejected two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying unlawful migrants. 

It also follows an agreement with El Salvador, by which President Nayib Bukele agreed to receive not only his own nationals but those from Venezuela and potentially other countries that will not take their own citizens back from the U.S. Many of the immigrants are suspected of gang ties and are being held in El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested 66,463 illegal immigrants and removed 65,682 of them.

Border encounters dropped to an average of 11,363 per day in February and March, Trump's first two full months in office, compared to an average of nearly 160,000 during the Biden administration.

Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion.

Hulk Hogan felt sure he was onto something.

After watching the NCAA Division I wrestling championships, he was absolutely certain.

Hogan is one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time, and he stayed in that lane until his teenage stepson pulled him into watching freestyle wrestling. After becoming more familiar with it, Hogan started to believe the sport could become more popular and profitable with the right promotion.

Then, it happened. Last month, Oklahoma State's Wyatt Hendrickson stunned Minnesota's Gable Steveson — an Olympic gold medalist in Tokyo — with a late takedown to claim the national title at heavyweight.

Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump after his victory last month in Philadelphia. Then, with a United States flag draped over his shoulders, the Air Force second lieutenant walked over and shook Trump's hand and hugged him.

Hendrickson's dramatic win and the moments that followed vaulted freestyle wrestling into the mainstream and made the timing perfect for Hogan to help launch Real American Freestyle. He'll be commissioner of a league that announced its plans on Wednesday.

Hogan wants the league to provide more earnings opportunities for a sport that historically has lacked them. And after Hendrickson's big moment, he feels the time is now.

“When I saw that happen and I saw our President hug him, I went, OK, we are on point, we're ready to go and instincts have prevailed and I smell victory,” Hogan said. “I think we're right on track, brother.”




Hogan, who at 71 still has those massive arms and the charisma to match, initially was a bit worried that the freestyle wrestlers might not have the personality to sell tickets. He changed his mind as he began to connect with them.

“Dude, they've all got that edge,” he said. “These kids are young, they're smart. They're watching TV. They know about branding, they know what sells. And they've all got that little Conor McGregor swag.”

Real American Freestyle events will feature single matches at eight men's and four women's weight classes. The first event is scheduled for Aug. 30 in Cleveland, with other sites to be named in the coming months.

Freestyle wrestling has been hot in the United States in recent years. The women's U.S. Olympic freestyle team earned four medals in six weight classes in 2024, while the men claimed three medals. And according to the National Federation of High Schools, wrestling set participation records for boys and girls in 2023 and 2024.

Hogan said Kennedy Blades, an American who earned a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will be the face of the women's division. Zahid Valencia and Ben Askren have agreed to participate on the men's side.

Hogan said Hendrickson and Steveson are possible additions, and his eyes lit up when the subject of a possible rematch came up.

“How much can we say,” Hogan asked his advisors. “It's on the radar.”

Hogan's Real American Beer serves as the title sponsor, and he has plenty of support. Chad Bronstein is the co-founder and president. Left Lane Capital, which has backed Gerard Piqué's Kings League, Shaun White's Snow League and League One Volleyball, among other things, has added this to its list of ventures. Cassius is another sponsor.

Hogan knows some fans will be shocked that his next step does not involve pro wrestling, but he's confident in his decision.

“The idea was so exciting that I get a chance to be involved with all these young people and help guide them in any way, especially to make them huge stars and create a future for them,” he said. “People might be surprised, but wrestling is wrestling, brother.”

Because of name, image and likeness deals, college athletes will be able to participate, though Hogan said the league won't interfere with college, national and international competitions.

Hogan did bring in one connection from his pro wrestling days. Eric Bischoff, who ran World Championship Wrestling in its heyday in the late 1990s and created the famous New World Order storyline, will be the chief media officer.

“Eric jumped in with both feet, and he's doing a lot to guide this ship right now, brother,” Hogan said. “He's setting so much stuff up production wise — just moving us forward, light years ahead of where we could have been on our own.”

Israel Martinez is the chief operating officer. He is an accomplished wrestling coach who has helped build champions in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the wrestling coach for Jon Jones and he coached Holly Holm when she upset Ronda Rousey. Hogan said Martinez played a key role in getting USA Wrestling's blessing.

Hogan considers the new league an alternative to pro wrestling.

“I see this as an opportunity for me to get involved,” Hogan said, “to get back, quit sitting on the couch, to get involved with a bunch of powerful athletes that I can relate to as far as championship material, guys that are on top of their game, and I just — I couldn't pass on it.”

Before games, Dallas forward Matt Duchene relies on the same, tried-and-true routine. He blocks out a two-hour window for a nap, eats an identical meal — pasta and salmon — and spends time reviewing notes he's made in his journal.

Like many NHL players and coaches, Duchene is a creature of habit. Little pregame rituals and routines help them slip into the proper frame of mind for the next big game.

These familiar patterns can be sleep- or food-related. Or revolve around how they get dressed for a game. Or the way they warm up. Or how they tinker with their hockey sticks. Or be as simple as taking their dog for a walk.

Be careful, though, to lump these in with superstitions like Patrick Roy talking to his goalposts or Brendan Shanahan listening to Madonna. 

“I have a routine, but I don't think that means you're superstitious,” Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson explained. “Lots of guys have routines.”

Food seems to be a common theme. Many have their go-to menu on game day.

For Vegas forward Pavel Dorofeyev, it's pasta with alfredo sauce and chicken, while Stars forward Mikko Rantanen prefers chicken, pasta and sweet potatoes. Vegas forward Tomas Hertl has the same breakfast every morning — scrambled eggs with mushrooms, ham and onions. 

It used to be 13 meatballs with lingonberry sauce and mashed potatoes with gravy for Minnesota Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson. But he's changed it up this season.




“Went to a restaurant instead,” Gustavsson said. “It makes it a little easier.”

On the ice, Avalanche goaltender Scott Wedgewood follows the same steps before each period. He taps the crossbar, the right post, left post, back to his blade and the crossbar, each pad twice and then his gloves.

“That's just been a game-on, turn-the-engine-on, type thing,” said Wedgewood, whose pregame meal is usually chickpea pasta with marinara sauce, two chicken breasts and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. “If I didn't do it, I don't think it would mentally screw me up.” 

Coaches aren't immune to their routines, either.

Over the years, Stars coach Pete DeBoer has taken to walking through downtown Denver to get to the arena (the Stars and Avalanche are meeting for a second straight postseason). It's become a tradition for him.

“I'm probably going to get mugged now that I'm telling you this,” DeBoer cracked. “It's a nice walk to the hotel.”

Sometimes, he even stops along the way at a pizza joint for a slice.

“They have a jalapeno-popper pizza with grape jelly,” DeBoer said. “Sounds crazy, but may be the best thing I've ever tasted.”

All routines are subject to change. Unless, of course, it involves how players put on their uniform.

“I always dress (the same) — left skate, left shin pad, left elbow (pad), but I don't even think about it,” Hertl said. “I just do it.”

Same with Vegas defenseman Ben Hutton: “I kiss the inside of my jersey when I put it on,” he said.

One frequent requirement — sneaking in a pregame nap. If they can't sleep, at least they log some chill time.

“I nap around the same time, that's just routine more than ritual. I was a little bit more (superstitious) when I was younger, but with my life the way it is, I've kind of had to change my schedule on the fly with a busy household,” said Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo, who has four kids, including triplets. “I try not to overthink it.”

Following morning home skates, Carolina forward Mark Jankowski typically takes Lucy, his 6-year-old golden retriever, for a stroll.

“Get some sunlight,” said Jankowski, who was acquired by the Hurricanes in March. “Get the legs moving a little bit.”

Then, a pregame meal for Jankowski, followed by slipping on a pair of Normatec boots — compression therapy to enhance circulation. He naps (60-90 minutes) before taking off for the rink.

Washington goaltender Logan Thompson used to have numerous superstitions, including not stepping on cracks. It got to the point where, “if I would mess one up or if I would do something wrong, I think it would throw off my whole game,” he explained.

“Over the last two years just switched it up of making sure my body feels good and just keeping it loose,” Thompson added. “I feel like when you overthink too much, that's when issues happen.”

For keeping it loose, he credits “sewer ball,” a game played in some corner of a hockey arena all over. Players form a circle and try to keep a ball from hitting the ground. If a player can't, they're out. The exact rules are always subject to debate.

“A good way to keep my mind off the game,” Thompson said.

As part of his pregame routine, Hertl cranks up the tunes. These days, his playlist is heavy Czech music because it's been setting the proper goal-scoring mood. 

“I'm the kind of guy who can listen to everything,” Hertl said. “I like just the songs I kind of know I can sing along. I have a terrible voice, I can't sing, but this I do by myself.”

Other ways that players loosen up for a game: Gustavsson, like many, kicks around a soccer ball, while Vegas defenseman Noah Hanifin takes a cold plunge. Hanifin's teammate Brayden McNabb chomps on gum (peppermint) in warmups. 

Players spend all sorts of time making sure their equipment is as prepared as them. Avalanche forward Jonathan Drouin spray-paints the bottom of his sticks to add a little extra weight. Stars forward Mason Marchment makes sure his stick is stiff and newly taped.

Duchene slightly tweaks his routine depending on if it's a road or home game. On the road, he includes rice with his pasta and salmon. At home, it's salad. He also naps in a hyperbaric chamber before home games.

“As a younger player, I was extremely superstitious, and I hated it,” said Duchene, who writes the title of a song — “Jim Bob” by Hardy — on his stick. “I did everything to the minute before a game. I was almost obsessive about it. I got away from it a few years back.

“My biggest thing is you do what you do to get prepared, and then you just throw the gear on and go play,” he added. “That's the most pure form of playing hockey. That's how you do it your whole life. You don't need to do ‘A-through-Z' to get ready.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is renewing GOP divisions over trade as the Senate prepares to vote on the repeal of President Donald Trump's global tariff emergency.

The Senate will vote as soon as Wednesday on a resolution that reverses the “Liberation Day” tariffs Trump announced on April 2, even after the White House paused those duties for 90 days in the face of a market crash and turbulence in the bond market.

Republicans have nervously given Trump leeway to negotiate a raft of trade deals, with the reimposition of tariffs serving as leverage, but Paul and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the Democratic co-sponsor, still want a vote.

The resolution is considered privileged, meaning GOP leadership, who can lose three Republicans on any party-line vote, are unable to stop their request.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) acknowledged the measure stood a strong chance of passing, citing an earlier effort by Senate Democrats to repeal more narrow tariffs on Canada. In that vote, four Republicans joined all Democrats to end the national emergency Trump declared to give himself tariff authority.

“I mean, you saw the last one. They had the votes last time. So, we'll see,” Thune said. “I mean, my expectation is it could be similar in terms of, kind of what the vote count is on that.”

The resolution went nowhere in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has passed language to prevent Democrats from challenging Trump's tariff authority. But the vote amounted to a symbolic rebuke of the Trump administration and divided a party that traditionally prides itself on free trade.

“Obviously, it's a, you know, opportunity for the Democrats to put something on the floor that they think puts Republicans in an uncomfortable position, but I don't think most Republicans at this point see it that way,” Thune said of this week's resolution, describing the mood of his conference as “wait and see.”

“I think a lot of our members are willing to give the administration some time and some space to get some deals,” he added.

Beyond Democrats, the universe of potential “yes” votes lies in the seven Republicans who co-sponsored a separate bill that would sunset any tariff not approved by Congress after 60 days.

Paul and three of those Republicans — Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME) — voted for the Canadian resolution and could be expected to do so again. But Paul conceded additional support is unlikely.

He told the Washington Examiner that the sunset legislation, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) this month, is the way Republicans are choosing to “show displeasure” with the administration, with some not wanting to antagonize the White House further.

“I think it'd be a similar response,” Paul said. “It'd be interesting if we could get another person or two, but I think the Grassley bill sort of has become the off-ramp.”

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a co-sponsor of the Grassley bill, confirmed that he will not vote for the tariff repeal, calling it a partisan “shirts and skins exercise.” Several other co-sponsors were noncommittal or unaware the vote had been scheduled.

Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) declined to preview his vote but also described it as a “messaging” effort that had no chance of becoming law. On Monday, the White House promised to veto the resolution should it arrive on Trump's desk.

Paul, a libertarian, has been careful to describe his resolution as a matter of principle and not an attempt to needle Trump. The two men have periodically clashed on policy, but Paul has warmed to the president over his agency-slashing Department of Government Efficiency and Cabinet picks like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“I'm still supportive of Donald Trump. I voted for him, support him, love a lot of the things he's doing, but we shouldn't have a country ruled by emergency,” Paul said of the powers Trump is using on trade. 

McConnell, the former majority leader and home state colleague to Paul, made similar remarks at a business forum last week, noting that Kentucky relies heavily on international commerce, with its bourbon exports particularly vulnerable to a trade war.

“It's not an anti-Trump thing, in my opinion, but a structural thing,” McConnell, whose relationship with the president soured after the Jan. 6 riot, said. “Should the president have 100% of the authority in this particular area? And I think some of us think Congress probably ought to have some impact on that.”

Still, their vote against the Canadian tariffs on April 2, which came hours after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” duties, was viewed as the first legislative blemish of his second term. Trump subsequently chided all four Republicans who defied him, accusing them of playing “right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats.”

Republican anxiety has calmed some since Trump imposed those tariffs. The administration has been eager to show progress in trade talks, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling reporters on Tuesday that 17 deals with major partners are in “motion.”

Trump has also taken steps to ease the tariffs' impact, signing an executive order on Tuesday that prevents overlapping duties on the auto industry.

There is nonetheless an undercurrent of concern that Trump is harming the economy the longer the tariffs, some of which fall outside the 90-day pause, remain in place. On Wednesday, Trump dismissed the idea that his tariffs caused a slowdown of the economy in the first quarter, instead blaming former President Joe Biden.

SCHATZ LINES UP WHIP SUPPORT WITH NO SENATE COMPETITORS

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attempted to smooth over those concerns in a Tuesday lunch with Senate Republicans in which he briefed the conference on the state of negotiations, while congressional leaders are urging unity on the resolution vote.

The administration had previously stoked confusion over whether Trump wants the tariffs to be a temporary bargaining chip or a permanent trade barrier. The latter possibility, suggested by some of his advisers, prompted open pushback within a broader segment of Senate Republicans.

The uncertainty also spilled into Trump's relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Tuesday after reports that the retail giant would begin listing “import charges” on its website. Amazon denied the change after an angry call to Bezos from Trump.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — A coalition of survivors of clergy sexual abuse demanded Wednesday that cardinals entering the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis pick a pope who will adopt a universal zero-tolerance policy for abuse and himself has a clean record handling cases.

The group End Clergy Abuse issued an open letter to the cardinals who are meeting informally this week before the start of the May 7 conclave. SNAP, the main U.S.-based survivor group, also identified cardinals who themselves have problematic records in a new database, highlighting a new level of scrutiny of all possible contenders for the papacy.

The developments come amid real questions about how prominent the abuse scandal is featuring in the discussions about finding a new pope. After two decades of unrelenting revelations about abuse and cover-up that have discredited the Catholic hierarchy, many church leaders would like to think the issue is in the past, the survivors said.

“The sexual abuse crisis is not a matter of the past. It is present. And nowhere is its devastation more visible than in the Global South,” the survivors said in the open letter.

ECA and SNAP have called for the Catholic Church to adopt a zero-tolerance policy that a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established according to church law. That is the policy in the U.S. church, adopted at the height of the U.S. scandal in 2002, but it is by no means embraced elsewhere.




The issue is playing out in real time in Rome as the cardinals gather: Peruvian Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, 81, has been seen in full cardinal garb entering and exiting Vatican City, despite being under Vatican sanction for allegedly abusing a minor. Cipriani is not allowed in the conclave itself because he is over 80, but he has been participating in the pre-conclave meetings this week.

The Vatican in January confirmed that disciplinary sanctions were in effect against Cipriani, the first-ever cardinal from Opus Dei, following accusations of sexual abuse. The sanctions included requiring him to leave Peru and included restrictions on his public activity and use of insignia. The Vatican said he was allowed to deviate from them on some occasions.

Asked why Cipriani was presenting himself as a cardinal and participating, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the Vatican regulations concerning the pre-conclave meetings are clear. The rules, he said, all cardinals must participate unless they have “legitimate impediments,” which involve “personal or physical questions.”

Cipriani, who lives in Madrid and Rome, has called the allegations “completely false.”

Bruni said the issue of abuse was discussed this week by cardinals in the pre-conclave discussions, among other challenges facing the church.

SNAP earlier this year launched an online initiative, Conclave Watch, to provide information about individual cardinals and their records. The group says since the launch, survivors from Fiji, Tonga, Belgium, France, South Africa, Malawi, France, Italy, Canada and the U.S. have gotten in touch with additional information.

The initiative vets cardinals who are considered contenders for the papacy on their records handling sexual abuse cases, including whether they were involved in covering up cases, as well as their acceptance of a zero-tolerance law that SNAP and ECA have proposed.

“Abuse survivors do not want to see another conclave that elects a pope who has shielded and covered up for clergy offenders,” said Sarah Pearson, a SNAP spokesperson.

Christie Brinkley on aging gracefully 

Christie Brinkley has Beverly D'Angelo to thank for not going topless in "National Lampoon's Vacation."

The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model appeared in the 1983 comedy as the flirty "Girl in the Ferrari" opposite Chevy Chase. Viewers witnessed how Chase's character, Clark Griswold, struggled to keep his eyes on the road as the blonde bombshell in the sports car beside him zoomed between lanes. Meanwhile, Griswold's wife Ellen [D'Angelo] was asleep in the passenger seat.

In Brinkley's new memoir, "Uptown Girl," the pinup described how the producers of the film asked her to go topless for a scene, but she refused.

"The most memorable part of filming was the scene where I bump into Chevy's character at a motel pool and talk him into going skinny-dipping, which we shot at two in the morning," wrote Brinkley in an excerpt obtained by Fox News Digital.

"That's when the production team asked me to go topless for the shot, but I wasn't comfortable with it: I knew very well by then that part of my appeal as a model was that men had to imagine what was underneath my swimsuit, and I wasn't about to give that away for what I thought would be a small, goofy movie. (None of us at the time ever suspected ‘National Lampoon's Vacation' would take off the way it did)."

"When the production team asked again about the possibility of nudity — and I couldn't blame them for trying — Beverly walked out onto set in the nick of time. ‘I'll do it,' she said. ‘I'll be the one to go topless! You'll get your t---ies.' I couldn't have loved her more [at] that moment. And in my opinion, the scene between Chevy and me is funnier and cleverer because I throw my bra and panties at him from off camera, and all that the viewers can see are his oversized facial expressions."

Brinkley, 71, told Fox News Digital she was thankful to have D'Angelo, 73, step in and save her that day.

"I was so grateful from day one when I got there," she said. "I arrived at the location, and I wasn't really sure what to do with myself. I was in this motel in the middle of nowhere, and then I got a call from Beverly right away saying, ‘Hey! Welcome. We're all going to head out and grab a bite to eat. Why don't you come with us?' That's the kind of thing that just puts you at ease and lets you feel like, 'I can relax. I've got a friend.'"

"[He asked] me for my ‘beauty secrets' in his own hilarious way: ‘Christie, you gotta give me tips to make my hair look thicker!' she wrote. "As funny as he was, he was also shy, a combination I found endearing, and we quickly developed a playful chemistry that translated on-screen."

Brinkley has been photographed on six continents, in more than 30 countries and has appeared on more than 500 magazine covers worldwide. But in the five decades she's been modeling, Brinkley has never posed nude.

"I really knew that I wanted to be a mom, and I didn't want [my children] to go to school and have some kid go, 'There's your mom! I see your mom!'" the star told Fox News Digital. 

"And so, I just made that decision. And then I think people knew. I think there was something about me that I didn't attract that kind of… I didn't have photographers saying or trying to get me to strip down all the time. It just didn't happen."

In her memoir, Brinkley emphasized that she never posed in her birthday suit.

"To be clear… if anyone asked me to pose nude, which they eventually did, I said no," Brinkley wrote. "To this day, I have never done a nude shoot — not because I'm a prude, but because I've always wanted to be a mom, and I never wanted my kids to be embarrassed by nude photos of their mother circulating somewhere in the magazine world. Plus, I think it's much sexier to suggest than to show it all."

"I've refused to do other things as a model, too, most notably when, a few months into my career, a client asked me to fly to the South of France to accompany a group of men on a yacht in the Mediterranean," Brinkley wrote.

"The job, they said, would be to be nice to everyone on board, because everyone on board could be beneficial to my career. The trip would include an overnight, but in the morning, I could fly back to Paris — no harm, no foul."

"I may have been a naïve kid from Malibu, but nothing about the trip sounded right to me," she shared. "Where, after all, was the modeling part? I heard rumors that other models with more successful careers at the time had taken the same trip and come back with fancy cars, jewelry, and a new magazine cover, but none of that mattered to me. If I was going to get ahead in the industry, I wanted to do it on my own terms, not underneath someone else's."

"That proposed trip was the only time in my career I was ever asked, directly or indirectly, for a sexual favor," Brinkley continued.

"I know that makes me one of the lucky few, and I like to think that once you declare your worth, no one questions it again, but I know that's not true, either. Instead, you have to declare your worth over and over again, if not in one way, then in another — especially in an industry like modeling, where fame, money, and misconceptions can run wild. 

"But as long as you believe in yourself, it doesn't really matter what other people want or ask you to do. You write your own script… And as long as I'm writing my own script, I'm also going to call my own shots, no matter which side of the camera I'm on."

"It's very sweet," she told Fox News Digital. "I never really took it literally. I just thought that it's a compliment you take with a grain of salt. But it was very pleasant and sweet that they wanted to say something nice about me."

Brinkley said she has zero regrets about her stance. Today, she hopes her story will inspire others to live life on their own terms.

Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, joins ‘The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss the Trump administration's southern border strategy and Democratic support for suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

As President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigrant gangs, a priority for his administration during his first 100 days in office, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official says violent foreign gangs like MS-13 are feeling the heat. 

"These gangs are getting increasingly desperate," Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. "Designating MS-13 and other gangs as terrorists is certainly helpful. That just gives us broader authorities … as far as deportations go."

Immediately upon taking office, McLaughlin said, the Trump administration began partnering with local law enforcement as part of the 287(g) program, specifically because of their knowledge of the local gang scene.

"Part of the reason we're deputizing state and local law enforcement is, of course, we need more law enforcement bodies, but also they know their localities, and they can help us really target these guys and get them out of the country," she said.

McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that, so far, 2,394 illegal immigrant gang members have been arrested since Trump took office, adding that this is just the tip of the spear of what the administration intends to accomplish. 

"This is just the beginning," she said. "This is just 100 days. We want to get these arrest numbers up. We want to get MS-13, Tren de Aragua — these really bad actors — out of our country. And that's what we're going to deliver on."

Trump's early efforts have not gone unnoticed by would-be illegal immigrants, who McLaughlin said are reversing course instead of attempting to cross the border, and illegal immigrants already present in the country.

"Self-deportation is definitely happening. I mean, we see it in our app, the CBP Home app," McLaughlin said. "And that's what we want because it's a lot cheaper. An average deportation and arrest is like $17,000. It's incredibly expensive, and that's probably on the conservative side."

McLaughlin noted that when illegal immigrants self-deport, it also reduces the danger to law enforcement authorities who risk life and limb arresting dangerous criminals.

One of the Trump administration's major victories in the war on MS-13 came at the end of March, when the FBI teamed up with the Prince William County Police Department, the ATF, ICE and the Virginia State Police to arrest one of the gang's top leaders in the United States, 24-year-old Salvadoran national Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos.

            JB Pritzker greeted Rep. Maggie Goodlander with a joke. Answering his own question about how the New Hampshire congresswoman's first few months in office have been, the Illinois governor laughed: “Awful, right?” But the conversation immediately became a mini-huddle about the debates they've each been having with friends at law firms over conceding to President Donald Trump's demands and the conversation Pritzker had with his sister, Penny, as she leads the Harvard Corporation in its own fight.
    


            “This is the way the world ends,” Goodlander said, after they turned and smiled for their photo.
    


            Pritzker raised his eyebrows, clenched his lips together in a grimace that looked like he was maybe about to blow a trumpet and gave a slight nod.
    


            He has been making that face a lot these days.
    


            “There is certain momentum where people are now feeling like — well, the politicians are feeling like, ‘Oh there's a political reason why I should now speak out and be a fighter.' I don't care why you're joining the fight at this point, we just need everybody out there, right?” Pritzker told CNN in an interview a few minutes later. “And then there are others who are joining the fight because they're coming to a real realization that, ‘This is much worse than I thought it would be and it's getting worse.' And then I look at some of the people who have capitulated and I wonder in the end, is this how you want people to think of you?”

            There was nothing subtle about Pritzker's trip to New Hampshire, the state where politicians go to spark chatter about potential presidential runs. Nor was there much subtlety with his intense speech chiding his own party for “simpering timidity” and demanding a stronger, prouder response to what he sees as the “tyrants and traitors” among the Republicans, woven with lines designed to be easily clipped on social media.
    


            All that, along with Pritzker's speeches comparing Trump to the rise of Nazis and the governor's calendar of similar Democratic event appearances  around the country are the visible, visceral part of what he's doing to push his party now and stoke talk about 2028, even as he repeats that Democrats should focus on the 2026 elections.
    


            Pritzker and his team are making a bet about where the country is, and where it's going. The existential bet is that things are going to get much darker and more authoritarian. The political bet is that Democrats will remember deep in their cores who was out front first.
    


            As a man who was one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors long before he was a governor bracing his state against Trump's actions or a potential presidential hopeful, Pritzker is in a unique spot. Most expect if he runs in 2028 he would largely self-fund his campaign, as he has done in Illinois. The Hyatt hotel fortune made the family so rich that several heirs are billionaires.
    


            Now, on top of his official duties, his days can range from calling up Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler to say he hadn't seen enough yard signs while driving through his neighboring state and asking how much money they needed to fix that, to calling executives he knows from before his time in office to urge them to think how history will see their administration-friendly moves now, to calling Maine Gov. Janet Mills after the president threatened to strip funding from her state during an event at the White House in February.
    


            The Democratic Governors Association's aghast statement after Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was because Pritzker, along with frequent phone buddy Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, insisted on it, according to aides to both. Pritzker and his aides are initiating calls to other governors, state legislators and activists urging them to follow Illinois' lead in anticipating Trump's next moves.

            Pritzker has his own plane, so it wasn't travel logistics that kept him from this year's National Governors Association meeting in February in Washington, but an unspoken statement about how feckless he has found the Republicans in the group in standing up for their states against Trump and how disappointingly docile he has found too many of his fellow Democrats.
    


            In the interview, Pritzker compared this moment in America to what he sees walking through the exhibits of the Holocaust museum he helped get built outside Chicago. He likened it to the point when Nazis were on the rise, everyone was writing them off and only looking back “where you can feel, you know it, you can see and absorb what was happening in 1933, 1934.”
    


            Others, including fellow governors, see opportunism, or at least the convenient freedom that he has as a rich man in a solidly blue state so comfortable in his standing and wealth that he spent millions in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary to get a weaker candidate he could run up the score on. Unlimited money means unlimited new groups and organizations he can fund that don't do much except provide new avenues for press releases and TV bookings.
    


            Now Pritzker's Think Big PAC, formed after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision to boost abortion protection ballot measures across the country, is preparing to expand both geographically and on issues, with plans to support efforts to protect Medicaid and Head Start programs, according to people familiar with the plans.
    


            “The people who are fighting against the things that are so important to working families and the fundamental values of Democrats have all the money, or most of it,” Pritzker said. “And so when I have an opportunity, I step up.”
    


            His fortune means Pritzker has the dollars, but also the entre with other major donors to serve as a sort of angel investor in ways that are known among Democratic insiders but not immediately apparent. Sometimes that's through drawing attention by news of where he's weighing in. Sometimes it's through organizing calls with others in their own mansions to say where he's giving to prod them to match.
    


            Stacy Pearson, an Arizona consultant who helped run last year's successful campaign to pass abortion protections in the state, told CNN that unlike other big donors who have not actually helped, Pritzker's efforts were so quietly strategic — ranging from chipping in for the legal fees to secure the initiative's spot on the ballot to subsidizing outreach and ads — that she found herself telling the governor right before the election that she couldn't figure out how they'd efficiently spend whatever else he was offering.
    


            “No one ever tells me,” Pearson remembers Pritzker saying with a big laugh, “they don't need more of my money.”
    


            Yet Pritzker is in a party where attacking Elon Musk can seem at times just as popular as attacking Trump, where independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been drawing massive crowds around the country for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and where several operatives already sizing up the prospective presidential field told CNN they're looking forward to making Pritzker's bank account his main weakness.
    


            “The terms that the people use, ‘oligarchs' and ‘billionaires' and whatever, they're talking about values,” Pritzker said. “It's shorthand for everybody to use these words. And I have used the word oligarch, because I think people have looked at like the four tech titans who were sitting next to Trump at the inauguration, and just said, ‘Well, those are the oligarchs.' I think it's an easy word for people to use. I don't take it as an offense to me.”
    


            Asked what he thinks of those who are just suspicious of rich people, Pritzker said, “I get it.”

            That's why, Pritzker said, he spent so much time traveling his state in his first run for governor and participating in dozens of debates and forums, so that “by the end, I think what people said is, ‘He's a normal guy and he cares about people like me.'”
    


            At least in the room on Sunday night in Manchester, that was the feeling many left with.
    


            “I know Pritzker is a billionaire, but I also know he has been consistent in how he's spoken,” said Liz Kotowski, a retired environmental works employee from Manchester.
    


            “If you can't see the difference between JB Pritzker and Elon Musk, you're not listening,” said Lucas Coriaty, a 23-year-old who came from the University of New Hampshire and waited half an hour after the speech to take a selfie and tell the governor he felt inspired.
    


            One measure of the political moment and how Pritzker has placed himself in it: His call for mass protests and disruptions lit up Democrats online and top MAGA personalities, who quickly accused him of an incitement toward violence that was not, in fact, in his carefully worded speech.
    


            Also reposting video from that moment of the speech: Ocasio-Cortez.
    


            Part of Pritzker's speech in New Hampshire included blasting Trump for subverting Jewish values in the name of combatting antisemitism through the administration's war with elite universities. This is less from being an active member of his synagogue than from reading his great-grandfather's book.
    


            Every Pritzker gets a copy at 13 years old — a bar or bat mitzvah present for those in the family who have them, or just a birthday present. It's the story of escaping pogroms in Ukraine, of arriving penniless as a refugee, of sleeping on the streets and then of starting what would become one of America's biggest family fortunes.
    


            Pritzker didn't really read much of it when he was 13. He's read it several times since. Now he keeps one copy on the shelf in his home office, another on a shelf in his gubernatorial office.

Illinois governor to Democrats: ‘Time to stop surrendering, when we need to fight'



            “It's our family ethos that's kind of wrapped up in this thing. He was an enormously ethical person who cared deeply about this country and the fact that we were really saved by this country had we not had the ability to have safety and security. And the ability to thrive.”
    


            Pritzker has clocked how New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who set out to charm Trump over dinners at the president's Bedminster golf club during the height of Covid-19 and was one of the first to call the president after last year's assassination attempt, still ended up with Trump's former lawyer — via her new perch as an interim US attorney — investigating him over his handling of immigration enforcement. Or that Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, fiercely loyal since she was Trump's press secretary, had to go public after being denied federal recovery aid following recent storms in her state.
    


            “He's vindictive to every state, it appears to me. Yes, he doesn't like his enemies and he goes after his enemies. But I was going to suffer that either way,” Pritzker said. “It's not like he hasn't had words about Chicago.”
    


            In 2017, at the same New Hampshire Democrats dinner on the last Sunday in April, at the same Manchester hotel, Joe Biden was the featured speaker. He also gave a speech urging Trump-stunned Democrats to rediscover themselves, then declared into the microphone, “I'm not running.”
    


            Pritzker didn't bother with a line he knows isn't true, though in the interview before the speech he stuck to saying he hasn't even decided whether to launch the campaign for a third term as governor that aides are already planning, teasing more speeches around the country, and giving on-brand line: “This is a time for people to stand up and fight.”
    


            Several party operatives working their way around the weekend's White House Correspondents' Dinner events were gaming when to reach out about signing up with him, while focus group research has already quietly been passed around about whether the governor's weight is a positive or negative with voters, according to people who've seen the findings.
    


            The Democratic diehards in the longtime first-primary state on Sunday night responded with a 40-minute clump waiting to thank Pritzker and take their own photos, or to lean in with a version of how state Rep. Zoe Manos said goodbye: “When are you coming back again?”

Travel expert Colleen Kelly shares the hottest travel destinations for this summer and provides tips for travelers planning a cruise.

As summer travel quickly approaches, cruise lines are steering clear of a Caribbean island due to safety concerns.

Royal Caribbean recently altered its sailing itineraries to exclude Labadee, a picturesque peninsula on Haiti's northern coast, which has long been a highlight of Royal Caribbean's Western Caribbean itineraries.

"Out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily paused our upcoming visits to Labadee," Royal Caribbean said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The cruise line informed guests directly of the change in their itineraries, the spokesperson said. Sister brand Celebrity Cruises had already removed the stop on its cruises in recent weeks, the Miami Herald reported.

Chris Grow, a security consultant with more than 38 years of international experience in travel risk management and the co-author of "A Step-by-Step Guide to Essential Travel Safety Considerations," discussed cruise travel safety with Fox News Digital.

"Some of these islands are very touchy with what's happening, and their politics can change from day to day," he said. "One minute you're OK and the next minute it's time to get on the boat and leave."​

Grow advised travelers to remain aware of where the U.S. consulate or embassy is located, to keep digital and physical copies of their passport and be aware of local political and social climates that can change rapidly.

"This isn't to present fear," he said. "You want travelers to have fun, but please understand there's a reason we say these things."

John Lovell, the president of Travel Leaders Network, told Fox News Digital that since the situation in Haiti is deteriorating, it was wise of the cruise behemoth to consider alternative routes.

"The good news is that Royal Caribbean has another place in the Caribbean exclusively for their guests: Perfect Day at CocoCay in The Bahamas. It has several beaches, the Caribbean's largest freshwater pool, a water park and more," he said.

GANG VIOLENCE IN HAITI AT RECORD LEVELS AMID CRITICISM US HAS NO ‘CLEAR STRATEGY'

"I hope that things will settle down and that ships will call on Labadee again. Not only is the beach incredibly beautiful, but it provides employment to Haitians at the resort and support to entrepreneurs with the onsite Haitian straw market."

Just days before Royal Caribbean's announcement, the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince issued a fresh security alert warning of "widespread protests with potential for violence between police, protestors, and criminal gangs." 

Haiti is currently rated at Level 4 by the U.S. Department of State's travel advisory "due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care," which means the U.S. government recommends travelers not go to the country.

"The U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti. Local police and other first responders often lack the resources to respond to emergencies or serious crime," the U.S. travel advisory states.

It remains unclear when or if Labadee will return as a regular port of call. While Royal Caribbean has emphasized the "temporary" nature of the suspension, no timeline of a return has been communicated.

Gangs in Haiti killed at least 5,600 people last year, according to a new United Nations report. The report from the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights said an additional 3,700 were injured or abducted.

Just a year ago, the streets of the Caribbean nation were overtaken by violence. On March 4, 2024, Port-au-Prince's Toussaint Louverture International Airport was taken over by armed gangs.

Following the gang takeover, Haitians and Americans were left trapped. Fox News Digital previously reported that, in 2024, gangs controlled 85% of Port-au-Prince and all the roads and highways in and out of the capital.

In early December 2024, at least 207 people were massacred in Port-au-Prince by the Wharf Jérémie gang. The victims, many of them elderly, were accused of using voodoo to harm the gang leader's son. Their bodies were mutilated and burned and others were thrown into the sea.

            Donald Trump was supposed to destroy establishment centrists with an anti-woke global populist revolt. But his wild second presidency may be doing the opposite.
    


            Many Western democracies are experiencing the same intractable political issues that lifted Trump to his stunning electoral comeback last year, including high prices, affordable housing crises and difficulties controlling their borders.
    


            So not long ago, Trump's 2024 blueprint looked like a roadmap for populists everywhere. But his power grabs, attacks on US allies and tariff wars have swiftly brewed resentment. Foreigners might be cynical about their own leaders, but many look at Americans and think, “We don't want what you've got.”
    


            That's why Mark Carney is still prime minister of Canada.
    


            The Liberals' late sub-in is celebrating an astonishing election victory after pulling his party from 25 points behind in a couple of months. But he wouldn't even be in politics if it weren't for Trump, whose demands that Canada become the 51st US state and tariffs that could be existential for its economy doomed the opposition.
    


            “The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has echoed a lot of Trump's language for years,” said Matthew Lebo, a political scientist at Western University, Ontario. “To sound Trumpy at a moment when all of Canada's attention turns to Donald Trump and sees the damage of it – it was just awful timing for Poilievre.”
    


            Trump might be the scourge of globalists. But you don't get much more establishment than a prime minister who studied at Harvard and Oxford and ran two central banks. “Mark Carney just looked made for this moment,” Lebo said.
    


            The next chance for an anti-Trump wave is in Australia, which holds a general election this weekend. Weeks ago, Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seemed headed for defeat. But he's surged in the polls amid fury among voters over US tariffs, and the opposition conservative coalition, led by Peter Dutton, another anti-woke culture warrior, has stalled.
    


            It's impossible to predict what voters might decide. But if Albanese's once-unpopular government survives, Dutton will face the same questions about political positioning as Poilievre. (Impressions that Dutton is accident-prone solidified early in the campaign after he punted an Australian football at a cameraman's head during a disastrous photo-op.)
    


            Even leaders who aren't facing elections have had to recalibrate to deal with Trump's raucous second term. The US president is deeply disliked abroad, and his bombast and insults have fostered anti-Americanism that creates dilemmas for leaders who must deal with him.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for instance, struggled for traction after his landslide election victory last year. But his approval spiked over his unflappable dealings with the Trump and support for Ukraine as the US began to turn its back. Still, Starmer's greatest test lies ahead, with the president's state visit with King Charles III looming – an act of flattery by pageantry that many Britons oppose.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron has been struggling almost since his reelection win and was instrumental in the collapse of his own government after disastrously calling National Assembly elections last year. But suddenly he looks prescient. He's been warning for years that Europe needs to take care of its own defense needs – and Trump's attacks on allies have allowed him to relaunch his perennial unofficial campaign to be the EU's indispensable leader.
    


            Germany's elections earlier this year seemed to buck the trend, since the far-right populist AfD party doubled its vote share after being openly backed by Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk. Still, some analysts believe that alarm among voters about a US-style right-wing tide put a ceiling on the AfD's rise.
    


            Elsewhere in Europe, Trump's “America first” attitude has changed the game for right-wing parties that look to him for inspiration. Anger over tariffs could blunt far-right leader Marine Le Pen's bid to use Trump-style tactics to brand her conviction for embezzlement as election meddling ahead of France's 2027 presidential vote.
    


            Even Brexit architect Nigel Farage, who critics accuse of spending more time at Mar-a-Lago than with his constituency in a faded English seaside town, distanced himself from Trump's Ukraine policy. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose anti-democratic playbook made him a MAGA hero, is increasingly unpopular ahead of elections next year.
    


            Populists aren't on the retreat everywhere. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who won office on Trump-style immigration policies, remains popular and is promoting herself as a bridge between her friend in the Oval Office and Europe. She pulled off a consummate balancing act during a Washington visit this month.
    


            More broadly, Trump's sudden political earthquakes are looming over other campaigns. Both South Korea and Japan have key elections this year that will be shaped by the trade wars. Leaders of both US allies are under pressure to do quick deals to mitigate economic damage that could hurt their voters.
    


            US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday rejected the idea that Japan's general election in July and South Korea's presidential vote in June will clog up talks on trade deals Trump needs to show his strategy is working.
    


            “I think from our talks that these governments actually want to have the framework of a trade deal done before they go into elections to show that they have successfully negotiated with the United States,” Bessent said.
    


            “So we are finding that they are actually much more keen to come to the table, get this done, and then go home and campaign on it.”
    


            That's one way of looking at it. But trade deals involve painful compromises that can alienate key voting blocs – hardly what politicians need before tough elections. This could also limit the scope of agreements that Trump insists will include spectacular concessions to the US.
    


            Carney knows what got him elected. And he's not letting up.
    


            “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” he warned. “But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never, that will never ever happen.”
    


            His crowd cheered. But his words pose a question that applies not just to Canada but to other foreign democracies. Will an anti-Trump message work as long as the 47th president stays in the White House?
    


            It might, since there's no sign Trump will tone down his act. But the world is full of disgruntled electorates and the West has deep political problems. In fact, voters repeatedly send clear messages that they want change, but their new governments often struggle to deliver. And big political wins can quickly fade under the weight of intractable issues – just ask Starmer.
    


            The heat on Carney to deliver is immense.
    


            He must defuse the trade war with Trump, which threatens to cause an economic crisis and destroy millions of Canadian jobs. He must find new markets and revenues for his country now that the US is no longer a reliable partner. And he's under pressure to finally get Canada up to NATO spending minimums.
    


            And voters will sooner or later demand progress on other issues – health care, housing, high prices, homelessness, substance abuse and unemployment. And the prime minister doesn't have much room to maneuver.
    


            Voters might have picked him as the best bet to stand up to Trump. But they didn't hand him a wide mandate, saddling him instead with a minority government. He'll need smaller parties to pass legislation that could entail tough political choices. This is an inherently unstable situation in which to build trust and a record that could convince voters in a few years to hand him a majority.

            And while they were stung by defeat, Conservatives weren't wiped out. Their promises to fight crime and lower taxes resonated with some voters, and they may fancy their chances of winning in a few years – perhaps under a new leader like Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who's a populist himself but made the wise choice to confront Trump rather than trying to emulate him.
    


            Carney's Liberals understand they need to demonstrate change. They appeased angry voters by brutally ditching unpopular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a desperate Hail Mary to keep power. They picked a non-politician in Carney to lead them. And as soon as he was interim leader, he jettisoned Trudeau's most unpopular positions, including a carbon tax. This removed one of Poilievre's best arguments.
    


            But in an era of grumpy voters and leaders struggling to deliver, even big electoral wins don't guarantee success.



            America, after all, is experiencing its third straight one-term presidency – assuming Trump obeys the Constitution and goes home in January 2029. And after snapping up all the swing states last year, Trump has the worst polling numbers of any president at the 100-day mark in decades.
    


            And politics is never static. Starmer's Labour Party landslide last year will count for nothing on Thursday, when Farage's far-right Reform Party is expected to claim huge wins in local elections that could portend its eclipse of Britain's most successful election machine, the Conservative Party, in the next general election.
    


            Is it too soon to predict a populist revival?

            A newly released image of the sun captured by the world's largest solar telescope shows the surface of our nearest star in unprecedented detail, shedding light on its fiery complexity.
    


            The image is the first taken by the US National Science Foundation Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's new Visible Tunable Filter, or VTF. The instrument can build a closer-than-ever, three-dimensional view of what's happening on the sun's surface, according to a news release.
    


            The close-up reveals a cluster of continent-size dark sunspots near the center of the sun's inner atmosphere, at a scale of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) per pixel.
    


            These blemishes mark areas of intense magnetic activity, where solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are likely to occur. Coronal mass ejections are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun's outer atmosphere.
    


            Detailed images such as this one, which was taken in early December, pose an important way for scientists to learn about and predict potentially dangerous solar weather, said Friedrich Woeger, the NSF Inouye Solar Telescope instrument program scientist, in an email.
    


            “A solar storm in the 1800s (the Carrington Event) reportedly was so energetic that it caused fires in telegraph stations,” Woeger said. “We need to understand the physical drivers of these phenomena and how they can affect our technology and ultimately our lives.”

            These energetic outbursts from the sun can interact with our planet's own electromagnetic field, causing disturbances to key infrastructure such as electrical power grids and satellite-powered communication networks, he explained.
    


            The sun goes through periods of high and low magnetic activity in an 11-year cycle. In October, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced the sun reached the peak of activity, called the solar maximum. During the peak, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and more sunspots appear on its surface.
    


            The maximum is expected to last for several months, so it's a fitting time for the Inouye Solar Telescope to be ramping up its instrument testing with spectacular images of the sun's dynamic surface.
    


            Like boiling soup on a stove, heat escapes the core of the sun and rises to its surface through fluid motions, said Mark Miesch, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. Miesch was not involved in the research.
    


            Sunspots, then, are like “magnetic plugs,” or tangles in the star's complex magnetic fields that prevent the heat from reaching the surface, Miesch said. For this reason, the sunspots, which emit less light than other areas of the sun, appear darker in images and are cooler than their surroundings. Nevertheless, sunspots are “still hotter than any oven on Earth,” he added.
    


            The apparent texture of the sun comes from the varying densities and temperatures within its surface, which has layers similar to an onion. By “tuning” in to different wavelengths, or colors, like a radio tuner, the VTF offers a way to probe these various layers and observe what is happening between them, Miesch said.
    


            In other words, while an image from a personal camera uses light that contains multiple wavelengths at the same time, the VTF, a type of imaging spectro-polarimeter, filters measurable wavelengths one by one.
    


            To accomplish this filtering, the instrument uses an etalon — two glass plates separated by mere microns.

            “The principle is not unlike that of noise-canceling headphones: when two waves with similar wavelength(s) travel on the same or an intersecting path, they can interact with each other to either cancel each other out, or they can reinforce each other,” Woeger said. “Light waves ‘trapped' between those two plates interfere, and the distance between the plates selects which exact ‘colors' of the light are passed on, and which ones cancel out.”
    


            In just a few seconds, the powerful instrument captures hundreds of images through the different filters and combines them into a three-dimensional snapshot.
    


            Researchers can then use the resulting views to study the temperature, pressure, velocity and magnetic field structure at diﬀerent layers of the solar atmosphere.
    


            “Seeing those first spectral scans was a surreal moment. This is something no other instrument in the telescope can achieve in the same way,” said Dr. Stacey Sueoka, a senior optical engineer at the National Solar Observatory, in a statement.



            The imaging spectro-polarimeter represents a culmination of over a decade's worth of development.
    


            Located at the NSF's National Solar Observatory, at the top of Maui's 10,000-foot (3,000-meter) Haleakalā volcanic mountain, the VTF itself spans multiple stories of the Inouye Solar Telescope.
    


            After the VTF was designed and built by the Institute for Solar Physics in Germany, the instrument's parts were shipped across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and then reassembled — like a “ship in a bottle,” Woeger said.

            The team expects the tool to be fully operational and ready for use by 2026.
    


            “The significance of the technological achievement is such that one could easily argue the VTF is the Inouye Solar Telescope's heart, and it is finally beating at its forever place,” said Dr. Matthias Schubert, a VTF project scientist at the Institute for Solar Physics, in a statement.
    


            The solar telescope is among several other recent efforts by scientists to better understand the sun and its stormy weather patterns, including the Solar Orbiter, a joint mission of the European Space Agency and NASA launched in 2020, and NASA's Parker Solar Probe, the first spacecraft to “touch” the sun.

DOGE chief Elon Musk claimed Wednesday that his federal workforce slashing initiative so far has saved $160 billion — far less than his original projections — as the mega-billionaire Tesla CEO gave a sort of farewell to President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

It's "been an honor to work with your incredible Cabinet," Musk told Trump at the White House on Wednesday. "I would just like to say thank you to everyone, It was an honor to work with you, so thank you for everything."

"A tremendous amount has been accomplished in the first 100 days," Musk said. "As everyone has said, it's more than has been accomplished in any administration before. Ever. So this portends very well for what happens, for the rest of the administration."

Musk said last week on a Tesla earnings call that his time spent running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency will drop significantly beginning in May, and that he plans to spend just a "day or two per week" on the government effort.

The New York Post reported Tuesday that Musk was no longer working out of the West Wing. But his DOGE lieutenants were still working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is on the  White House campus. 

Trump told Musk on Wednesday, "We all want to thank you for your help. You really have sacrificed a lot. You've been treated very unfairly." 

Musk then quipped, "Well, they like to burn my cars, which is not great," referring to a spate of vandalism targeting Tesla vehicles and locations since he began his DOGE program.

"But the vast majority of people in this country really respect and appreciate you, and this whole room can say that very strongly, you have really been a tremendous help," Trump said.

"And you know, you're invited to stay as long as you want."

Trump's Cabinet secretaries and other people in the room clapped at that comment.

When Trump said that DOGE had "saved" $150 billion with his initiatives to cut spending and reduce federal employee headcount, Musk chimed in, "$160 billion, but who's counting?"

Musk last fall said that DOGE would slash "at least $2 trillion" from the federal budget.

But during an interview in January, Musk downplayed that estimate.

"I think we'll try for $2 trillion. I think that's the best-case outcome," Musk said. "But I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for $2 trillion, we've got a good shot at getting 1," he said, meaning $1 trillion.

But experts say the number could be far smaller than even the $160 billion figure Musk quoted. 

The nonprofit Partnership for Public Service has estimated that DOGE-related "firings, re-hirings, lost productivity and paid leave of thousands of workers will cost upward of $135 billion this fiscal year," The New York Times reported.

Musk said in his Tesla earnings call last week that he would continue work on DOGE "for as long as the president would like me to do so, and as long as it's useful."

"But starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done," said Musk.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro brushed off concerns Wednesday about the unexpected drop in U.S. gross domestic product last quarter, saying, 'We really like where we're at now," and pointing to a surge in new domestic investment.

"I got to say just one thing about today's news, that's the best negative print I have ever seen in my life," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" after the Commerce Department reported that GDP fell at a 0.3% annualized pace in the first quarter of 2025.

"The markets need to, like, look beneath the surface of that" figure, said Navarro, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

"We had a 22% increase in domestic investment," he said.

"That is off the charts when you strip out inventories and the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs, you had 3% growth," Navarro said.

"So, we really like where we're at now," he added.

Major stock market indices were down in morning trading on the heels of the GDP report, which captured economic data from the first two full months of Trump's second term in the White House.

This is not the first time that Navarro has dismissed concerns about the damaging effect of Trump's policies on the U.S. economy.

Earlier this month, Navarro described a massive April 10 market drop that was fueled by fears Trump's broad new tariffs as "no big deal."

That day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points and the benchmark S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks lost 3.46%.

So far this year, the S&P 500 is down more than 7%.

App makers Meta Platforms Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Match Group Inc. are girding for a high-stakes political battle with the world's two dominant smartphone platforms over who should take responsibility for verifying users' ages.

The app makers this week are launching a lobbying coalition to take on Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. as legislation to require age verification gains momentum amid rising public concern over minors' online access to inappropriate material.

The latest eye-popping headline in the hedge fund industry's talent war is Steve Schurr's move from Balyasny to Millennium and the $100 million pay package it took to poach him.

Schurr, a former financial journalist at the Financial Times and short-seller who worked with legendary investor Jim Chanos, was a key part of the equities rebuild that $23 billion Balyasny has undergone. He worked alongside the firm's founder and executives, like Archana Parekh, head of Asian equities.

Speaking with Business Insider at the end of 2024 about the firm's thinking about equities investing, Schurr said Balyasny tapped him to build a centralized research function for stockpicking teams that focused on primary research in addition to managing a large portfolio.

Now, he'll be taking his talents to Izzy Englander's $73 billion manager after he sits out a year to comply with the non-compete clause in his contract. His pay package includes incentives that will take years to pay out, according to a person familiar with the matter. Schurr's hire was first reported by Bloomberg. 

Unlike other multistrategy portfolio managers, Schurr didn't want to use alternative data like credit-card receipts to focus on "triangulating and calling quarters" by estimating a company's earnings before they're released, calling the popular investing process "a strategy of diminished expected returns" when he spoke to BI last year.

In a presentation at a conference at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business this March, Schurr went into greater detail about how he finds opportunities and researches potential investments.

In a recording of his presentation viewed by BI, Schurr described how he applies a short-seller's lens to long bets in his book.

"You turn a situation upside down," he said, noting that "Wall Street is a perpetual optimism machine" that forces investors to dig deep to find the real valuation of a stock, not just the "narrative."

He also used his experience as a short-seller to identify three buckets of stocks with "certain types of things we should never short."

Those buckets are:

"I thought of the research process as an extension of the work I did as a journalist," he said, noting that "there's not a secret trove of information that no one else has access."

"The best thing you can do is doing the research yourself," he said, recommending industry conferences and expert networks over sell-side-organized events and meetings with company executives and investor relations teams. He recommended data providers such as 280first, Zion Research, and BamSEC to augment the process.

"Wall Street is an echo chamber," he said, and good investors look outside of the normal channels. He pointed to YouTube reviews of consumer products and Reddit forums dedicated to a specific company as places where investors could glean insights from.

On a slide titled "How We Maintain Performance," Schurr outlined that his teams "thrive in obscurity" and look for stocks with less than three teams covering the name. Companies with market caps between $1 billion and $5 billion market cap have been a sweet spot for them.

But duration is also critical. The ability to hold a stock through volatile markets is important, Schurr said, telling the students in attendance that "all the money to be made" is going to come from yearslong positions, not quarterly wins.

"The market is going to change constantly over the next 20 years," he said, and tools like alternative data and artificial intelligence are "commoditized very quickly."

"What is durable is deep fundamental equity research," he said.

Snap shares fell more than 12% Wednesday after the social media company withheld second-quarter guidance due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment.

"While our topline revenue has continued to grow, we have experienced headwinds to start the current quarter, and we believe it is prudent to continue to balance our level of investment with realized revenue growth," the company said Tuesday, adding that macro conditions could impact advertising demand.

Snap's finance chief Derek Andersen said during an earnings call that some advertisers are already seeing an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption. The loophole, which ends Friday, currently allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.

President Donald Trump's shifting tariff plans have created an unsettling backdrop for companies this earnings season. Fears of a weakening economy have also fueled concerns that companies could ease up advertising spending, where Snap makes a key component of revenues.

The company said ad revenues grew 9% year over year to $1.21 billion during the quarter.

Despite holding back on guidance, Snap reported 14% revenue growth, up from $1.19 billion a year ago to $1.36 billion. Snap's loss also narrowed 54% to $140 million, or 8 cents per share, from about $305 million, or 19 cents, last year. The loss was due to a $70.1 million charge related to cash severance, stock-based compensation expenses and other costs associated with a 2024 restructuring.

Snap also signaled ongoing user growth. Daily active users grew to 460 million, up from 453 million the previous quarter. The company said it hit 900 million monthly active users, up from 850 million in August, the last time Snap provided that stat. DAUs fell to 99 million from 100 million in North America during the period, but Snap says it doesn't expect more declines this quarter.

Many on Wall Street expect the company's lack of visibility into the second quarter and macro backdrop to weigh on shares and adjusted price targets to account for it.

"While [price-to-sales ratio] is nearing a historical bottom and could support stock, we reiterate our neutral rating as Snap has been pressured more than peers in prior macro downturns," said Bank of America's Justin Post.

Other social media companies saw shares move lower, including Pinterest and Reddit, last down 4% and 8%, respectively. Meta fell more than 2%.

Citadel Securities is urging the Securities and Exchange Commission's new leadership to examine a list of what it argues are emerging and mounting risks, including opaque trading in so-called private rooms and the push by US stock markets to operate around the clock.

Billionaire Ken Griffin's market-making firm sent more than 30 recommendations, spotlighting concerns in equities, credit, treasuries, options and digital assets. Subjects included private rooms — a twist on dark pools, in which only certain parties are allowed to transact.

The most anticipated part of Apple's Thursday earnings won't be iPhone sales or Mac forecasts – it'll be CEO Tim Cook's comments on how the company is dealing with President Donald Trump's tariffs. 

Apple is one of the most exposed companies to Trump's tariffs and expected retaliation. It makes about three-quarters of its overall revenue from physical goods — iPhones, Macs and Apple Watches — mostly made in China or elsewhere in Asia. And the U.S. is its largest market.

"It's how Apple responds to 'everything else' that will set the tone for post-earnings sentiment," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a Monday note.

He has an overweight rating on the stock, and wants to hear what Cook and Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh have to say about how the company is mitigating supply chain and tariffs risks, if Apple will raise prices or eat costs, and the status of Cook's relationships with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Apple hasn't commented on the hefty tariffs Trump announced for every country in the world on April 2, but they represent a deep threat to the iPhone maker's supply chain and sent the company's share price down 9%. 

"We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that," Cook said during Apple's January earnings call. Those were the company's most recent comments on Trump's trade policy.

Apple is perhaps the highest-profile example of a company that's gotten caught up in Trump's trade war. 

It's the most valuable U.S. company, hundreds of millions of Americans own iPhones and Cook built his reputation in Silicon Valley as an operations expert who keeps Apple's inventory low and its logistics tight.

But Apple and Cook have stayed tight-lipped publicly even as Trump administration officials called for the company to move iPhone production to the U.S., imagining millions of Americans "screwing in little screws" to build the devices.

The White House suggested that Apple was capable of building iPhones in the U.S., something that many analysts said is impossible at worst and would result in a $3,500 iPhone at best. 

"I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business," Trump said in an oval office briefing earlier this month after he delayed the highest-tariffs on non-China nations for 90 days. It was a move that boosted Apple stock. Cook has maintained a line of communication with the Trump administration, according to Trump, dating back to his first term.

Now it's time to hear from Apple itself. 

The tariffs are a material issue that will eventually affect the company's financials. TD Cowen predicts that the current tariffs will cost Apple about 6% of its annual earnings this year. Apple reported about $94 billion in profit in its fiscal 2024.

It's not just investors that want a peek into Apple's thinking — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questioned Cook about what he discussed with the Trump administration ahead of the president's decision to pause tariffs on non-China nations.

Apple's share price remains lower than it was on April 2, even though analysts have said the pause will give Apple some flexibility to avoid the highest tariffs, thanks to its production locations in India and Vietnam.

Several recent reports have said that Apple will try to source as many iPhones as possible from from India, which only faces a 10% tariff, to avoid the highest 145% tariffs on China. But although Apple has been ramping up iPhone production in India since 2017, the company has only recently begun to ship commercially significant quantities in recent years, and Apple hasn't confirmed the pivot to India or discussed its Indian production capabilities.

"While it's possible for all 25 million of India capacity to be allocated to the US near-term, we think it could take approximately a year for production to double to 50 million overall," TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote Monday, saying that Apple is expected to sell between 65 million and 70 million iPhones in the U.S. this year.

Apple declined to comment on sourcing iPhones to the U.S. from India.

Another closely-watched metric will be Apple's China revenue, which could indicate if rising nationalism will hurt iPhone sales in the company's third largest market, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Some analysts have noted that the smartphone owners in China are more likely to switch phone brands than Western consumers. There's concern that now those Chinese consumers could take cues from media and government officials and buy Chinese phone brands, such as phones made by Huawei.

Dipanjan Chatterjee, principal analyst at Forrester, said that if Apple were to move a lot of production out of China, it would also have to consider if that could upset the Chinese consumer.

"If Apple is going to pull production out of China, that's not going to go down well in that market," Chatterjee said. "They're going to hedge. You're going to see a lot more saying and a little bit of tinkering and not a whole lot of doing."

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Apple to report $1.62 in earnings per share on $94.19 billion in sales, which would be an almost 4% revenue increase on an annual basis.

Etsy shares plunged on Wednesday after the company posted mixed results for the first quarter.

Here's how the company did:

Shares of Etsy tumbled more than 9% in afternoon trading, as stocks fell broadly after new economic data showed a contraction of 0.3%. The data spurred fears the economy was headed toward a recession from President Donald Trump's abrupt policy shifts, primarily around trade.

The e-commerce company reported a net loss of $52.1 million, or a loss of 49 cents per share, compared with a profit of $68 million, or 48 cents per share, a year ago.

Etsy said the results reflected it taking a $101.7 million impairment charge from the sale of Reverb. The company announced earlier this month it will sell off the musical instrument marketplace it acquired in 2019 to focus on its core marketplace and secondhand platform Depop, which it bought in 2021.

Revenue for the quarter was up about 1% to $651.2 million, beating analysts' projected $643 million.

Etsy operates an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers with mostly handcrafted goods. Like many other retailers, the company is digesting the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs, though CEO Josh Silverman said in February that the company is "vastly less" dependent on products from China, which was hit by aggressive levies of 145%.

Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said Wednesday that the company is "staying nimble in the face of uncertainty" around the tariff announcements and "the fluid state of consumer confidence in our core markets."

The company said it also established a "small operational task force" to address the tariffs, which has provided buyers and sellers with guidance on shipping timelines, along with other information. Earlier this month, Etsy began highlighting products from domestic sellers on its site as a way for shoppers to circumvent the extra costs associated with Trump's tariffs.

Approximately 90% of sellers source their products domestically, Silverman said on a call with investors.

"We are, of course, monitoring the ricochet impact of higher global tariffs on consumer spending in our core markets, particularly with regard to the cost of items people purchase every day and how this may impact demand for consumer discretionary items," Silverman said.

Gross merchandise sales, a key metric that measures the total volume of goods sold on the platform, fell 6.5% year over year to $2.79 billion, which was in line with consensus estimates, according to FactSet.

For the second quarter, Etsy forecast GMS to decline at a rate similar to or "potentially slightly better than" the 6.5% rate it saw this quarter.

Active sellers on the platform fell 11.3% year over year to nearly 8.1 million, marking four straight quarters of declines. Active buyers also declined for the second consecutive quarter to 94.8 million. Both figures include sellers and buyers across the core Etsy marketplace, Depop and Reverb.

Etsy has been working to strengthen its image as a destination for unique gifts and products as it looks to return to growth and combats a fiercely competitive e-commerce market dominated by Amazon and, more recently, Chinese online retailers Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.

CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that Etsy's earnings for the quarter were 46 cents per share. A previous version of this story stated an incorrect amount.

​​Big Tech companies aren't just building AI — they're increasingly using it to write more of their code.

Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said Tuesday that between 20% and 30% of the code for some of the company's projects is written by AI.

Speaking to Mark Zuckerberg at Meta's LlamaCon conference, Nadella said that the precise figure depends on the programming language.

He added that Microsoft is leaning on AI for more than just code generation. "The agents we have for reviewing code — that usage has increased," he said, in a sign the company is weaving AI into the full software development cycle.

Nadella isn't the only Big Tech CEO leaning on AI for coding.

Last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet's earnings call that more than 30% of new code at the company is written by AI — up from 25% in October.

At LlamaCon, Nadella asked Zuckerberg how much of Meta's code was created by AI, but the social media boss couldn't give a precise figure.

Instead, Zuckerberg gave a prediction for the AI agents Meta's building to help write and test code for its Llama models: "Our bet is that in the next year, probably, maybe half the development is going be done by AI as opposed to people, and then that will just increase from there."

For now, Meta is already using AI in more narrowly defined areas, such as ad ranking and feed experiments, where results can be closely measured, Zuckerberg said.

It's not just the largest tech companies that are embracing AI for coding. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, said in a February earnings call that the company would pause engineer hiring in 2025 because of AI, which he said had increased engineering productivity by 30%.

In January, payments company Stripe laid off 300 employees, including people in engineering roles, Business Insider first reported.

AI isn't always causing companies to cut back on human coders. Microsoft, for instance, is considering another round of job cuts aimed at middle managers and non-coders, BI first reported. They are focused on increasing the share of contributors who write code by decreasing its "PM ratio" — the number of product or program managers per engineer.

Looking further ahead, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott expects that within five years, 95% of all code will be AI-generated. "Very little is going to be line-by-line human-written code," he said last month on the 20VC podcast. Still, he emphasized that humans would remain essential in shaping the high-level structure, goals, and design of software.

Microsoft President Brad Smith says the U.S. tech giant is committed to respecting European laws — even though it may not always agree with them.

"Like every citizen and company, we don't always agree with every policy of every government. But even when we've lost cases in European courts, Microsoft has long respected and complied with European laws," Smith said in a blog post Wednesday.

Smith's comments are part of a charm offensive Microsoft is making in Europe this week, after tensions between the United States and European Union ratcheted up in recent weeks over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Trump's trade war with U.S. trading partners — including the European Union, China and others — has raised fears that the EU could use its regulatory crackdown on America's technology giants as a tool to counter trade restrictions.

The EU has for years been trying to tame U.S. Big Tech firms over competition issues. The bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which became enforceable last year, aims to tackle the market power of large so-called "gatekeeper" firms such as Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft.

Last week, the European Commission — the executive body of the EU — fined Apple 500 million euros ($568.5 million) and Meta 200 million euros ($227.4 million) for DMA breaches.

"We understand that European laws apply to our business practices in Europe, just as local laws apply to local practices in the United States and similar laws apply elsewhere in the world. This includes European competition law and the Digital Markets Act, among others," Smith said Wednesday.

"We're committed not only to building digital infrastructure for Europe, but to respecting the role that laws across Europe play in regulating our products and services."

Trump has previously cited the EU's regulatory actions against America's tech giants as a reason to hit the bloc with tariffs. In February, he threatened the bloc with duties to tackle "overseas extortion" of U.S. tech firms through digital taxes and fines.

BYD is building a massive factory in Hungary as it looks to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla in Europe.

The 300-hectare site on the outskirts of Szeged, Hungary, is expected to have a maximum capacity of around 200,000 vehicles a year, and satellite images provided to BI by Planet Images show how the factory is rapidly taking shape.

Construction of the site began last year, with a Hungarian official confirming last November that the first BYD EV is expected to roll off the line in the second half of 2025.

The estimated €4 billion ($4.5 billion) investment is the latest step in BYD's quest for European domination.

Having conquered China's brutally competitive electric vehicle market, the Chinese EV giant is eyeing overseas expansion, exporting a record number of electric vehicles and hybrids in the first quarter of 2025.

BYD is barred from the US market thanks to high tariffs and faces a 17% import tax in Europe, leading the company to invest in local factories such as the one in Hungary.

The Chinese automaker is also set to break ground on a factory in Turkey in the coming years, and executives at the Warren Buffett-backed automaker have said that plans for a third European factory are under consideration.

That poses a huge threat to Tesla, which has a gigafactory in Germany and counts Europe as its third-biggest market.

Elon Musk's carmaker sold 327,000 vehicles in Europe last year but has seen sales collapse in 2025 amid intense backlash over Musk's interventions in European politics and support for the German far-right AfD party.

Tesla's sales in Europe have fallen 37% in the first three months of the year, while BYD's have surged by nearly 300%.

Hungary has proven to be a welcoming environment for Chinese companies looking to put down roots in Europe.

Battery giant CATL, which is the world's largest manufacturer of EV batteries, is also building a $7.6 billion factory in the country as it seeks to tighten its grip on the continent's battery industry.

The presence of Chinese companies has sparked tensions with the European Union, which counts Hungary as a member.

Last month, The Financial Times reported that the EU was investigating whether BYD's Hungarian plant had received unfair subsidies from the Chinese government.

In this article

Treasury yields were flat on Wednesday as investors digested key economic data that showed hot price pressures and an unexpected contraction in the U.S. economy.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was little changed at 4.173%. The 2-year Treasury yield dipped more than 3 basis points to 3.625%.

One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields move inversely to prices.

Gross domestic product, a sum of all the goods and services produced from January through March, fell at an annualized pace of 0.3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 0.4% after GDP rose 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Traders seemed to focus on the inflation readings in the GDP report. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, posted a 3.6% gain for the quarter, up sharply from the 2.4% increase in Q4. Excluding food and energy, core PCE was up 3.5%.

The Commerce Department reported later in the morning that the PCE price index in March was little changed. The headline annual inflation reading was 2.3% for the month, slightly higher than expected, while core was at 2.6%, as forecast.

Investors have also been monitoring the latest tariff developments with some relief as President Donald Trump appears to be willing to negotiate on tariffs with trade partners.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the White House would soon announce a trade deal, but the country wasn't named. Trump also said later that tariff negotiations with India are "coming along great" and a deal would be reached soon.

Trump also softened automotive tariffs, signing an executive order on Tuesday that would reduce the overall level of duties on vehicle imports that had been affected by separate levies "stacking" on top of one another.

How much water should you drink per day?

The answer varies, but it's always way more than six ounces.

So it's puzzling that Hydro Flask — one of the largest water bottle brands in the world — would start selling teeny tiny bottles that are smaller than the average iPhone.

Don't judge the micro bottles by their size, though. Some fans tell Business Insider that they might just be worth the hype.

Reusable water bottles are getting smaller.

Thin Owala bottles usurped Stanley tumblers in 2024, then shorter, thicker Bink bottles had a moment in 2025.

Hydro Flask has taken things a step further — or should I say, smaller.

The brand announced in late February that it was launching the $19 Micro Hydro: a 6.7-inch bottle made in collaboration with Hydro Flask Japan that holds just a few sips of your favorite drink.

That's about 10 ounces less than the average plastic water bottle, and 25 ounces less than the trendy but bulky tumblers that have become standard.

The online-only launch quickly sold out, leading to the brand releasing new colorways in late March. That inventory didn't last a day in its online store, and the product hasn't been restocked.

Currently, Micro Hydro Flasks are only available on resale websites for between $50 and $100 each.

Heidi Ng, a 32-year-old from San Francisco, is a self-described "water bottle girl." She's tried options from Stanley, Hydro Flask, and Yeti, and even follows the brands on social media.

That's where she first encountered Micro Hydro Flasks, which she said instantly reminded her of the small water bottles she regularly saw people carrying during her past travels in China.

"It's only here in America that we've popularized 40-ounce bottles," she said. "When I'd visit relatives in Hong Kong, I'd bring my reusable bottle. They would laugh and say: Isn't that heavy? Why do you want to carry that?"

"So I wasn't totally surprised by the size, as maybe some people are," she added.

Not everyone understands the product.

On Instagram, some Hydro Flask shoppers have asked why anyone would buy such a small bottle.

In most responses, water wasn't mentioned. Instead, people said they've used their micro bottles to measure small pre-workout drinks, to keep soup hot, and as flasks for alcohol.

Then there's Haley Carter, 28, from Tennessee. She told BI that she's used her micro bottle as "an emergency milk stash" to keep the drink cold for her 1- and 3-year-old children on the go.

Geneveive Kelley, a 25-year-old from California, told BI she uses her micro bottle "for everything" — but she especially loves using it to carry matcha.

"I have to have a little sweet drink or something like that each day," Kelley said. "So sometimes, I'll put some matcha that I already made…so I can have it later."

When some fans use the small product to carry water, they're using it because of its convenience.

"It fits in pretty much every single purse that I have, and it fits in my jacket pockets," Ng said. "It actually can be really useful if I'm going out to brunch or somewhere I don't want to carry a full water bottle, and we're walking and talking and I suddenly need a sip."

Kelley, a big Disney fan, said it's also helped her stay hydrated at Disneyland.

"I hate bringing anything heavy into the park," she told BI. "I wanted something light, and because they have refill stations everywhere, [the Micro Hydro Flask] is really convenient."

When Hydro Flask restocked its micro bottles in March, Ng said that buying them was like "getting concert tickets." She waited in line for 25 minutes to get the item, and at the checkout page, she said her payment wouldn't go through. It just kept processing — a common complaint from people who tried to purchase the micro bottles.

While Ng was lucky enough to secure her purchase eventually, countless fans have shared online that they never made it past that page. The number of people trying to buy the same bottles was just too high.

What all three women — and other shoppers who have posted about the bottle on social media — agree on is that Micro Hydro Flasks aren't necessities. They're just convenient and cute hydration tools.

"People think that I'm replacing my 32-ounce Hydro Flask with a 6.7 Micro Hydro as my form of hydration. That's not happening," Kelley said. "I'm still drinking my normal intake of water. I just happen to have a little accessory that goes with me everywhere."

A theme in travel industry earnings this week has emerged: fewer Canadians are visiting the US.

There have also been signs of a top destination they're headed to instead: Mexico.

Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on an earnings call Tuesday that the company, whose hotels are primarily in the US, had seen a decline in Canadian visitors. Caesars Entertainment, the Nevada-based hotel and casino company, also said on its earnings call that Canadian visitation was down. Both companies said, however, that Canadians made up a small portion of their overall business.

Booking Holdings, an online travel booking company, also reported that Canada-US travel had slowed and offered some insight into where Canadian travelers are going instead. The company's brands include Booking.com, Priceline.com, and Kayak.

"In the quarter, we observed notable changes in certain travel patterns. We saw a moderation in trends for inbound travel into the US, particularly from bookers in Canada, and to a lesser extent, from bookers in Europe," the company's chief financial officer, Ewout Lucien Steenbergen, said on Tuesday's earnings call. "However, we also saw an improvement in trends in other travel corridors, for example, from Canada to Mexico, resulting in stable growth overall."

Steenbergen added that the company was "agnostic where they are traveling because usually, they're spending the same amount just at another destination."

The company earnings were the latest sign that Canadians are avoiding US travel in response to President Donald Trump's trade war and his comments about making Canada the 51st state. There have also been other indications from travel companies that Canadians are opting to visit Mexico over the US.

Longwoods International, a market research consultancy specializing in the travel tourism industry, found in a survey published Tuesday that Mexico was one of the top destinations Canadians said they'd choose over the US. The survey, conducted earlier this month, included 1,000 Canadian adults who had taken a trip in the past three years and planned to take one in the next two years.

In the survey, 36% of respondents said they'd planned to travel to the US in the next 12 months but decided to cancel their plans, while 60% said US government policy, trade practices, or political statements had made them less likely to visit the US in the next year.

Of those who said US government policies were affecting their travel plans, 40% said they'd take a domestic trip instead, while 27% said they'd travel to a different international destination. The most popular international destinations included Mexico, Portugal, Spain, France, and the Caribbean.

In March, WestJet Airlines also said Canadian travelers were opting for Central America over the US.

"There's clearly been a reaction," Alex Cruz, a vice chairman of WestJet, said on CNBC about how Trump's trade war had affected Canadians visiting the US. "What we are seeing, though, is people changing their destinations. It's no longer Phoenix or Florida. It's the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Mexico."

Christian Wolters, the Canada president of tour organizer Intrepid Travel, also told NBC News last month that Canadian customers were avoiding the US and traveling domestically or to places such as Mexico and Costa Rica.

The US Travel Association has said that a 10% reduction in visitors from Canada, the top source of international travelers to the US, could mean a loss of $2.1 billion in spending and 14,000 jobs.

President Donald Trump said voters should have expected him to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on the world when they chose to back him in last year's presidential election.

"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on," Trump said of the tariffs during an interview with ABC News that aired Tuesday.

"We've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before," Trump said.

On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 180 countries. A 10% baseline rate took effect on April 5. A higher set of tariffs, which varied by country, went into effect on April 9 before Trump announced a 90-day pause on the same day.

Trump's on-and-off-again tariff announcements sparked a massive market sell-off and were also criticized by economists and business leaders.

Trump, however, said his tariffs on America's trading partners were a necessary measure.

"I could have left it that way, and at some point, there would have been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it,'" Trump told ABC News. "I have wanted to do this for many years."

Trump has defended his tariff policy on multiple occasions. On April 20, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that business leaders who were against his tariffs didn't appreciate what he was doing for them.

"THE BUSINESSMEN WHO CRITICIZE TARIFFS ARE BAD AT BUSINESS, BUT REALLY BAD AT POLITICS," Trump wrote on Truth Social on Easter Sunday.

"THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OR REALIZE THAT I AM THE GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!" Trump continued.

Christopher Tsai, the president and chief investment officer of the investment management firm Tsai Capital, told Business Insider that businesses would probably not have enough time to adjust to Trump's tariffs, even with the announced 90-day pause.

Tsai said the tariffs could hurt America's small and midsize businesses and tip the country into a recession. Small businesses make up about 44% of the US GDP, according to the US Chamber of Commerce.

"This is a lot more than numbers. People's jobs are at stake, and businesses that have been thriving and contributing to the economy for years are all of a sudden in an extremely different situation. That's worrisome to me," Tsai said.

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment from BI.

Swiss giant UBS on Wednesday beat bottom line expectations amid sharp returns in investment banking while warning of the global trade impact of sweeping U.S. tariffs as it seeks to rein in steep share declines.

Net profit attributable to shareholders hit $1.692 billion in the first quarter, compared with a mean forecast of $1.359 billion in a LSEG poll of analysts. Group revenue over the stretch stood at $12.557 billion, versus analyst expectations of $12.99 billion.

Other first-quarter highlights included:

The lender said it delivered a 32% year-on-year hike in revenues of the global markets unit of its investment banking arm, largely driven by "higher client activity in equities and FX with gains across all regions." It also achieved a 15% hike in transaction-based hike in income in its key global wealth management unit.

Speaking to CNBC's Carolin Roth on Wednesday, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti recognized a "challenging environment" in the first quarter, with a spate of "definitely extremely volatile" first few weeks in April that underpinned spikes in the volume of transactions that at times exceeded Covid-19 levels by 30%.

Critically, the lender posted $1.629 billion in its net interest income (NII) — the difference between earnings from loans and investments and the payments on deposits —  down 16% year-on-year and 11% from the fourth quarter, guiding for further declines in the June quarter.

"In the second quarter we expect net interest income (NII) in Global Wealth Management to decline sequentially by a low single-digit percentage, and we see a similar decline in Personal & Corporate Banking's NII in Swiss francs. In US dollar terms, Personal & Corporate Banking's NII is expected to increase sequentially by a mid-single-digit percentage, based on current foreign exchange rates," UBS said.

Investors are keenly watching these metrics as European banks transition to an environment of monetary easing, particularly in Switzerland, which has been combating a strong franc and depressed inflation with interest rates as low as 0.25%.

Ermotti said he is "not overly concerned" about interest rate movements.

"I think that we are now in a situation where it's almost like a neutral, fairly boring zone," he noted. "If rates go up or down from here in Swiss francs, then we're going to see a potential pick up in NII. But it's premature to talk about if and when this will materialize."

Separately, UBS on Wednesday confirmed it had completed $500 million in share buybacks and intended to press ahead with a $2.5 billion repurchase plan for the remainder of 2025.

"Overall a decent set of results, albeit boosted by non-core gains and heightened trading activity in both IB and GWM, all of which may not be sustainable, whereas NII has missed expectations again," Citi analysts said in a Wednesday note after UBS reported.

The lender's Swiss-listed shares closed down 0.3% on Wednesday.

Deposed this month as continental Europe's largest bank by market capitalization by Banco Santander, UBS has suffered share declines of roughly 10% in the year to date, with the brunt of losses logged after the White House's imposition of tariffs on global trade partners on April 2.

Switzerland faces a 31% duty if it fails to agree a more conciliatory trade deal by the end of Washington's 90-day reprieve in early July. Comparatively, the European Union was hit with 20% in U.S. levies.

Tensions with Washington and a potential recessionary outlook for the world's largest economy spell trouble for the Swiss banking giant and its money-spinning global wealth management division, with around half of UBS' invested assets concentrated in the broader Americas region last year.

"Rapid and significant changes to trade tariffs, heightened risk of escalation and significantly increased macroeconomic uncertainty led to major market volatility in the first weeks of April," UBS said Wednesday. "With a wide range of possible outcomes, the economic path forward is particularly unpredictable. The prospect of higher tariffs on global trade presents a material risk to global growth and inflation, clouding the interest rate outlook."

It flagged the possibility of "further spikes in volatility" as markets remain sensitive to new tariffs-led developments, noting that "Prolonged uncertainty would affect sentiment and cause businesses and investors to delay important decisions on strategy, capital allocation and investments."

"You look at the last 10 days or so, I think there is a little bit of fatigue coming in. I think that investors are now waiting in a wait-and-see mode. Markets have settled down … people are waiting for significant news," UBS' Ermotti told CNBC. "But I do expect spikes of volatilities to come back as positive or negative news unfold."

The picture of UBS' long-term profitability remains darkened by questions over potential new — and more draconian — capital requirements from Swiss authorities, which have questioned the Swiss titan's "too big to fail" status since its absorption of collapsed domestic rival Credit Suisse. The transaction — which one politician at the time dubbed the "deal of the century" — has propelled UBS down the path of maximum resistance against further restrictions, which it argues would undermine its competitiveness as an already adequately capitalized entity.

"UBS's lobbying is both visible and unmistakable. It's clearly resonating in various places. But once again: the Federal Council cannot be intimidated by lobbying, but must also represent the interests of taxpayers," Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter told broadcaster SRF last month, according to a Google translation.

"The Federal Council has one goal: that in the event of a crisis, a UBS that is systemically important is resolvable. This means that the systemically important parts of the bank can be separated in Switzerland. That must be the goal of the Federal Council and the new legislation."

UBS is expected to engage with the Swiss Federal Council over any proposed capital requirement changes in June.

Speaking about UBS' odds of competitiveness in the broader Swiss regulatory environment, Ermotti said, "We are not magicians. We are not going to be able to be competitive and provide and be an engine of growth for the financial center, but also for the economy, if the regulatory framework is not competitive."

Target made its first-ever donation to a presidential inauguration this year, contributing $1 million to President Donald Trump's 2025 Inaugural Committee on January 10, according to a recent Federal Election Commission filing.

First reported by The Minnesota Star Tribune, the Minneapolis-based retailer is one of the three major retailers that contributed to Trump's 2025 inauguration, alongside Walmart and e-commerce giant Amazon.

Trump's inauguration received donations from the tech sector as well as from retail. Based on FEC filings, the Trump-Vance inaugural committee raised more than $239 million, a figure that more than doubles what Trump received for inauguration in 2016 and far exceeds the $62 million Biden received in 2020.

Aside from oil companies that donated heavily to Trump's inauguration, large Silicon Valley companies like Google, Meta, and Uber also each contributed $1 million, and individual tech CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook and Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi also made personal donations of similar sums. These companies also watched their shares plunge due to Trump's tariff policies.

Target is likely feeling the sting of Trump's trade policies. Roughly half of the retailer's merchandise is imported, according to what Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer of Target, said in the company's fourth quarter earnings of 2024. In March, Target forecast that its full-year comparable sales could come in below estimates, and said that uncertainty around tariffs as well as consumer spending could weigh on first-quarter profits.

Walmart and Target's respective CEOs also met with Trump last week to discuss the impact of tariffs on consumer prices and on retail supply chains that could lead to product shortages.

Supply chain experts have also previously told Business Insider that while companies like Walmart are heavy on groceries that are predominantly domestic, Target is less insulated from tariffs because it relies heavily on merchandise like apparel, housewares, and beauty products, most of which are imported. Meanwhile, food and beverages accounted for less than a quarter of Target's sales in 2024.

Target shares prices were down by around 40% on April 29 compared to the same day a year ago, and down by over 50% since their 2021 peak.

The inauguration donation followed a year of change for Target. In May of last year, Target said only a fraction of stores would carry Pride merchandise the following month. The decline came after years of prominent Pride displays. The company said in a memo obtained by Business Insider that it would offer a collection online and in certain stores "based on historical sales performance."

The same week Trump was inaugurated, the company said it was rolling back its DEI initiatives, such as its DEI goals, investments in Black-owned businesses, and an end to all external diversity surveys. It joined a list of other companies that did away with their DEI initiatives after Trump ordered the end of DEI programs at federal agencies.

An Atlanta pastor named Jamal Bryant called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback, which drew wide participation.

Target and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Google is making changes to its compensation structure in a bid to incentivize higher performance from staff.

The company announced on Tuesday that it would change how employee performance ratings work. The change gives more staff the opportunity to achieve one of the highest scores in their annual review and, therefore, higher compensation, while lower performers receive smaller bonuses and equity.

In an email to staff with the subject line "Strengthening our performance culture," John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, said managers would be able to allocate the "Outstanding Impact" score to more employees than previously.

"This means more Googlers will have the opportunity to achieve that rating during annual reviews, and their bonus and equity award will be modeled using the O's individual multiplier in 2026," he wrote in the email, which was seen by Business Insider.

Googlers' performances are rated once a year using an internal system known as Googler Reviews and Development, or GRAD. An employee's impact is scored on a scale, with "Not Enough Impact" being the lowest and "Transformative Impact" being the highest. The ranking a Googler is given usually determines their bonus and equity.

Most Googlers fall into the third-highest bracket, "Significant Impact." The "Outstanding Impact" bucket captures a smaller number of higher performers, while the "Transformative" bucket is reserved for a very small number of excelling Googlers. A fifth bucket, "Moderate Impact," falls between Significant and Not Enough.

Casey said Google would also increase the discretionary budget it gives to managers so they can dish out more rewards to high performers who fall within that "Significant Impact" bracket.

He added that the changes would be "budget-neutral," meaning employees with lower ratings could receive smaller bonuses and equity in their compensation packages as more of the budget is allocated to the higher brackets.

"We want to be upfront that to fund this we'll be slightly reducing the bonus and equity individual multipliers for Significant Impact and Moderate Impact ratings," Casey told staff. "It's important to note that Significant Impact will remain a strong rating — achieving it will still get you more than your target bonus."

A Google spokesperson, Courtenay Mencini, told Business Insider in a statement, "We're making these changes to further reward top performers and continue our momentum across the company."

The changes at Google have come amid a broader shift across Big Tech to run their businesses more efficiently and push employees to perform better. Microsoft recently rolled out new policies focused on dialing up performance pressure on employees, while in January, Meta announced it would cut 5% of its workforce, focusing on low performers.

While Google hasn't gone to such lengths itself, the changes to its performance ratings are designed to push staff to work harder and aim higher.

"High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set," Casey wrote in the email to staff, adding that the changes were being made to "further reward top contributors" at the company.

Correction: April 30, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the position of Google's "Significant Impact" bracket. It's the third-highest bracket, not the second-highest.

In a recent interview, Harvard University dropout Mark Zuckerberg said that he's not sure if colleges are preparing students enough for today's job market.

"I'm not sure that college is preparing people for like the jobs that they need to have today," Zuckerberg said in an interview with comedian Theo Von published on Monday. "I think there's a big issue on that and like all the student debt issues are like really big issues."

The Meta CEO said that college could be a formative "social experience" for students, as many leave home for the first time. Still, some people will have to decide whether higher education is worth going into debt.

"It would be one thing if it were just kind of like a social experience," he said. "If it's not preparing you for the jobs that you need and you're kind of starting off in this big hole, then I think that's not good. That I think there's gonna have to be a reckoning with and people are gonna have to kind of figure whether that makes sense."

According to data from CollegeBoard, the average student loan debt for those who graduated in 2022-23 was $29,3000 per borrower. Gen Z graduates this year face a tough job market amid layoffs in the tech and government sectors.

One 2024 study from Deloitte showed that a third of Gen Z and millennials opt out of higher education due to costs and career choices that don't require a degree.

"It's sort of been this taboo thing to say of like, maybe not everyone needs to go to college because there's, like, a lot of jobs that don't require that," Zuckerberg said. "But I think people are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe like 10 years ago."

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in 2005 while a sophomore to focus on growing Facebook. Twelve years later, he received an honorary degree.

The CEO said in the interview that he met many people in college "who are really important in my life," including his wife, Priscilla Chan, Facebook cofounders, and people who are still close friends.

"It was good, I feel like you need some time kind of away from home a bit before you like, fully go out," he said of his time at boarding school and college.

When asked if students should be learning about artificial intelligence in middle or high school, Zuckerberg said technology changes a lot and that he's not using the same skills he learned when he was 15. Still, he added that there could be value in "understanding the technology and understanding how to use it."

Zuckerberg also said having good mentors or teachers is valuable, regardless of the class.

"When I was in boarding school, I really liked studying Latin and Greek, and that's like, not useful for any practical thing," he said, "But it's fun."

A Meta spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Story of Man Who Lost $750 Million Worth of Bitcoin in Landfill Headed to Hollywood

tv

The story of a Wales man who believes he accidentally threw away $750 million worth of Bitcoin is now poised to get the Hollywood treatment. 

On Wednesday, a new Los Angeles-based production company, Lebul, announced that it secured the exclusive rights to tell the story of James Howells, an IT engineer who mined 8,000 BTC back in 2009—when the tokens were effectively worthless—and then lost them all. 

Howells maintains that a former lover threw away a hard drive containing the tokens back in 2013. They are worth nearly a billion dollars. For the last several years, Howells has waged an unsuccessful battle to search the Wales landfill where he insists—somewhere—his digital treasure is still buried.

Last month, a British appeals court issued a final ruling ordering him to not sift through the waste site in search of his hard drive. Howells condemned the judgement as a tactic employed by UK elites to sweep the affair “under the carpet.” He says he now plans to buy the landfill when it closes next year. 

In the interim, the Welshman is now seeking to overcome another statistically imposing hurdle: having his tale turned into a high-profile docuseries. 

Howells told Decrypt he has “received hundreds of offers” from “all sorts of award-winning production companies” over the years, to turn his saga into a documentary. But ultimately he went with Lebul—in part, he said, because the company is willing to help launch a “global media campaign to support my broader objective of acquiring the Docksway landfill.”

Lebul says it plans to turn the story of Howell's failed mission to search his local landfill into “a bold, multi-platform media venture including a premium docuseries, podcast, and an expansive short-form content and marketing strategy across social platforms.”

"This isn't just content," Reese Van Allen, the company's president of unscripted entertainment, said in a statement. "It's a live-action tech thriller with nearly a billion dollars on the line—and Lebul is proud to bring it to the world."

Howells is confident the media enterprise will not only do justice to his experiences, but also touch on more universal themes. 

“The documentary will expose the environmental contradictions of Newport City Council and shine a light on the long-term financial obligations taxpayers face from maintaining a closed landfill,” he said, “while also introducing a global narrative built around technology, reclamation, and digital ownership.”

A closely followed crypto analyst says that altcoins may start outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) once one key metric hits a pivotal level.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Rekt Capital tells his 545,100 followers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric may soon enter a downward phase, setting alts up to outperform the flagship crypto asset.

Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.73%. Traders use BTC.D to track if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as the metric calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC.

“If history repeats, the real altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin dominance rejects close to or directly from 71% (red).”

The analyst also says that BTC.D is likely reclaiming 64% as support on the monthly chart, resembling a similar pattern that occurred in 2019, when the metric surged to hit 71% before entering a downtrend.

“BTC dominance indeed successfully retested November 2024 highs (black) to revisit ~64% (blue). Now, Bitcoin dominance is positioning itself for a reclaim of 64%. It's likely BTC dominance reclaims 64% in a very similar fashion to the reclaim of ~60%.” 

Rekt Capital says Bitcoin may be on the verge of entering another price discovery phase after a lengthy consolidation period.

“Bitcoin price discovery roadmap: Bitcoin is trying to finalize its first price discovery correction to transition into its second price discovery uptrend.”

Bitcoin is trading for $93,961 at time of writing, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

What one hour ago was looking like another positive day in markets has turned decidedly negative as the latest economic data fueled growing stagflation fears.

First up was ADP jobs numbers for April. Coming two days ahead of the government's own employment data for April, the ADP report showed just 62,000 private sector jobs created this month, well shy of estimates for 108,000 and March's 147,000. It was the weakest print since July 2024.

Next was the government's first estimate of first quarter GDP growth, which came in at negative 0.3% against estimates for positive 0.2%. While the quarter ended in March, economic actors — fully aware of coming tariffs — front-loaded imports early in the year. Going back to Econ 101, rising imports (absent a corresponding gain in exports) are a drag on GDP growth. 

Indeed, the export-import imbalance cut GDP growth by nearly 5% in the first quarter. Also at work was the Trump administration's DOGE efforts, with government spending a drag on GDP for the first time since 2022.

Turning to inflation, the Core PCE price index embedded within the GDP report rose 3.5% versus estimates for a gain of just 3.1%.

It's all adding up to a big drop in U.S. stocks, with the Nasdaq lower 2% and S&P 500 by 1.5%. That's hitting bitcoin (BTC), which has slipped about 1% alongside to $94,300.

 Vitalik Buterin outlined his 2025 Ethereum development priorities, including single-slot finality, statelessness, enhanced privacy and decentralized infrastructure. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released another update on what he believes the future of the network should entail.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.

The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

Buterin recently argued that privacy should be a top priority for developers and proposed solutions to boost privacy on Ethereum. Earlier in April, he also published a short-term privacy roadmap for Ethereum, detailing technical solutions to the network's transparency.

Buterin's focus on forward-looking research follows changes at the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit organization developing the Ethereum ecosystem. Earlier this month, the Ethereum Foundation co-executive director, Tomasz Stańczak, said that Buterin now has more time for research and exploration.

“Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long‑term breakthroughs,” he wrote.

In today's post, Buterin said that this year, he would be researching single-slot finality on Ethereum. This proposed upgrade would allow blocks to become final in a single slot within 12 seconds. This would significantly reduce the time needed to confirm transactions irreversibly and improve user experience.

Another area of focus would be making Ethereum stateless. This would lead to nodes no longer storing the full state (account balances, contracts, etc.) but instead requiring users to provide the necessary state data (witnesses) with each transaction. This could potentially improve scalability and decentralization.

Buterin also expects to study ways to improve the ecosystem's cybersecurity on both the front and back ends, as well as its resilience and decentralization. He set some objectives that he specified should also apply to client software, such as third-party wallets:

Besides working on the Ethereum protocol, Buterin expects to dedicate his attention to improving communication tools, information sharing, and the social layer surrounding Ethereum. This includes governance changes, the network's resources management and open-source development funding.

Buterin explained that this also involves developing better encrypted messaging, software documentation, and leading their adoption in the ecosystem. He also hinted at developing prediction markets and related technology, as well as some potential new types of communication tools.

Other objectives include the lower-level development. Buterin cited the intention to investigate cryptography, operating systems, hardware, physical infrastructure and biological defence without further explanation.

Buterin also cited some areas of development where he is not personally involved, including plans to increase Ethereum's gas limit as a short-term scalability solution, as well as peer-to-peer systems.

Strategists for two U.S. bills meant to create an oversight regime for crypto are setting out plans this week to pass legislation in the summer, Bo Hines, the White House official at the center of those efforts, told CoinDesk.



Hines, who President Donald Trump hired as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk in an interview that the procedures are being ironed out to move legislation on regulating stablecoin issuers, and the crypto advocates in the White House and Congress will quickly pivot to the bigger bill that will set a full regulatory regime for U.S. crypto markets.



The progress so far puts the efforts "well on pace to achieve what the President desires," he said, which is that both crypto bills reach Trump's desk for signatures before Congress takes its summer recess in August.



The president's adviser, who is a speaker at Consensus 2025 in Toronto May 14-16, said the bills to regulate stablecoin issuers that are moving through the Senate and House of Representatives are "90% aligned," so it won't be a difficult task to bring them together into a unified approach that would still need approval in both chambers."We're in the process of mitigating any differences between the two chambers there, but we feel like, you know, we're in a really good spot to get that passed and signed into law," he said. "It lays the foundation for everything that we can do."



He said the more complex undertaking to write laws for how the U.S. should police the overall markets should emerge in draft bills "in the next few weeks."





While Congress is moving unusually fast, the president's own crypto business interests have been criticized by Democrats who accuse Trump of improperly benefiting from his own policies and of inviting foreign influence from investors in his family's projects. Trump's interests include stakes in World Liberty Financial and the president's own memecoin, $TRUMP. Hines pushed back, saying the rise of crypto has presented attractive innovations for investors.

"Any good business person would engage in a marketplace opportunity like that," he said. "So, you know, I don't view it as being detrimental in any capacity whatsoever."



The president and his family have the "ability to engage with any marketplace that they see fit," Hines said.



"We're narrowly focused on just doing what's in the best interest of the United States to make the U.S. the crypto capital world, usher in the golden age of digital assets, and we have our binders on to everything else," he said. "That's what the president's asked us to do, and we're going to deliver on his wishes."



The White House official, 29, is known as a staunch loyalist to Trump, who had endorsed the former college football player in the first of his two unsuccessful North Carolina congressional campaigns. Despite his relative inexperience in the crypto field, Trump elevated Hines to a senior White House role to work beside crypto czar David Sacks and act as a "sherpa between White House policy, interagency activity, industry and what's happening on Capitol Hill," as Hines described it.



"We move at a speed that no other administration has ever been able to move before," Hines noted.





Many in the digital assets industry had clamored for a digital assets reserve at the federal level, though the idea for how to approach it varies widely. Trump's campaign-trail promises surged toward reality in March when he ordered his administration to start work on a bitcoin (BTC) reserve and a separate stockpile of other crypto assets.



One point of disappointment for those who'd wished for it was that Trump insisted the reserve be budget-neutral, meaning no new taxpayer money would go toward acquiring assets for the reserve.



Hines has been a prominent booster of this effort. He said the Treasury-led audit of U.S. crypto holdings, which needs to be done to find out the extent of assets (so far unmeasured) that'll be directed into the stockpiles, is progressing quickly. The Treasury Department is now going through audit reports from various corners of the U.S. government, he said.



Trump had directed his administration to work out ideas for how to add even more to the funds without tapping taxpayers, and Hines said they're still "fleshing out the best ideas."



"I don't think there's going to be one single resolution where we say, 'This is the path that we're going.' I think there could be multiple ways in which we engage in this," Hines said, "We view bitcoin as digital gold, and we want to accumulate as much as we can."



He didn't have a timeline in mind for when the first tokens will begin stacking up as a longterm U.S. government investment.





The transition from President Joe Biden to Trump's administration has been stark for the industry — until recently a target of government suspicion and now celebrated as an innovative movement that should be fostered. Already, regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission have reversed policies and started crypto roundtables behind doors that had been largely closed to digital assets discussions. And Trump himself held a crypto summit in the room of the White House where state dinners are hosted.



"We move at a speed that no other administration has ever been able to move before," Hines noted.



Hines said he's had as many as 200 meetings with crypto insiders in his short stint in the government, and he granted that their opinions can range widely. But he thinks the industry is largely aligned where it needs to be as Congress and regulators are considering its U.S. future.



When asked about some industry concerns about splitting the crypto legislation into two rather than a combined, single effort to improve its odds, he said details could still be worked out, though he's currently focused on a stablecoin bill being quickly followed by market-structure legislation.



The crypto push, which he said "some will portray as being a chaotic process," looks that way because that's always the case in government policymaking "when you're attempting to effectuate change."



"We're talking about revolutionizing a financial marketplace which has basically been archaic for the last three decades," he said. "I just think that people should be very excited about what's to come."

 The stolen $330 million was laundered through 300 wallets and 20+ exchanges, experts told Cointelegraph. 

An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.

The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim's wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.

The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.

Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).

Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

Once stolen, the attacker wasted no time laundering the Bitcoin using a peel chain method — a common obfuscation technique in which large sums are broken into smaller, harder-to-trace chunks.

“$330M in BTC was received in two transactions, then immediately distributed via peel chains,” Yehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, explained to Cointelegraph.

Hacken's internal tool, Extractor, tracked $284 million worth of BTC funneled through these chains, which now amounts to around $60 million after repeated “peeling” and redistribution across low-credibility exchanges.

Rudytsia said over 300 hacker wallets and 20+ exchanges or payment services were involved, including Binance.

Cointelegraph has reached out to Binance for comment.

“Major problem in cases like this (similar to Genesis creditor's 4064 BTC theft back in Aug 2024) is that freezing centralized exchange accounts used in the laundering process is hardened due to particularly slow legal process of police reporting and investigations,” Rudytsia added.

Adding to the complexity, the attacker rapidly converted a significant portion of the BTC into XMR. The move triggered a 50% surge in Monero's price, with the token briefly reaching $339.

“Once funds are swapped into Monero, tracing becomes virtually impossible due to its privacy-preserving architecture. The chance of recovery drops significantly after this step,” Cyvers Alerts senior security operations lead Hakan Unal said.

Unal said that the attacker likely had pre-established accounts across multiple exchanges and OTC desks, suggesting a high degree of premeditation.

A small portion of the stolen BTC was also bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various platforms, further complicating tracking efforts. Investigators have since alerted exchanges for potential freezing of funds.

ZachXBT had previously dismissed the theory that North Korea's Lazarus Group could have been behind the attack, suggesting independent hackers were responsible.

While attribution remains uncertain, experts agree the laundering tactics show rare automation and coordination for a heist of this magnitude.

“So far, we haven't been able to confidently link this activity to any known hacker group, as the laundering methods used — while sophisticated — don't clearly match the signature patterns of previously identified actors,” Unal noted.

He recommended using multisignature (multisig) wallets to eliminate single points of failure, minimizing exposure to hot wallets connected to the internet, regularly rotating private keys, and relying on hardware-based cold storage to safeguard large Bitcoin holdings.

In the first quarter of 2025, hackers stole more than $1.6 billion worth of crypto from exchanges and onchain smart contracts, blockchain security firm PeckShield said in an April report. 

More than 90% of those losses are attributable to a $1.5 billion attack on Bybit, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, by North Korean hacking outfit Lazarus Group.

FIFA Collect, a digital platform created by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) that allows football fans to collect, trade, and enjoy digital collectibles featuring iconic moments from football history, announced today it will migrate its NFT platform to a new EVM-compatible FIFA blockchain.

The transition, scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, aims to support enhanced performance, future features, and improved scalability for the platform's digital collectibles ecosystem.

According to FIFA, this change will not affect users' access to their accounts or existing digital collectibles. All assets will remain fully secure and accessible throughout and after the migration process.

The upgrade will bring changes to wallet compatibility, with Algorand-based wallets like Pera and Defly no longer supported post-migration. Users will instead be able to connect using MetaMask or other EVM-compatible wallets that support WalletConnect.

“The FIFA Blockchain was created to support new experiences, enable wallet compatibility, and provide stronger foundations for future innovation,” FIFA stated in its migration FAQ document.

Users who have exported collectibles must reimport them before the migration date to ensure inclusion in the automatic transfer process. After the cut-off date, manual migrations will require additional verification.

USDC balances will remain available for spending until the migration date and can be withdrawn, but not spent, after the transition. Listed collectibles will automatically transfer to the new platform unless users delist them before the migration.

In May 2022, FIFA announced a strategic collaboration with Algorand, naming it the official blockchain partner of the organization. As part of the agreement, Algorand provided a blockchain-supported wallet solution and played a key role in shaping FIFA's digital asset strategy.

Through this collaboration, FIFA explored blockchain-driven innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital wallets, with a focus on transparency, sustainability, and revenue growth.

The partnership led to the launch of FIFA Collect later in 2022. Powered by Algorand, the NFT platform enables fans to collect and engage with iconic football moments in digital form.

ALGO, Algorand's native asset, dropped 3% to $0.2213 on Binance following the news.

DUBAI, UAE — Tokenization firm Securitize and decentralized finance (DeFi) specialist Gauntlet are planning to bring a tokenized version of Apollo's credit fund to DeFi, a notable step in embedding real-world assets into the crypto ecosystem.

The two firms are unveiling Wednesday a leveraged-yield strategy offering centered on the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED), a tokenized feeder fund that debuted in January and invests in Apollo's $1 billion Diversified Credit Fund. The strategy will run on Compound Blue, a lending protocol powered by Morpho,

The offering, called Levered RWA Strategy, will be first available on Polygon (POL). It is expected to expand to the Ethereum mainnet and other blockchains after a pilot phase.

"The idea behind the product is we want our securities to be plug and play competitive with stablecoin strategies writ large," Reid Simon, head of DeFi and credit solutions at Securitize, said in an interview with CoinDesk.

The introduction comes as tokenized RWAs — funds, bonds, credit products — gain traction among traditional finance giants. BlackRock, HSBC, and Franklin Templeton are among the firms exploring blockchain-based asset issuance and settlement. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone have pulled in over $6 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz.

While institutions are experimenting with tokenization, the next challenge is making these assets usable across DeFi applications. That includes enabling their use as collateral for loans, margin trading or building investment strategies not possible on legacy rails.

The strategy employs a DeFi-native yield-optimization technique called "looping", in which ACRED tokens deposited into a vault are used as collateral to borrow USDC, which is then used to purchase more ACRED. The process repeats recursively to enhance yield, with exposure adjusted dynamically based on real-time borrowing and lending rates.

All trades are automated using smart contracts, reducing the need for manual oversight. Risk is actively managed by Gauntlet's risk engine, which monitors leverage ratios and can unwind positions in volatile market conditions to protect users.

"This is expected to deliver the institutional-grade DeFi that our industry has promised for years," Morpho CEO and cofounder Paul Frambot said. "This use case uniquely demonstrates how DeFi enables investors in funds like ACRED to access financial composability that is simply not possible on traditional rails.”

The vault is also one of the first uses of Securitize's new sToken tool, which allows accredited token holders to maintain compliance and investor protections within decentralized networks. In this case, ACRED investors first mint sACRED that they can use for broader DeFi strategies without breaking regulatory rules.

"This is a strong example of the institutional-grade DeFi we've been working to build: making tokenized securities not only accessible, but compelling to crypto-native investors seeking strategies that objectively outpace their traditional counterparts,” Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement.

Bitcoin (BTC) is extending its consolidation streak to five consecutive days, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as investors await a decisive breakout. A K33 report highlights two key events to watch this week: MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. 

Institutional demand for Bitcoin remains strong, supporting a bullish thesis, as US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the positive trend seen since April 17.

The K33 report speculates that positive news will emerge from MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings presentation on Thursday, as the company nearly depleted its $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) shelf offering this week. The analyst explains that the massive $21 billion ATM announced by MSTR on October 30, 2024, is now practically emptied after another BTC purchase on Monday.

Six months after this announcement, $128.7 million remains of the original $21 billion ATM offering. Nonetheless, other funding sources, such as convertibles and perpetual preferred stock offerings Strife (STRF), have moved slower. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman “Michael Saylor seems more than determined to deploy as much capital as frequently and aggressively as possible to grow the company's BTC treasury,” the analyst says.

Given the continued solid MSTR premiums, the analyst views a new ATM announcement as a likely scenario during the earnings call – similar to the 21/21 plan announcement during Q3 earnings. Such an announcement would likely benefit the BTC price.

The second event to watch this week is the 60-day deadline of Trump's executive order regarding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, set for May 5. The order from March 6 gave the US Treasury a 60-day deadline to deliver an evaluation of the legal and investment considerations for establishing and managing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Official communication ahead of this deadline has been very limited, with little discussion of the matter among the public. However, the analyst expects this to change as the date approaches. 

Bitcoin institutional demand remained strong so far this week. According to the data from SoSoValue shown below, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $172.78 million on Tuesday, continuing the trend of inflows since April 17. If these inflows intensify, Bitcoin prices could rally further.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% through Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and has hovered around this level in the last four days. 

If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions.

However, if BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological level.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price is extending its consolidation streak, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as traders await a decisive breakout. MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have the potential to move BTC price.

Chainlink's supply outside exchanges has surged to 803.38 million from 778.87 million in under two months. LINK network activity declines, with new and active addresses falling from a recent peak.

Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further. If XRP holds above the immediate support at $2.21, a reversal could soon ensue.

THORChain announced on Tuesday that its stagenet development of its Ripple (XRP) integration is nearing the final step, with mainnet activation imminent. This integration enhances THORChain's economic model by increasing swap activity and protocol fees. 

Bitcoin price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week. This week's rally was supported by strong institutional demand, as US spot ETFs recorded a total inflow of $2.68 billion until Thursday.

In our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, we estimated that illicit cryptocurrency addresses received $40.9 billion in 2024. At first glance, this appears to mark a decline from the previous year's $46.1 billion. However, our 2024 figures reflect-lower bound estimates based on identified illicit addresses — when accounting for likely undiscovered activity, the true number is closer to $51.3 billion. In other words, crypto crime intensified.



As blockchain adoption accelerates and decentralized infrastructure expands, so does the attack surface. With every new protocol, smart contract, and wallet user added to the ecosystem, the need for robust blockchain security grows more urgent. Innovation has opened the doors to remarkable possibilities, but also to a new era of sophisticated threats.

From smart contract exploits and cross-chain bridge hacks, to phishing campaigns that drain users wallets, the risks facing blockchain technology are evolving in real time. However, with the right tools, many attacks can be stopped before they strike. In this blog, we'll explore the most pressing blockchain security challenges and the steps participants can take now to build more resilient infrastructure.

Keep reading to learn more about the following topics:

Blockchain security refers to the combination of cybersecurity principles, tools, and best practices aimed at mitigating risk, avoiding malicious attacks, and preventing unauthorized access while operating on blockchain networks.

While all blockchains run on distributed ledger technology (DLT), not all blockchains are functionally the same or equally secure. Both public and private blockchains have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, and their security models are fundamentally different due to the open versus closed nature of their networks.

Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open, permissionless networks where anyone can join and participate in validating transactions. The codebase of public blockchains is open source — publicly available and continually vetted by developers who review the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. By leveraging the expertise of open-source communities, the security, features, and efficiency of these blockchains are continuously examined and improved. At the same time, hackers and malicious entities also examine code to search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

In contrast, private blockchains are exclusive, permissioned networks with limited access, making them more centralized. Securing a private blockchain is the sole responsibility of the operating entity. The centralized nature of these blockchains means that there is a single point of failure, making it crucial for the institution to implement strong security measures.

Although private blockchains may not benefit as much from the decentralized and security-by-numbers approach of public blockchains, they are generally faster and more efficient due to less computational work required for consensus algorithms. However, because the entity granting permission also has authority over the network, there is a theoretical risk of the network being shut down or manipulated.

Blockchain technology runs on a distributed digital ledger system. A blockchain network is made up of a worldwide network of computers, known as nodes, validating and recording transactions. Every participant maintains a copy of the ledger, so there is no centralized authority or point of failure. Each time a transaction occurs — such as sending or receiving cryptocurrency — it is recorded on a block.

Before a block (made up of a group of transactions that occurred during a given time frame) is added to the chain, it must first be verified by consensus. That's where consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, come into play. In a Proof-of-Work system, miners compete to solve computationally intensive algorithms to validate transactions. In a Proof-of-Stake system, network participants lock up a certain quantity of tokens to run a node to validate transactions. Miners and stakers are incentivized with rewards to secure the network. This process ensures everyone agrees (or reaches consensus) on the validity of each transaction. Once a block is full, it is sealed and linked to the previous block using a cryptographic code, forming a chain. By linking each block using cryptography and distributing the ledger across numerous computers, any attempt to tamper with a block would disrupt the entire chain.

Unlike traditional finance — which operates on permissions to pull funds — a crypto transaction is a push transaction, initiated peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediary. Participants in blockchain networks control their digital assets on the blockchain with a private key — a cryptographically secured method of authentication and access.

Crypto requires you to be deliberate. Because no intermediary is required, personal responsibility becomes much more important when transferring value on-chain. Once transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, they are irreversible. This makes it notoriously difficult to recover funds that are lost or stolen.

The notion that blockchain technology is inherently immune to security threats is somewhat misleading, but several of its unique structural features bolster its intrinsic security:

While these defining characteristics are the reason blockchain technology is considered so revolutionary, there are still vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Paradoxically, some of the traits of blockchain (e.g. immutability) can introduce unique complexities if the system itself is compromised. Next, we'll look at challenges in securing blockchains and some of the most common threats currently shaping the landscape.

A major challenge in securing blockchain systems is that the pace of innovation continues to outstrip the development of security tools. New protocols, features, and use cases emerge faster than they can be thoroughly vetted, leaving gaps that attackers are quick to exploit.

The permissionless nature of blockchain adds another layer of complexity. Anyone can deploy a contract, launch a token, or interact with protocols, creating low barriers for malicious actors to operate at scale. Scams can proliferate with little friction, often faster than detection systems can respond.

Cross-chain activity only compounds the problem. As users move assets across multiple blockchains, visibility into transactions can become fragmented. Monitoring and securing these flows requires coordination across protocols — something the current infrastructure isn't fully equipped to handle.

Finally, one of the most persistent challenges is real-time detection. On-chain behavior can look similar, whether it's part of a legitimate arbitrage strategy or a coordinated exploit. This ambiguity makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between malicious and benign actions before damage is done.

The following threats target applications operating on-chain — such as DeFi protocols, bridges, and phishing tokens — rather than the underlying blockchain infrastructure itself.

Smart contracts are self-executing code that power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But once deployed, a single bug can expose millions in locked assets. Attackers often exploit logical flaws, reentrancy vulnerabilities, or unchecked access controls to drain funds or manipulate protocol behavior. Without code audits, even well-intentioned projects can become exposed.

Between January and November 2024, approximately 8.5% of funds stolen were due to smart contract vulnerabilities and code exploits.

Oracles feed real-world data into smart contracts. If attackers influence or corrupt these inputs, they can trigger faulty contract logic. For instance, manipulating the reported price of an asset could allow an attacker to buy it at a discount or trigger a liquidation cascade. In DeFi, where value is algorithmically tied to oracle data, the consequences can be immediate and catastrophic.

Cross-chain bridges allow assets to move between blockchains, but they've also become prime targets for attackers. Many bridge architectures rely on complex smart contracts and custodial mechanisms, creating large honeypots of funds. A single vulnerability can be exploited to mint or release wrapped tokens without backing, leading to massive losses.

Not all threats in blockchain are technical. Some of the most damaging attacks are social in nature. Rug pulls occur when developers abruptly withdraw liquidity or abandon a project after attracting user investment, leaving holders with worthless tokens. These schemes often masquerade as legitimate startups, leveraging hype, influencer marketing, and anonymous teams to build trust before vanishing with user funds.

We identified that 3.59% of all launched tokens in 2024 displayed patterns that may have been linked to rug pull schemes. Moreover, approximately 94% of DEX pools involved in suspected pump-and-dump schemes appear to be rugged by the address that created the DEX pool. The other 6% appear to be rugged by the addresses that were funded by the pool or token deployer.

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors in crypto. As we recently revealed in our 2025 Crypto Crime Report, nearly $10 billion worth of crypto was lost in 2024 due to fraud and scams, although we estimate this number is likely closer to $12.4 billion, which would be a slight increase from amounts stolen in 2023.

Whether through fake wallet apps, malicious airdrops, or impersonated support accounts, attackers trick users into revealing private keys or signing malicious transactions. These scams are growing more targeted and convincing, often exploiting community trust and platform UX loopholes.

Preventing cyberattacks before they happen starts with visibility. On-chain data provides an invaluable window into blockchain activity, helping security teams identify red flags early — whether that's unusual transaction patterns, interactions with known malicious contracts, or sudden liquidity movements. Real-time monitoring and transaction analysis are essential for catching threats in motion.

Key components of blockchain analytics include:

A financial deal was supposed to help launch the MOVE crypto token.Instead, it led to a token-dumping scandal, a Binance ban, and behind-the-scenes infighting. 

Contracts obtained by CoinDesk help explain where it all went wrong. 

Movement, the blockchain project behind the MOVE cryptocurrency, is investigating whether it was deceived into signing a financial agreement that granted a single entity outsized control over the market for its token, according to internal documents reviewed by CoinDesk.

The agreement led to 66 million MOVE tokens being sold onto the market the day after the asset's December 9 exchange debut, triggering a steep price drop and allegations of insider dealing within a crypto project endorsed by World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture backed by Donald Trump.

Cooper Scanlon, Movement Labs' co-founder, told employees in an April 21 Slack message that the company was examining how more than 5% of MOVE tokens earmarked for Web3Port, a market maker, were routed through a middleman named Rentech — “an entity the foundation was led to believe was a subsidiary of Web3Port but apparently is not.” Rentech denies engaging in any misrepresentation.

Movement's contract with Rentech loaned a single counterparty around half of MOVE's publicly held supply, according to an internal Movement Foundation memo. This granted the entity an unusually large degree of control over the fledgling token, experts told CoinDesk.

More worryingly, in versions of the contracts obtained by CoinDesk, “there are incentives basically to manipulate the price to over $5 billion fully diluted value and then dump on retail for shared profit,” concluded Zaki Manian, a veteran crypto founder who reviewed the documents. “Even participating in a discussion where that's on paper is insane.”

Market makers, hired to provide liquidity for new tokens, stabilize prices by buying and selling on exchanges using money loaned to them by a token's issuer. But the role can also be abused, giving insiders a way to quietly manipulate markets and offload large token holdings without drawing attention.

A series of contracts obtained by CoinDesk offer a rare look into a murky corner of crypto, where weak oversight and opaque legal agreements can turn public projects into private windfalls.

While crypto market-making abuses are often rumored about, the details behind them almost never surface to the public.

The market-making contracts reviewed by CoinDesk show Rentech appeared in agreements on both sides of a deal with the Movement Foundation — once as an agent of the Movement Foundation and once as a Web3Port subsidiary — a setup that could theoretically allow the middleman to dictate terms and profit from its position in the middle.

Movement's deal with Rentech ultimately enabled wallets tied to Web3Port — a Chinese financial firm that claims to have worked with projects including MyShell, GoPlus Security, and the Donald Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial — to immediately liquidate $38 million in MOVE tokens the day after the token debuted on exchanges.

Binance, the crypto exchange, later banned the market-making account for “misconduct,” and Movement announced a token buyback plan.

Like stock options at startups, token allocations in crypto projects are typically subject to lock-up periods intended to prevent insiders from selling large stakes during a project's early trading.

The Binance ban created the impression — which Movement denied — that project insiders might have entered into an improper agreement with Web3Port to sell tokens ahead of schedule.

Movement, a new Layer 2 blockchain designed to scale Ethereum using Facebook's Move programming language, is one of the most talked-about crypto projects of recent years.

Founded by 22-year-old Vanderbilt University dropouts Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, the company raised $38 million from investors, nabbed a spot in the World Liberty Financial crypto portfolio, and has been the subject of intense social media attention.

Reuters reported in January that Movement Labs was close to wrapping a $100 million funding round that would have valued the company at $3 billion.

In interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with Movement's internal operations, most of whom requested anonymity to avoid reprisal, CoinDesk heard a range of conflicting allegations over who architected the Rentech arrangement, which industry experts called highly unusual.

Galen Law-Kun, the owner of Rentech, rejects the suggestion that the Foundation was deceived into signing a market-making agreement, asserting that the entity structure was crafted with full collaboration from the Movement Foundation's general counsel, YK Pek.

Pek disputes having any involvement in creating Rentech and was, at least at first, deeply critical of the deal internally, according to a memo and other communications reviewed by CoinDesk.

In his message to employees, Scanlon, the co-founder of Movement Labs, states that Movement is “a victim in this situation.”

According to four sources familiar with the investigation who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity, Movement is also examining the involvement of its co-founder Rushi Manche, who initially forwarded a deal with Rentech to the Movement team and promoted it internally, and Sam Thapaliya, an informal adviser to Movement and business partner to Law-Kun.

Web3Port did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Despite initially rejecting a risky market-making deal with Rentech, Movement ultimately signed a revised agreement with similar features, relying on assurances from a middleman without any identifiable track record.

In the lightly regulated cryptocurrency industry, projects typically split their operations between a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit development firm. The developer — Movement Labs, in this case — builds the technology, while the foundation stewards the token and manages community resources.

The two entities are supposed to operate independently: a structure designed to shield the token from securities regulations. In Movement's case, however, internal correspondence reviewed by CoinDesk suggests that Manche — an employee of the development firm, Movement Labs — also played an active role in the non-profit Movement Foundation.

On March 28, Manche sent a market-making contract to the Movement Foundation in a Telegram message — it needed a signature.

The draft agreement proposed loaning a massive 5% allocation of MOVE tokens to Rentech, a company with zero digital footprint.

Pek, the foundation's lawyer, flagged the document in an email as “[p]ossibly the worst agreement” he had ever seen. In a separate memo reviewed by CoinDesk, he warned that it would hand control of MOVE's market to a single unknown entity. Marc Piano, director of the foundation's British Virgin Islands entity, also refused to sign.

Among the contract's more unusual provisions was a clause allowing Rentech to liquidate its MOVE tokens if the cryptocurrency's fully diluted value exceeded $5 billion — a benchmark that, if reached, would have allowed Rentech to split profits 50-50 with the foundation.

According to Manian, this created a perverse incentive for the market maker to artificially increase the price of MOVE so that it could sell its massive supply of tokens for a profit.

Movement Foundation declined to sign the deal, but they continued discussions with Rentech.

According to three people familiar with the discussions and legal documents reviewed by CoinDesk, Rentech eventually told Movement Foundation it was operating as a subsidiary of Web3Port, the Chinese market-making firm. According to these sources, Rentech also offered to front $60 million of its own collateral, a detail that helped sweeten the arrangement for the foundation.

On December 8, the Movement Foundation agreed to a modified version of the market-making contract that removed some of the provisions most troubling to the foundation. Among the changes: the new deal eliminated a clause that would have allowed Web3Port to sue Movement Foundation for damages if the MOVE token failed to list on a specific crypto exchange.

The revised agreement, which was primarily crafted by Pek, who originally pushed back, still contained many of the same features as the original: It still allowed Web3Port to borrow 5% of MOVE's supply and sell tokens for a profit, albeit under a different disbursement structure.

The new contract listed Web3Port as the borrower, and a director of Rentech signed on its behalf.

DNS records show that the domain name attached to the Rentech director's email address, web3portrentech.io, was registered on the same day the contract was signed.

According to three people close to the situation, Movement Foundation officials did not realize that Web3Port had already entered into an agreement with “Movement” weeks before the December 8 deal was signed.

A contract dated November 25 and obtained by CoinDesk shows that Web3Port had signed a deal, apparently with Movement, that closely resembled the original proposal Movement Foundation had rejected. In this deal, Rentech was listed as a representative of Movement.

The deal was structured similarly to the Nov. 27 contract, explicitly allowing the market maker to liquidate tokens if MOVE's price hit certain targets — a key provision from the older agreement that stood out to experts like Manian.

Sources close to Movement have presented several theories around who ultimately architected the relationship with Rentech, which led to December's token-dumping incident and a wave of negative press attention for Movement.

The agreement was initially circulated internally by Manche, who was briefly placed on administrative leave last week, as Blockworks first reported.

“Throughout the market maker selection process, the MVMT Labs team trusted various advisers and members on the foundation team to provide input and help properly structure those deals,” Manche told CoinDesk. “Apparently, at least one member of the Foundation team represented interests on both sides of the market maker deal, which we are now in the process of investigating.”

Among those close to Movement, scrutiny over the deal has also spurred questions about whether Sam Thapaliya — the founder of crypto protocol Zebec and an adviser to Manche and Scanlon — may have played a behind-the-scenes role.

Thapaliya was CC'd alongside Rentech and Manche in an email from Web3Port to "Movement Team" and other communications regarding the market-making arrangement reviewed by CoinDesk.

“My understanding is that Sam is a close advisor to Rushi and perhaps sort of a shadow third co-founder,” said one employee. “Rushi kept the relationship pretty hidden; we often just heard his name.”

“A lot of times we'd decide on something, and at the last minute there would be this change,” said another. “In those cases, we knew it was probably coming from Sam.”

Thapaliya was present at Movement's San Francisco office on the day that the MOVE token launched to the public, according to three people who were present.

Telegram screenshots reviewed by CoinDesk also show that Scanlon commissioned Thapaliya to help curate MOVE's airdrop whitelist — the carefully controlled list of wallet addresses eligible to receive tokens in Movement's (long-delayed) community token giveaway. 

The arrangement reinforced a perception among some Movement employees that Thapaliya's influence within the company was more extensive than acknowledged.

Thapaliya, according to a statement he shared with CoinDesk, met Manche and Scanlon while they were college students and has served as an outside adviser to Movement over the years. Thapaliya told CoinDesk he has "no equity in Movement Labs," "no token from Movement Foundation" and "no decision-making power" within either organization.

Rentech, the entity at the center of the token dispute, was created by Galen Law-Kun, Thapaliya's business partner. Law-Kun told CoinDesk he established Rentech as a subsidiary of Autonomy, his Singapore-based financial services firm, to connect crypto projects with family offices in Asia.

In a statement to CoinDesk, Law-Kun said YK Pek “helped set up and was general counsel of Autonomy SG, which is the parent or affiliate company of Rentech.” He also claimed that Pek, despite pushing back against the initial Rentech deal internally, “advised to set up the Rentech structure for the launch” and “advised on the first version of the contract, which is almost identical to the contract he later drafted and approved for the foundation.”

CoinDesk's investigation has not uncovered any evidence confirming that Pek set up Rentech or authored the first version of the contract while acting on behalf of Autonomy.

“I am not and have never been Galen or any of his entities' general counsel,” stated Pek. “A corporate administration firm that I co-founded, and which provides corporate secretarial services to over 150 entities in the Web3 space has provided corporate secretarial services to two of his companies, both of which filed 'no assets' as part of their annual renewals in 2025. Neither of these companies are Rentech.”

Pek states that he once spent “two hours” reviewing an advisory agreement that Law-Kun had with a project in 2024. Additionally, "[h]e reached out to me regarding the FTX filing deadline," and in August, "he forwarded me an NDA Docusign which I cast my eye over without charging him."

“I have no idea why Galen would claim I am his general counsel and I am frankly confused and disturbed by that claim,” Pek continued. “He was represented in email correspondence with my corporate services partner by his personal lawyer from one 'Hillington Group'."

According to Pek, “[b]oth the general counsels of Movement Foundation (myself) and Movement Labs were introduced to GS Legal as counsel for Rentech by Rushi Manche.”

In Law-Kun's telling, Pek was "introduced to 10 projects as my Autonomy lawyer" and "never hesitated to say otherwise or correct the statement." According to Law-Kun, "The GS introduction was just done as a formality requested by Movement."

In his Slack message to employees, Scanlon said Movement had retained Groom Lake, an outside auditing firm, to “conduct the third-party review into recent market maker abnormalities.”

“Movement is a victim in this situation,” he wrote.

North Carolina House members are expected to vote Wednesday on whether the state can invest a portion of its public funds — for retirement, education, transportation, general spending, and more — in cryptocurrency.

The NC Digital Assets Investments Act, sponsored by 27 Republicans, would permit the state treasury department to place up to 5% of funds' assets in digital currencies like Bitcoin.

The bill applies to more than two dozen funds, including the state's $129 billion pension plan covering firefighters, teachers, police officers and state employees. It also calls for the North Carolina treasurer and the State Bureau of Investigation to study how seized digital assets could be used to establish a digital assets reserve. 

House leaders have adjusted key aspects of the legislation since a smaller group of Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, introduced it two months ago. 

Under the current bill, digital assets can comprise up to 5% of any fund — lowered from an original 10% cap, and a third-party consultant now must assess any crypto investments. The updated legislation also opens the door to more cryptocurrencies, erasing an initial market capitalization requirement (of $750 billion) that had essentially made only Bitcoin eligible. 

Wording around the state treasurer having exclusive knowledge of the “private key” that serves as a passcode to their virtual wallet has been replaced with a rule that virtual currencies be held in a “secure custody solution” platform. 

The state Senate has already backed public cryptocurrency investments. On April 19, the chamber passed a budget which allows for 5% of funds' assets to be digital. 

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has voiced support for a state cryptocurrency investing bill, telling The News & Observer in February that he favored “giving people more authority to do their jobs.”

“That doesn't mean that the treasurer must make those investments,” he said. “But if there are wise investments that can result in a positive, diversified return for the pension fund, then I'm comfortable with the treasurer making that investment.”

At least 40 states have introduced cryptocurrency bills this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, with Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Dakota among those weighing public investments. A pair of states, Wisconsin and Michigan, already allow crypto in their retirement portfolios. And on Tuesday, Arizona legislators advanced a bill to create the country's first state Bitcoin reserve. 

Momentum for Bitcoin investing at the state level has coincided with President Donald Trump's calls for a national digital asset reserve tethered to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Strategic reserves are a stockpile the nation stores for crisis moments, like the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

As of Tuesday evening, the world's top cryptocurrency sold at around $95,500. Bitcoin's price has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, propelled by a huge spike in November following Trump's election victory.

The North Carolina Blockchain Initiative worked with state lawmakers on its cryptocurrency investment legislation. In an X post in February, Hall said the bill aligns North Carolina “with President Trump's vision for a national Bitcoin stockpile” while keeping the state at the forefront of a financial innovation.

Critics of public Bitcoin investing say the 16-year-old currency has been volatile and lacks the oversight of traditional money. 

“When we're talking about the dollar amounts that are in the pension funds, we're talking about the people whose retirements are at risk here,” Rep. Brian Turner, an Asheville Democrat, told The News & Observer. “We should be, I would say, using more proven financial instruments to fund those funds.”

It isn't yet known who precisely will make North Carolina pension decisions — on digital or traditional assets.

Another bill changing how North Carolina handles state investments passed the House on Tuesday, moving the state closer to replacing its sole fiduciary model with a shared governance structure.

House Bill 506 would create the North Carolina Investment Authority, within the treasurer's department. It would be overseen by a five-member board of directors responsible for managing state investments.

Currently, the treasurer's department has an Investment Management Division with more than 20 professionals who oversee operating funds — such as highway dollars — and pension funds, including the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System and the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System. Despite the presence of that team, the state treasurer alone currently holds final authority over investment decisions.

Briner, during his campaign for state treasurer, championed this change. He has continued to do so, arguing that North Carolina is at the bottom for pension plan returns, in part because of its governance structure. 

The state's pension plan returns averaged 5.9% annually over the past decade, below the 7.5% national average, with states like Washington at about 11%, Briner said in mid-April during a committee hearing. For Briner, the state does not need to take as much risk as Washington but does need to take on more.

“I seek to relinquish some of my power to a board of qualified investment professionals to help deliver better returns for this state so that we can get to a better place, not just for our budget, but for our retirees,” he said. 

The bill passed that committee with no dissenting views raised, as it did on the House floor on Tuesday. The sole question on the floor came from Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Greensboro Democrat, who wanted to confirm that crypto language had been eliminated from the bill. A previous version of the bill included language allowing cryptocurrency investments, but that provision was removed.

Under the current bill, the board would include the state treasurer as an ex officio member, plus one appointee each from the House speaker, Senate president pro tempore, governor and state treasurer. Appointees must have investment expertise and would serve staggered six-year terms. 

The board would appoint a chief investment officer, who must have at least 15 years of experience managing pensions, endowments or similar funds. The CIO would be responsible for the day-to-day investing.

 TON ecosystem participant Broxus launches TON Factory, a high-throughput dev platform with a purported 35,000 transactions per second, aiming to scale DEXs, games and DApps. 

The Open Network (TON) ecosystem participant Broxus has unveiled TON Factory, a new platform designed to accelerate the development and scalability of high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and blockchain-based games.

In an April 30 post on Telegram, the project said TON Factory aims to help developers rapidly build and scale projects with modular components, integration tools, and hands-on expert support.

“For OGs already building on TON, TON Factory helps you scale further,” the announcement stated.

The initiative is backed by a team of over 150 engineers with experience delivering production-ready infrastructure in the TON ecosystem, per the announcement. 

“TON Factory will help developers focusing on L2/appchains with TVM tech and ensuring connectivity with TON,” a spokesperson told Cointelegraph. 

They said any TON DApp focusing on scaling its performance while maintaining the strong link with TON network can use the platform.

The underlying architecture leverages Broxus' Tycho protocol, which combines the TVM with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consensus mechanism.

This hybrid design is intended to achieve near-instant finality and high throughput, reportedly handling up to 35,000 transactions per second (TPS), a benchmark that could position TON Factory as a serious competitor to other layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions:

Broxus builds key tools and technology for blockchains that use the TON Virtual Machine, or TVM. 

It has created several important decentralized finance (DeFi) products like FlatQube (a decentralized exchange), Octus Bridge (a crosschain bridge) and Ever Wallet. 

In March 2025, the TON Foundation said several venture capital firms invested more than $400 million in the TON blockchain, signaling growing interest in the Telegram messaging ecosystem. 

Sequoia Capital, Ribbit, Benchmark, Draper Associates, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Libertus Capital, CoinFund, SkyBridge, Hypersphere and Karatage participated in the investment by purchasing Toncoin.

At the time of writing, Toncoin, the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), is trading at $3.22, down around 1% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

TON blockchain is a decentralized network that supports the development of Mini Apps for the Telegram ecosystem. Although TON was initially developed by Telegram's founders, it now operates as an independent chain.

Data-driven Dogecoin price forecasts from CoinCodex and Changelly show that the largest meme coin may struggle to break above the $0.3 resistance this year, posting a modest 55% return.

This mediocre price forecast has prompted DOGE traders to seek greener pastures in new altcoins like Remittix (RTX). This PayFi token is already up over 400% in presale, and crypto analysts posit it might top 2025 crypto gains with a 150x multiplier. Here's why.

Remittix is building a cutting-edge financial infrastructure that connects cryptocurrencies to everyday fiat payment networks across the world. This innovative approach makes it a breeze for the average consumer and businesses to undertake cross-border transactions with the speed benefits of crypto while enjoying the convenience of traditional payment apps.



Users will only need to link their crypto wallet to the Remittix dApp to send same-day crypto-to-fiat payments across borders in 50+ crypto pairs and over 30 fiat currencies at a flat fee. That eliminates the extra hidden costs levied by traditional channels, helping users retain more of their money during transfer.

While cross-border crypto pioneers like XRP and XLM focus on large financial giants, Remittix fills a critical gap in the market by bringing faster, cheaper, and seamless cross-border crypto payments to crypto holders and small business owners.

That's why top market pundits believe Remittix is well-positioned to take a significant slice of the $800 billion market as its addressable market grows due to rising crypto trends in the cross-border payments sector. Controlling even 3-5% of this market will be enough to push RTX into the XRP and XLM league, sparking a 150x moonshot for the altcoin.

After an extended bearish run that pushed the DOGE price to a vital buy zone in the $0.14 region, the meme coin has recently posted bullish price action. At current rates, Dogecoin is over 20% up from the dip, showing signs of growth as buying pressure and trader interest rise.

This has sparked rumors of a potential DOGE bullish reversal amid news of Z Squared and Coepti's merger to expand Dogecoin mining. Sadly, the DOGE has faced crippling resistances in the $0.18 zone, hampering its upward trajectory.

Some analysts, like $Kev_Capital_TA, have put forth insane Dogecoin price predictions of $1.5 or even $3.8. But this crazy target requires the DOGE market cap to exceed $200 billion, which is not an easy feat!

Data-driven Dogecoin price prediction from CoinCodex reveals that the meme coin will likely post sluggish price action in the $0.13-$0.27 zone for the rest of the year. That aligns with Changelly's analysis, which shows that the DOGE may struggle below $0.3 throughout the year.

This underwhelming Dogecoin price forecast has spurred an increasing number of meme coin traders to jump ship, piling into other new altcoins that promise better gains.

At the $0.0757 floor price, the RTX token is already up over 400% from its $0.015 entry price, blessing first movers with 3x gains as the Remittix ICO surpasses $14.6 million. Join DOGE traders and grab your RTX share before the price increases to $0.0781 in the next presale phase.

Discover the exciting opportunities of the Remittix (RTX) presale today!

 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says Ether needs “more than just a good week here and there.” 

Key takeaways

Approving staking for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may have a minimal impact on inflows unless Ether sees a sustained rally, says Eric Balchunas

ETH dropped significantly in price after the launch of the ETFs last year, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw new all-time highs just two months after launching.

Balchunas said that for inflows to increase again, ETH would need a multimonth run and a strong narrative.

Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token's price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Balchunas said on an April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast that staking being approved for Ether (ETH) ETFs would have “a little” impact on inflows, adding “it's only going to help — it can't hurt.”

However, Balchunas noted that one of the main reasons for the weak inflows into Ether ETFs since their July launch in the US is that ETH has yet to sustain a prolonged rally.

He added that when Ether's price surged during a run in December, there was a direct correlation with an increase in inflows. 

Donald Trump's election win in November sparked a crypto market rally which saw ETH surge 71% to reach $4,107 on Dec. 16. 

From Nov. 22, spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day positive inflow streak, amassing approximately $2.44 billion in inflows, according to Farside data.

However, since tapping the $4,107 price level, Ether entered a downtrend and has since fallen 56% to trade around $1,809 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Balchunas said that for inflows to pick up again, Ether would need a “multimonth run” paired with a “strong narrative.”

“It needs something that is more than just a good week here and there,” he added.

Balchunas noted that after the Ether ETFs launched, the price “went down quickly,” making any recovery difficult, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high just two months after they launched in January 2024.

“When you launch an ETF, and you have that sort of performance out of the gate, it's tough,” he said.

US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that “it's possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.”

“Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May and late August,” he added.

Scroll said Monday it has become the first Ethereum Layer 2 using zero-knowledge proofs to reach a critical development stage, allowing users to post transactions without relying on a central operator.

In a post to X, Scroll touted its advances in security, scalability, and decentralization after claiming the project had reached “Stage 1” in its development.

“While Scroll has always had a fully functional zk proof system, users previously had to trust the centralized sequencer to avoid censorship or downtime,” it said. “That's no longer the case.”

Scroll used to require users to trust a central system to process their transactions without blocking or delays—now, even if that system fails or censors, transactions can still go through, according to the project.

Scroll's Euclid upgrade, which users voted to approve earlier this month, keeps the system running even if the primary operator stops or tries to block user actions.

Rollups typically start at Stage 0 with full team control, move to Stage 1 where smart contracts take over but a safety council can step in, and reach Stage 2 when the system runs entirely on code with no central authority.

If the operator blocks a user or shuts down, the transaction can still be included and sent to Ethereum. This fixes a big problem for tools like Scroll.

They need to create proofs for each group of actions, but these proofs could only be so big. If a user sends a sizable action, it could end up disrupting the whole system.

Working with Axiom—a project that helps smart contracts verify past blockchain data—Scroll built a new tool called OpenVM, which breaks down large actions into smaller, provable pieces.

Instead of being at risk of failing, larger proofs could "just take longer to prove," Scroll explained in its post.

To keep users safe, all system changes must be voted on and then wait three days before they apply. This gives users time to exit if they don't like the changes.

The Euclid update establishes a 12-person safety team called the Security Council, which mandates strict rules.

At least nine members must agree to do anything, and at least seven of them must not work for Scroll. Only two council members from Scroll are permitted to sit on the council.

Despite the improvements, Scroll has had its fair share of problems. Launched in 2023, it went to market later than competitors like zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM.

Still, Scroll says it's now "looking forward" to Stage 2, which would limit what any one group can do in an emergency, even the Security Council.

Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around $95,000 at the time of writing on Wednesday, and a breakout suggests gains toward $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) followed BTC's footsteps and hovered around their key levels. The technical outlook suggests a breakout of these coins above the key resistance level could pave the way for a bullish run, targeting $100,000 BTC, $2,000 ETH, and $3 XRP.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and hovered around this level in the last four days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to stabilize around the $95,000 level.

If BTC breaks and closes above $95,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. A successful close above this level could extend additional gains to retest its psychological resistance at $100,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart holds at 66, suggesting bullish momentum, and still has room for further gains before hitting overbought conditions.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological importance level.

Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on April 22 and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. However, ETH retested the daily resistance level at $1,861 the next day and declined slightly. ETH has been consolidating around $1,740 for the past two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it continues to hover around $1,800.

If ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 55 above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

XRP price broke above the 50-day EMA level at $2.20 on Sunday and rallied by 4.77%, surpassing the daily resistance level at $2.23. However, it declined slightly on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it is retesting its support level at $2.20.

If the support level at $2.20 holds, XRP will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 55 above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum.



XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around the $2.20 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price is extending its consolidation streak, trading around $95,000 on Wednesday, as traders await a decisive breakout. MicroStrategy's Q1 earnings release and the approaching deadline for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve have the potential to move BTC price.

Chainlink's supply outside exchanges has surged to 803.38 million from 778.87 million in under two months. LINK network activity declines, with new and active addresses falling from a recent peak.

Ripple (XRP) price hovers at $2.24 at the time of writing on Wednesday as bulls try to prevent the pullback from its April peak of $2.36 from extending further. If XRP holds above the immediate support at $2.21, a reversal could soon ensue.

THORChain announced on Tuesday that its stagenet development of its Ripple (XRP) integration is nearing the final step, with mainnet activation imminent. This integration enhances THORChain's economic model by increasing swap activity and protocol fees. 

Bitcoin price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week. This week's rally was supported by strong institutional demand, as US spot ETFs recorded a total inflow of $2.68 billion until Thursday.

 Richard Byworth says that a firm like Strategy isn't concerned with how high Bitcoin's price goes; its focus is solely on the multiple of its net asset value. 

Key takeaways:

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor's Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy's mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor's Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.

“Saylor's strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

However, Byworth pondered what happens when Bitcoin (BTC) reaches an “illiquid supply” point where no Bitcoin is left on crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks.

“Should Saylor buy Bitcoin really carelessly? As in, not try and buy it through OTC desks…and actually just buy it with the intention of massively ramping the price,” Byworth said.

Strategy currently holds 553,555 BTC, valued at approximately $52.48 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. 

Fidelity Digital Assets said on April 24 that it has seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to purchases by public companies, which it anticipated would accelerate “in the near future.” 

Byworth said a firm like Strategy wouldn't be concerned with the price of Bitcoin when buying it as its primary focus would be on its mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value), the value of the assets held, as “it is much more beneficial to [its] shareholders.”

He added that when there is no more Bitcoin, “you may as well go aggressive buying, because what happens is it will just ramp the price, it will massively increase [Strategy's] MNAV, which means [its] dilution will become much more accretive.”

Movements in the NAV premium and discount can give signals about market sentiment or potential future price movements.

Byworth said that Japan has a “large number of zombie companies” holding significant cash reserves. He proposed that Strategy could adopt an aggressive approach by acquiring these companies and “immediately converting that cash into Bitcoin,” similar to the strategy taken by Japanese investment firm Metaplanet.

“There are plenty of companies out there in Japan like that, sitting on these cash flow generative businesses that are pretty boring and have very low price-to-cash ratios,” Byworth added.

On April 21, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than $400 million after its latest $28 million purchase.

Byworth's comments come as Bitcoin trades below the psychological $100,000 price level, a threshold it fell below in early February, which has widely been attributed to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

Bitcoin is trading at $94,680, down 13.22% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A closely followed analyst believes that the crypto markets are primed for a corrective move following strong rallies over the past couple of weeks.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks “a dip is going to come soon,” but he doesn't see any reason to be super bearish once the correction takes place.

According to the analyst, a correction should provide an opportunity for investors to enter the crypto market before another leg up.

Should a marketwide pullback materialize, Altcoin Sherpa says he plans to accumulate five altcoins.

“Coins I want to buy:

BONK ($0.00001600s)
Fartcoin ($0.85)
POPCAT ($0.33)
HYPE ($15-$16s)
GUN ($0.055s)

Loads of others too, but those are on my short list for now.” 

Looking closer at the memecoin Fartcoin, the trader notes that FART needs to stay above $1.05 to witness new rallies. Otherwise, he thinks the altcoin could fall to as low as $0.8.

“Fartcoin: wouldn't be surprised to see this pullback a little bit here, but don't forget that hot air rises in the end.

Three different scenarios, all mostly dependent on BTC, frankly. I think this just continues up.” 

Based on the trader's chart, he seems to suggest that FART can rally to as high as $1.40. At time of writing, FART is worth $1.09.

Turning to fellow memecoin Bonk (BONK), Altcoin Sherpa thinks that the altcoin looks really strong.

“The chart itself still looks fire.” 

At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.00002, up over 10% on the day.

Metrics details

Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains are central components of pattern recognition immune proteins across all domains of life1,2. In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties2,3,4,5. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties.

Metrics details

The ability to evaluate valence of a social agent based on social experience is essential for an animal's survival in its social group1. Although hippocampal circuits have been implicated in distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics2,3,4,5,6,7, it remains unclear how social valence is constructed on the basis of social history and what mechanisms underlie the heightened valence versatility in dynamic relationships. Here we demonstrate that the ventral (v)CA1 integrates serotonin (5-HT) inputs from the dorsal raphe and neurotensin inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to determine positive or negative valence of conspecific representations. Specifically, during an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released into the vCA1 and disinhibits pyramidal neurons through 5-HT1B receptors, whereas neurotensin is released during an aversive social interaction and potentiates vCA1 neurons directly through NTR1s. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin inputs into the vCA1 impairs positive and negative social valence, respectively, and excitation flexibly switches valence assignment. These results show how aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, and represent a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation.

Many mammals live in social groups and navigating a social environment requires the ability to flexibly update valence of a social agent, unlike the predetermined valence towards predator odour, foot shock or food reward1,8,9,10. Owing to the dynamic nature of social relationships, the temporal scales and plasticity may differ from learned valence of inanimate objects and contexts11,12,13,14. Indeed, it is poorly understood how social history influences social valence and how valence information can be flexibly updated. In a changing environment, how does the brain integrate different and even conflicting information to calculate new behavioural decisions? We reasoned that distinct neuromodulatory inputs from converging circuit motifs may represent a potential neural plasticity mechanism, which would allow flexible behavioural switch based on social history. To interrogate this hypothesis, we established new behavioural models to determine the causal relationship between neuromodulator release and social valence.

Unlike innate valence, assessment of social valence has been challenging in rodents, as it is difficult to dissociate conditioning to a non-social stimulus (for example, foot shock pairing) from valence of the social interaction itself15,16. To address how social valence is regulated we developed new social cognitive models, which enabled us to assess valence association with a conspecific. We presented strong stimuli consisting of a potential mate or an aggressor before a three-chamber social memory assay to elicit rewarding and aversive social experiences (Fig. 1a,b). First, we evaluated whether C57BL/6J test mice show memory of aggressor identity using a standard social memory assay without valenced interactions, as subjects only encounter the aggressive mice under a cup. Indeed, C57BL/6J subjects can distinguish novel and familiar aggressive mice, as evidenced by their preference for the chamber containing the novel mouse (Extended Data Fig. 1a). It is important to dissociate innate valence, such as natural response to predators, from social valence, which can be flexibly assigned based on social history1. Thus, we examined whether subjects showed any avoidance behaviour towards aggressive mice under a cup and found that without previous direct interaction, test mice showed no preference (Extended Data Fig. 1b). To assess negative social valence assignment, the subject mouse sequentially interacts with a same-sex aggressor or a non-aggressor (male CD-1 or female CFW) for 5 min separated by 5-min intervals (Fig. 1a). Similar to the resident–intruder test17,18, the interaction with the aggressor is in its home cage whereas the interaction with the non-aggressor is in a new cage. After a 5-min interval, mice were tested for social valence assignment to the aggressor in a three-chamber box, where both aggressor and non-aggressor were confined under a cup. With previous direct aggressor and non-aggressor interaction, both male and female subjects preferred the chamber with the non-aggressor in the subsequent social valence test (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1c), thereby demonstrating negative social valence association with the conspecific based on the previously aversive interaction.

To test positive social valence association, C57BL/6J subjects undergo sequential 5-min direct interactions with a potential mate and a ‘neutral' partner followed by a 5-min three-chamber test, each separated by 5-min intervals (Fig. 1b). The neutral interaction is less appetitive, but not completely neutral. Male subjects interacted with an age-matched female conspecific in the female partner's home cage while the experimenter held the partner three times for 3 s to simulate the mating posture19 and allowed the male to sniff the rear of the female. Without previous direct interaction, male subjects do not show any preference for females in proestrus or oestrus cycles over other cycles in the three-chamber assay (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Since female subjects may not experience the same level of reward during a male partner interaction, we constructed a barrier small enough that the female could escape to another compartment and thus control the timing of the interaction, which has been reported to be rewarding20,21. The neutral (less positive) experiences are without mating posture or barrier in a new cage. After a direct neutral and potential mate interaction, the male and female subjects spent more time in the chamber with the potential mate in the subsequent social valence test (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1e), thereby demonstrating positive social valence association with the conspecific based on the previously appetitive interaction.

The dorsal (d)CA2 and vCA1 are critical for distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics2,3,4,5,6,22, but it remains unclear whether they participate in valence association of social representations. To investigate the role of the dCA2 and vCA1 in social valence, we expressed an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM4Di fused to mCherry (mCh) in the dCA2 of Amigo2-Cre mice, a dCA2-specific Cre-driver line2, or vCA1 of C57BL/6J mice and administered the DREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or saline before three different social memory and valence tests. In the social memory test2,3,7, subjects encounter a novel and a familiar age-matched same-sex conspecific, which are relatively neutral interactions. After saline administration as a within animal control, subjects with hM4Di expression in the dCA2 (Fig. 1c) and vCA1 (Fig. 1d) showed normal social memory as well as negative and positive social valence assignment, as they spent more time in the chamber with the novel mouse, the non-aggressor and the potential mate, respectively. However, the same cohorts of hM4Di-expressing mice receiving CNO showed impaired social memory and valence (Fig. 1c,d). The discrimination scores3,7, which allowed us to directly compare saline and CNO conditions, confirmed the disruption of both social memory and valence in mice in which dCA2 and vCA1 neuronal activity was inhibited (Fig. 1c,d). As an extra control, we expressed mCh alone in the dCA2 and the vCA1, which did not affect social memory nor valence after saline or CNO administration (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Baseline sociability, assessed by the initial phase of the neutral social memory test, was not affected by hM4Di-mediated silencing of the dCA2 and vCA1, nor by expression of mCh in the control cohort (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). To test whether the positive social valence test is primarily driven by reproductive related behaviours, we assessed the time subjects spent in the chamber with a male or female mouse under a cup. Like saline administration, CNO administration in the hM4Di vCA1 cohort did not decrease the preference of subjects for the chamber with females over males (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Further, the number of times female subjects escaped through the barrier from male partners did not significantly differ after hM4Di-mediated vCA1 inhibition, suggesting that the positive social valence test does not affect innate sexual behaviours (Extended Data Fig. 2f).

Although our results show that information encoded in the dCA2 and vCA1 is important for both positive and negative social valence association, it is possible that an impairment of conspecific identity memory also affects valence evaluation. To determine whether the dCA2 and vCA1 are indeed involved in social valence encoding, independent assessment of valence and identity is necessary. We postulated that different hippocampal inputs may send information mediating positive and negative association and thus be dissociable when manipulated separately. To identify regions that form monosynaptic connections with the dCA2 and vCA1, we used monosynaptic rabies tracing, which yielded labelled cells in the medial septum, the nucleus of the diagonal band, the anterodorsal, anteroventral thalamus, the supramammillary nucleus and the median raphe for both starter regions (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Direct connection to the vCA1 was only found in the nucleus of the reuniens, the anterior region of the paraventricular thalamic nuclei paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT) and dorsal raphe (DR) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To uncover dCA2 and vCA1-projecting regions, involved in valence induction, we exposed TRAP2;Ai14 mice to a neutral social partner, a potential mate and an aggressor, and quantified the number of tdTomato-positive cells in the dCA2, vCA1 and all extra-hippocampal input regions (Fig. 1e). Increased numbers of tdTomato-positive cells were detected in the aPVT, reuniens and median raphe only after an aversive interaction and in the DR only after a rewarding interaction (Fig. 1f).

To address whether distinct inputs can confer opposing social valence, we used a viral intersectional chemogenetic approach to achieve projection-specific manipulations. As the DR primarily projects to the ventral hippocampus23 (Extended Data Fig. 3), we injected canine adenovirus type 2 expressing Cre (CAV2-Cre) into the vCA1 and Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCh into the DR (Fig. 2a). In two control cohorts, mice expressing hM4Di with saline administration or expressing mCh with saline or CNO administration showed normal social memory (Fig. 2b) as well as negative (Fig. 2c) and positive social valence (Fig. 2d). On the contrary, hM4Di mice that received CNO showed impaired positive social valence, while social memory and negative social valence were unperturbed (Fig. 2b–d). Consistent with manipulations of the vCA1, hM4Di-mediated silencing of vCA1-projecting DR neurons did not alter baseline sociability (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Because the vCA1 is implicated in non-social valence association24,25,26,27,28, which could influence social valence, we tested whether inhibiting the DR to vCA1 projection induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or aversion. hM4Di-mediated silencing of the vCA1-projecting DR cells had no effect on non-social reward and aversion as test mice spent an equal amount of time on the surfaces paired with CNO or saline (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Neither sociability nor CPP were significantly affected by CNO administration in the mCh control cohort (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b).

To identify inputs mediating negative social valence, we used the same viral intersectional strategy to chemogenetically manipulate projections of the median raphe to the dCA2, reuniens to the vCA1 and aPVT to the vCA1 based on connectivity found in our tracing experiment. Inhibition of the median raphe to dCA2 projection impaired social memory but not sociability (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d), whereas inactivation of the reuniens to vCA1 projection had no effect on social memory, social valence nor sociability (Extended Data Fig. 4e–h). hM4Di-mediated silencing of the aPVT to vCA1 projection (Fig. 2e) specifically ablated negative social valence without affecting social memory and positive social valence (Fig. 2f–h). Saline administration in the same hM4Di cohort or CNO administration in the mCh control cohort did not influence social memory nor valence (Fig. 2f–h). No manipulations of vCA1-projecting aPVT neurons in hM4Di or mCh-expressing cohorts affected baseline sociability and CPP (Extended Data Fig. 4i,j). Similarly to previously reported studies29,30, bath application of CNO significantly reduced the excitability of hM4Di-expressing DR and PVT cells compared to non-expressing control cells (Extended Data Fig. 4k,l). Together, these results indicate that positive and negative social valence information converge in the vCA1 through DR and PVT inputs.

We questioned how vCA1 neurons dissociate opposing valence information. To explore the possibility that distinct neuromodulators facilitate memory valence encoding in the same brain region, we assessed differential neuromodulatory signals from the DR and PVT. As the DR and PVT are major release sites for 5-HT (refs. 23,31) and neurotensin (NT)9,32, respectively, we tested whether DR 5-HT and aPVT NT neurons send projections to the vCA1. Consistent with previous reports9,23,33, expressing Cre-dependent GFP in the DR of Sert-Cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and Cre-dependent mCh in the aPVT of NT-Cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 5b) revealed 5-HT and NT axon innervation in the vCA1. To assess the involvement of DR 5-HT neurons in positive social valence induction, we expressed Cre-dependent NpHR3.0eYFP or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) alone in the DR and implanted optical fibres adjacent to the vCA1 (Fig. 3a). Optogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT inputs in the vCA1 did not alter social memory (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and negative social valence (Fig. 3b) but only blocked positive social valence assignment (Fig. 3c). The same manipulation did not affect baseline sociability (Extended Data Fig. 5d) nor induce real-time place preference (RTPP) (Extended Data Fig. 5e), suggesting no change in innate reward and aversion. Moreover, the NpHR3.0 cohort without light stimulation (light off) or the eYFP cohort with or without light stimulation (light on or off) showed no significant changes in social memory, social valence, sociability and RTPP (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5c–e).

To address whether PVT NT neurons exert opposing effects, we injected AAVs expressing Cre-dependent NpHR3.0 in the aPVT and implanted optic fibre cannulas above the vCA1 to silence PVT NT inputs in the vCA1 (Fig. 3d). Optogenetic inhibition during initial interaction and three-chamber testing specifically impaired negative social valence association (Fig. 3e) without affecting social memory (Extended Data Fig. 5f) and positive social valence (Fig. 3f). Again, light-off conditions in the NpHR3.0 cohort or light on and off conditions in the eYFP cohort did not alter social memory and valence (Fig. 3e,f). Baseline sociability and RTPP were not significantly affected by those manipulations (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). To evaluate NpHR3.0-mediated silencing, we expressed Cre-dependent NpHR3.0eYFP and RCaMP2, a calcium indicator, in the DR or PVT of the respective Cre-driver lines and implanted optogenetics fibre cannulas above the injection sites as well as fibre photometry cannulas above the vCA1. Light stimulation of NpHR3.0 strongly diminished terminal activity during social interactions in both cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 5i).

Our results predict enhanced 5-HT release into the vCA1 during an appetitive social interaction and increased NT release during an aversive one. Therefore, we expressed GRAB5HT3.5 or GRABNT1.0 (ref. 9) in the ventral hippocampus and placed fibre implants adjacent to the vCA1 to record 5-HT or NT activity while the subject was exposed to sequential interactions with a same-sex age-matched conspecific, a potential mate and an aggressor (Fig. 3g). Robustly elevated 5-HT activity was detected only during the appetitive interaction, whereas interactions with the neutral and aversive partners produced smaller increases in 5-HT activity (Fig. 3h). By contrast, NT signals showed a marked increase only during an aversive interaction, with neutral and rewarding social encounters only generating moderate NT activity (Fig. 3i). When we expressed a membrane-bound enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a control, we did not detect any significant changes in fluorescence between different social encounters (Extended Data Fig. 5j).

Because DR 5-HT neurons also corelease glutamate into the vCA1 (ref. 23), we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) combined with a viral intersectional strategy to specifically knockdown the 5-HT producing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (encoded by Tph2) in vCA1-projecting DR neurons. Initially, we validated knockdown efficiency by expressing AAVs carrying three single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tph2 (AAV-sgTph2) or non-targeting control sgRNAs (AAV-sgNTC) along with AAV-Cre in the DR of dCas9-KRAB mice, where dCas9 expression can be turned on by Cre recombination. Immunostaining for TPH2 in the DR revealed a roughly 75% reduction in fluorescence intensity in sgTph2-expressing mice compared to non-targeting controls (Extended Data Fig. 5k). To further quantitatively assess knockdown efficiency, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on DR primary cultured neurons infected with AAV-Cre and AAV-sgTph2 or AAV-sgNTC, which revealed a 98% reduction in Tph2 messenger RNA (mRNA) level after knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 5l). We then injected AAV-sgTph2 into the DR and CAV2-Cre into the vCA1 of dCas9-KRAB mice (Fig. 3j). As a control, we expressed sgNTC in the DR and CAV2-Cre in the vCA1 in a separate cohort of mice. Knockdown of Tph2 in vCA1-projecting DR neurons only ablated positive social valence but not negative social valence, social memory and sociability (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5m). No changes in those behaviours were detected in control mice expressing non-targeting control sgRNA (Fig. 3k and Extended Data Fig. 5m). To further confirm knockdown, we assayed TPH2 expression in DR terminals in the vCA1 of the behavioural cohort and found a roughly 80% reduction in TPH2-positive terminals in sgTph2 mice compared to non-targeting controls (Fig. 3l).

Our data indicate that 5-HT and NT promote opposing social valence. Since DR 5-HT and PVT NT neurons can corelease other neuromodulators9,23, we assessed whether perturbing 5-HT and NT action is sufficient to block social valence evaluation by directly inhibiting 5-HT and NT receptors in the vCA1. To uncover receptor subtypes involved, we locally infused receptor (R) antagonists (A) into the vCA1 20 min before social memory tests (Fig. 4a). NTR1-A (SR48692) but not NTR2-A (NTRC 824) micro-infusion blocked negative social valence (Fig. 4b). Although the NTR1-A (SR48692) did not influence positive social valence, a promiscuous 5-HTR-A (methiothepin) impaired it (Fig. 4c). Next, we targeted the 5-HT1BR, as it is known to be involved in sociability and social memory when released into the nucleus accumbens31 and medial septum7, respectively. Indeed, local infusion of the 5-HT1BR-A (NAS-181) blocked positive (Fig. 4c) but not negative social valence (Fig. 4b). To examine the specificity of this receptor, we also infused an antagonist against 5-HT1AR (NAD299). The results show a P value of 0.07, suggesting that 5-HT1AR is most probably not involved in positive social valence regulation (Fig. 4c). Neither NTR1-A nor 5-HT1BR-A infused into the vCA1 had detectable effects on social memory (Fig. 4d). When comparing discrimination scores, NTR1 antagonist micro-infusion into the vCA1 seem to specifically impair negative social valence, whereas 5-HT1BR antagonist infusion specifically blocked positive social valence (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Source data

Our data indicate that NTR1-A and 5-HT1BR-A can regulate vCA1 neuronal activity during differently valenced social interactions. To evaluate this hypothesis, we expressed a calcium indicator GCaMP6f in the vCA1 and recorded vCA1 neuronal activity during sequential novel object, neutral, negatively and positively valenced social interactions. Like previous studies3,34, we observed a robust increase of vCA1 activity, during all types of social interaction compared to object interaction (Fig. 4e). Administration of NTR1-A specifically decreased the activity during an aversive social interaction (Fig. 4f), whereas 5-HT1BR-A administration only attenuated the activity during a rewarding one (Fig. 4g). To assess the effect of NTR1-A on PVT inputs, we expressed channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in the aPVT of C57BL/6J mice and performed ex vivo optogenetic recordings in the vCA1. Light stimulation evoked action potentials in half of vCA1 cells and bath application of the NTR1-A (SR48692) significantly reduced responses (Fig. 4h). To evaluate DR inputs, we used the same approach and expressed ChR2 in the DR. Light stimulation induced responses in more than 90% of vCA1 cells and 5-HT1BR-A (NAS-181) application strongly diminished responses (Fig. 4i).

To interrogate how 5-HT and NT release may cause an increase in vCA1 activity during different social encounters, we performed ex vivo whole-cell recordings to assess the excitability of vCA1 cells in response to NTR1 (0.5 µM PD149163) and 5-HT1BR (5 µM CP93129) agonists. Bath application of both NTR1 (PD) and 5-HT1BR (CP) agonists increased vCA1 neuronal spiking in response to depolarizing current pulses (Fig. 4j). To address if both receptors work through the same or different synaptic mechanisms, we further assessed evoked and spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Because 5-HT1BRs are commonly presynaptic and inhibit neurotransmitter release35 but NTR1s have been reported to be postsynaptic and excitatory36,37, we predicted differential synaptic mechanisms. Consistent with our hypothesis, bath application of the specific NTR1 agonist, PD149163, increased evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and had minimal impact on evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (Fig. 4k). Further, a higher percentage of cells showed a change in evoked EPSC compared to IPSC amplitude in response to PD149163 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Likewise, bath application of the 5-HT1BR agonist, CP93129, decreased evoked IPSCs but had no significant effects on evoked EPSCs (Fig. 4l), which suggests that the increase in excitability is due to depression of inhibitory inputs onto the vCA1 pyramidal neurons. Consistently, a greater proportion of cells showed a change in IPSC compared to EPSC amplitude in response to CP93129 (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To assess pre- versus postsynaptic mechanisms, we measured spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs). Bath application of PD149163 increased sEPSC amplitude, but not frequency (Extended Data Fig. 6d) and had minimal effects on sIPSC amplitude and inter-event interval (Extended Data Fig. 6e). By contrast, CP93129 increased sIPSC frequency, but not amplitude (Extended Data Fig. 6f), and did not influence sEPSC amplitude and frequency (Extended Data Fig. 6g). The results show that NT increases excitability by directly exciting vCA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas 5-HT acts through disinhibition by decreasing the inhibitory input onto them. To assess whether inhibitory neurons in the vCA1 express 5-HT1BRs, we performed in situ hybridization with probes targeting the γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing (GABAergic) neuron marker, Gad2 and 5-HT1BR (Htr1b). Quantification of Gad2+ cells revealed that 44% express Htr1b (Extended Data Fig. 6h).

Next, we tested whether positive and negative social valence flexibly mapped onto the same, overlapping or distinct populations of cells. Therefore, we tagged cells activated by a negative or positive social experience with tdTomato and used cFos immunostaining to label re-activated cells in the same or different social context (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Quantification of tdTomato-positive cells stained with cFos antibody revealed a 64–77% overlap when animals were exposed to the same social context, whereas the overlap decreased by roughly 40% when the second context had the opposite social valence (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We reasoned that these distinct cell populations encoding opposing social valence could be due to regionally separated innervation of differential neuromodulator inputs and/or heterogeneity in receptor expression. Hence, we examined DR and PVT innervation of the vCA1 by expressing GFP in the aPVT and mCh in the DR of the same brains and found overlapping but not identical areas of innervation (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Then, we evaluated receptor composition of cells encoding positive or negative social valence by using in situ hybridization with probes targeting NTR1 (Ntsr1) and 5-HT1BR (Htr1b) in TRAP2;Ai14 vCA1 cells that were labelled by tdTomato after a rewarding or aversive social experience (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Quantification of tdTomato cells positive for Ntsr1, revealed that roughly 80% of cells participating in negative social valence express Ntsr1, whereas only roughly 45% of cells participating in positive social valence showed expression (Extended Data Fig. 7e). There is also a trend towards a decrease, from roughly 40 to 30%, in the proportion Htr1b-expressing cells active during an aversive compared to an appetitive social interaction (Extended Data Fig. 7e). The data suggest that separate populations of vCA1 pyramidal neurons may be preferentially potentiated for distinct valence associations.

Having established that social valence is encoded in cells that are potentiated by 5-HT and NT, we proposed that endogenous release of those neuromodulators can attribute valence to the memory of a conspecific. To determine whether we could invert the polarity of social valence, we expressed Cre-dependent ChR2-mCh in DR 5-HT neurons of Sert-Cre mice. Stimulation of DR 5-HT inputs in the vCA1 during the aggressor interaction disrupted the preference for the non-aggressor in the subsequent valence test, which was normal without light stimulation (Fig. 5a, left). Because NT is still released during the aversive social interaction, it is possible that release of both 5-HT and NT signals contradictory valence and causes the ‘impairment' phenotype. Blocking NT signalling might shift the balance in favour of positive social valence. Consistent with this prediction, simultaneous NTR1-A (SR48692) administration and 5-HT release during an aversive social interaction completely switched social valence, whereas administration of NTR1-A without light stimulation inhibited positive social valence (Fig. 5a, right). 5-HT release during the entire duration of the sociability and social memory tests caused no behavioural effects (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Likewise, this manipulation did not significantly influence RTPP (Extended Data Fig. 8c), nor male and female sexual behaviours (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e).

To test bi-directionality, we expressed Cre-dependent ChR2-mCh in the aPVT of NT-Cre mice and placed optical fibres adjacent to the vCA1. When the light was off, saline administered mice showed normal positive social valence, whereas activation of NT inputs in the vCA1 during the appetitive social interaction impaired it (Fig. 5b, left). Further, 5-HT1BR-A administration with simultaneous NT release during the rewarding social interaction inversed social valence, whereas 5-HT1BR-A administration alone in the light-off condition merely disrupted positive social valence (Fig. 5b, right). Sociability, social memory, RTPP nor anxiety were influenced by NT release into the vCA1 (Extended Data Fig. 8f–i). By manipulating 5-HT and NT release in combination with receptor antagonists, we were able to invert the polarity of social valence with the same social partner during repeated exposure. Moreover, these results also indicate that 5-HT and NT induce opposite valence signals that are integrated for social valence calculation as presence of both ablated positive and negative social valence assignment.

Next, we asked whether valence can be conferred to a neutral social stimulus by manipulating 5-HT and NT signalling. To test this, we allowed subjects to interact with two novel mice under a cup in separate chambers, where light stimulation was paired with one chamber only and memory was tested without stimulation after a 5-min interval (Fig. 5c, left). To assess the valence associated to the conspecific and not the chamber, we swapped the location of the light-paired mouse in half of the trials. When the light was off in session 1, Sert-Cre mice did not show a preference for either of the familiar mice under a cup in session 2 (Fig. 5d, left). However, activation of 5-HT inputs in the vCA1 during the initial interaction generated preference for the previously light-paired mouse in the following memory test (Fig. 5d, right). To address whether novelty, regardless of social interaction, drives the behaviour, we used the same experimental set-up replacing novel mice with novel objects (Fig. 5c, right). Light pairing with an object did not evoke preference in the subsequent memory test (Fig. 5e). To examine whether NT release can also convey negative social valence to an otherwise more neutral stimulus, we manipulated NT release in the same experimental set-up (Fig. 5c). Activation of NT inputs in the vCA1 caused avoidance of the previously light-paired mouse (Fig. 5f), but not object in the second session (Fig. 5g).

Given social cognitive capabilities are commonly impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)38, we asked whether our findings can be leveraged to specifically rescue positive social valence in heterozygous Shank3Δ4-22+/− mice. Because sociability is not impaired in Shank3Δ4-22−/− mice39, but Shank3 mutations disrupt social memory40,41, we surmised that Shank3Δ4-22+/− mice would show a similar deficit. Consistent with previous reports39, Shank3Δ4-22+/− and wild-type littermates showed normal sociability after saline micro-infusion into the vCA1, which was not altered by infusion of 5-HT1BR agonist, CP93129 (Extended Data Fig. 8j,k). By contrast, social memory was impaired in Shank3Δ4-22+/− mice compared to wild-type littermates and CP93129 infusion did not rescue the deficits (Extended Data Fig. 8l). To activate 5-HT1BRs during an appetitive but not neutral social interaction, we exposed the mice to the neutral social interaction immediately after CP93129 infusion, before the drug had time to diffuse. After a 15-min incubation, we exposed the subjects to an appetitive social interaction and then tested for social valence (Fig. 5h). Notably, 5-HT1BR agonist infusion rescued positive social valence in Shank3Δ4-22+/− mice to a level comparable to wild-type mice (Fig. 5i). To assess whether the 5-HT1BR agonist acts through increasing excitability of vCA1 cells, we performed current-clamp recordings in the vCA1 of Shank3Δ4-22+/− and wild-type littermates. Indeed, spike numbers were lower in Shank3Δ4-22+/− mice compared to wild-type littermates, but bath application of the 5-HT1BR agonist rescued the decrease in excitability in the mutant mice (Fig. 5j).

Our results demonstrate that two neuromodulatory inputs, DR 5-HT and PVT NT, converge in a single brain region, the vCA1, to balance social valence by means of distinct mechanisms. 5-HT signals in the vCA1 were specifically elevated during a rewarding social interaction, whereas NT activity increased only during an aversive one. Our findings suggest that whereas 5-HT potentiates vCA1 pyramidal neurons by reducing the inhibitory inputs through presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, NT increases excitability by directedly activating NTR1 on the pyramidal neurons. Moreover, our data indicate that 5-HT and NT affect distinct or possibly overlapping populations of vCA1 neurons, as cells activated by rewarding and aversive social experiences differ in their 5-HT1BR and NTR1 composition in that they can be preferentially potentiated by 5-HT or NT (Extended Data Fig. 9). These results not only extend previous findings suggesting distinct vCA1 cell populations are activated by appetitive and aversive stimuli24, but also reveal that neuromodulator receptor expression can be a strong determinant in valence information routing. In addition, the physiological and behavioural effects of 5-HT and NT contrast non-social valence assignment in the amygdala, where a single neuromodulator gates directionality independent of receptor expression9. Our experiments show that 5-HT conveys positive, and NT negative valence association with a conspecific, which can be flexibly switched within minutes. Thus, activation of 5-HT1BRs specifically restored positive social valence assignment as well as vCA1 excitability in an ASD mouse model haplo-sufficient for Shank3 Exon 4-22. This suggests that enhanced 5-HT1BR activity can compensate for the reduction in synaptic plasticity caused by mutation of Shank3, which might be a common mechanism applicable to many ASD-risk gene mutations affecting synaptic transmission.

Given that information of conspecific identity is routed from the dCA2 to the vCA1 (refs. 4,42,43), we postulate that 5-HT and NT increase excitability of a subset of vCA1 neurons so that incoming identity information is preferentially mapped onto the potentiated population and thereby overlayed with valence. Since manipulation of 5-HT and NT release into the vCA1 lead to distinct behavioural outcomes, it is possible that information stored in the 5-HT and NT potentiated vCA1 neurons is differentially routed to promote appropriate action-selection. This represents a basic mechanism defining how the brain processes and updates many characteristics of a given entity. Further studies investigating the downstream target regions receiving inputs from those cells will thus be informative.

None of our projection- and neuromodulator-specific manipulations affected sexual behaviours, anxiety, baseline sociability and RTPP, indicating that innate valence is not affected. As manipulations of 5-HT and NT in other brain regions have been found to influence one or many of those behaviours9,31,44,45, our findings extend growing evidence that behavioural effects of the neuromodulators are highly region specific. Assuming the high regional heterogeneity of vCA1 neurons along with expression of various neuromodulator receptors46,47, it is possible that further neuromodulatory signals such as oxytocin, norepinephrine or dopamine48,49, are multiplexed to promote more specific types of social representation. This converging neuromodulatory motif has the potential to integrate complex information into a behaviourally relevant outcome and may represent a shared principle used by behaviours including social dominance, cooperation and foraging. In sum, we have identified physiological correlates of a neural competition mechanism for flexible valence association, which is capable of integrating social history. Our findings indicate that further simultaneous exploration of several neuromodulators in converging circuit motifs will not only provide critical insights into complex social behaviours but also reveal potential therapeutic targets such as 5-HT1BR and NTR1, which can be leveraged to improve social cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD and schizophrenia.

Female and male C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, 664) and heterozygous transgenic TRAP2;Ai14 (ref. 50), Amigo2-Cre2 (B6.Cg-Tg(Amigo2-cre)1Sieg/J; Jackson Laboratory, 30215), Sert-Cre (Mouse Mutant Resource and Research Centers, stock number 017260-UCD, strain code: Tg(Slc6a4-cre)ET33Gsat/Mmucd), NT-Cre44 (a gift from S. Russo) and, Shank3Δ4-22 (ref. 39) (B6.Cg-Shank3tm2.1Bux/J; Jackson Laboratory, 32169), dCas9-KRAB (Rosa26-LSL-dCas9-KRAB (Jackson Laboratory, 033066) mice were used as experimental subjects. TRAP2;Ai14 mice were generated by crossing TRAP2 (STOCK Fostm2.1(icre/ERT2)Luo/J; Jackson Laboratory, 30323) and Ai14 (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J; Jackson Laboratory, 7914) mice. Male retired breeder CD-1 (Charles River, ICR), female Swiss-Webster (Charles River, CFW) as well as male and female C57BL/6J mice were used as partner mice.

Except for singly housed aggressors, mice were housed with 2–5 mice per cage and weaned at 21 days old. All behavioural experiments were conducted with 7–14-week-old mice. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light–dark cycle at roughly 21 °C with 50% humidity and food and water ad libitum. Behavioural experiments were performed during the same circadian period (07:00–19:00). Experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and approved by the Use of Laboratory Animals and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sample sizes were not predetermined by statistical analysis but based on previous experience with the variance of the assays. The sequence of control and manipulated conditions were shuffled.

Mice (4–8 weeks old) were anaesthetized with intramuscular injections of a drug mixture containing ketamine (100 mg kg−1) and xylazine (5 mg kg−1) and heads were then positioned on a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) for virus injections (0.2–0.5 μl) at a flow rate of 0.1–0.25 μl min−1 with a microinjection pump (Harvard Apparatus). The following bregma coordinates from dura were used to target the virus solution filled glass cannula: dCA2 (bilateral, anteroposterior −1.6 mm; mediolateral ±1.6 mm; dorsoventral 1.7 mm), vCA1 (bilateral, anteroposterior −3.16; mediolateral ±3.1; dorsoventral −4.55), DR (unilateral, anteroposterior −4.36; mediolateral 0; dorsoventral −3.1), aPVT (unilateral, anteroposterior −0.4; mediolateral 0; dorsoventral −3.8), median raphe (unilateral, anteroposterior −4.4; mediolateral 0; dorsoventral −4) and reuniens (bilateral, anteroposterior −0.2; mediolateral ±0.85; dorsoventral −4.3).

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) used for stereotaxic injections were purchased from Addgene, WZ Biosciences and the Stanford Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus Core and included: AAVDJ-hSyn-EGFP, AAVDJ-hSyn-hM4Di-mCh, AAVDJ-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCh, AAVDJ-hSyn-mCh, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-eYFP, AAVDJ-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP, AAVDJ-hSyn-ChR2-mCh, AAVDJ-hSyn-GCaMP6f, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-RCaMP2, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-NpHR3.0eYFP, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-eYFP, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mCh, AAVDJ-CMV-DIO-EGFP, AAVDJ-EF1α-DIO-mCh, AAVDJ-EF1α mCh-IRES-Cre-WPRE, AAV9-hSyn-EGFP-CAAX, AAV9-hSyn-GRAB5-HT3.5 and AAV9-hSyn-GRABNT1.0. AAV titres ranged from 1 × 1012 to 2 × 1013 gc ml−1. CAV2-Cre (ref. 51) was purchased from Plateforme de Vectorologie de Montpellier. Synapsin-driven lentiviral NLS-GFP-Cre, AAV-CAG-FLEx-TC, AAV-CAG-FLEx-G and rabies virus (Janelia Research Campus) were used for monosynaptic tracing. Behavioural experiments with cell body manipulations were performed 3–4 weeks after virus injections, whereas the viral particles were allowed to incubate 4–8 weeks for manipulation of axon terminals.

Optic fibres (400-µm core, numerical aperture (NA) 0.5; RWD Life Science) for optogenetic light delivery were implanted in the vCA1 bilaterally at anteroposterior −3.16; mediolateral ±3.1; dorsoventral −4.4. A 26-gauge guide cannula (Plastics One) for drug micro-infusion was implanted at anteroposterior −3.16; mediolateral ±3.1, so that the 33-gauge infuser insert reached a depth of dorsoventral −4.5. Miniature screws (thread size 00–90 × 1/16; Antrin Miniature Specialties and McMaster-Carr), light-cured dental adhesive cement (C&B Metabond, Parkell) and resin (Geristore A&B paste, DenMat or Ortho-Jet powder&liquid, Lang Dental) were applied to secure implants to the skull. A small percentage (roughly 5%) of mice were excluded from behavioural analysis based on either off-target transgene expression or inaccurate implant placement.

For this, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma H6278-50MG) was administered by means of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at 50 mg kg−1 for 15 min after pairing with partner mice. CNO (Tocris Biosciences 4936) was also delivered through i.p. injections at 10 mg kg−1 for 30 min before behavioural experiments. Drugs used for cannula microinjection experiments were infused in a total volume of 200–400 nl at a speed of 200 nl min−1 through an injector cannula connected to a micro-infusion pump (World Precision Instruments). The following drugs and concentrations were used: methiothepin mesylate salt (Millipore Sigma M149, 0.2 μg), NAS-181 (Tocris Biosciences 1413, 2 μg), NAD-229 (Tocris Biosciences 3282, 3.5 μg), SR48692 (Tocris Biosciences 3721, 5 pg), NTRC 824 (Tocris Biosciences 5438, 22 pg) and CP93129 dihydrochloride (Tocris Biosciences 1032, 0.5 μg). After completion of the infusion, injection infusers stayed for 2 min until removal and sociability and social memory assays were carried out 20 min later. NAS-181 (10 mg kg−1) and SR48692 (3 mg kg−1) were delivered through i.p. injections 30 min before fibre photometry experiments.

Three groups of TRAP2;Ai14 mice (6–8 weeks old) were habituated to i.p. saline injections and empty cages for two consecutive days. On test day, group 1 subjects were introduced to an age-matched same-sex conspecific in a new cage, group 2 to a sex-matched aggressive male CD-1 or female CFW mouse in the aggressor's home cage and group 3 to a potential mate (opposite sex) in either the female partner's home cage or the female subject's home cage. After 15 min of interaction, subjects were administered 4-OHT (50 mg kg−1) and interaction was continued for 1 h before subjects returned to their home cages. Ten days later, mice were either perfused with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for histological analysis or brains were removed to be fresh frozen for in situ hybridization experiments.

Depending on the experiment, test mice were habituated for 2 days to i.p. injections, infuser inserts or the fibre optic patch cord as well as the three-chamber apparatus containing two empty inverted metal grid pencil cups (10 cm diameter) in the outer two chamber for 5 min. The three-chamber apparatus (60 cm long by 23 cm wide by 26 cm high) was constructed of 0.3-cm-thick white opaque acrylic sheets, with two outer chambers (23 cm long by 23 cm wide) and a centre chamber (15 cm long by 23 cm wide) divided by 15-cm-long barriers extending from opposite ends of the walls. White opaque acrylic dividers were used to block entrance to the two outer chambers from the centre chamber. Partner mice were also habituated under the cup for 5 min for 2 days. On test day, subjects were placed into the centre chamber for 2 min before the barriers were lifted, whereafter the subjects were able to freely explore all three chambers. Four variations of this assay were performed to test social memory. The location of partner mice and objects in either chamber was counterbalanced between trials in all tests.

In the neutral social memory test, the first 10-min session is also a sociability test, in which the time spent in the chamber with a same-sex age-matched novel mouse or an object is measured similarly to previously described methods3,5,7. After a 10-min interval, in which subjects were separated from the contents of the two outer chambers, the barriers were lifted and the subjects were allowed to freely explore the three chambers for 5 min in a second session. This time, the one of the outer two chambers contained a novel mouse and the other one a familiar mouse (same mouse from previous session) under a cup.

In the negative social memory test, subjects interacted directly or 5 min with either a same-sex aggressor in the aggressor's home cage (similar to a resident–intruder test17,18) or a same-sex non-aggressor in a new cage. After a 5-min interval, those subjects that interacted with an aggressor were exposed to a non-aggressor for 5 min and vice versa. The sequence was counterbalanced between trials. After another 5-min interval, the subject was placed into the centre chamber for 2 min, whereafter the barriers were lifted and the subject was allowed to freely explore the three chambers containing the aggressor and the non-aggressor under a cup for 5 min. Owing to the sharp drop in the discrimination scores after a short separation time3,7, a 5-min interval was chosen to shorten the separation time after the first interaction. Singly housed (at least 10 days) male retired breeder CD-1s were used as male aggressors and pair-housed female CFWs were used as female aggressors18. CD-1s and CFWs were screened for their level of aggression as previously described17 and only mice that attacked within 10 s and more than three times within 5 min qualified as aggressors. Retired breeder CD-1s and female CFW group-housed with same-sex conspecifics were used as non-aggressors. Only mice that did not attack in a 5-min interaction qualified as non-aggressors.

In the positive social memory test, subjects interacted directly with either an opposite-sex conspecific potential mate in the potential mate's home cage or an opposite-sex conspecific neutral partner in a new cage for 5 min. After a 5-min interval, the subject that interacted with one type of partner was exposed to other for 5 min, whereby the sequence was counterbalanced between trials. After another 5-min interval, social memory was tested in a three-chamber apparatus for 5 min with one outer chamber containing the potential mate and the other containing the neutral partner under the cup. In the case of male subjects, the experimenter held the potential mate female partner to simulate the mating posture19 with its rear close to the male's snout three times for 3 s. In the case of female subjects, a barrier was placed into their home cage so the timing and pacing of the interaction with the potential mate male partner could be controlled. The cardboard barrier had an opening at the bottom, small enough for the female, but not the male, to easily escape to the other side of the cage. The interactions with the neutral partner were without lordosis posture and barrier in a new cage. It is important to note that the term neutral is used to describe a more neutral or less positive stimulus compared to the potential mate but not an absolute neutral stimulus.

We used two variations of the RTPP test. The basic RTPP was performed as previously described31, in which light stimulation was paired with one of the two outer chambers while the subject was allowed to freely explore the three chambers for 15 min. Next, light stimulation was paired with the opposite outer chamber while the subject freely explored all three chambers again for 15 min. In variation 1, the two outer chambers each contained a new mouse and light stimulation was paired with one of the two chambers, while the subjects freely explored all three chambers for 10 min. After a 10-min interval, the barriers were lifted and the subjects were allowed to move freely between the three chambers, where the outer chambers contained the two previously acquainted mice (now familiar mice) under a cup. During this 5-min period, no light stimulation was applied. In variation 2 of this assay, two new objects instead of mice were used.

Recorded videos in the three-chamber apparatus was analysed using a video tracking system (BIOBSERVE, v.3.01), which automatically tracked the location of the subject mouse. The time spent in either of the two outer chambers were scored for the duration of the tests. The following were used to calculate the discrimination scores: sociability test ((time in novel mouse chamber − time in object chamber)/(time in novel mouse chamber + time in object chamber)); neutral social memory test ((time in novel mouse chamber − time in familiar mouse chamber)/(time in novel mouse chamber + time in familiar mouse chamber)); negative social memory test ((time in non-aggressor chamber − time in aggressor chamber)/(time in non-aggressor chamber + time in aggressor chamber)); positive social memory ((time in potential mate chamber − time in neutral mouse chamber)/(time in potential mate chamber + time in neutral mouse chamber)); RTPP mouse/object ((time in previously light-paired mouse/object chamber − time in no-light mouse/object chamber)/(time in light-paired mouse/object chamber + time in no-light mouse/object chamber)). For all experiments, male and female subject mice were used in roughly equal numbers. Test mice were excluded from the analysis (less than 2% of the total), if they were not attacked by the aggressor, if the non-aggressor attacked more than three times in 5 min, or if they spent the entirety of the assay in one chamber only.

Mice were habituated for 2 days to behavioural chambers with optic fibres connected to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in off states. A 545-nm Dual-LED (Prizmatix) was connected to the optical implants via a rotary joint and a fibre optic patch cord (Prizmatix) to photostimulate NpHR3.0. A 450-nm Dual-LED (Prizmatix) was used to photostimulate ChR2. The LEDs were adjusted to around 15 mW for axon terminal stimulation using a digital power meter console (ThorLabs) and the frequency was controlled by Pulser Plus (Prizmatix). A cycle of 8 s on and 2 s off was used to stimulate NpHR3.0 to avoid tissue overheating. ChR2 was stimulated at 20 Hz with a 5-ms pulse duration.

Similar to previously described52, mice were tested for baseline preference for two differently textured clear acrylic floors by spending 15 min in a white opaque polycarbonate chamber (23 cm long by 23 cm wide by 26 cm high, 0.3 cm thick) on both floors (23 cm long by 13 cm wide by 2.5 cm high, 0.3 cm thick). The ‘grid' floor was constructed of seven evenly spaced apart rails, which were 2.5 cm in width. The hole floor contained 4 × 9 round holes 8 mm in diameter, evenly spaced apart. On day 1, mice were either administered saline or CNO (10 mg kg−1) through i.p. injections 30 min before conditioning to one of the floors for 15 min. On the following day, mice that received saline on the previous day, received CNO and vice versa. 30 min later, animals were conditioned to the alternate flooring for 15 min. On day 3, test mice were placed into the chamber containing both types of flooring and time spent on either type was automatically scored with video tracking software (BIOBSERVE).

Mice were placed into the centre of the elevated-plus maze (74 cm long by 74 cm wide by 94 cm high; Med Associates Inc.) with white floors (each arm 35 cm long by 6 cm wide with 19 cm high walls on closed arms) for 10 min and location of the mice were scored with video tracking software (BIOBSERVE).

Male subjects were placed for 5 min into a female conspecific's home cage with one female present. The female was held by the experimenter for 3 s in a mating posture, so that the male could sniff the female's rear. Male mounting attempts during the 5 min of free interaction were manually quantified. As females do not show mounting behaviour, a different test was used to assess female receptiveness to males. Male partners were placed into the female subject's home cage, which was divided into two compartments by a barrier, small enough for the female to easily escape. Escape times and duration of the female in each compartment were manually scored.

AAVDJ-CaMKII-GCaMP6f, AAV9-hSyn-EGFP-CAAX, AAV9-hSyn-GRAB5-HT3.5 (ref. 53) or AAV9-hSyn-GRABNT1.0 (ref. 9) was injected into the vCA1 (unilateral, anteroposterior −3.16; mediolateral ±3.1; dorsoventral −4.55), and fibre optic implants were secured above the injection site (unilateral, anteroposterior −3.16; mediolateral ±3.1; dorsoventral −4.4) in stereotaxic surgeries. Two to three weeks later, mice were habituated to the behavioural set-up and tested on the following day with simultaneous video and fibre photometry acquisition. Test mice interacted with a new object, a novel same-sex age-matched conspecific, a sex-matched aggressor or a potential mate for 5 min with an interval of 5 min, whereby the sequence of the interaction was counterbalanced between subjects. The interaction with the aggressor and female potential mate was in the partner's home cage, whereas the interaction with the object and same-sex conspecific was in a new cage. Female subjects interacted with the potential mate in their own home cage. Synapse software, which controlled an RZ10X LUX-I/O processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies), was used for data acquisition. To stimulate Ca2+-dependent and isosbestic emission, GCaMP6f was excited by frequency-modulated built-in 465- and 405-nm LEDs (RZ10X LUX-I/O processor), respectively. All optical signals were band-pass-filtered with a fluorescence mini cube (Doric), emission was measured with built-in photosensors in the RZ10X LUX-I/O processor and the signal was digitized at 6 kHz. A previously described custom MATLAB_R2022b (MathWorks) code7 was used for signal processing. To debleach, fibre photometry raw signals were fitted with a mono- or bi-exponential decay function, and the resulting fluorescence trace was z scored. Corresponding videos were manually analysed by frame in MATLAB to identify the time of physical contact between test mouse and partner mouse and object. Peristimulus time histograms were constructed by averaging 7 s of non-overlapping epochs from the z scored trace, where a time of 0 represents the time of contact. The maximal z score between 0 and 4 s was used as peak z scored fluorescence.

We generated a multi-guide CRISPRi AAV vector starting with pX552 (Addgene, 60958) as the backbone, which we then digested with NotI-HF (NEB). Between the NotI sites, we inserted two gene fragments to generate the AAV backbone pAAV mU6-sgRNA-CR1 EF1α-EGFP-W3-SV40. The first fragment comprised a mouse U6 (mU6) promoter, multiple cloning site for protospacers, constant region (CR1) and an EF1α promoter derived from pU6-sgRNA EF1α-puro-T2A-BFP (Addgene, 60955) but engineered to include BbsI sites flanking the mU6-sgRNA-CR1 cassette. The second fragment contained EGFP, W3 terminator and SV40 poly(A) signal. Both were assembled into the NotI-digested pX552 backbone using a three-part Gibson assembly (HiFi NEB). Subsequently, sgRNA arrays comprising a mU6 promoter, sgRNA protospacer sequence of interest and CR1 cassette, synthesized as gene fragments, were inserted into the backbone with a Golden gate approach using the engineered BbsI (NEB) sites in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To ensure maximum knockdown efficiency, the vectors consist of three tandem sgRNA cassettes containing the protospacers predicted to have highest activity according to the Weissman laboratory's V2 CRISPR sgRNA algorithm54.

AAV particles were produced using a previously described protocol with minor modifications55. One T175 flask of HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) per construct was transfected with 87.6 µg PEI (1 µg ml−1; 3:1 PEI: DNA; PolySciences 24765) along with 15.4 µg of pAdΔF6, 7.3 µg of pAAV2/9n (pAdΔF6 and pAAV2/9n were gifts from J. M. Wilson; Addgene, catalogue nos. 112867 and 112865, respectively) and 6.5 µg of pAAV mU6-sgRNA-CR EF1α-EGFP-W3-SV40 plasmids. Viral supernatant was harvested 72 h posttransfection, along with cells and mixed thoroughly with 0.1 volumes of chloroform. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 M, mixed thoroughly, and the sample centrifuged for 5 mins at 3,000g, 4 °C. The aqueous phase was retained, mixed with 9.4 ml of 50% PEG-8000, incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 30 min at 3,000g, 4 °C. Pellets we resuspended in dPBS, mixed with 5 µl benzonase (EMD Millipore, 71205) and 1 mM MgCl2, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Postbenzonase treatment, samples were mixed thoroughly with an equal volume of chloroform and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000g, 4 °C. Samples were buffer exchanged into dPBS and concentrated to roughly 50 µl using 100-kDa cut-off cellulose centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma, UFC8100).

For the cFos immunohistochemistry experiment, mice were subjected to an interaction with an aggressor (CD-1/CFW) or a potential mate for 1.5 h and immediately perfused with chilled 10% NBF. After overnight incubation in 10% NBF, 40-μm slices were prepared on a Leica VT 1000S vibratome and collected in 24-well plates filled with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After a 1.5-h blocking in 5% normal goat serum, slices were incubated with 1:1,000 diluted primary antibody and 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C for 12 h. After three 5-min washes with PBS, slices were incubated for 1.5 h in secondary antibody, subsequently washed three times in PBS for 15 min and Fluoromount-G mounting medium was used for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The following primary antibodies were used: 1:1,000 diluted cFos antibody (Synaptic Systems, 226 008) and 1:500 diluted TPH2 antibody (Abcam, ab184505). The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa 488 (1:500 dilution), Alexa 568 (1:1,000 dilution) and Alexa 633 (1:1,000 dilution).

AAVDJ-EF1α mCh-IRES-Cre-WPRE and AAV9-EF1α-sgTph2-EGFP or AAV9-EF1α-sgNTC-EGFP were injected into the DR (unilateral, anteroposterior −4.36; mediolateral 0; dorsoventral −3.1) of dCas9-KRAB mice. Three weeks later, immunohistochemistry was performed as described above. Imaging was conducted on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal (×20 objective; NA 0.8; diode laser 405 nm, argon laser 458/488/514 nm, diode-pumped solid-state laser 561 nm and HeNe laser 594/633 nm; detectors 32 channel GaAsP, T-PMT (transmitted light), 2-PMT and Airyscan detector; bit depth of images was 8 bit). TPH2 channels were background subtracted, and the same cut-off threshold was applied for all replicates. Polygons were manually drawn around the DR area and particles within the area of interest were analysed. All infected DR cells received sgTph2 or non-targeting guides. To evaluate cell body TPH2 expression in the DR, we analysed fluorescence intensity. An average percentage fluorescence intensity was calculated from the sgNTC replicates and the remaining ratio was used for calculation of the percentage TPH2 fluorescence intensity and knockdown efficiency.

Behavioural cohorts were injected with AAV9-EF1α-sgTph2-EGFP or AAV9-EF1α-sgNTC-EGFP into the DR and CAV2-Cre into the vCA1. Six weeks later, behavioural experiments were performed followed by perfusion and immunohistochemistry. Imaging and background subtraction was performed as described above. Polygons were manually drawn around the vCA1 and particles in within the area were analysed. In the vCA1 only the DR terminals received sgTph2 or non-targeting sgRNA. Therefore, we analysed the area of the TPH2+ terminals in the vCA1. An average percentage of TPH2+ area within the vCA1 area was calculated from the sgNTC replicates and the remaining ratio was used for calculation of percentage TPH2+ area.

Primary neuronal culture was performed as previously described56. In brief, DR nuclei were dissected from P0 pups in ice-cold Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88284) supplemented with 2 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM EGTA under a dissection hood and incubated in Neuronal Isolation Enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88285) and HBSS for 20 min, washed twice with HBSS and dissociated in prewarmed Neurobasal-A Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10888022) with 2% FBS (Avantor, 97068-085) by gentle trituration. Cell yield and viability were determined by a hemocytometer and trypan blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15250061) staining, respectively. Neurons were plated on a poly-d-lysine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A3890401) precoated 24-well plate. After 24 h, half of the serum medium was replaced with an equivalent volume of Serum-free Neurobasal-A Medium supplemented with 0.5 mM l-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A2916801) and 0.5% B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504044). On day 3, half of the old medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 4 mM Ara-C (Sigma, C6645), and neurons were infected with AAV constructs expressing control sgRNAs or Tph2 sgRNAs. After infections, the primary neuronal cultures were maintained for 1 week with medium changes every 3 days.

RNA extraction was performed using a Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo Research, R1050) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4387406). The resulting complementary DNA (cDNA) was then used for qPCR using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A25742) with gene-specific primers. Data were recorded using a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tph2 expression was normalized to Actb. The relative changes in expression were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Primers used in the studies include: Tph2 (mouse): forward, 5′-GCAAGACAGCGGTAGTGTTCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGTCCACGAAGATTTCGACTT-3′; Actb (mouse): forward, 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′.

Here, 4–8-week-old C57BL/6J, Shank3Δ4-22+/− and wild-type littermates were used for whole-cell recordings. Mice were euthanized and brains were sliced in a sucrose cutting solution containing (in mM): 228 sucrose, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 7 MgCl2 and 0.5 CaCl2 on a vibratome (Leica VT1200 S). Slicing and recording solutions were continuously equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Coronal vCA1 slices (300 μm) were transferred to a slice holding chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl2 and 2.5 CaCl2 (osmolarity 289–295) for 30 min at 32 °C and then further equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature. Next, brain slices were placed in a recording chamber perfused with 28–30 °C artificial cerebrospinal fluid and visualized with a ×40 water-immersion objective on an upright fluorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus) equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast video microscopy and epifluorescence (CoolLED). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings (pipette opening 4–6 MΩ) were performed with pipettes filled with (in mM): 130 C6H11KO7, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 2.5 MgCl2, 4 Mg2ATP, 0.4 Na3GTP, 10 phosphocreatine (pH 7.25; osmolarity 290). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (pipette opening 3–4 MΩ) of IPSCs were performed with pipettes filled with (in mM): 80 CsCl, 65 CsMeSO4, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.25 EGTA, 2 Mg2ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 0.1 spermine, 7 phosphocreatine (pH 7.34; osmolarity 300). No CsCl but 140 CsMeSO4 was used for whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of EPSCs. Series and input resistance were monitored with −4 mV, 70-ms pulse delivered through the recording pipette and experiments were excluded from the analysis if series resistance varied by more than 15%.

Current-clamp recordings were carried out to assess intrinsic cell excitability with a series of incremental rectangular depolarizing current pulses (20 pA, 500 ms) injected into vCA1 pyramidal cells. Next, the same procedure was performed in the same cell after either CP93129 dihydrochloride (Tocris Biosciences 1032, 5 µM) or PD149163 (Sigma, 0.5 µM) was bath applied for 5 min. Following 10 min of wash-out, recordings were carried out in the same cell in presence of the second drug, whereby the sequence of drug application was counterbalanced between cells. Only one cell was recorded per slice. Current-clamp recordings in the PVT was carried out with 20-pA depolarizing current pulses and in the DR with 25-pA depolarizing current pulses. Pipettes were filled with in (mM): 130 C6H11KO7, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Mg2ATP, 0.5 Na3GTP, 10 phosphocreatine. CNO (Tocris Biosciences 4936, 5 µM) was bath applied for 5 min. Evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded from vCA1 cells with a bipolar stimulating electrode (fabricated from platinum and iridium wire) placed near the recording pipette. Baseline evoked and spontaneous EPSCs were recorded in voltage-clamp settings at −70 mV the presence of picrotoxin (50 μM). Baseline evoked and spontaneous IPSCs were recorded at −70 mV in the presence of NBQX (10 μM) and D-AP5 (50 μM). CP93129 dihydrochloride (5 µM) or PD149163 (0.5 µM) were bath applied after an initial baseline recording. Summary graphs of the effects of CP93129 and PD149163 over time in evoked recordings were generated by averaging 1-min bins as a percentage of the averaged 4-min baseline. Cumulative probability graphs were generated from all spontaneous events before and after drug application. Synaptic responses were recorded in the vCA1 8 weeks after stereotaxic injections of AAVDJ-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP into the DR or PVT. To photostimulate ChR2 in vCA1 axons and/or terminals, 470-nm 0.1–5.0-ms light pulses from the pE-300ultra (CoolLED) were delivered by means of a ×40 water-immersion objective to the whole slice. NAS-181 (20 µM) or SR48692 (0.5 µM) were bath applied following an initial baseline recording. Recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized at 10 kHz with the Digidata 1320A or 1440A data acquisition system (Molecular Devices) and analysed with Clampfit v.10.7 software (Molecular Devices).

The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer's manual57 using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v.2 kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, brains were fresh frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until 15-μm slices were prepared and collected directly on Superfrost plus microscopy slides using a cryostat. Following fixation in prechilled 4% paraformaldehyde, slices were washed in PBS and dehydrated gradually in 50%, 70% and two times 100% ethanol (5 min each). After a barrier was created with a hydrophobic pen, slides were incubated with roughly five drops of RNAscope hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, subsequently washed with distilled water and incubated with Protease IV for 30 min, then washed twice with PBS. The probes mCh-O3 (513201), Mm-Slc17a6-C2 (319171-C2), Mm-Gad2-C2 (439371-C2) and Mm-Nts-C3 (420441-C3) were warmed up to 40 °C in a water bath, and 1 volume of C2 and C3 were diluted in 50 volumes of C1 to create the probe mixture. In the hybridization step, slices were incubated with the probe mixture for 2 h at 40 °C in a HyEZ Oven and rinsed twice at room temperature in Wash buffer (50× RNAscope Wash buffer diluted in distilled water). Next, slides were incubated with roughly six drops of RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 Amp1 for 30 min at 40 °C in the HyEZ Oven and washed twice with wash buffer at room temperature. This procedure was repeated with RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 Amp2 (30 min) and RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 Amp3 (15 min). Slides were then incubated with RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 HRP-C1 in the HyEZ Oven at 40 °C for 15 min, rinsed twice in wash buffer at room temperature and incubated in a 1:1,000 diluted Opal 520 dye for 30 min at 40 °C and subsequently rinsed twice in wash buffer. This step was repeated with HRP-C2, HRP-C3 and matching Opal dyes 570 (1:3,000 dilution), 650 (1:1,000 dilution). Finally, Fluoromount-G mounting medium was used for DAPI staining.

Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal (×20 objective; NA 0.8; diode laser 405 nm, argon laser 458/488/514 nm, diode-pumped solid-state laser 561 nm and HeNe laser 594/633 nm; detectors 32 channel GaAsP, T-PMT (transmitted light), 2-PMT and Airyscan detector; bit depth of images, 8 bits). A Fiji (ImageJ v.1.52p) macro was used for automated image analysis, which was performed blinded. Based on pixel-intensity threshold, DAPI channels were background subtracted, binarized and converted to masks. Polygons were manually drawn around the vCA1 area and particles in the remaining channels were automatically analysed within the masked areas inside the polygon. The cut-off threshold was visually determined by comparing ascending intensity values with marked location in the images to eliminate background particles.

For behavioural experiments and analysis, the experimenters were blinded to the virus injection the animals received. Prism10 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. Individual data points are identified by sex in the source data. Parametric statistical tests were only chosen for normally distributed samples. Otherwise, non-parametric statistical tests were performed. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's or Dunnett's multiple comparison post hoc test was used to determine significance for several treatment comparisons and two-way ANOVA with Tukey's or Sidak's multiple comparison post hoc test for several group comparisons and across many time points. P values found in figure legends refer to ANOVA results of the whole group, whereas the asterisks between individual samples represent results of the multiple comparison post hoc tests. A two-tailed paired Student's t-test was applied for within-group comparison of two treatments and unpaired test for comparison between two groups. When normality was not assumed, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for within-group comparison of two treatments, Mann–Whitney test for between group comparison and Kruskal–Wallis with post hoc Dunn's test for multiple comparisons. All tests are two-sided. NS, not significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. In all figures, data are shown as mean ± s.e.m.

DR 5-HT and PVT NT neurons innervate overlapping but not identical areas within the vCA1. During an aversive social interaction NT is released from PVT neurons into the vCA1 and binds to NTR1 receptors on vCA1 pyramidal neurons, which increases excitability. During an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released from DR neurons into the vCA1 and binds onto 5-HT1BRs on GABAergic interneurons and inhibits their activity. By releasing the local inhibition onto vCA1 pyramidal neurons, the net excitatory drive (likely from the dCA24) onto the pyramidal neurons is increased. As there is heterogeneity in the vCA1 cell population, a subset of cells can be preferentially potentiated by NT due to higher expression of NTR1s or preferentially potentiated by 5-HT as they receive inputs from interneurons with higher expression of 5-HT1BRs. Overall, the increase in excitability in vCA1 pyramidal neurons in response to either NT or 5-HT balances social valence. The right insert highlights the converging circuitries from the PVT and DR to the vCA1, which mediates the plasticity. Credit: SciStories.

Metrics details

Indigenous groups often encounter significant challenges when asserting ancestral claims and cultural affiliations based on oral histories, particularly in the USA where such narratives have historically been undervalued. Although ancient DNA offers a tool to complement traditional knowledge and address gaps in oral history, longstanding disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and beliefs has understandably led many Indigenous communities to distrust DNA studies1,2,3,4. Earlier research often focused on repatriation claims5,6,7, whereas more recent work has increasingly moved towards enhancing Tribal histories8,9. Here we present a collaborative study initiated by a federally recognized Native American tribe, the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico, USA, to address gaps in traditional knowledge and further their understanding of their population history and ancestry. We generated genomes from 16 ancient Picuris individuals and 13 present-day members of Picuris Pueblo, providing genomic data spanning the last millennium. We show genetic continuity between ancient and present-day Picuris, and more broadly with Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon10, 275 km to the west. This suggests a firm spatiotemporal link among these Puebloan populations of the North American Southwest. Furthermore, we see no evidence of population decline before European arrival11,12,13, and no Athabascan ancestry in individuals predating 1500 ce, challenging earlier migration hypotheses14,15,16. This work prioritizes Indigenous control of genetic data and brings together oral tradition, archaeology, ethnography and genetics.

Ancient pueblos created by the Ancestral Pueblo culture, a term indicative of their ancestral relationship to contemporary Native American Pueblo Tribes, are among the most recognizable archaeological culture of North America. Many ancient pueblos have become the focus of US National Parks, Historic Parks or Monuments, and several have become UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the large, multi-story masonry ‘Great Houses' concentrated in Chaco Canyon within the San Juan River Basin on the Colorado Plateau in Northwestern New Mexico in the USA17. Chacoan Great Houses were constructed between roughly 850 and 1150 ce, and were central to a broader ritual landscape of agricultural communities across the northern Southwest (Fig. 1)18,19. Chaco Canyon was the centre of an extensive political and social network of more than 200 Great House communities covering an area larger than modern England. However, after around 1150 ce major construction ceased in Chaco Canyon and the area was largely depopulated for reasons still debated, which include drought, overexploitation of available ecological resources or arable land, collapse of regional exchange and belief systems or a combination of those factors20,21.

Chaco culture (Ancestral Puebloan) related sites are indicated with circles and present-day Pueblos are indicated with squares. Base elevation data are derived from the USGS EROS SRTM 1-arc second digital elevation model99, with smoothing applied to produce derivative hillshade and terrain-relief datasets.

Where Chacoan populations resettled in roughly 1150 ce, and what subsequent migrations they might have undertaken, remains a debated topic within Southwestern Archaeology and Indigenous communities alike. One area that has gained significant interest for its connections to Chaco is the Northern Rio Grande (NRG) region. Dating to roughly 900 ce, the earliest NRG Puebloan centres were contemporaneous with early Chaco, whereas archaeological, historic and modern pueblos—such as Picuris—provide evidence of NRG cultural continuity since the depopulation of Chaco. Whereas the oral traditions of present-day Puebloans22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 and many lines of scholarly evidence18,31,32,33 support some level of relationship between the inhabitants of Chaco Canyon and the NRG, the nature and depth of the relationship between these two distant regions is debated (see Supplementary Information 3.5 for a discussion on some archaeological models). This has inevitably led to scepticism about the strength of links between past and present Puebloan groups, which has negatively affected Tribal Nations seeking to protect and preserve Chaco Canyon and its ancestral role in the Puebloan world11,12,13.

Traditional knowledge keepers at Picuris Pueblo assert ancestral and cultural connections to numerous Ancestral Pueblo and Chaco culture sites in the San Juan Basin. The specifics of these relationships cannot be discussed outside traditional Picuris contexts, but include architectural motifs, an overlap between their racetracks with the system of Chacoan roads—which connect present-day Picuris with the San Juan Basin—and shared religious symbols found in material culture (such as pottery and sacred figurines) (Supplementary Information 3.1).

However, they also acknowledge uncertainties because of gaps in their oral history. Such gaps are inevitable in a centuries-old community that by our estimate (below) lost at least 85% of their members in the first several decades after European Contact. By 1700 ce, the community had shrunk to around 300 members, making them the smallest of the extant Pueblo nations. In addition, centuries of oppression and prohibition of Picuris religion and rituals, the loss of access to traditional and sacred landscapes, and the placement of Picuris children into Native American boarding schools inhibited the intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge and history at Picuris. Cumulatively, these factors have often minimized Picuris' voice in continuing discussions regarding the status and future of Chaco Canyon. The Picuris community initiated this research to bridge and mend gaps in their traditional knowledge with appropriate scientific data, and to address the extent to which they might have ancestral ties to Chaco Canyon and the regional system it anchored centuries ago.

Recognizing the potential of ancient DNA to help secure links to their past, the Governor and leadership of Picuris Pueblo requested some of their archaeological collaborators help them initiate conversations with the Centre for GeoGenetics (University of Copenhagen). In many consultations over a 2-year period, a mutually agreed-on collaborative research design was developed to investigate Picuris population, genomic and health history (Supplementary Information 2). A memorandum of agreement resulted between the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo and the University of Copenhagen for this collaborative study. Following that, Picuris approved the transfer of ancient individuals excavated from the pueblo in the 1960s34, that were on long-term loan to Southern Methodist University. For clarity, we have chosen to address both the Picuris Pueblo Tribal Nation and its members in the third person, even though some of its members are coauthors of this study.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas have documented their history through rich oral traditions, encompassing narratives, storytelling, songs, poetry and music35, as well as through painted and sculpted art forms27,31,36. Whereas there is some debate whether those Indigenous histories can be co-interpreted alongside archaeological and/or genetic evidence and how37,38,39,40,41, there is a general agreement that Indigenous narratives possess both symbolic and literal meanings, recording historical events42,43 and probably others detected archaeologically29,44. However, it is vital to recognize that oral narratives have many functions, and they may concentrate on a cosmological dimension or a character's intentions instead of more quotidian questions such as when and where22,25. Furthermore, oral narratives thrive in their plurality, as alternative, complementary accounts, and do not seek consensus to establish their importance25,26,28.

Picuris trace their origins to an underground realm inhabited by Pá à wíá è Páyó, the Creator, and other peoples. The community is divided in two halves (the ‘North' and ‘South' people), which have separate birthplaces in Picuris oral histories. These peoples were sent to the present, surface world by the Creator, some on clouds, others by watery routes, with the earliest peoples emerging from lakes near big white mountains. One of those lakes is called Phaxwii Oxwalna, and thought to be Serpent Lake, near Jicarita Peak, a mountain with perennial snow. It is located south of Picuris and, fittingly, the origin of the ‘South' people. The geographical correspondence of the ‘North' people's emergence location is less clear, with some traditions identifying it as a spring near Pikes Peak, Colorado. After migrating through the landscape for an unknown duration of time, these peoples settled at Picuris and Taos Pueblos, as well as Pot Creek Pueblo, which is located between the two. Archaeological estimates put the founding of these communities at roughly 900 ce. Although Pot Creek Pueblo was depopulated in roughly 1320 ce, Picuris and Taos, communities that speak closely related languages, were not, and represent some of the oldest, continuously occupied communities in the Americas.

In dedicated ancient DNA clean laboratories at the Center for GeoGenetics, we extracted DNA45,46 and built 29 double-stranded libraries47,48 and 42 uracil-specific excision reagent (USER)-treated single-stranded libraries49,50 of 16 ancient individuals buried in Picuris Pueblo, dated between 500 and 700 years ago (median depth of coverage, 2.67×, ranging from 0.009× to 36.6×). All non-USER-treated libraries showed positive evidence of post mortem ancient DNA damage51, and we estimated present-day human contamination to be below 2% for all individuals52,53,54 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Information 4 and 5).

At the community request, we also sequenced 13 present-day genomes from enrolled members of the Picuris Nation (Supplementary Table 3). We co-analysed these data with 590 ancient and modern genomes from the Americas and Siberia (Methods and Supplementary Information 9.1).

For all individuals, we obtained imputed diploid genotypes for the 44,136,290 variable sites in the 1000 Genomes high-coverage dataset, using GLIMPSE v.1.1.1 (refs. 55,56,57) (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Information 9.1.2). As the genetic data of many Indigenous North American groups are available only as genome-wide arrays or hybridization methodologies, we also subset our dataset accordingly to allow a direct comparison between the newly generated data and the wealth of sequences in the literature58,59 (Methods, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, and Supplementary Information 9.2).

We used principal component analysis (PCA)60, f statistics61, patterns of sharing of identity-by-descent (IBD) segments62 and estimated pairwise branch lengths5 to explore the genetic affinities between Ancestral and present-day Picuris, and all other Indigenous Americans with available genome-wide data, including the published low-coverage data from elite burials in Pueblo Bonito10 (Supplementary Information 10, 11.1, 11.2, 14.2 and 16).

We find that Ancestral and present-day Picuris are most closely related to each other, confirming the genetic continuity in Picuris Pueblo throughout the last millennium. Outgroup f3 statistics, D statistics, TreeMix63 and PCA results unambiguously show that no other sampled population, ancient or present-day, is more closely related to Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito than the Picuris individuals are (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 10–12 and 15–25 and Extended Data Fig. 1). These results are supported by Y-chromosome64 and mitochondrial DNA65 haplogroup distributions (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Information 7 and 8). We acknowledge, however, that DNA sampling in the region is very limited and includes no other Pueblo communities. Nonetheless, sampled individuals buried in Room 33 in Pueblo Bonito all carried the same very rare mitochondrial haplotype (B2y1), suggesting a matrilineal dynastic system. We found one modern Picuris individual to carry this same haplotype, and to be closer to the Pueblo Bonito individuals than to any other sampled population in both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 9).

a, Outgroup f3 statistics in the format f3(PuebloBonitoRoom33, pop, Yorubas), in which we find present-day and ancient Picuris Pueblo to share the most shared genetic drift with ancient individuals from Pueblo Bonito. Error bars represent about 3.3 standard errors (P ≈ 0.001 in a Z test with 172,863 SNPs in 5-Mb jackknife blocks). b, Same outgroup f3 statistics results, plotted on a map of North America. Warmer colours indicate higher f3 values. Triangle and circle denote ancient and present-day individuals, respectively. c, Treemix maximum-likelihood tree of Indigenous North Americans, rooted using a West African population (Yorubas). Populations were grouped and branches were shortened (denoted with a *) for increased readability. Unedited results can be found in Extended Data Fig. 3.

Previous studies have shown that Native American genomic ancestry featured two early splits, taking place between 22 and 14.6 thousand years ago (ka)7,58,59,66,67, giving rise to three main lineages. The first group to diverge were Ancient Beringians, represented by 11.5–9-ka-old individuals from Alaska7,67. This is followed by a split that gave rise to two extra lineages; one that includes mainly speakers of Athabascan and Algic languages, as well as groups in the Pacific Northwest58,59, whereas the other comprises all other previously studied Native Americans, including all ancient South Americans, and are represented by a roughly 12.8 ka individual of the Clovis culture (‘Anzick1')5. However, many Indigenous groups have a complex population history that involves ancestry from above this split, from both lineages or ancestry related to the lineage represented by Anzick1, but not present in Anzick1 itself5,7,9,68,69,70,71 (Supplementary Information 11.2.2).

Using D statistics of the form D(ancientPicurisPueblo, Karitiana, Anzick, Yorubas)5,61 we found a significant rejection (D = −0.017; Z = −4.19) of ancient individuals from Picuris forming a clade with Southern Amazonian Karitiana to the exclusion of Anzick1, indicating Picuris carries ancestry that is not entirely from the lineage represented by Anzick1, a similar signal found in some North Mexican populations7,71,72 (Supplementary Figs. 25–31). However, when directly testing whether those populations carry instead ancestry from the other lineage in the form D(pop, Karitiana, test, USR1.11,500 bp) we found all to be consistent with zero (maximum D = 0.011, Z = 1.82 for LaPlaya.600 bp and ‘CanAmerindian_1'), suggesting our dataset does not include a suitable proxy for the excess ancestry not represented in Anzick1 found in Picuris and other populations. This probably represents either ancestry more basal than the one found in the Anzick1 genome, or an ancestry source very distantly related to the ones with genetic data available.

To investigate whether the end of construction and occupation of Chacoan Great Houses in the North American Southwest roughly 1150–1200 ce was followed or preceded by a population bottleneck, we applied three different methods73,74,75 on the imputed diploid genotypes from ancient and modern Picuris separately to estimate founder effects and their effective population size (Ne) over time. We estimate a similar population size in Picuris before European arrival using both ancient and present-day individuals, while also detecting no signal of population decline in pre-Colonial time using the three methods (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38 and Supplementary Information 12 and 15).

Left, the average shared IBD segments longer than 8 centiMorgans (cM) between Indigenous American populations and present-day individuals from Picuris Pueblo. Populations are ordered by latitude and coloured by major geographic areas. Right, the demographical history of present-day Picuris individuals inferred using HapNe-LD with imputed diploid genotypes. Shaded areas show 95 and 90% confidence intervals, and the dotted line the median estimate. The x axis is the time (measured in generations ago since the time of sampling), and the y axis the effective population size (Ne).

Archaeological and ethnohistoric estimates put the population of Picuris Pueblo on the eve of European arrival at around 3,000 individuals76,77,78. Architectural room-count-based estimates for the Northern Tiwa area in general (which includes Picuris), suggest that around 10,000 individuals occupied the region roughly 1300–1350 ce (ref. 77). Although it is challenging to translate effective population size estimates to census sizes in human populations, effective population sizes are conservatively estimated to roughly one-third of the census size79 or of a ratio between 0.21 and 0.65 (refs. 73,80). Therefore our point estimates, calculated both with ancient (harmonic mean over the ten last generations: 3,190 using IBDNe (ref. 73) and 5,300 using HapNe-LD75) or present-day Picuris Pueblo members (harmonic mean between 20 and 30 generations, 5,480 using HapNe-LD) are consistent with estimates of around 10,000 individuals being part of the Picuris sphere of influence at the time. The estimate of around 3,000 people at Picuris Pueblo is supported by oral traditions at Picuris, as well as archaeological estimates based on ceramic frequencies and architectural space occupied at the site's maximal size.

Using these high-quality genomic data, we sought to investigate the relationship of a Pueblo population with other populations, such as Athabascan-speaking groups. The latter occupy a large contiguous region in interior Alaska and western Canada, with two outlier populations residing along the Pacific Coast of South Oregon and Northern California, and the other in the US Southwest (the so-called Southern Athabascans)81. Whereas a north-to-south direction for their migration is attested in oral tradition82 and universally accepted among scholars83, its timing, causes, source population(s) and routes, and arrival times in those regions have been of longstanding academic debate.

The oldest direct archaeological evidence of Southern Athabascan settlement in the Southwest is a proposed Navajo-affiliated site in the Gobernador area of northwestern New Mexico, with a tree ring date of 1541 ce (ref. 84), a date that is coincident with the oldest written colonial record of a Southern Athabascan population—the ‘Querechos', commonly identified as Apaches85—in the region. The archaeological Tierra Blanca complex has been tentatively suggested by some to be culturally associated with these groups, and would push the date of an Athabascan presence back to roughly 1450 ce (refs. 83,85). One hypothesis suggests this movement took place due to the cold climate of the Little Ice Age (which peaked in North America roughly 1400 ce)86,87, the colder conditions leading some northern groups to move south. In contrast to this hypothesis, other researchers have proposed that there was a substantially earlier Southern Athabascan presence in the region, perhaps by roughly 800 ce. The lack of archaeological evidence in support of this hypothesis is attributed to the group's low census size and high mobility, which would have left relatively few archaeological traces14,15,16.

To investigate whether it is possible to resolve the timing of Athabascan dispersal, we compared the Southern Athabascan individuals reported in ref. 59 with all individuals in our dataset. Using f statistics61,88, we found that Southern Athabascans can be modelled as receiving most of their ancestry from a Puebloan source (ancientPicurisPueblo) alongside a Northern Athabascan population (for example, Chipewyan) (P = 0.34, Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34 and Supplementary Information 11.2.3). This is in line with the oral history of Southern Athabascans from the time of their arrival in the Southwest82, ethnographic evidence of many clan names being of ultimately Puebloan origin89,90,91, loanwords from Puebloan languages92 and, critically, the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and cultivation of maize, squash, beans, cotton and tobacco.

a, D statistics in the format D(Southern_Athabascans_1, Chipewyan, pop, Yorubas), where warmer colours indicate higher values of D, therefore a stronger genetic similarity with Southern Athabascans. Circles and triangles denote present-day and ancient individuals, respectively. Ancestral Puebloans from Picuris Pueblo is the population that maximize the value of D. Full D statistics results can be found in Supplementary Fig. 36. b, D statistics in the format D(Southern_Athabascans_1, ancientPicurisPueblo, pop, Yorubas). Athabascan speakers from northern North America are the ones to maximize the value of D (for example, Chipewyan). Full D statistics results can be found in Supplementary Fig. 37. For both plots, error bars represent about 3.3 standard errors (P ≈ 0.001 in a Z test with 172,863 SNPs in 5-Mb jackknife blocks).

Southern Athabascan traditions link them to interactions with Ancestral Puebloan communities before sixteenth century European Contact, but we do not find evidence of Athabascan ancestry in any Ancestral Picuris individual predating 1535 ce; such ancestry only occurs among present-day Picuris individuals (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23 and Supplementary Information 11.2.1 and 13). These results support a late arrival of Athabascan-related populations in the US Southwest, most likely after 1500 ce. Puebloan marriage preferences, burial practices, or admixture evident in Southern Athabascans could have been one-directional, as for example through Pueblo captives. Although this would explain the absence of an Athabascan ancestry signal in ancient Picuris, given the extensive interactions between those two groups, both historically as well as to this day, it is unlikely that such a scenario persisted over an extended period.

In conclusion, we show that individuals from Picuris Pueblo are the closest sampled population, past or present, to ancient individuals from Chaco Canyon, challenging claims of depopulation or disappearance in the area, and establishing a genetic component to suspected cultural affiliation between a present-day group and Ancestral Puebloan heritage. We emphasize that this conclusion does not challenge or call into question the connections and relationships that more than two dozen federally recognized Tribes have to Chaco Canyon. It is, however, the only example of paleogenetic data supporting a federally recognized Tribe's affiliation with Chaco Canyon ancestors.

Whereas Indigenous oral histories are increasingly being accepted and legislated as evidence of cultural affiliation, as they should be, caution is also needed to avoid unintentionally excluding groups such as Picuris Pueblo who have lineal and cultural affiliation, but who may have notable gaps in their histories due to centuries of continuing systemic injustices and colonial rule. Scientific tools, such as genetics, archaeology and linguistics, can assist in demonstrating local genetic continuity7,8,93,94,95,96 and provide opportunities to mend gaps in oral histories. Their application can have profound restorative value for present-day communities, discussions of their cultural heritage and ensure their federally recognized rights as stakeholders of ancient sites.

Finally, a crucial aspect of this research has been the shared commitment to ensure data sovereignty for Picuris Pueblo throughout this collaboration. Tribal leadership was involved in both drafting the research agreement and crafting the key findings of the work. Furthermore, Picuris Pueblo retained the right to curtail research at any point in the collaboration, and publication of results continues to be the sole decision of Picuris leadership. These guidelines and policies were an essential aspect of this collaborative research between non-Indigenous researchers and an Indigenous stakeholder community3,97,98. We hope collaborative efforts such as this one serve as catalysts for meaningful action and policy consideration, greater respect for oral histories and traditions, and that these results can be incorporated into well informed decision-making processes affecting Tribal sovereignty and community identity.

Following the decision of Picuris Pueblo members to study their population history using DNA, their archaeological collaborators initiated contact with the Centre for GeoGenetics in the University of Copenhagen. After 2 years of consultation and the signing of a research agreement, ancient individuals from Picuris Pueblo on long-term loan to Southern Methodist University were sent to the Centre for GeoGenetics. Saliva samples from present-day members of Picuris Pueblo were collected by members of the community following the signature of an informed consent that was explained by a Tribal liaison in both English and Northern Tiwa. Ethical oversight was provided by the Picuris Pueblo Tribal Council, which reviewed the study and granted permission for its conduct, with individual and tribal consent obtained from all participants. Furthermore, we consulted the National Committee on Health Research Ethics in Denmark, which had no comments on the study design H-16018872 (Supplementary Information 1–3).

All ancient DNA work was performed in dedicated clean laboratories at the Centre for GeoGenetics, GLOBE institute, University of Copenhagen. We extracted DNA from between 50 and 100 mg of crushed bone powder obtained from tooth cementum and the pars petrosa of the temporal bone of 28 samples from 22 ancient individuals. We built 34 double-stranded and 54 single-stranded Illumina libraries from those extracts, the latter after USER treatment. DNA was extracted from present-day saliva samples using Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit and built into dual-indexed Illumina libraries. All libraries were paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at the GeoGenetics Sequencing Core (Supplementary Information 4).

Accelerator mass spectrometry was performed on the University of California Irvine Keck-CCAMS facility to obtain direct radiocarbon dates. Calibrated dates were obtained with Bayesian modelling done using OxCal v.4.4 (ref. 100) software using the Northern Hemisphere curve101.

Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed and had their adaptors trimmed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.2 (ref. 102). Collapsed and paired-end reads were mapped to GRCh38 using bwa aln v.0.7.17 (ref. 103), optical duplicates were marked using Picard v.2.25.0 and depth of coverage and average read length estimated using pysam v.0.22.1. Ancient DNA characteristic misincorporation patterns were measured using mapDamage v.2.0 (ref. 104), and present-day contamination using ContamMix52 and ANGSD v.0.931 (ref. 53). For all analyses, only reads with mapping quality greater than or equal to 30 and bases with quality equal to or greater than 20 were considered. Chromosomal sex was estimated by estimating the ratio of reads mapping to the autosomal, X- and Y-chromosomes (Supplementary Information 5 and 6).

Consensus sequences were obtained using samtools v.1.3.1 mpileup105), requiring a minimum of five reads and more than 70% frequency in a locus to call a base. Haplogroup assignment was done using Haplogrep v.3 (ref. 106). Following sequence alignment using mafft107, haplogroup-specific phylogenetic trees were built using raxml-ng v.0.8.1 (ref. 108) and BEAST v.2.6 (ref. 109) (Supplementary Information 7).

Genotypes for positions located in the single-copy short-read callable 10-Mb region of the Y-chromosome110 were called using bcftools v.1.17 mpileup, excluding triallelic locus, indels and variants called in less than 95% frequency in the locus. Haplogroups were called by matching ancestral and derived calls to ISOGG 2019–2020, private databases and a previously published curated database111 (Supplementary Information 8).

We compared Picuris Pueblo present and ancient individuals with 835 published present-day and ancient genomes from the literature5,6,7,59,67,68,72,93,94,95,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123, alongside the 2,503 individuals from the 1000 Genomes high-coverage dataset124. Furthermore, as data from some key population only exists as hybridization capture or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array10,58,69,71,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133, we subset our whole genome dataset to those to allow a direct comparison. In total, we compared Picuris Pueblo data with more than 300 populations from the American continent and more than 5,500 individuals worldwide (Supplementary Information 9).

We used GLIMPSE v.1.1.1 (ref. 55) to impute ancient and present-day genomes with depth of coverage above 0.3× on a set of 44,136,290 variable sites on the 1000 Genomes high-coverage dataset, which was used as a reference panel. We excluded individuals with average genotype probability below 0.98. For the remaining individuals, we excluded variants with an INFO score below 0.8, not present in the GRCh38 strict accessibility mask and with a reference panel allele frequency below 1% (Supplementary Information 9).

We performed PCA on the dataset as implemented in plink v.1.90 (ref. 134), first including all individuals, then restricting to Far East Asia and the Americas and finally only including North American individuals. We used ADMIXTURE63 to investigate ancestry proportions and detect the presence of non-Indigenous American ancestry. We masked African and European tracts in present-day Indigenous Americans using RFMix v.2.03-r0 (ref. 135) (Supplementary Information 9 and 10).

Using FrAnTK136, we computed f3 statistics to estimate shared drift between two populations and D statistics to formally test hypothesis of cladality and gene flow61. We used qpAdm88, as implemented in Admixtools 2 (ref. 137), to model individual and population ancestry proportions (Supplementary Information 11).

We identified segments in IBD in the whole genome dataset using IBDseq138, but only segments with an LOD score higher than three and that were longer than two centiMorgans, and removing regions with excess IBD sharing following138. IBD sharing between individuals was averaged out per population (Supplementary Information 14).

To test the hypothesis of a pre-Colonial depopulation event taking place in the North American Southwest, we estimated demographic trajectories using IBD segments with IBDNe (ref. 73) and using patterns of linkage disequilibrium using HapNe-LD75. Age of founder population and bottlenecks were estimated using ASCEND74, and timing for admixture events with DATES139 (Supplementary Information 12, 13 and 15).

All maps were made using freely available vector and raster data from Natural Earth or the US Geological Survey and plotted using ESRI ArcGIS Pro v.3.0 and cartopy v.0.24.1. Compressed sequence alignment map files (BAM) aligned using human reference genome GRCh38 for ancient and present-day individuals are available in the European Genome-Phenome Archive under accession numbers EGAD50000001245 and EGAD50000001246. Picuris Pueblo is the sole owner of this dataset. Data access is controlled by the Picuris Pueblo Tribal Council through standard signed agreements that regulate the use of the ancient and/or present-day data. Consent for access will be granted exclusively to universities and research institutions exclusively for studies in population genetics that focus on understanding population history. The agreement strictly prohibits the use of the data for commercial purposes, inclusion in any kind of private databases (including forensic, mitochondrial or Y-chromosome) or medical or natural selection studies. Data cannot be used for tribal enrolment purposes. Present-day Picuris genomes are available exclusively for replication purposes using exactly identical comparison datasets, parameters and software and are controlled under a different agreement. Requests for data access will be evaluated jointly by the authors and the currently serving Picuris Pueblo Tribal Council every 3 months during the first year since publication, and every 6 months thereafter. Legitimate medical applications will be considered by the Picuris Pueblo Tribal Council if they explicitly serve Picuris health interests and guarantee that Picuris Pueblo retains full ownership of the data at all times and the right to halt any project at its sole discretion. Furthermore, previously published genomic data used for comparison are detailed and referenced in Supplementary Tables 4–6.

Metrics details

Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity1,2. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared3. Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT)4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)6,7,8,9,10 via a theory-neutral consortium11,12,13. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof12. Human participants (n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here14,15,16,17. Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.

Philosophers and scientists have sought to explain the subjective nature of consciousness (for example, the feeling of pain or of seeing a colourful rainbow) and how it relates to physical processes in the brain18,19. This quest has led to various theories of consciousness evolving in parallel1,2,3 and often providing incompatible accounts of the neural basis of consciousness1,2. Furthermore, empirical support for a given theory is often highly dependent on methodological choices, pointing towards a confirmation bias in theory testing3. Convergence on a broadly accepted neuroscientific theory of consciousness will have profound medical, societal and ethical implications.

To advance this goal, we tested two theories of consciousness, through a large-scale, open-science adversarial collaboration11,12,20,21,22 aimed at accelerating progress in consciousness research by building on constructive disagreement. We brought together proponents of IIT4,5 and GNWT6,23, in addition to theory-neutral researchers. The group identified differential existing and novel predictions of the two theories and developed an experimental design to test them (Fig. 1a). We preregistered these predictions, including pass or fail criteria, expected outcomes and their interpretation ex-ante11,12. We focus on IIT and GNWT, among other widely discussed theories (for example, recurrent processing theory and higher-order theories1,2), because they feature prominently in consciousness science, as demonstrated by a recent systematic review of the literature3.

a, Predictions of IIT and GNWT. For prediction 1 (decoding of conscious content), IIT predicts maximal decoding of conscious content in posterior brain areas, whereas GNWT emphasizes a necessary role for the PFC. For prediction 2 (maintenance of conscious content), IIT posits that conscious content is actively maintained in the posterior cortex, whereas GNWT predicts brief content-specific ignition (approximately 0.3–0.5 s) in the PFC at stimulus onset and offset, with content stored in a non-conscious silent state between these events. Waveforms (left) and temporal generalization matrices (right) illustrate the predicted amplitude-based and information-based temporal profiles: coloured rectangles indicate the three stimulus durations for PFC (GNWT) and posterior cortex (IIT; left); the arrows mark stimulus onset (brown) and offset (red), whereas predicted temporal generalization is depicted in green (GNWT) and blue (IIT; right). For prediction 3 (interareal connectivity supporting consciousness), the stars and arrows on the brain diagram illustrate predicted synchrony patterns, with green representing GNWT and blue representing IIT. Brain surface is from Freesurfer. b, Conscious experience is multifaceted. For instance, viewing the Mona Lisa involves experiencing it as occupying a specific spatial location, categorizing it as a face, recognizing an identity and noting its leftward orientation, with this complex experience maintained over time. c, To manipulate conscious content, stimuli varied across four dimensions: category (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), identity (different exemplars within each category), orientation (left, right and front views) and duration (0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s). Example stimuli are shown. d, Experimental paradigm. Participants detected predefined targets (for example, a specific face and object or a letter and false font) in sequences of single, high-contrast stimuli. Each trial contained three stimulus types: targets (red; coloured frames for illustration only), task-relevant stimuli (orange-red; same categories as targets) and task-irrelevant stimuli (purple; other categories). Blank intervals between stimuli are not depicted. Object stimulus images in panels c,d are courtesy of Michael J. Tarr, Carnegie Mellon University, http://www.tarrlab.org/; face stimuli were created using FaceGen Modeler 3.1.

IIT and GNWT explain consciousness differently: IIT proposes that consciousness is the intrinsic ability of a neuronal network to influence itself, as determined by the amount of maximally irreducible integrated information (phi) supported by a network in a state. On the basis of theoretical and neuroanatomical considerations, IIT suggests that a complex of maximum phi probably resides primarily in the posterior cerebral cortex, in a temporo–parietal–occipital ‘hot zone'4,5,24,25. GNWT instead posits that consciousness arises from global broadcasting and late amplification (or ‘ignition') of information across interconnected networks of higher-order sensory, parietal and especially prefrontal cortex (PFC)6,9,23.

Both theories have a mathematical or computational core (integrated information for IIT and global workspace for GNWT) and proposed biological implementations (posterior cortex versus PFC and associated areas, respectively). Although it is difficult to test the mathematical or computational core of either theory directly, their competing biological implementations are empirically testable with current methodologies. Thus, our study focuses on brain regions where the predictions diverge most notably—posterior cortex for IIT and PFC for GNWT, rather than the associated areas in higher-order sensory or parietal cortex—to facilitate maximally diagnostic experiments.

One consequence of this biological focus is that theorists could respond to challenging data by modifying the proposed biological implementation while retaining the mathematical or computational core of a theory. Another consequence is that some predictions (and their associated consequences) may overlap with other theories of consciousness that share similar biological bases, such as higher-order theories16,17 in the PFC and local recurrency theories14,26 in the visual cortex. Although these are inherent aspects of studying theoretical proposals about neural mechanisms of consciousness, the results are expected to help the community make more informed judgements about the tested theories (for rationale, see the preregistration document27).

We tested three preregistered, peer-reviewed predictions of IIT and GNWT12 for how the brain enables conscious experience (Fig. 1a). Prediction 1 addresses the cortical areas holding information about different aspects of conscious content. IIT predicts that conscious content is maximal in posterior brain areas, whereas GNWT predicts a necessary role for PFC. Prediction 2 pertains to the maintenance of conscious percepts over time28,29,30. IIT predicts that conscious content is actively maintained by neural activity in the posterior ‘hot zone' throughout the duration of a conscious experience, whereas GNWT predicts ignition events in PFC at stimulus onset and offset, updating the global workspace, with activity-silent information maintenance in between31. Prediction 3 examines interareal connectivity during conscious perception. IIT predicts sustained short-range connectivity within the posterior cortex, linking low-level sensory (V1/V2) with high-level category-selective areas (for example, fusiform face area and lateral occipital cortex), whereas GNWT predicts long-range connectivity between high-level category-selective areas and PFC. The combination of predictions, tested through highly powered, multimodal studies, places a high bar for either theory to pass, rendering failures more informative. Predictions were differentially weighted on the basis of their centrality to the theory and methodological considerations (Extended Data Table 1; for an additional preregistered non-critical analysis, see section 8 in Supplementary Information).

To empirically test these predictions, we investigated the content and temporal extent of conscious visual experiences, focusing on their phenomenological richness and multifaceted nature, even for a single stimulus. For instance, when viewing the Mona Lisa (Fig. 1b), one experiences it as having a specific identity, orientation and location in visual space for as long as one looks at the painting. To approximate such multifaceted experiences, we manipulated several attributes of conscious content by presenting suprathreshold visual stimuli across four different categories (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), each containing 20 unique identities shown in three orientations (front, left and right view) and for three durations (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 s). In each block, participants were instructed to detect two infrequent target stimuli from either the pictorial (face–object) or symbolic (letter–false fonts) stimulus categories (for example, a specific face or object), making these categories task relevant for that block (Fig. 1c,d).

This paradigm offers several advantages. First, it provides robust conditions to test the predictions of the theories by focusing on clearly experienced conscious content, studied through a high signal-to-noise, suprathreshold, fully attended single stimulus at fixation. This amplifies the significance of any challenges to the theories, as they cannot be explained by weak signals. Second, it minimizes task and report confounds, isolating neural activity specifically related to consciousness. Third, it allows testing of novel predictions to address previously unexplored questions, that is, how experience is maintained over time, refining theories and yielding new insights.

All research was conducted by theory-neutral teams to minimize confirmatory bias. We evaluated the predictions of theories in 256 participants performing the same behavioural task in three neuroimaging modalities: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 120), magnetoencephalography (MEG; n = 102) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG; n = 34). To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of each modality, we combined whole-brain, non-invasive fMRI and MEG with invasive iEEG, ensuring methodological rigour. Combined with large sample sizes, this minimizes the likelihood that negative results are due to methodological or sensitivity issues. Data collection occurred in two (or three) independent laboratories for each modality to guarantee generalization across groups of participants, instruments and experimenters. To foster informativeness, reproducibility and robustness, we (1) separated theory proponents from data acquisition and analysis to minimize bias and post-hoc interpretation, (2) used a multimodal approach that maximizes spatiotemporal resolution and coverage for a stringent and comprehensive tests of the theories in humans, (3) predefined large samples to increase statistical power, (4) followed standardized32 and preregistered protocols12 to reduce setup differences and confirmatory bias22 (see sections 1 and 2 in Supplementary Information), and (5) implemented an analysis optimization phase (one-third of the sample) followed by a final testing phase (two-thirds of the sample) on independent data for result validation33. Consequently, this large-scale international effort aimed at implementing a rigorous adversarial collaboration framework, thereby establishing a precedent for an alternative scientific approach.

According to IIT, PFC is not necessary for consciousness. Consequently, decoding conscious content should be most effective from the posterior cortex, and adding PFC activity as additional information should not improve decoding accuracy. This prediction was considered non-critical for testing IIT, as the theory focuses on the intrinsic, causal perspective of information within a neural substrate rather than the amount of information decodable from the perspective of an extrinsic observer5. By contrast, GNWT posits that conscious content can be decoded from PFC activity. Both theories predict that conscious content should be evident in theory-relevant areas independently of other cognitive processes (for example, report and task); thus, conscious content should be present irrespective of task manipulations34,35. This prediction was tested by evaluating the decoding accuracy of stimulus category (faces–objects (pictorial) and letters–false fonts (symbolic)) and orientation (left, right and front facing) in all theory-relevant areas. All stimulus categories alternated between being task-relevant and task-irrelevant across blocks (Fig. 1d). Stimulus orientation, being orthogonal to the task, remained task-irrelevant in all blocks.

On the basis of our preregistered predictions and pre-approved interpretations27 (Extended Data Table 1), the theories would pass the test if decoding is possible for both category (in at least one category pairing) and orientation (in at least one category), but would fail otherwise. Testing both category and orientation decoding constitutes a stringent test, as it requires two conditions to be satisfied, increasing the likelihood of failures36, while capturing the critical multidimensionality of conscious content, that is, phenomenological richness (Fig. 1b).

For decoding of category, we tested whether information is present in the relevant regions irrespective of the task, using a cross-task generalization approach (see Methods).

Here we report the most robust results for decoding of category (faces–objects) and orientation (left, right and front views of faces). Qualitatively similar results were observed for decoding of letters–false fonts (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). Results for orientation decoding were consistent across stimulus categories and data modalities in posterior cortex, but mostly absent in PFC (see section 5.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

In the iEEG data, pattern classifiers were trained on high gamma frequency band (70–150 Hz), which correlates with spiking activity37,38, at each time point in the task-irrelevant condition, and tested in the task-relevant condition, for each stimulus duration and category, and across all electrodes within the theory-relevant region of interests (ROIs; see Fig. 2a for a visualization of ROIs and Methods for anatomical ROI definitions). In the posterior ROIs, face–object decoding showed significant cross-task generalization (more than 95% accuracy) for the approximate duration of the stimulus (Fig. 2b, top row). In the PFC ROIs, significant cross-task face–object decoding accuracy (approximately 70%) was also evident, but the temporal generalization of this decoding was restricted to approximately 0.2–0.4 s (Fig. 2b, bottom row). Training on task-relevant and testing on task-irrelevant trials showed similar results (Extended Data Fig. 1e; within-task decoding is presented in Extended Data Fig. 2).

a, Spatial coverage of intracranial electrodes (npatients = 29) on a standard inflated cortical surface map (top), and within theory-defined ROIs (bottom): posterior (blue; nelectrodes = 583) and prefrontal (green; nelectrodes = 576). b, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of decoding of high-gamma signal. Pattern classifiers were trained to discriminate stimulus category (faces–objects) in the task-irrelevant condition at each time point and tested in the task-relevant condition across all time-points. Columns denote stimulus durations (0.5 s (left), 1.0 s (centre) and 1.5 s (right)), and rows indicate theory ROIs (posterior (top) and prefrontal (bottom)). Contoured red-shaded regions depict significant above-chance (50%) decoding. Here and below, significance was evaluated through a non-parametric cluster-based permutation test (P < 0.05; two-sided). c, MEG average cross-task decoding of stimulus category (n = 65) from task-relevant to task-irrelevant stimuli (purple) and vice versa (orange), separately for the posterior (top) and prefrontal (bottom) ROIs, depicted on inflated cortical surfaces (posterior in blue and prefrontal in green), across durations, using pseudotrial aggregation. Underlying lines indicate significance. The shading depicts 95% CI across participants. d, fMRI searchlight cross-task decoding of stimulus category (n = 73), collapsed across durations, from task-relevant stimuli to task-irrelevant stimuli (left; purple) or vice versa (right; orange). The outlined coloured regions on the inflated cortical surfaces (left–right lateral views; right–left medial views (bottom)) indicate significant above-chance decoding. e, iEEG ROIs significant cross-task decoding of stimulus category, collapsed across durations. Conventions are as in panel d, displayed from a left lateral (top left), posterior (top right) and left medial (bottom) views. f, iEEG average decoding of stimulus orientation (left, right and front) within posterior (top) and prefrontal (bottom) ROIs, collapsed across durations. Underlying lines indicate above-chance (33%) decoding. The shading depicts 95% CI estimated across cross-validation folds. g, fMRI searchlight decoding of face orientation (left, right and front). Regions with significantly above-chance (33%) decoding accuracies are outlined in blue. h, iEEG ROIs decoding of face orientation (left, right and front). Conventions are as in panel g. i, MEG ROIs average decoding of face orientation (left, right and front). Conventions are as in panel f. Brain surfaces in panels a,c–e,g,h are from Freesurfer.

Although electrode coverage across our sample of iEEG patients (n = 29 for decoding analyses) was exceptional in the relevant brain regions (Fig. 2a; PFC ROIs nelectrodes = 576, posterior ROIs nelectrodes = 583), we further analysed a larger population of healthy participants (n = 65) using MEG, focusing on theory-relevant ROIs (see Methods). Here too, cross-task generalization of face–object decoding was significant in both posterior and prefrontal ROIs (Fig. 2c) within the theory-predicted time windows. Cross-temporal generalization of decoding in MEG was sustained in posterior ROIs and brief in PFC ROIs for all three stimulus durations (see section 5.1.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

We leveraged the higher spatial resolution of fMRI (n = 73) to complement the analysis. A searchlight approach (see Methods) revealed distributed, robust cross-task generalization (approximately 75%) in the striate and extrastriate, ventral temporal and intraparietal cortex (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Table 2). Generalization in PFC had lower accuracy (approximately 60%) and was spatially restricted to middle and inferior frontal cortex regions (Fig. 2d). Theory-relevant ROIs defined in the Destrieux atlas yielded comparable results (see section 5.1.1.3 in Supplementary Information). These results closely matched those from iEEG-restricted to theory-specified ROIs and time windows (Fig. 2e). Hence, across modalities, face–object decoding occurred in both posterior and prefrontal ROIs, consistent with IIT and GNWT predictions.

Given the rich and multidimensional nature of conscious content, we assessed the decoding of stimulus orientation, which was always task-irrelevant. We obtained divergent results for IIT and GNWT: decoding of face orientation (left, right or front views) was achieved in posterior but not in prefrontal ROIs, both with iEEG (Fig. 2f,h, approximately 95% with pseudotrial aggregation; Extended Data Fig. 3a) and the fMRI searchlight approach (Fig. 2g, approximately 45%). Decoding of face orientation was robust from MEG cortical time series in posterior ROIs (approximately 75% with pseudotrial aggregation), but was weaker, yet above chance (35%), in prefrontal ROIs (Fig. 2i), with a possibility of signal leakage from posterior regions (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Bayesian testing further validated these findings. For iEEG, Bayes factor (BF)01 values (5.11–8.65) supported the null hypothesis of no face orientation decoding in prefrontal regions. fMRI Bayesian analysis revealed substantial-to-very-strong support for the null hypothesis in 34–55% of prefrontal voxels (BF01: 3–71.5), with support for the alternative hypothesis in only 1–9% of voxels, whereas the rest remained inconclusive. Across all modalities, orientation decoding was observed for letters and false fonts—but not objects—in posterior, but not prefrontal, ROIs (see section 5.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

Finally, we tested IIT's prediction that prefrontal regions do not contribute further information beyond that specified by posterior areas (or may even degrade performance by introducing noise)39. If PFC activity increased decoding accuracy, IIT would be challenged, whereas no improvement in decoding accuracy would align with both IIT and GNWT, as GNWT posits that PFC workspace neurons broadcast but do not add information. We compared the performance of decoders trained exclusively on posterior ROIs with those trained on posterior and prefrontal ROIs together (Extended Data Fig. 3c; see Methods). Across critical time-resolved methods (iEEG and MEG) and various PFC ROI definitions, adding prefrontal ROIs did not improve—and in some cases reduced—category and orientation decoding (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e and see section 5.1.3 in Supplementary Information for non-critical fMRI results). Bayesian testing confirmed these findings: we found strong evidence against increased decoding accuracy when including PFC ROIs for category decoding (face–object: iEEG BF01 = 1.94 × 104 and MEG BF01 = 3.05; letter–false font: iEEG BF01 = 1.91 × 105 and MEG BF01 = 4.70) and face orientation (iEEG BF01 = 1,205 and MEG BF01 = 3.26).

According to IIT, the network that specifies the content of consciousness in posterior cortex is actively maintained over the duration of the conscious experience (manipulated here via different stimulus durations). By contrast, GNWT predicts brief, content-specific ignition in PFC within 0.3–0.5 s after stimulus onset, as the workspace is updated12. Activity then decays back to baseline, with information maintained in a latent state, until another ignition marks the offset of the current percept and the onset of a new percept (for example, the fixation screen following stimulus offset). Thus, although the underlying brain responses (the workspace update) are temporally discrete (that is, an onset and an offset response), the conscious experience can be temporally continuous, spanning from one update to the next.

Following the preregistration27 (Extended Data Table 1), IIT would be challenged if sustained content-specific information and activation tracking stimulus duration were absent in the posterior cortex. GNWT would be challenged if transient prefrontal activation (at stimulus onset and offset) was not observed. These patterns were expected for at least one conscious feature (category, identity or orientation). We assessed activation strength as a function of stimulus duration and the informational content of this activation within theory-relevant ROIs. For IIT, both activation and information content were critical predictions, jointly determining result interpretation. For GNWT, activation was the primary measure owing to the difficulty of reliably detecting content-specific reinstatement at stimulus offset. The temporal predictions were tested in time-resolved iEEG and MEG data. We focused on the task-irrelevant condition as it best isolates neural activity related to consciousness while minimizing confounds (see sections 6.1 and 6.2.9 in Supplementary Information for task-relevant results).

First, we tested the predictions of the theories by investigating iEEG neural activation as a function of stimulus duration using linear mixed models (LMMs; see Methods) to model the time course of neural activity in the high gamma. Among the 31 patients included, 29.5% (194 of 657) of posterior ROI electrodes and 18.7% (123 of 655) of PFC ROI electrodes exhibited high gamma responses to stimuli (see section 6.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

In posterior cortex ROIs, 25 electrodes (out of 657) measured sustained activity tracking stimulus duration (Extended Data Table 3 for electrode localization and section 6.1.1 in Supplementary Information for results of the full model), consistent with IIT's (Fig. 3a). Of these, 12 electrodes tracked duration independent of stimulus category, primarily in early visual areas (for example, occipital pole; Fig. 3b), whereas 13 showed category-specific duration tracking (mostly for faces) in the ventral temporal cortex (for example, lateral fusiform gyrus; Fig. 3b). Overall, only a small proportion of electrodes exhibited both category selectivity and duration tracking—for example, just 15% (8 of 53) of face-selective electrodes showed sustained activity as predicted by IIT, suggesting a sparse neural substrate. These responses were mostly localized to the lateral fusiform gyrus, whereas the majority of face-selective electrodes displayed transient activations at stimulus onset across the striate, extrastriate and ventral areas (see section 6.1.2 in Supplementary Information).

The barplots (right) depict the average HG signal across sustained face-selective electrodes (n = 8) in 1.5-s trials, separated by category (faces in dark blue, objects in orange, letters in turquoise and false fonts in dark red) and theory-defined time windows (x axis).

Titles indicate the compared contrasts, and subtitles denote the ROIs. Matrix values represent z-scored, within-class-corrected correlation distances derived from a label shuffle null distribution. Contours denote significance (cluster-based permutation tests, P < 0.05, upper tail).

In PFC ROIs, 99 and 24 electrodes showed non-selective and category-selective onset responses, respectively (Fig. 3c). However, none of the 655 electrodes measured the temporal profile predicted by GNWT (that is, onset and offset). Bayesian analysis confirmed this result (BF01 > 3 for all electrodes in PFC ROIs), providing stronger evidence for either an intercept-only or a time-varying amplitude model over the GNWT model, with or without category interaction. This null result was not due to analysis limitations, as the LMM successfully detected the GNWT-predicted pattern in 10 electrodes in other ROIs (in the striate or extrastriate cortex; Fig. 3b). An exploratory decoding analysis of stimulus duration with unrestricted temporal profiles identified only one electrode, in the inferior frontal sulcus, showing the GNWT-predicted pattern, although with transient responses occurring earlier than expected (0.15 s post-onset and post-offset; Fig. 3c). Additional control analyses confirmed the IIT-predicted pattern in posterior ROIs and the absence of the GNWT-predicted pattern in PFC ROIs (see sections 6.2.1–6.2.3 in Supplementary Information).

We used LMMs to track gamma frequency band (60–90 Hz) power changes from the MEG source time series across posterior (15 parcels) and PFC (11 parcels) ROIs. Although signals were strong in posterior areas, none of the theory-based models adequately fit the data (BF01 > 3 for all parcels; see section 6.1.3.1 in Supplementary Information). We also examined alpha band activity (8–13 Hz), which negatively correlates with neural spiking activity40,41. Validation of theoretical predictions from iEEG and MEG data was inconclusive: no prefrontal iEEG electrodes showed the GNWT-predicted combination of an onset and offset response (BF01 > 3 for all prefrontal electrodes); instead, this pattern appeared in posterior sites and in MEG data, including the anterior cingulate cortex. However, the MEG results were sensitive to parameter choices, and signal leakage from posterior sites could not be ruled out (see sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.2 in Supplementary Information).

Next, we used cross-temporal representational similarity analysis (RSA) on both iEEG and MEG source data, within each theory-relevant ROI, to test the predictions of IIT and GNWT about the temporal profile of the maintenance of conscious content (Fig. 1a, middle panel): sustained versus phasic (onset and offset) representation for IIT and GNWT, respectively. This test was critical for IIT only. Results for faces and objects are presented below (see Extended Data Fig. 4 for similar results for letters–false fonts).

In iEEG, we calculated the correlation distance between high gamma activity patterns across 583 electrodes in posterior (npatients = 28) and 576 electrodes in PFC (npatients = 28) ROIs separately (see Methods). We analysed the 1.5-s duration trials because this condition provided the strongest contrast between the temporal profiles predicted by the theories.

In posterior cortex ROIs, cross-temporal RSA revealed sustained face–object categorical representation, with larger correlation distances between categories (face–objects) than within category (face, object; compare Fig. 3d, left, with Fig. 1a). The RSA matrix matched the IIT model better than the GNWT model (see section 6.3 in Supplementary Information for results of all contrasts).

In PFC ROIs, cross-temporal RSA revealed transient face–object categorical representation at stimulus onset, but not at stimulus offset. Consequently, no significant correlation was found with the GNWT onset and offset model (compare Fig. 3d, right, with the predicted pattern in Fig. 1a). This pattern held even for the task-relevant condition, in which face–object information was stronger, more stable and longer lasting. Additional evidence for the absence of GNWT-predicted patterns in PFC ROIs emerged from three control analyses using (1) feature selection, which improved RSA in PFC; (2) modified time-windows to account for a potential earlier ignition at stimulus offset; and (3) a decoding analysis time-locked to stimulus offset to enhance sensitivity (see section 6.4 in Supplementary Information). These results align with two independent studies using comparable methods42,43.

It has been argued that because conscious experiences are specific, the representation of identity and orientation are more stringent tests of the neural substrate of conscious experience44 than of category. We thus also evaluated the predictions of the theories on these dimensions.

In posterior ROIs, iEEG revealed sustained object identity information, with smaller distances for same-identity objects than for different identities (Fig. 3d). The IIT model significantly correlated with the observed RSA matrix, providing a better fit than the GNWT model. Similar results were found for letter and false-font identity, but not for faces (Extended Data Fig. 4). In PFC ROIs, identity information was absent for all categories across analysed time windows (Fig. 3d, objects). Face orientation information appeared weakly in posterior ROIs at stimulus onset but was not sustained, decaying after 0.5 s, contrary to the predictions of IIT. No face orientation information was detected in PFC ROIs (Fig. 3d). Finally, the predictions of neither theory were supported for category, identity or orientation by the MEG data (see section 6.5 for Supplementary Information).

IIT predicts sustained gamma-band connectivity within the posterior cortex, that is, between high-level and low-level sensory areas (V1/V2), throughout any conscious visual experience. By contrast, GNWT predicts brief, late-phase metastable connectivity (more than 0.25 s) with information sharing between the PFC and category-specific areas, manifested in long-range gamma-band or beta-band synchronization45.

On the basis of our preregistration (see Extended Data Table 1), IIT would be challenged in the absence of sustained content-specific synchronization between face–object selective areas and V1/V2; whereas a challenge for GNWT would be a lack of phasic connectivity (0.3–0.5 s) between category-selective areas and PFC. Given the dynamical nature of these predictions, iEEG and MEG provided the most informative empirical test. These predictions were tested by computing pairwise phase consistency (PPC)46 between each category-selective time series (face-selective and object-selective nodes) and either the V1/V2 or the PFC time series in the intermediate (1.0 s) and long-stimulus-duration (1.5 s), task-irrelevant trials (see section 7.1.2 in Supplementary Information for task-relevant trials). Gamma activity was analysed because of its close link to neuronal spiking47, which IIT considers a constituent property of the physical substrate of consciousness5.

For iEEG, we analysed connectivity between electrodes showing face and object selectivity, using a different subset of electrodes to test connectivity with V1/V2 and PFC (see Methods; Extended Data Fig. 5a for ROIs and examples of face-selective and object-selective electrodes). Given the sparse electrode coverage, the requirement to focus on ‘activated' electrodes (see Methods) was relaxed, although restricting it to only activated electrodes yielded similar results. We found increased category-selective synchrony between category-selective and V1/V2 electrodes (Extended Data Fig. 5b). These effects were early and brief (for example, less than 0.75 s), and restricted to low frequencies (2–25 Hz). This synchrony was mostly explained by the stimulus-evoked response (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These results fail to align with IIT's predictions: the activity was neither sustained nor observed in the gamma frequency band. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis (BF01 = 1.15–4.9). No content-selective PPC was found between face-selective and object-selective electrodes and PFC electrodes in the relevant time window, contradicting the prediction of GNWT (Extended Data Fig. 6a; BF01 = 2.62–5.32).

For MEG, we found selective synchronization between face-selective areas and both V1/V2 and PFC. These effects were again early, restricted to low frequencies (2–25 Hz), and mostly explained by stimulus-evoked responses (Extended Data Figs. 5d and 6b). Bayesian analysis of the gamma-band synchronization further supported the null hypothesis (all BF01 > 3).

The results of the preregistered PPC metric for prediction 3, critical for both IIT and the GNWT, supported neither theory. PPC was chosen based on the mechanistic considerations of the theories because it assesses oscillatory phase. However, phase estimation from macroscopic recordings is susceptible to noise.

We thus used dynamic functional connectivity (DFC; see Methods), a metric sensitive to co-modulations of signal amplitude, after removing stimulus-evoked responses (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d includes the evoked response).

In iEEG, we observed significant connectivity between object-selective electrodes and V1/V2 (Fig. 4a), spanning multiple frequency bands, with the gamma band being the most predominant. In contrast to the predictions of IIT, the observed connectivity was brief. Connectivity between face-selective electrodes and V1/V2 was scarce, further supported by Bayesian analysis (BF01 = 1.3 in favour of the null hypothesis). Significant connectivity was observed between PFC and both the face-selective and the object-selective areas in the gamma frequency band within the GNWT-predicted time window. For MEG, brief DFC in the alpha–beta frequency bands was found between face-selective nodes and both PFC and V1/V2 (Fig. 4b).

a, iEEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials revealed significant content-selective synchrony only for object-selective electrodes in V1/V2 (for example, top row; face-selective: npatients = 4 and nelectrodes = 30; object-selective: npatients= 4 and nelectrodes= 21), while showing significant content-selective synchrony for both categories in the PFC ROI (bottom row; face selective: npatients = 19 and nelectrodes = 81; object selective: npatients = 14 and nelectrodes = 57). Here and in panel b, significance was assessed using a cluster-based permutation analysis (P < 0.05, two-sided) and the colour bars represent the average change in the DFC between conditions. b, MEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials (n = 65) revealed significant content-selective synchrony below 25 Hz for the face-selective GED filter in both V1/V2 (top left) and PFC (bottom left), but not for the object-selective GED filter (right panels). c, fMRI generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI; n = 70) on task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials combined revealed significant content-selective connectivity when FFA is used as the analysis seed. Various significant regions showing task-related connectivity with the FFA seed were observed including V1/V2, right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere. d, Analysis of iEEG face-selective DFC synchrony across tasks is shown at the single-electrode level in PFC (top) and V1/V2 (bottom) ROIs. Electrodes showing significant synchrony (tested using a permutation test, FDR-corrected, P < 0.05) in relevant (orange-red), irrelevant (purple) or combined relevant and irrelevant (black) trials are shown (averaged over 70–120 Hz and 0–0.5-s time window). DFC synchrony was observed in both tasks, but restricted to IFG for the GNWT analysis and V2 regions for the IIT analysis, consistent with the fMRI gPPI analysis shown in panel c. Brain surfaces in panels c,d are from Freesurfer.

The exploratory DFC results in iEEG were consistent with the predictions of GNWT while challenging the predictions of IIT, as connectivity with V1/V2 was not sustained. However, V1/V2 were sparsely sampled in our population, with only 12 electrodes localized to V1/V2 compared with 472 in PFC.

Using fMRI, we evaluated connectivity across the entire cortex with homogeneous sampling. We computed the generalized psychophysiological interaction, defining the fusiform face area (FFA) and lateral occipital complex as seed regions (see Methods). Task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were pooled to increase statistical power (see sections 7.1.1 and 12 in Supplementary Information for separate preregistered analyses). FFA showed content selective (face > object stimuli) connectivity with V1/V2, inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus, consistent with predictions from both theories (Fig. 4c). No selective increase in interareal connectivity between object-selective nodes and PFC or V1/V2 was found in fMRI, even when separating task conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Bayesian testing across prefrontal ROIs confirmed our findings with 62–94% of voxels across ROIs showing substantial evidence for the null hypothesis of no interareal connectivity (BF01 = 3–7.75). Support for the alternative hypothesis was observed only in 0–4% of voxels. The remaining voxels showed inconclusive evidence.

To determine whether connectivity to PFC and V1/V2 was task driven in the generalized psychophysiological interaction, we explored the iEEG data, separating task-relevant and irrelevant trials. We found task-independent, selective DFC connectivity (face > objects) for face-selective electrodes in both inferior frontal gyrus and V1/V2 (Fig. 4d).

This adversarial collaboration aimed to address confirmation biases by researchers, breaking theoretical echo chambers3 and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of theories2,48 by forcing them to be explicit and committal about their empirical predictions, rigorously testing them on common methodological grounds22,49, and providing the means for theorists to change their minds given conflicting results49. Doing so catalyses our ability to evaluate and arbitrate between theories of consciousness. Embracing this spirit, and adhering to guidelines for structuring adversarial collaborations21, we opted for a three-voice discussion format, acknowledging that despite stringent testing of incompatible theoretical views, different interpretations of the same evidence may persist. Below, the theory-neutral consortium presents the main challenges our findings pose to the theories, based on the preregistered predictions, methods and analysis agreed on in advance with the adversaries. Then, adversaries offer their own interpretation of the findings and future directions (see sections 12 and 13 in Supplementary Information).

Extended Data Fig. 7 summarizes the key results, including the criteria used to assess whether findings support or contradict the theories. This summary covers both central and peripheral findings related to theory evaluation. The consortium adopted Lakatos' sophisticated falsificationist approach to philosophy of science13,50, emphasizing that challenged predictions provide more valuable insights than those confirmed by the data (see section 11 in Supplementary Information). Outcomes are weighted differentially across predictions and with respect to the different brain imaging modalities (Extended Data Table 1). This approach ensures a nuanced evaluation of the theories, highlighting areas of strength and those requiring further refinement.

For IIT, the lack of sustained synchronization within posterior cortex represents the most direct challenge, based on our preregistration. This is incompatible with IIT's claim that the state of the neural network, including its activity and connectivity, specifies the degree and content of consciousness5. Although this null result could stem from methodological limitations (for example, limited iEEG sampling of V1/V2 areas), our multimodal and highly powered study provided the best conditions so far for evaluating the prediction. We urge IIT proponents to direct future efforts to evaluate this prediction and determine the implications of this failure.

More broadly, although IIT passed the predefined criteria for the duration prediction (number 2), there was no evidence for a sustained representation of orientation, despite being a property of the consciously perceived stimuli25. This is an informative challenge for IIT, as orientation decoding was robust across all three data modalities, leaving open the question of whether and how information about orientation is maintained over time.

For GNWT, the most substantial challenge based on our preregistered criteria pertains to its account for the maintenance of a conscious percept over time and, in particular, the lack of ignition at stimulus offset. This result is unlikely to stem from sensitivity limitations, as offset responses were robustly found elsewhere (for example, visual areas); and in PFC, strong onset responses were found to the very same stimuli. The lack of ignition at stimulus offset is especially surprising given the change in conscious experience at the onset of the blank fixation screen. This clear update to the content of consciousness should have been represented somehow by the global workspace12. Thus, that aspect of consciousness remains unexplained within the GNWT framework.

Another key challenge for GNWT pertains to representing the contents of experience: although we found representation of category in PFC irrespective of the task, thereby demonstrating the sensitivity of our methods, no representation of identity was found, and representation of orientation was evident only in MEG (signal leakage notwithstanding); although these dimensions were clearly a part of the conscious experience of participants of the stimuli. This raises the question of whether PFC is involved in broadcasting all conscious content, as predicted by GNWT23, or only a subset (for example, abstract concepts and categories, rather than low-level details), in which case the role of PFC in consciousness might need to be redefined.

Before this study, predictions from IIT and GNWT were typically tested with one data modality at a time23,24, leaving room for negative results to be easily attributed to the limitations of the chosen modality51. We combined multiple techniques (iEEG, MEG and fMRI) to mitigate these limitations, cross-compensating for their weaknesses. This methodological approach was mutually agreed upon by the theory leaders before data collection and results disclosure as the most powerful and conclusive approach, making both positive and negative findings more meaningful.

Although this study was designed around IIT and GNWT, the results may have implications for other theories of consciousness. For example, the prediction of GNWT about PFC is shared by those higher-order theories of consciousness that hypothesize that PFC actually supplies the content of visual consciousness (for example, ref. 17), rather than those that take it to merely enable the consciousness of content that is located in posterior visual areas (for example, refs. 52,53). As a result, the failures to confirm this prediction challenge not only GNWT but also those higher-order theories54. Predictions 2 and 3, about timing and connectivity, are more distinctive to GNWT but could also be shared by other theories. Likewise, the non-core prediction 1 about the posterior cortex by IIT is also shared by many theories (for example, recurrent processing theory14), and its prediction 2 about timing may be shared by some posterior theories of consciousness, such as the local recurrency theory15. Its prediction 3 about interareal connectivity is more distinctive to IIT (for example, it is not shared by synchrony theory55), so the challenge here is more specific as well.

Our study focused on the contents of consciousness (for example, category, identity, orientation and duration), linking brain activity to subjective phenomenology. This departs from the traditional contrastive method, which compares the presence and absence of consciousness but conflates it with other cognitive processes (for example, decision-making or memory formation)56,57,58. Some might argue that our approach tracks stimulus processing rather than consciousness. Yet, our aim is to challenge and potentially falsify50,59 IIT and GNWT, by examining where their predictions differ, rather than to discover the neural correlates of consciousness. In this context, what might seem like a weakness—focusing on the presence of fully attended, consciously experienced stimuli—is actually beneficial for testing the primary positive predictions of the theories and their failures. This is because such failures are harder to dismiss owing to weak signals. Thus, our approach assesses whether the proposed neural mechanisms are truly necessary for consciousness.

Our study, although comprehensive, is not without limitations. First, we cannot entirely rule out residual task engagement with respect to category, although our design ensured that orientation and duration remained task-irrelevant, so the results on these dimensions cannot be explained by task-related effects. Second, although we aimed to capture multiple aspects of consciousness, our approach still falls short of encompassing its full phenomenal richness. Third, despite the high spatial and temporal resolution of our data, it lacks single-unit recordings, which are typically restricted to patients with epilepsy and selected brain regions. Ongoing studies in animal models, as part of a separate adversarial collaboration, can accordingly complement our findings.

Beyond directly challenging the theories, our study raises broader questions about theory testing and development across disciplines. A key challenge is how to weigh predictions and integrate evidence across different analyses and measurement techniques (for example, fMRI, MEG and iEEG). We adopted a lenient falsificationist approach, in which evidence for any tested feature (for example, decoding of category or orientation) was sufficient to rule out failure, rather than requiring consistency across all features. However, a formal framework is urgently needed to quantitatively integrate evidence, accounting for prediction centrality, measurement error and cross-sample consistency. Such a framework would enhance systematic theory building in an era of accumulating results60.

After reviewing the results and the discussions by adversaries, readers might expect a definitive verdict on the two theories under evaluation. Instead, we invite readers to weigh the evidence themselves—considering the support for each preregistered prediction, the breadth of the data, the sophistication of the methods and analyses, and the cognitive biases that shape interpretation. Scientific progress is rarely a matter of simple verdicts; evidence is filtered through previous beliefs and motivations61, making theory evaluation a dynamic process. By presenting results and adversarial responses transparently, we embrace the openness needed for science to converge on robust explanations of complex phenomena such as consciousness.

The experiment was approved by the institutional ethics committees of each participating data-collecting laboratory, including the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Ethical Review Committee at the Centre for Human Brain Research, University of Birmingham (ERN_18-0226AP20); the Committee for Protecting Human and Animal Subjects at the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University (2020-05-07e); the Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Donders Institute (NL45659.091.14); the Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Board at Yale School of Medicine (2000027591); the Office of Science and Research Institutional Review Board at New York University Langone Health (i14-02101_CR6); the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board at Children's Hospital Corporation d/b/a Boston Children's Hospital (04-05-065R); the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (ID: 2017-1299); and the Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics (Nr. 2017_12). All participants and patients provided oral and written informed consent before participating in the study. All study procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were also informed that clinical care was not affected by participation in the study.

Healthy participants and patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy participated in this study. The datasets reported here consist of: (1) behaviour, eye tracking and iEEG data collected at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at New York University (NYU) Langone Health, the Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Boston Children's Hospital (Harvard), and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (WU). (2) Behaviour, eye tracking, MEG and EEG data collected at the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH) of the University of Birmingham (UB), and at the Center for MRI Research of Peking University (PKU). (3) Behaviour, eye tracking and fMRI data collected at the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) and at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (DCCN), of Radboud University Nijmegen. For both the MEG and fMRI datasets, one-third of the data that passed quality tests (henceforth, the optimization dataset; see the section ‘Preregistration' for details about quality test criteria27) were used to optimize the analysis methods, which were subsequently added to the preregistration as an additional amendment. These preregistered analyses were then run on the remaining two-thirds of the data (henceforth, the replication dataset) and constitute the data reported in the main study. This procedure was not used for the iEEG data due to the serendipitous nature of the recording and electrode placement, the rarity of this type of data and the increased difficulty of data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 97 healthy participants were included in the MEG sample (mean age of 22.79 ± 3.59 years, 54 females, all right handed), 32 of those datasets were included in the optimization phase (mean age of 22.50 ± 3.43 years, 19 females, all right handed), and 65 in the replication sample (mean age of 22.93 ± 3.66, 35 females, all right handed). Five additional participants were excluded from the MEG dataset: two because of failure to meet predefined behavioural criteria (that is, Hits of less than 80% and/or False Alarms > 20%), two because of excessive noise from sensors, and one because of incorrect sensor reconstruction. A total of 108 healthy participants were included in the fMRI sample (mean age of 23.28 ± 3.46 years, 70 females, 105 right handed); 35 of those datasets were included in the optimization sample (mean age of 23.26  ±  3.64 years, 21 females, 34 right handed) and 73 in the replication sample (mean age of 23.29 ± 3.37, 49 females, 71 right handed). Twelve additional participants were excluded from the fMRI dataset: eight because of motion artefacts, two because of insufficient coverage and two because of incomplete data (with respect to these last two participants, see section 14 of the Supplementary Information for deviations from the preregistration document). For the iEEG arm of the project, a total of 34 patients were recruited. Two patients were excluded owing to incomplete data. Demographic, medical and neuropsychological scores for each patient, when available, are reported in Supplementary Table 25. Three iEEG patients whose behaviour fell slightly short of the predefined behavioural criteria (that is Hits of less than 70%, FA > 30%) were nonetheless included given the difficulty of obtaining additional iEEG data (see section 14 in Supplementary Information for deviation from the preregistration).

To test critical predictions of the theories, five experimental manipulations were included in the experimental design: (1) four stimulus categories (faces, objects, letters and false fonts), (2) 20 stimulus identities (20 different exemplars per stimulus category), (3) three stimulus orientations (front, left and right view), (4) three stimulus durations (0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s), and (5) task relevance (relevant targets, relevant non-targets and irrelevant).

Stimulus category, stimulus identity and stimulus orientation served to test predictions about the representation of the content of consciousness in different brain areas by the theories. In addition, stimulus duration served to test predictions about the temporal dynamics of sustained conscious percepts and interareal synchronization between areas. Task relevance served to rule out the effect of task demands, as opposed to conscious perception per se, on the observed effects62. This aspect of the experimental design was inspired by ref. 63.

Four stimulus categories were used: faces, objects, letters and false fonts. These stimuli naturally fell into two clearly distinct groups: pictures (faces and objects) and symbols (letters and false fonts). These natural couplings were aimed at creating a clear difference between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli in each trial block (see the section ‘Procedure'). All stimuli covered a squared aperture at an average visual angle of 6° by 6°. Face stimuli were created with FaceGen Modeler 3.1; letter and false font stimuli were generated with MAXON CINEMA 4D Studio (RC - R20) 20.059; object stimuli were taken from the Object Databank64. Stimuli were grey scaled and equated for luminance and size. To facilitate face individuation, faces had different hairstyles and belonged to different ethnicities and genders. Equal proportions of male and female faces were presented. The orientation of the stimuli was manipulated, such that half of the stimuli from each category had a side view (30° and −30° horizontal viewing angle, left and right orientation) and the other half had a front view (0°).

Participants performed a non-speeded target detection task (see Supplementary Video 1). The experiment was divided into runs, with four blocks in each run (see the section ‘Trial counts'). On a given block, participants viewed a sequence of single, supra-threshold, foveally presented stimuli belonging to one of four stimulus categories and presented for one of three stimulus durations onto a fixation cross that was present throughout the experiment. Within each block, half of the stimuli were task-relevant and half were task-irrelevant. To manipulate task relevance, at the beginning of each block participants were instructed to detect the rare occurrences of two target stimulus identities, one from each relevant category (for pictures, face–object; for symbols, letter–false font), irrespective of their orientation. This was specified by presenting the instruction ‘detect face A and object B' or ‘detect letter C and false font D', accompanied by images for each target (see Fig. 1d). Targets did not repeat across blocks. Each run contained two blocks of the face–object task and two blocks of the letter–false font task, with block order counterbalanced across runs.

Accordingly, each block contained three different trial types: (1) targets: the two stimuli being detected (for example, the specific face and object identities); (2) task-relevant stimuli: all other stimuli from the task-relevant categories (for example, the non-target faces–objects); and (3) task-irrelevant stimuli: all stimuli from the two other categories (for example, letters–false fonts). An advantage of this design is that the three trial types enabled a differentiation of neural responses related to task goal, task relevance and simply consciously seeing a stimulus. We confirmed that participants were conscious of the stimuli in both the task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials in a separate experiment, which included a surprise memory test (see section 3 in Supplementary Information).

Stimuli were presented for one of three durations (0.5 s, 1.0 s or 1.5 s), followed by a blank period of a variable duration to complete an overall trial length fixed at 2.0 s. For the MEG and iEEG version, random jitter was added at the end of each trial (mean inter-trial interval of 0.4 s, jittered 0.2–2.0 s, truncated exponential distribution) to avoid periodic presentation of the stimuli. The mean trial length was 2.4 s. For the fMRI protocol, timing was adjusted as follows: the random jitter between trials was increased (mean inter-trial interval of 3 s, jittered 2.5–10 s, with truncated exponential distribution), with each trial lasting approximately 5.5 s. This modification helped with avoiding non-linearities in BOLD signal, which may affect fMRI decoding65. Second, to increase detection efficacy for amplitude-based analyses, three additional baseline periods (blank screen) of 12 s each were included per run (total of 24). The identity of the stimuli was randomized with the constraint that they appeared equally across durations and tasks conditions. Participants were further instructed to maintain central fixation on a black circle with a white cross and another black circle in the middle throughout each trial (see Supplementary Fig. 1d and Supplementary Video 1 for a demonstration of the experimental paradigm).

The MEG study consisted of 10 runs containing 4 blocks each with 34–38 trials per block, 32 non-targets (8 per category) and 2–6 targets, for a total of 1,440 trials. The same design was used for iEEG, but with half the runs (5 runs total), resulting in a total of 720 trials. For fMRI, there were 8 runs containing 4 blocks each with 17–19 trials per block, 16 non-targets (4 per category) and 1–3 targets, for a total of 576 trials. Rest breaks between runs and blocks were included.

The task was run on Matlab (PKU: R2018b; DCCN, UB and Yale: R2019b; Harvard: R2020b; NYU: R2020a, and WU: 2021a) using Psychtoolbox (v3)66. The iEEG version of the task was run on a Dell Precision 5540 laptop, with a 15.6′′ Ultrasharp screen at NYU and Harvard and on a Dell D29M PC with an Acer 19.1′′ screen in WU. Participants responded using an eight-button response box (Millikey LH-8; response hand (or hands) varied based on the setting in the patient's room). The MEG version was run on a custom PC at UB and a Dell XPS desktop PC on PKU. Stimuli were displayed on a screen placed in front of the participants with a PROPixx DLP LED projector (VPixx Technologies). Participants responded with both hands using two 5-button response boxes (NAtA or SINORAD). The fMRI version was run on an MSI laptop at Yale and a Dell Desktop PC at DCCN. In DCCN, stimuli were presented on an MRI compatible Cambridge Research Systems BOLD screen 32′′ IPS LCD monitor, and in Yale they were presented on a Psychology Software Tools Hyperion projection system to project stimuli on the mirror fixed to the head coil. Participants responded with their right hand using a 2 × 2 current designs response box at Yale and a 1 × 4 current designs response box at DCCN.

For the iEEG setup, eye tracking and pupillometry data were collected using a EyeLink 1000 Plus in remote mode, sampled monocularly at 500 Hz (from the left eye at WU, and depending on the setup at Harvard), or on a Tobii-4C eye tracker, sampled binocularly at 90 Hz (NYU). The MEG and fMRI laboratories used the MEG-compatible and fMRI-compatible EyeLink 1000 Plus Eye-tracker system (SR Research) to collect data at 1,000 Hz. For MEG, eye tracking data were acquired binocularly. For fMRI, data were acquired monocularly from either the left or the right eye, in DCCN and Yale, respectively. For all recordings, a 9-point calibration was performed (besides Harvard, where a 13-point calibration was used) at the beginning of the experiment, and recalibration was carried out as needed at the beginning of each block or run.

Brain activity was recorded with a combination of intracranial subdural platinum-iridium electrodes embedded in SILASTIC sheets (2.3-mm diameter contacts, Ad-Tech Medical Instrument and PMT Corporation) and/or depth stereo-electroencephalographic platinum-iridium electrodes (PMT Corporation; 0.8 mm in diameter, 2.0-mm length cylinders; separated from adjacent contacts by 1.5–2.43 mm), or depth stereo-electroencephalographic platinum-iridium electrodes (BF08R-SP21X-0C2, Ad-Tech Medical; 1.28 mm in diameter, 1.57 mm in length, 3–5.5-mm spacing). Electrodes were arranged as grid arrays (either 8 × 8 with 10-mm centre-to-centre spacing, 8 × 16 contacts with 3-mm spacing, or hybrid macro–micro 8 × 8 contacts with 10-mm spacing and 64 integrated microcontacts with 5-mm spacing), linear strips (1 × 8/12 contacts), depth electrodes (1 × 8/12 contacts) or a combination thereof. Recordings from grid, strip and depth electrode arrays were done using a Natus Quantum amplifier or a Neuralynx Atlas amplifier. A total of 4,057 electrodes (892 grids, 346 strips and 2,819 depths) were implanted across 32 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing clinically motivated invasive monitoring. A total of 3,512 electrodes (780 grids, 307 strips and 2,425 depths) that were unaffected by epileptic activity, artefacts or electrical noise were used in subsequent analyses. To determine the electrode localization for each patient, a post-operative computed tomography scan and a pre-operative T1 MRI were acquired and co-registered.

MEG was acquired using a 306-sensor TRIUX MEGIN system, comprising 204 planar gradiometres and 102 magnetometres in a helmet-shaped array. The MEG gantry was positioned at 68° for optimal coverage of frontal and posterior brain areas. Simultaneous EEG was recorded using an integrated EEG system and a 64-channel electrode cap (EEG data are not reported here, but are included in the shared dataset). During acquisition, MEG and EEG data were bandpass filtered (0.01 and 330 Hz) and sampled at 1,000 Hz. The location of the head fiducials, the shape of the head, the positions of the 64 EEG electrodes and the head position indicator (HPI) coil locations relative to anatomical landmarks were collected with a 3D digitizer system (Polhemus Isotrack). ECG was recorded with a set of bipolar electrodes placed on the chest of the participant. Two sets of bipolar electrodes were placed around the eyes (two at the outer canthi of the right and left eyes and two above and below the centre of the right eye) to record eye movements and blinks (EOG). Ground and reference electrodes were placed on the back of the neck and on the right cheek, respectively. The head position of participants on the MEG system was measured at the beginning and end of each run, and also before and after each resting period, using four HPI coils placed on the EEG cap, next to the left and right mastoids and over left and right frontal areas.

For source localization of the MEG data with individual realistic head modelling, a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI volume (3 T Siemens MRI Prisma scanner) was acquired per participant. Anatomical scans were acquired either with a 32-channel coil (repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2,000/2.03 ms; inversion time (TI) = 880 ms; 8° flip angle; field of view = 256 × 256 × 208 mm; 208 slices; 1-mm isotropic voxels, UB) or a 64-channel coil (TR/TE = 2,530/2.98 ms; TI = 1,100 ms; 7° flip angle; field of view = 224 × 256 × 192 mm, 192 slice, 0.5 × 0.5 × 1 mm voxels, PKU). The FreeSurfer standard template was used (fsaverage) for participants lacking an anatomical scan (n = 5).

MRI data were acquired using a 32-channel head coil on a 3 T Prisma scanner. A session included high-resolution anatomical T1-weighted MPRAGE images (GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2, TR/TE = 2,300/3.03 ms, 8° flip angle, 192 slices, 1-mm isotropic voxels), and a whole-brain T2*-weighted multiband-4 sequence (TR/TE = 1,500/39.6 ms, 75° flip angle, 68 slices, voxel size of 2 mm isotropic, anterior/posterior (A/P) phase-encoding direction, field of view = 210 mm, bandwith (BW) = 2,090 Hz px−1). A single-band reference image was acquired before each run. To correct for susceptibility distortions, additional scans using the same T2*-weighted sequence, but with inverted phase-encoding direction (inverted readout/phase-encoding (RO/PE) polarity), were collected while the participant was resting at multiple points throughout the experiment.

For readability, we first detail the preprocessing protocols for each of the modalities (iEEG, MEG and fMRI) separately. Then, we describe the different analyses, combining information across the modalities, while noting any differences between them.

As part of our testing framework, after excluding a limited number of participants due to data quality checks, we conducted an initial optimization phase on one-third of the MEG (n = 32) and fMRI (n = 35) datasets to evaluate data quality across sites and to optimize analysis pipelines. Following the optimization phase, pipelines were preregistered27 and applied to the novel datasets containing twice as much data (MEG n = 65 and fMRI n = 73).

In the main paper, we report results obtained on the novel, previously unexamined datasets. For iEEG, given the smaller sample, a different analysis strategy was implemented. We refer the reader to the iEEG methods section and text in the main paper for numbers of participants that were entered in each analysis. Results from the optimization phase are reported in section 4 of Supplementary Information. The results of the optimization phase and the preregistered replication phase were compared and deemed to be largely compatible, with some minor exceptions (section 4 of Supplementary Information).

Data were converted to BIDS67 and preprocessed using MNE-Python (v0.24)68, and custom-written functions in Python and Matlab. Preprocessing steps included downsampling to 512 Hz, detrending, bad channel rejection, line noise and harmonic removal, and re-referencing. Electrodes were re-referenced to a Laplacian scheme69, whereas bipolar referencing was used for electrodes at the edge of a strip, grid or stereo EEG, and the signal was localized at the midpoint (Euclidean distance) between the two electrodes. Electrodes with no direct neighbours were discarded. Seizure-onset zone electrodes, those localized outside the brain and/or containing no signal or high amplitude noise level were discarded. Line noise and harmonics were removed using a one-pass, zero-phase non-causal band-stop FIR filter.

The high-gamma power (70–150 Hz) was obtained by bandpass filtering the raw signal in eight successive 10-Hz-wide frequency bands, computing the envelope using a standard Hilbert transform, and normalizing it (dividing) by the mean power per frequency band across the entire recording. To produce a single high-gamma envelope time series, all frequency bands were averaged together70. Most analyses focused on the high-gamma power as it closely correlated with neural spiking activity71 and with the BOLD signal37. To obtain the event-related potentials (ERPs), the raw signal was low-pass-filtered at 30 Hz with a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal low-pass FIR filter. Epochs were segmented between 1-s pre-stimulus until 2.5-s post-stimulus of interest.

Electrode positions were determined based on a computed tomography scan coregistered with a pre-implant T1-weighted MRI. A 3D reconstruction of the brain of each patient was computed using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). For visualization, the electrode positions for individual participants were converted to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)152 space. As each theory specified a set of anatomical ROIs, after electrode localization, electrodes were labelled according to the Freesurfer-based Destrieux atlas segmentation72,73 and/or Wang atlas segmentation74.

To identify task-responsive electrodes, we computed the area under the curve (AUC) for the baseline (−0.3 to 0 s) and the stimulus-evoked period (0.05–0.35 s) separately for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions, and compared them per electrode using a Wilcoxon sign-rank test, corrected for false discovery rate (FDR)75. A Bayesian t-test76 was used to quantify evidence for non-responsiveness.

To determine category selectivity for faces, objects, letters and false fonts in the high gamma, we followed the method of Kadipasaoglu and colleagues77. Per category, we computed a d′ (AUC of 0.05–0.4 s) comparing the activation between the category of interest (uj) and each of the other categories (ui), normalized by the standard deviation of each category:

A permutation test (10,000 permutations) was used to evaluate significance. d′ was computed for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions separately. An electrode was considered selective if it showed selectivity on both tasks.

Owing to the sparse and highly variable coverage of iEEG data, all collected electrodes were combined into a ‘super participant' multivariate analyses (RSA and decoding). To create a single-trial matrix for the super participant, we equated the trial matrices of all our participants by subsampling to the lowest number of trials in the relevant conditions. Participants that did not complete the full experiment were discarded (n = 3), resulting in a total of 29 participants with 583 electrodes in posterior ROIs and 576 electrodes in prefrontal ROIs. For analyses on stimuli identities, stimuli that were presented less than three times to any of the participants across intermediate and long trials in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were discarded. We then subsampled the trials for each identity to three trials per participant. The subsampling procedure was repeated 100 times to avoid random fluctuations induced by the subsampling. The analysis was computed for each repetition and average across repetitions.

The MEG data were converted to BIDS78 using MNE-BIDS79, and preprocessed following the FLUX Pipeline80 in MNE-Python (v0.24.0)68. Preprocessing steps included MEG sensor reconstruction using a semi-automatic detection algorithm and signal-space separation81 to reduce environmental artefacts. FastICA82 was used to detect and remove cardiac and ocular components from the data for each participant (mean = 2.90 components, s.d. = 0.92). Before ICA, data were segmented, and segments containing muscle artefacts were removed. After preprocessing, data were epoched into 3.5-s segments (1-s pre-stimulus to 2.5-s post-stimulus onset). Trials in which gradiometre values exceeded 5,000 fT cm−1, magnetometres exceeded 5,000 fT and/or the trial contained muscle artefacts were rejected from the MEG dataset. Finally, to be included in the analyses, participants should have a minimum of 30 clean trials per condition. No participants were excluded because of not meeting this criterion.

MEG source modelling was performed using the dynamic statistical parametric mapping method83, based on depth-weighted minimum-norm estimates (MNEs)84,85, on epoched and baseline (−0.5 s to 0 s before stimulus onset) corrected data. To build a forward model, the MRI images were manually aligned to the digitized head shape. A single shell boundary elements model was constructed in MNE-Python based on the inner skull surface derived from FreeSurfer72,73, to create a volumetric forwards model (5-mm grid) covering the full-brain volume. The lead field matrix was then calculated according to the head position with respect to the MEG sensor array. A noise covariance matrix for the baseline and a covariance matrix for the active time window were calculated and the combined (that is, sum) covariance matrix was used with the forwards model to create a common spatial filter. Data were spatially pre-whitened using the covariance matrix from the baseline interval to combine gradiometre and magnetometre data86.

Source DICOM data were converted to BIDS using BIDScoin (v3.6.3)87. This includes converting DICOM data to NIfTI using dcm2niix88 and creating event files using custom Python codes. BIDS compliance of the resulting dataset was controlled using BIDS-Validator. Subsequently, MRI data quality control was performed using MRIQC (0.16.1)89 and custom scripts for data rejection. All (f)MRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep (20.2.3)90, based on Nipype (1.6.1)91. For further details on the fMRIprep pipeline, see preregistration. Custom scripts used NumPy (1.19.2)92 and Pandas (1.1.3)93.

Additional, analysis-specific, fMRI data preprocessing was performed using FSL 6.0.2 (FMRIB Software Library)94, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 12) software95, and custom Python scripts (using NiBabel (3.2.2)96 and SciPy (1.8.0)97 after the above-outlined general preprocessing. Functional data for univariate data analyses were spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel with full-width at half-maximum of 5 mm), grand mean scaled and temporal high-pass filtered (128 s). No spatial smoothing was applied for multivariate analyses.

We modelled BOLD signal responses to the experimental variables by fitting voxel-wise general linear model (GLM) to the data of each run using FSL FEAT. The following regressors were modelled in an event-related approach, with event duration corresponding to the stimulus duration (that is, 0.5 s, 1.0 s and 1.5 s), and convolved with a double gamma haemodynamic response function: 12 regressors of interest (targets, task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli per stimulus category, that is, faces, objects, letters and false fonts; and a regressors of no interest, that is, target screen display). We included the first-order temporal derivatives of the regressors of interest, and a set of nuisance regressors: 24 motion regressors (FMRIB Software Library (FSL)'s standard + extended set of motion parameters) plus a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a white matter (WM) tissue regressor. Each of the 12 regressors of interest was contrasted against an implicit baseline (used in the putative Neural Correlates of Consciousness analysis; see below). In addition, we obtained contrast of parameter estimates for ‘relevant faces versus relevant objects', ‘relevant letters versus relevant false fonts', ‘irrelevant faces versus irrelevant objects', ‘irrelevant letters versus irrelevant false fonts' (used for the definition of decoding ROIs), ‘relevant and irrelevant faces versus relevant and irrelevant objects' and ‘all stimuli versus baseline' (used for the definition of seeds for the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis). Data were averaged across runs per participant using FSL's fixed-effects analysis and subsequently averaged across participants using FSL's FLAME1 mixed-effect analysis. Gaussian random-field cluster thresholding was used to correct for multiple comparisons, using the default settings of FSL, with a cluster formation threshold of one-sided P < 0.001 (z ≥ 3.1) and a cluster significance threshold of P < 0.05.

ROIs were defined a priori in consultation with the adversarial theories. They were determined per participant based on the Destrieux atlas73 including both hemispheres, and then resampled to standard MNI space (see Supplementary Table 26). For the connectivity analysis, areas V1/V2 (combining dorsal and ventral) were defined based on the Wang cortical parcellation74. For details on the process of selecting the ROIs and the justification of the ROI selection in the context of this study, see section 10 in Supplementary Information. All anatomical segmentations were performed using Freesurfer (6.0.1)72.

Log-linear-corrected d′ (ref. 98), false alarms and reaction times were computed per category and stimulus duration, separately (false alarms were also calculated per task relevance, without duration) and per modality (iEEG, MEG and fMRI). These measures were compared with linear–logistic mixed models, where appropriate. For the former, we report analysis of variance omnibus F-tests, and for the latter, omnibus χ2 test from an analysis of deviance. We approximated degrees of freedom using the Satterthwaite method99. Pairwise t-tests following significant interactions were Bonferroni corrected. To estimate Bayesian information criterion (BIC) differences between the original and null logistic models, we used the P values and sample size100 (p_to_bf package in R).

For Eyelink, gaze and pupil data were segmented, and trials with missing data were excluded. Blinks were detected using the Hershman algorithm101, and removed with 200-ms padding102. The Eyelink standard parser algorithm was used for saccade and fixation detection. Saccades were further corroborated using the Engbert and Kliegl103 algorithm. Fixations were baseline corrected (−0.25 s to 0 s). Mean fixation distance, mean blink rate, mean saccade amplitude and mean pupil size were compared in a LMM with category and task relevance as fixed effects, and participant and item as random effects. Separate analyses were carried out on the first 0.5 s after stimulus onset including all trials; and on the 1.5-s trials including time window (0–0.5 s, 0.5–1.0 s and 1.0–1.5 s) as fixed effects. BIC was used to test the models against the null hypothesis models. For Tobii, gaze coordinate data were segmented, missing data were excluded and coordinates were baseline corrected to depict heatmaps of patients' gaze. Of note, the coordinate data were not added to the LMMs due to its poorer quality with respect to the EyeLink data.

All decoding analyses were performed using a linear support vector machine (SVM; scikit learn (0.23.2), https://scikit-learn.org/) classifier. Below, we explain how this was done for each one of the predictions.

iEEG decoding was done on the high-gamma signal, averaged over non-overlapping windows of 0.02 s separately for electrodes located in the GNWT and IIT ROIs. The top 200 electrodes (selectKbest104), as determined by a F-test within a given set of electrodes from the theory ROIs, were used as features for the classifier. Two-hundred features were selected to provide a balance between model optimization (for example, feature selection) and participant representation (for example, electrodes or features coming from multiple participants). Statistical significance of decoding performance was assessed via permutation test, randomly permuting the sample labels and repeating the decoding analysis 1,000 times, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-based correction (cluster mass inference with cluster forming threshold at P < 0.05)105,106. Also, to assess the decoding accuracy within unique ROIs (for example, S_temporal_sup of the Destrieux atlas), separate classifiers were trained using all electrodes in a given parcel. Each classifier was fitted using all electrodes in a parcel and time window (GNWT: 0.3–0.5 s, IIT: 0.3–1.5 s) as features, resulting in a single accuracy value per parcel. SelectKbest (200 features for iEEG) feature selection and fivefold cross-validation with three repetitions was used. To assess the statistical significance of the decoding accuracy within unique ROIs (so only one accuracy score is obtained per ROI), P values obtained via permutation tests were corrected for multiple comparisons across all ROIs using FDR correction (q ≤ 0.0575). To compute Bayes factors on the decoding accuracy values, we used a β-binomial approach that compares the marginal likelihood under a point-null hypothesis against a flat \(B(\alpha =1,\,\beta =1)\) alternative prior, yielding an analytic Bayes factor. We then derived the null hypothesis parameters from the empirical null distribution by updating a tight prior centred at chance level (\(B(\alpha =1,000,\,\beta =1,000)\)) with the shuffle-based accuracies, thereby incorporating any bias present in the null distribution.

MEG decoding was done on bandpass-filtered (1–40 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz) data. The reconstructed source-level MEG data within a subset of the predefined anatomical ROIs (GNWT: ‘G_and_S_cingul-Ant', ‘G_and_S_cingul-Mid-Ant', ‘G_and_S_cingul-Mid-Post', ‘G_front_middle', ‘S_front_inf', ‘S_front_sup'; IIT: ‘G_cuneus', ‘G_oc-temp_lat-fusifor', ‘G_oc-temp_med-Lingual', ‘Pole_occipital', ‘S_calcarine', ‘S_oc_sup_and_transversal', as they showed high response to the stimulus on the optimization dataset) were extracted for further analysis (500 vertices and 800 vertices per hemisphere for each of the anatomical ROI defined by the theories). We applied temporal smoothing (0.05-s window, 0.01-s sliding window), computed pseudotrials107, normalized the data and selected the top 30 features within a given ROI as features for the different classifiers. A group-level one-sample t-test per time point was performed on the decoding accuracy results, corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster-based correction106.

The overall decoding strategy for fMRI was similar to that used on the iEEG and MEG data, yet with some differences. A multivariate pattern analysis approach was used on the pattern of BOLD activity over voxels. A non-spatially smoothed parameter estimate map was obtained by fitting a GLM per event with that event as the regressor of interest and all the other remaining events as one regressor of no interest108 as implemented in NiBetaSeries (0.6.0) package. The model also included the 24 nuisance regressors described in the ‘fMRI preprocessing' section.

Decoding was performed using whole-brain and ROI-based approaches. The whole-brain analysis was performed using a searchlight approach with 4-mm radius. For ROI-based decoding, decoding ROIs were defined based on functional fMRI contrasts (see the ‘fMRI preprocessing' section) and constrained with pre-defined anatomical ROIs (see Extended Data Table 2 on anatomical ROIs). A one-sample permutation test was used to determine whether decoding significantly exceeded chance level within each ROI. FDR was used to correct for multiple comparisons across ROIs. For whole-brain decoding, a cluster-based permutation test was used to evaluate the decoding statistical significance across participants (P < 0.05), complemented by Bayesian analysis. In addition, stimulus versus baseline searchlight decoding was performed using leave-one-run out cross-validation, and the resultant decoding accuracy maps were used as input for the multivariate putative NCC analysis (see below). To perform stimulus versus baseline decoding, we subsampled the stimuli trials to a 2:1 ratio with respect to baseline. The SVM cost function was weighted by the number of trials from each class. Plots were generated using Matplotlib (3.3.2)109.

To test GNWT and IIT decoding predictions, stimulus category (faces versus objects and letters versus false fonts) was decoded separately for the task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions (within-task category decoding), whereas orientation (front view versus left view versus right view) was decoded on the combined data from the two task conditions. In addition, cross-task category decoding from the task-relevant to task-irrelevant condition and vice versa was performed to test generalization by training classifiers on one condition and testing on the other condition. Both within-task category and orientation decoding were performed in a leave-one-run-out cross-validation scheme for fMRI and in an k-fold cross-validation scheme for MEG and iEEG.

For category decoding, trials from each task condition (that is, task relevant or task irrelevant) were extracted for each category comparison of interest: 160 face/160 objects classification, 160 letters/160 false-fonts classification within each task-relevant condition for MEG, and half the trials for iEEG. For fMRI, there were 64 trials for each category in each task-relevant condition. For orientation decoding, task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials were collapsed within category to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in 160 front, 80 left and 80 right trials per category for MEG, and half these numbers for iEEG. For fMRI, there were 64 front and 32 left and right trials per category. Decoding was evaluated using accuracy measures, tested against 50% chance level for category decoding (binary classification) and against 33% chance level for orientation decoding (three-class classification). For orientation decoding, balanced accuracy was used due to the unbalanced number of trials for the different orientations. The SVM cost function was weighted by the number of trials per class to reduce bias to the class with the highest number.

For within-task decoding (for example, classification of categories across time), a classifier at each time point was trained and tested separately using a fivefold cross-validation (with three separate repeats of cross-validation). For cross-task decoding (task relevant → irrelevant and task irrelevant → relevant), each SVM model was trained on one task (for example, faces–objects in the task-relevant condition) and tested on the second task (for example, faces–objects in the task-irrelevant condition). As cross-decoding in iEEG data is performed across all pooled electrodes, an additional cross-validation step was performed on this modality data to provide a confidence metric (for example, confidence intervals) using a fivefold cross-validation with three repetitions (for example, train on 80% of task 1, and test on held-out 20% of task 2).

Within-task temporal generalization was performed by training a classifier at each time point (using selectKbest feature selection) and testing its performance across all time points using the same set of selected features and three repetitions of fivefold cross-validation. To generalize from one task to another across all time points, cross-temporal generalization was used: a classifier was trained at each time point in task 1 (for example, task relevant) using selectKbest feature selection, and tested across all time points in task 2 (for example, task irrelevant) using the same set of selected features. Cross-validation was performed in the same manner as in cross-decoding.

Additional decoding analyses were performed on all trials aligned to the stimulus onset (for example, −0.2 to 2 s relative to stimulus onset) and stimulus offset (−0.5 to 0.5 s around stimulus offset). For the latter analysis, all trials from different durations were aligned to the stimulus offset.

To assess the prediction of IIT that included prefrontal regions along with posterior regions to the decoding of categories will not significantly affect decoding accuracy, we performed an additional decoding analysis in which the decoding performance of electrodes from the IIT region were compared with the decoding performance when electrodes from both the posterior + PFC ROIs are included. The PFC ROIs included all PFC ROIs except for inferior frontal sulcus, as it belongs to the IIT extended ROIs. Posterior ROI included all IIT ROIs shown in Supplementary Table 26. The analysis compared the decoding accuracy for a model including all electrodes from posterior regions to a separate model in which electrodes (features) from posterior and PFC regions were combined (for example, feature combination). Training and testing of the individual models followed all previously described cross-validation procedures, and model comparison was performed using a variance-corrected paired t-test110 and complemented with Bayesian analysis.

We also tested this prediction on the fMRI data. To select features to be used for both analyses, the face versus object contrast for each participant was masked by a predefined anatomical posterior ROIs as well as PFC anatomical ROIs, defined the same way as described above. Within each of the two ROIs, the 150 voxels that are most selective to each of the to-be-decoded stimuli were defined as the decoding ROIs (300 voxels total) for each participant. The first analysis compared the decoding accuracies for a model that included 300 voxels from the posterior ROIs as features to another model that included 600 voxels (300 features from each ROI). In the second analysis, two separate models were constructed, calibrated and combined as described above. For the two analyses, model comparison was performed using a group-level one-sample permutation test to determine if accuracies obtained by combining posterior and PFC ROIs were significantly higher than the accuracies obtained based on posterior ROIs only. FDR was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Bayesian analysis was performed to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis that adding prefrontal ROIs will not improve decoding accuracy.

Neural responses were extracted from three windows of interest (0.8–1.0 s, 1.3–1.5 s and 1.8–2.0 s) and compared using LMMs. Four theory agnostic models were fitted: a null model, a duration model (three durations), a windows of interest model, and a duration and windows of interest model. Two theory models were fitted: the GNWT model predicts activation (ignition) following stimulus offset (0.3–0.5 s) independent of duration, with virtually no response in between. The IIT model predicts sustained activation for the duration of the stimulus returning to baseline after stimulus offset. Both theoretical models were complemented with an interaction term between category (faces, objects, letters and false fonts) and the theories' predictors, to account for regions showing selective responses to categories. BIC was used to define the winning model and we computed Bayes factors based on the difference in BIC values, comparing the GNWT model (with or without interaction) against either the null model (intercept only) or the time-window model (capturing amplitude changes over time)111.

Models for iEEG were fitted per electrode on the predefined ROIs, using the high-gamma (AUC), alpha (8–13 Hz, obtained through Morlet wavelets, f = 8–13 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; f/2 cycles, AUC),and ERPs (peak to peak) as signal, separately for task-relevant and task-irrelevant condition.

MEG models were fitted to source data on the predefined ROIs, using the gamma (60–90 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz) bands as signal, separately for task-relevant and task-irrelevant conditions. Time-frequency analyses were performed on source-data using Morlet wavelets (f = 8–13 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; f/2 cycles; f = 60–90 Hz, in 2-Hz steps, f/4 cycles) and were baseline corrected. Spectral activity was computed for each vertex, baseline corrected and then averaged across trials within each parcel included in the ROIs, yielding a unique time course per ROI parcel. In addition, a single-source time course capturing the entire prefrontal ROI and the posterior ROI was computed by averaging the spectral activity within an ROI. Models were fitted on each parcel and ROI, as defined by the theories.

To examine how the neural representations evolved over time in response to the different stimulus properties (that is, category, orientation and identity representation), we performed cross-temporal RSA on source-level MEG data and iEEG high-gamma power within each of the theory-defined ROIs, using all trials. Specifically, at each set of data points, we computed a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) by calculating the correlation distance (1 − Pearson's r, Fisher corrected) between all pairs of stimuli (the preregistration document described a different method that was however updated to optimize trial numbers; see section 14 in Supplementary Information for justification). Next, to quantify the representational space occupied by one class versus another, we computed the average within-class distances versus the average between-class distances. This analysis was performed in a cross-temporal manner, in which RDMs were computed between all stimuli at time point t1 and the corresponding set of stimuli at time points t1, t2,…tn.

Long trials (1.5 s) were used to investigate category and orientation representation. As specific identities were repeated a limited number of times per duration, both intermediate (1.0 s) and long (1.5 s) trials were combined and equated in duration by cropping the 1–1.5-s time interval for long trials. This was done to allow for the analysis of at least three (3) presentations of the same identity.

To evaluate the theoretical predictions about when significant content representation should occur, we subsampled the observed cross-temporal representational matrices in four time windows (0.3–0.5 s, 0.8–1.0 s, 1.3–1.5 s and 1.8–2.0 s). The subsampled matrices were correlated to the model matrices predicted by GNWT and IIT (see Fig. 1a, right panel) using Kendall's tau correlation. If the correlation was significant (see below) for at least one of the predicted matrices, we computed the difference between the transformed correlation (\((r+1)/2\)) to each theory, and compared this difference against a random distribution to obtain a P value. If the correlation with the theory-predicted pattern in the theory ROI was significantly higher than the other model, we considered the theory prediction to be fulfilled.

To generate a null distribution of cross-temporal RSA surrogate matrices, we repeated the procedure outlined above 1,024 times, randomly shuffling the labels. Next, the observed RSA matrix was z-scored using the null distribution as:

Where \({{\rm{obs}}}_{i,j}\) is the observed within-versus-between class difference at time points i and j, and \({\mu }_{{{\rm{surr}}}_{i,j}}\) and \({\sigma }_{{{\rm{surr}}}_{i,j}}\) are the mean and standard deviation of the surrogate representational similarity matrix at time points i and j, respectively. Cluster-based permutation tests112, z-score threshold of z = 1.5 for clustering, were used to evaluate significance. RSA surrogates were also used to assess the significance of the correlation between the observed matrices and the predicted matrices of the theories. First, a null distribution of possible correlations was generated for each of the theories by correlating each of the surrogate matrices to each of the theory-predicted matrices. Next, a P value was obtained for each theory-predicted matrix, by locating its observed correlation within the null correlation distribution. The same procedure was used to assess the significance of the difference in correlation to IIT and GNWT matrices (for example, each of the surrogate matrices was correlated to each of the theory-predicted matrices and the difference between the two was computed). P values were FDR corrected (q ≤ 0.05)75.

For iEEG, the high-gamma power per electrode within the predefined anatomical ROI was averaged in 0.02-s non-overlapping windows. Electrodes were used as features for the RDM. The data were vectorized across all electrodes within a ROI (for example, samples × significant electrodes) to compute the RDMs. A total of 576 and 583 electrodes entered this analysis for the prefrontal and posterior ROI, respectively. The resultant RDM was subjected to a PCA, and the first two dimensions were plotted against each other to produce a 2D projection of dissimilarity scores across all pairs for each of the 100 subsampling repetitions. The PCA components were aligned across repetitions using Procrustes alignment and averaged together for visualization purposes113,114.

For MEG, the same analysis was run on the source reconstructed data within the predefined anatomical ROIs used for the decoding analysis, bandpass filtered (1–40 Hz) and downsampled (100 Hz). For the category and orientation analysis, pseudotrials and temporal moving-average methods were used to optimize the RSA analysis and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. For identity, single trials were used. Vertices within the ROIs were used as features. The statistical testing differed from that conducted on the iEEG data, as it was performed at the participant level. Similarly to the iEEG analysis, we first tested whether the correlation between the data and the model predicted by each theory was greater than zero using the Kendall's tau measure, and then compared between the theories using the Mann–Whitney U rank test on two independent samples.

For both iEEG and MEG, PPC46 was computed between each category-selective time series (face selective and object selective) and either the V1/V2 or the PFC time series.

For iEEG, the PPC analysis included electrodes in V1/V2 visual areas, in PFC ROIs (see Supplementary Table 26), and face-selective and object-selective electrodes (see ‘Identification of task-responsive channels'), as long as they were ‘active' during the task. As both theories predict different types of activation (for example, ignition versus sustained activation), channels were categorized as active if they showed an increase in high-gamma power relative to baseline (−0.5 to −0.3 s, P < 0.05, signed-rank test) evaluated across all trials (task relevant + irrelevant, intermediate + long trials, combined across both categories), for the 0.3–0.5-s window (GNWT), or in all time windows: 0.3–0.5 s, 0.5–0.8 s and 1.3–1.5 s (IIT).

For MEG, the category-selective single-trial time courses used to define the ROIs for PPC analysis were extracted using the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GED) method115. Two GED spatial filters were built by contrasting either faces or objects against all other categories during the first 0.5 s after stimulus onset. Single-trial covariance matrices were computed separately for signal and reference for all vertices within the fusiform ROI identified from the FreeSurfer parcellation using the Desikan atlas116, and the Euclidean distance between them was z-scored. Trials exceeding 3 z-scores were excluded. The reference covariance matrix was regularized to reduce overfitting and increase numerical stability. The GED was then performed on the two covariance matrices, resulting in n (=rank of the data) pairs of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvector associated with the highest eigenvalue was selected as a GED spatial filter, which in turn was applied to the data to compute the single-trial GED component time series. A GED spatial filter was extracted also for the PFC ROI, on parcels from the Destrieux atlas73, to identify the distributed pattern of sources that are responsive to visually presented stimuli. Specifically, a spatial filter was built by contrasting source-level frontal slow-frequency activity (30-Hz low-pass filter) after stimulus onset (0–0.5 s) against baseline (−0.5 to 0 s). V1/V2 areas were identified using the Wang Atlas74 and a singular values-decomposition approach. For the GED, the 1.0-s and 1.5-s duration trials were used to minimize overlap with the transient evoked at stimulus onset.

PPC was computed for each MEG time series–iEEG electrode pairing, for all face trials and object trials separately. Analyses were performed on 1.0-s and 1.5-s duration trials, separately on task-relevant and task-irrelevant trials and also combined to maximize statistical power. To compute synchrony, time-frequency analysis of the broadband MEG and LFP signal was performed using Morlet wavelets (f = 2–30 Hz, in 1-Hz steps; 4 cycles; f = 30–180 Hz for iEEG or f = 30–100 Hz for MEG, in 2-Hz steps, f/4 cycles), and PPC was then computed by taking the difference in phase angle between MEG time series–iEEG electrode at each time t and frequency f for a specific trial and computing PPC across all trials in a category (for example, faces) as:

\({\theta }_{j,k}(f,t)={\theta (f,t)}_{e1{\rm{or}}{\rm{GED}}{\rm{filter}}}-{\theta (f,t)}_{e2{\rm{or}}{\rm{GED}}{\rm{filter}}}\), for all frequencies f and at all times t.

For iEEG, PPC for each category-selective site was then averaged across all its pairings (for example, all PFC electrodes pairings or all V1/V2 pairings within that patient). The variability in electrode coverage across patients precluded a within-participants analysis. Therefore, to achieve sufficient statistical power, we pooled all derived PPC values from one electrode pairing (for example, face selective to the PFC) across all patients into one ROI-specific analysis. A similar approach was used on the MEG parcels.

To quantify content-specific synchrony enhancement, the difference in PPC was computed between within-category and across-category trials (for example, for face-selective sites, the change in PPC was computed between faces versus objects trials) using a cluster-based permutation test106. This was done for both modalities.

As an exploratory analysis, we also investigated dynamic functional connectivity using the Gaussian copula mutual information117 approach to evaluate the dependencies between time series. This power-based measure of connectivity was implemented using the conn_dfc method from the Frites Python package118. We used the same parameters as for the PPC analysis, with the following exceptions: for both MEG and iEEG, power was estimated through a multitaper-based method (using a frequency-dependent dynamic sliding window: 2–30 Hz, T = 4 cycles; 30–100 Hz, T4/f using a 0.25-s sliding window). For iEEG, the high-frequency range was extended from 30 to 180 Hz, T = 4/f cycles). DFC was performed per frequency band, 0.1-s sliding window and 0.02-s steps.

For fMRI, connectivity was assessed through gPPI implemented in SPM119. The FFA and lateral occipital cortex were defined as seed regions per participant based on an anatomically constrained functional contrast. Anatomically, FFA seeds were constrained to the ‘inferior occipital gyrus (O3) and sulcus' and ‘lateral occipito-temporal gyrus (fusiform gyrus; O4–T4)'. LOC seeds were constrained to the ‘middle occipital gyrus (O2; lateral occipital gyrus)' and the ‘middle occipital sulcus and lunatus sulcus' (Destrieux ROIs 2 and 21 for FFA, and ROIs 19 and 57 for LOC; see ‘Anatomical ROIs').

Candidate seed voxels within the above-mentioned anatomical ROIs were defined as those with z > 1 in the contrast of parameter estimates of all stimuli versus baseline. Three participants with less than 300 candidate seed voxels were excluded from the analysis. This was done to ensure that the seed voxels were visually driven. Next, using an unthresholded contrast of parameter estimates between ‘relevant and irrelevant faces' and ‘relevant and irrelevant objects', the 300 voxels most responsive to faces within the FFA anatomical ROIs were selected for the FFA seed, and the 300 voxels most responsive to objects within the LOC anatomical ROIs were selected for the LOC seed.

gPPI analysis was performed per participant and seed region separately, including an interaction term between the seed time-series regressor (physiological term) and the task regressor (psychological term) at the participant-level GLM119, separately for task-relevant and irrelevant conditions, and also combining across tasks to increase statistical power. For combined conditions, the model design matrix for each participant included regressors for task-relevant and task-irrelevant faces, objects, letters and false fonts collapsed across conditions (four regressors) as well as a regressor for targets (irrespective of their category), yielding five regressors in total. As for separated conditions, the model design matrix included regressors for task-relevant and task-irrelevant faces, objects, letters and false fonts (eight regressors) as well as a regressor for targets (irrespective of their category), yielding nine regressors in total. For each seed, group-level analysis was performed using a cluster-based permutation test (preferred over the preregistered FDR correction), complemented by Bayesian analysis. See section 14 in Supplementary Information for a justification of this change to evaluate the statistical significance of face > object contrast parameter estimates across participants (P < 0.05).

A series of conjunction analyses were performed on the fMRI data to identify (1) areas responsive to task goal, (2) areas responsive to task relevance, and (3) areas putatively involved in the neural correlates of consciousness. We note that the contrasts proposed below might overestimate the neural correlates of consciousness and that the fast-event-related design adopted here might be suboptimal to detect activity changes in the salience network120, that is, potentially underestimating some regions that might be involved in conscious processing. We therefore have adopted a conservative approach that distinguishes between areas that might participate in consciousness versus those that definitely do not.

The conjunction defining areas responsive to task goals was defined as [TaskRelTar > bsl] and [(TaskRelNonTar = bsl) and (TaskIrrel = bsl)]. This contrast captures areas that show an increase of BOLD signal for targets but not for other stimuli. The following conjunction identified areas responsive to task relevance: [(TaskRelTar > bsl) and (TaskRelNonTar ≠ bsl)] and [TaskIrrel = bsl]. This contrast identifies areas displaying differential activity for all task-relevant stimuli, but are insensitive to non-task-relevant stimuli. Finally, the following conjunction was used to identify the putative NCC areas: [(TaskRelNonTar (stim id) > bsl) and (TaskIrrel (stim id) > bsl)] or [(TaskRelNonTar (stim id) < bsl) and (TaskIrrel (stim id) < bsl)], critically detecting areas that are responsive to any stimulus category irrespective of task, with consistent activation or deactivation. Thus, this analysis casts a wide net to identify areas that can potentially be the neural correlates of consciousness, whereas excluding areas that do not respond to task-relevant or irrelevant stimuli (meaning that areas that respond both to the task and to the content of perception are still included).

To compute conjunctions, we first ran a GLM (see above) corrected for multiple comparisons (Gaussian random-field cluster-based inference). Equivalence to baseline was established using a JZS Bayes factor test, with a Cauchy prior (r scale value of 0.707, as implemented in Pingouin (0.5.1)121. Evidence maps were thresholded at BF01 > 3. The thresholded z maps and the Bayesian evidence maps on the group level were used for the conjunction analysis. For conjunctions including an ‘unequal to', a ‘logical and' operation was used between the directional z maps, after thresholded maps were binarized. For the putative NCC contrast, conjunctions were performed separately for activations and deactivations, using a ‘logical and' operator for the task-relevant and irrelevant z maps. The resulting maps were combined using a ‘logical or' operation to discard areas showing effects of opposite direction for task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli. This analysis was also done at the participant level, masked using the anatomical ROIs, to account for inter-participant variability. For each ROI, the proportion of participants with voxels included in the conjunction is reported. The multivariate version of the putative NCC analysis was done using the thresholded statistical maps obtained from the whole-brain searchlight decoding based on a participant-level stimulus versus baseline-decoding accuracy maps (for details regarding the decoding approach used, see ‘Decoding analysis').

a, fMRI searchlight decoding accuracies (letters-falsefonts), collapsed across durations. Pattern classifiers trained on relevant stimuli and tested on irrelevant stimuli (left, purple) or vice versa (right, orange): Outlined colored regions on the inflated cortical surfaces (top: lateral views; bottom: medial views) indicate significant above-chance (50%) decoding. Here and below, significance was evaluated through a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05; two-sided). Sample sizes as reported in Fig. 2. b, iEEG ROIs decoding accuracies (letters-falsefonts) collapsed across durations. Conventions as in a. The results are displayed on inflated surface maps from a left lateral (top left), posterior (top right) and left medial (bottom) views. c, MEG cross-task decoding of category (letters-falsefonts) when classifiers were trained on relevant stimuli and tested on irrelevant stimuli (purple); or vice versa (orange), separately for the whole posterior (left) and prefrontal (right) ROIs. Underlying lines indicate significantly above-chance (50%) decoding. Error bars depict 95% CI across participants. d, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (letters-falsefonts) classifiers trained on task-relevant stimuli and tested on task-irrelevant stimuli. Columns: stimulus durations (left: 0.5 s; center: 1.0 s; right: 1.5 s). Rows: theory ROIs (top: posterior; bottom: prefrontal). Contoured red-shaded regions depict significant above-chance (50%) decoding. e, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (faces-objects), classifiers were trained on task-relevant stimuli and tested on task-irrelevant ones. Conventions as in d. f, iEEG cross-task temporal generalization of category decoding (faces-objects) from task-irrelevant to task-relevant stimuli, yet using pseudotrial aggregation to boost decoding accuracy. Conventions as in d. g, iEEG ROI decoding accuracies (faces-objects) using pseudotrials. Conventions as in b. Brain surfaces in panels a, b, g are from Freesurfer.

a, iEEG within-task temporal generalization decoding of category (faces-objects) for pattern classifiers trained and tested on task-relevant stimuli. As in Fig. 2b, columns represent stimulus durations (left: 0.5 s; center: 1.0 s; right: 1.5 s) and rows represent theory ROIs (top: posterior; bottom: prefrontal). Contoured red-shaded regions depict significant above-chance (50%) decoding. Here and below, significance was evaluated through a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05; two-sided). Sample size as in Fig. 2. b, iEEG within-task temporal generalization decoding of category for task-irrelevant stimuli. Conventions as in a. c, MEG within-task average decoding of category (faces-objects), for the task-relevant (orange) and the task-irrelevant (purple) conditions, in posterior (left) and prefrontal (right) ROIs. Underlying lines depict significantly above-chance (50%) decoding assessed by cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05). Error bars depict 95% CI estimated across participants. d, MEG within-task decoding of category (letters-falsefonts). Conventions as in c. e, fMRI searchlight decoding of category (faces-objects), collapsed across durations, for the task-relevant (left, orange) and task-irrelevant (right, purple) conditions. Outlined colors indicate regions on the inflated cortical surfaces showing significantly above-chance (50%) decoding (top: left/right lateral views; bottom: right/left medial views). f, iEEG ROIs decoding accuracies, collapsed across durations, within the task-relevant (left, orange) and the task-irrelevant (right, purple) stimuli. Same conventions as in e, with maps from a left lateral (top left), posterior (top right) and left medial (bottom) views. Brain surfaces in panels e,f are from Freesurfer.

a, Left: iEEG ROIs decoding results of orientation (left/right/front view) over time as in Fig. 2, but using pseudotrials akin to the MEG analysis. Right: Regions with electrodes showing significant above-chance (33%) accuracies are indicated in outlined blue on the inflated surfaces (left: left lateral view; middle: posterior view; right: left medial view). Here and below, error bars depict 95% CI. Significance assessed using a cluster-based permutation test (p < 0.05, two-sided). Sample size as in Fig. 2. b, Two analyses were performed to evaluate potential leakage in MEG decoding, using independent data from the optimization phase (N = 32). Top: averaged stimulus-evoked response in face task-relevant trials, combined across durations, at different latencies, projected on the inflated surfaces. Activity in posterior areas (blue ellipse) showed the highest peak ~0.1-0.2 s, while prefrontal areas showed a later highest peak ~0.2-0.3 s. This challenges the leakage interpretation. Bottom: Analysis of face-object decoding in task-relevant trials across durations, separately within parcels in parietal and PFC. Left: Average decoding accuracy in an early time window (0.25-0.5 s) projected on two differently inflated surfaces to better depict gyri and sulci. Right: Time-resolved decoding of these parcels. Decoding is highest in posterior areas and lowest in anterior areas, with fairly similar time courses, suggesting a posterior-to-anterior gradient consistent with leakage. c, ROIs used in the decoding analysis including (blue) and excluding (red) PFC areas. d, iEEG decoding of faces-objects (left), letters-falsefonts (middle) and face orientation (right), with and without PFC (blue and red). Underlying lines indicate significantly worse decoding when including PFC. e, MEG decoding results, same conventions as in d. f, fMRI decoding of faces-objects. Histogram shows the differences in classification including and excluding frontal areas. fMRI accuracies including PFC show 1.2% increase compared to excluding PFC, observed in 56% of the participants. Notably, this slight increase was observed only in the combined features analysis and not the combined models' analysis (see Methods). Brain surfaces in panels a-c are from Freesurfer.

a, Cross-temporal representational similarity matrices in Posterior ROI (Npatients=28, Nelectrodes = 583). The leftmost column shows similarity for letters vs. false fonts, separately for task-relevant (left) and task-irrelevant (right) trials. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots at 0.3 s illustrate the separability between letters and false fonts. The top rightward column display similarity for identity, while bottom rows show similarity for orientation. Contours indicate statistical significance based on cluster-based permutation tests (upper tail test, α = 0.05). PCA illustrates clear separability between letters and false fonts in the posterior cortex at 0.3 s, regardless of task relevance (top – task-relevant, bottom - task-irrelevant). This separability was largely sustained in the task-relevant condition but diminished between ~0.95 and 1.4 s. In the task-irrelevant condition, separability was significant only for a brief period at the beginning. Identity information was significant for letters and false-fonts but not for faces. While identity information was not sustained throughout the entire stimulus duration, elevated z-scores up to 1 s suggest a potential limitation in statistical power. No statistically significant orientation information was observed for any category. Conventions as in Fig. 3. b, Cross-temporal representational similarity matrices in Prefrontal ROI (Npatients=28, Nelectrodes = 576) for the same contrasts as and following the same conventions as in a. No contrast yielded statistically significant results in the PFC ROI.

a, iEEG electrode coverage used to assess content-selective synchrony for IIT ROIs (top, Npatients = 4) & GNWT ROIs (bottom, Npatients = 21). Electrode coverage varied between ROIs as interareal connectivity was assessed between electrodes on a per-participant basis. In addition, two example category-selective electrodes are shown (right): one face-selective, and one object-selective. Error bars depict standard error of the mean. b, iEEG Pairwise phase consistency (PPC) analysis of task-irrelevant trials reveals significant content-selective synchrony (e.g. faces > objects for face-selective electrodes; left; objects > faces for object-selective electrodes; right) in V1/V2 ROIs (top row), but not in PFC ROIs (bottom row). Color bars represent the average change in PPC (face and object trials) for each node (face-selective, object-selective). Positive values reflect stronger connectivity for faces, while negative values reflect stronger connectivity for objects. c, MEG (N = 65) cortical time-series were extracted per participant from cortical parcels in V1/V2 (blue), PFC (green) and in a fusiform (red) ROIs. Category-selective signals were obtained by creating a category-selective GED filter (i.e., contrasting face-object trials against any other stimulus category trials) on the activity extracted from the fusiform ROI. Face- (bottom left) and object-selective (bottom right) responses averaged across participants are shown at the bottom. Error bars depict 95% CI. Here and below, significance was assessed using cluster-based permutation tests, p < 0.05, two-sided. d, MEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials (N = 65) reveals significant category-selective synchrony below 25 Hz for the face-selective GED filter (i.e., faces > objects for face-selective electrodes) in both V1/V2 (top row) and PFC ROIs (bottom row) and for the object-selective synchrony (objects > faces for object-selective electrodes) in the PFC ROI only. Brain surfaces in panels a,c are from Freesurfer.

a, iEEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials did not reveal any significant category-selective synchrony cluster in posterior (top) or PFC (bottom) ROIs after removing the evoked response. Same conventions, sample size and statistical tests as in Extended Data Fig. 5 are used here and below. b, MEG PPC analysis of task-irrelevant trials also did not reveal any synchrony cluster in any ROI after removing the evoked response. c, iEEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials without removing the evoked response reveals significant content-selective connectivity between object-selective electrodes and V1/V2 electrodes (top-right), reflected as broadband (25–125 Hz) decrease in the change in DFC (e.g., faces < objects). Similar broadband changes in DFC (faces > objects) were observed for face-selective electrodes in PFC (bottom-left). Smaller significant effects were detected between face-selective and V1/V2 electrodes (top-left) and for object-selective and PFC electrodes (bottom-right). d, MEG DFC analysis of task-irrelevant trials without removing the evoked response reveal significant content-selective synchrony between the face-selective GED filter node and both V1/V2 (top-left) and PFC (bottom-left). This is reflected in an increase in low-frequency connectivity (< 25 Hz) combined with a decrease in high-frequency connectivity (25–100 Hz). Smaller yet significant effects were detected for the object-selective GED filter (right). e, Generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) task-related connectivity analysis of task-irrelevant (left) and task-relevant (right) trials revealed weak clusters of content-selective connectivity with FFA as the analysis seed (p < 0.01, uncorrected). Common significant regions showing task-related connectivity in task-irrelevant, task-relevant, and combined conditions include V1/V2, right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). f, gPPI task-related connectivity analysis of task-irrelevant (left), task-relevant (middle), and combined conditions revealed weak clusters of content-selective connectivity with lateral occipital complex (LOC) as the analysis seed (p < 0.01, uncorrected). Overall, no common significant regions showed task-related connectivity. Brain surfaces in panel e, f are from Freesurfer.

Left: Preregistered predictions of IIT (top) and GNWT (bottom) (see also ref. 12; Fig. 1). Key hypotheses (second column, Key hypotheses) are described alongside the three analyses used to test them (third column, Test): decoding (prediction #1; Fig. 2), activation & RSA (prediction #2; Fig. 3), and synchrony (prediction #3; Fig. 4). Potential outcomes and their interpretations are detailed in the fourth column (Possible outcome and interpretation), with outcomes aligning with predictions framed in green (pass) and contradictory outcomes framed in red (fail). Solid frames denote critical predictions, while dotted gray frames indicate non-critical predictions. This section reflects the theoretical expectations before the experiment. Right: summary of the actual findings, integrating results across modalities and analyses. Key findings for each prediction are described (fifth column; ‘Result') with white denoting alignment with predictions, red indicating contradiction, white/red mixtures showing partial support or failure, and yellow indicating inconclusive results. Final conclusions synthesize these findings, using the same color coding. For IIT, the results mix a passed prediction (content-specific complex of neural units in posterior cortex, throughout the persistence of a percept, independent of the task) with a failure (maximum integrated information). For GNWT, the results consisted of a mixture of a partly challenged prediction (of an all-or-none threshold and amplification of information updating the content of consciousness in PFC) and a partly supported one, given the inconclusive result for orientation (of global broadcasting of information in the PFC). These results are discussed in the main text, including their implications for other consciousness theories.

Metrics details

Land plants thrive in soils showing vastly different properties and environmental stresses1. Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil conditions and stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic approaches, we showed major expression changes in outer root cell types when comparing the single-cell transcriptomes of rice roots grown in gel versus soil conditions. These tissue-specific transcriptional responses are related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity and defence in response to heterogeneous soil versus homogeneous gel growth conditions. We also demonstrate how the model soil stress, termed compaction, triggers expression changes in cell wall remodelling and barrier formation in outer and inner root tissues, regulated by abscisic acid released from phloem cells. Our study reveals how root tissues communicate and adapt to contrasting soil conditions at single-cell resolution.

Crops such as rice thrive in arable soils that show natural heterogeneity. The heterogeneous nature of soils is characterized by uneven distributions of nutrients, water, microorganisms and organic content that pose a stark contrast to the uniformity of growth media, underscoring the fundamental importance to understand how plant roots navigate, adapt and thrive at molecular and cellular levels in natural soils. Roots have evolved diverse strategies to tackle the variability in soil conditions1,2. However, our understanding of how roots respond to complex soil environments at a cellular level of resolution remains limited. The application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic approaches to plant organs grown in diverse environments has the potential to reveal gene-expression complexity throughout root developmental stages, and identify mechanisms governing cell type-specific responses to environmental stresses3,4. Soil stresses represent a major challenge in global agriculture5. For example, soil compaction stress reduces root penetration, thereby affecting nutrient and water uptake and subsequently crop yield6. Roots have developed adaptive growth responses for compacted soils; but the underlying genes, cell group-specific transcriptional responses and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To discover the mechanisms governing root responses to soil compaction at a cellular resolution, we pioneered transcriptomic profiling of rice root tissues grown in soils with and without compaction using single-cell approaches.

Protoplasts of rice primary roots, obtained from gel-based conditions, were initially adopted to generate a high-quality scRNA-seq reference dataset to show cell identities and differentiation trajectories7, and later compared to equivalent datasets generated from soil-grown roots. Using the 10X Genomics scRNA-seq platform, we profiled more than 47,000 root cells gathered from Xkitaake rice primary root tissues 2–3 days after germination across ten sets of independently grown seedlings. To enhance depth and assess data variability across laboratories, we integrated a previously published scRNA-seq dataset8 with our datasets. All datasets underwent processing with the COPILOT (cell preprocessing pipeline kallisto bustools) pipeline9, resulting in the integration of more than 79,000 high-quality cells to construct the final scRNA-seq atlas (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Video 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1). To mitigate the effect of protoplasting on gene expression, we identified protoplasting-induced genes by means of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq, Supplementary Table 2) and excluded them from data integration and differential expression analysis. This approach ensured the robustness of our scRNA-seq findings.

To ensure representation from all major developmental stages, we assigned developmental annotations to major cell types by comparing each cell's transcriptome with bulk RNA-seq expression profiles of manually dissected root tissue segments corresponding to meristematic, elongation and maturation zones (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 2). scRNA-seq studies often rely on pseudotime analysis to infer developmental stages, a computational method that orders cells on the basis of gene expression similarities but does not represent actual time. This approach is influenced by the choice of the starting point, which can affect interpretations. In our study, we integrated bulk RNA-seq data from rice root tissues at distinct developmental stages. Using stage-specific marker genes, we directly annotated developmental stages in our scRNA-seq dataset, aligning it more closely with experimental observations. This developmental-stage annotation is unique in our scRNA-seq dataset, compared to the previously published ones8,10,11.

High Spearman correlation among transcriptional profiles of all samples confirmed minimal batch effects (Extended Data Fig. 1b). For cell type annotation, we initially used principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques, followed by the calculation of z-scores for published markers (Methods). However, because of the limited number of validated cell type markers, a substantial proportion of cells remained unannotated. To address this limitation, we used Molecular Cartography, an optimized multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization technology12,13. This allowed us to explore in situ gene-expression profiles for the candidate cell type markers identified in our putatively annotated cell type clusters. Our spatial transcriptomic experiments validated the cell type-specific expression of more than 40 markers (Fig. 1i–p, Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Data 3 and 4). We then refined our cell type annotation, relying on the expression patterns of validated markers in scRNA-seq clusters (Fig. 1c–h,q). The iterative feedback loop between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics significantly increased the number of reliable markers for the major root cell types, enhancing cell annotation quality.

Integrating scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data also showed temporal gene-expression dynamics. Pseudotime analysis demonstrated a continuous differentiation trajectory of rice root epidermis (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), and we examined temporal expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in root hair differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Among the DEGs, three genes (LOC_Os12g05380, OsGT3, encoding a putative xylosyltransferase (XXT); LOC_Os10g42750, OsCSLD1, encoding Cellulose Synthase Like D1; LOC_Os06g48050, unannotated) showed a sequential pattern of expression along root hair differentiation, detected in both scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics data (Fig. 1r–u and Extended Data Fig. 1f–k). Overall, our approach generated a high-resolution scRNA-seq atlas, with confidently annotated cell types and developmental stages.

To investigate the cell type-specific responses to natural soil condition relative to the gel-based condition, we used our standardized soil-based growth regime14. Xkitaake rice seedlings were cultivated in soils for 3 days, their roots were then harvested, after which scRNA-seq was conducted on protoplasts isolated from two biological replicates of 1-cm root tip segments. Root tip samples encompassed meristem, elongation and early maturation zones. To leverage our gel-based data for interpreting our soil-based data, gel-based and soil-based scRNA-seq datasets were integrated (Methods). Although the scRNA datasets obtained from different growth conditions could be distinguished with sample-wise correlation analyses, the gel-grown roots showed high one-to-one similarities with the soil-grown roots across almost all cell clusters (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c,h). Most validated cell type markers detected in our Molecular Cartography examination remained expressed in their target cell types under soil conditions (Fig. 2d–l, Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 5 and 6). We thus relied on the expression patterns of these marker genes to annotate the major cell types in our soil-based scRNA-seq data (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 4). We verified the relatively high correlation of individual cell types between the two growth conditions (Extended Data Fig. 3d,f). Our scRNA-seq analysis showed a notable decrease in the number of root hair cells detected under soil conditions. To verify this reduction in trichoblast cell numbers, we examined the expression of a root hair cell-specific marker line (proCSLD1::VENUS-N7). Imaging showed highly similar expression patterns between gel and soil conditions, indicating that the observed decrease is probably due to the loss of root hair cells during the protoplasting process (Extended Data Fig. 3i–k). In conclusion, we managed to annotate our soil-based scRNA-seq data with our knowledge gained from both gel-based scRNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomic application to soil-grown roots.

Source Data

To delve into the mechanisms governing cell type-specific responses to soil growth conditions, we conducted differential expression analysis for confidently annotated root cell types and developmental stage-enriched groups (Methods). This analysis revealed 11,259 DEGs (fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate less than 0.05, Supplementary Table 5). Notably, 31% of DEGs were altered in a single cell type or developmental stage, indicating that changes in growth conditions modulate distinct sets of genes in specific cell type contexts (Extended Data Fig. 5m,n). Most DEGs were found in the outer root cell types (epidermis, exodermis, sclerenchyma and cortex), whereas the inner stele layers (such as phloem and endodermis) showed relatively minor changes (Fig. 2a–c,m and Extended Data Fig. 5m). This pattern indicates that even under non-stressed soil conditions, roots modify their gene expression compared to gel-grown roots, particularly in outer cell layers.

Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these DEGs revealed the functional classes enriched in outer tissues of soil-grown roots notably include nutrient metabolism (particularly phosphate and nitrogen pathways), alongside vesicle-mediated transport, cell wall integrity, hormone-mediated signalling and defence responses, compared to axenic gel conditions (Fig. 2n–p, Supplementary Table 6). The increased expression of genes involved in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism in outer cell layers further indicates that root cells dynamically adjust their metabolic processes to respond to fluctuating nutrient availability in soils. We also identified several micro nutrient (zinc and boron) uptake-related genes (OsZIP10 and OsBOR1) showing enhanced expression in the outer cell layers. Our scRNA-seq analysis indicates that roots use various adaptive strategies to improve nutrient uptake, including strengthening cell wall integrity, enhancing cell communication by means of hormone signalling and using vesicle-mediated transport mechanisms, in response to the heterogeneous distribution of nutrients in the soils.

In our study, we used the model rice variety Xkitaake to establish our scRNA-seq resource given the wealth of functional resources available in this background including mutant collections15 and exploited in our recent study2. However, Xkitaake is a transgenic line containing the XA21 gene, which encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. To assess the potential influence of XA21 on rice root gene expression, we conducted scRNA-seq on Kitaake genotype under both gel and soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). Cell type annotation revealed similar enrichment of DEGs in outer root cells as observed in Xkitaake (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). We further validated the enriched GO terms through a comparative scRNA-seq analysis of the Kitaake genotype. The GO term enrichment patterns and associated gene expression changes (Supplementary Table 9), related to nutrient homeostasis, cell wall integrity, hormone-mediated signalling and vesicle-mediated transport were consistent between Xkitaake and Kitaake in the scRNA-seq analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4c–e). For defence responses, scRNA-seq analysis of Xkitaake compared to Kitaake showed relatively higher expression of defence-related genes in Xkitaake (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i), indicating that XA21 can enhance defence responses under changing growth conditions. However, when examining specific defence response genes in Kitaake under soil versus gel conditions, we also detected their induction in soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g,j,k). Thus, although XA21 is not required for the enhanced defence response observed in natural soils as compared to the gel growth regime, it amplifies the defence response triggered by these growth condition changes.

Hence, compared to when propagated in sterile homogeneous gel, roots grown in soils seem to adapt to their heterogeneous environment by upregulating defence, nutrient and cell wall-related gene expression across all the cell types. The outer cell layers are more responsive compared to the inner cell layers, reinforcing nutrient uptake (that is, ‘get nutrients in') and cell wall integrity, to facilitate root exploration for heterogeneous resources in soil (Fig. 2q,r). This cell layer-specific responsiveness also helps to protect developing roots from abiotic and biotic signals (that is, ‘keep stress out') that are unevenly distributed in natural soils (Fig. 2q,r). These important insights highlight the benefit of applying single-cell profiling approaches on samples grown in a natural soil environment.

Root systems can adapt to contrasting soil stresses, yet how their responses are programmed at the individual cell scale remains unclear. Soil compaction reduces the ratio of air spaces versus soil particles, resulting in higher mechanical strength that impedes root growth and triggers adaptive responses6. To show how individual root cell types exposed to compaction stress modify their gene-expression profiles, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic datasets were generated from roots grown at higher soil bulk density (1.6 g cm−3 compared to 1.2 g cm−3; Fig. 3a–c and Methods). Molecular Cartography revealed most validated cell type markers remained expressed in their target cell types under compacted soil growth conditions (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5b–l and Supplementary Data 7 and 8). This is consistent with the detected high correlation between two soil conditions across most cell layers (Extended Data Fig. 3e,g).

Source Data

Next, we performed a comparative analysis to determine the most transcriptionally affected cell groups and understand the nature of their responses to soil compaction stress. We further checked the DEGs for each confidently annotated root cell type and developmental stage-enriched groups. We identified 7,947 DEGs (fold change greater than 1.5, false discovery rate less than 0.05). Here 42% of DEGs were altered in a single cell type or developmental stage (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Notably, exodermis and endodermis emerged as the two cell layers particularly influenced by soil compaction, showing the highest number of DEGs (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 10).

Analysing enriched GO terms for the most affected cell types, exodermis and endodermis, showed a significant association with cell wall component metabolism (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 6f–h and Supplementary Table 11). The group of cell wall-related proteins with differential gene expressions included EXPANSINS (EXPA), a family of plant cell wall regulatory proteins that facilitate turgor-driven cell enlargement16. Notably, bulk RNA-seq of Xkitaake also showed similar induction of EXPA in compacted soil conditions (Supplementary Table 12 and Extended Data Fig. 7c). The upregulation of EXPA gene expression in both the exodermis and cortex (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 10), is consistent with the observed enlarged cell area for both cell types under compacted soil conditions as roots undergo radial expansion (Extended Data Fig. 7e–h and Supplementary Table 13), necessitating cell wall remodelling of outer root tissues17. A deeper analysis of the DEGs pinpointed several genes encoding xylanase inhibitors, indicative of secondary cell wall formation, given xylan's significant role as a secondary cell wall component18. In addition, xylanase inhibitors are important defence components, primarily found in the cell walls of monocots where they inhibit the hemicellulose-degrading activity of microbial xylanases. This indicates that root defence responses are also activated by soil compaction. In addition, we observed upregulation of other genes involved in cell wall metabolism in the exodermis with soil compaction, including XTH22 (LOC_Os02g57770), OsARF6 (LOC_Os02g06910)19 and OsBRI1 (LOC_Os07g40630)20 (Fig. 3f, top). Similar upregulation of cell wall-relevant genes was detected in the endodermis (Extended Data Figs. 6c and 7a–d), indicating the induction of cell wall metabolism in both exodermis and endodermis.

A group of water stress-responsive genes also showed enhanced expression in both exodermis and endodermis under compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6e). The induction of water stress relevant genes indicates root tissues experience water stress in compacted soils, leading us to investigate the expression of genes relevant to abscisic acid (ABA), which is tightly linked to water stress21,22,23. Significantly, enriched GO terms for upregulated genes in exodermis also included the class ‘response to ABA' (Fig. 3e). We thus checked the spatial expression of ABA biosynthesis genes in our scRNA-seq dataset. We identified strong upregulation of OsAAO1 and OsNCED genes (which encode enzymes catalysing the last steps of ABA biosynthesis) in phloem-derived vascular tissue23 (Fig. 3f, bottom and g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). We also noted induced expression of ABA-responsive genes in other outer cell layers (beside exodermis) in response to soil compaction (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 8c). Moreover, we also found similar induction of ABA biosynthesis genes in our bulk RNA-seq in compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Our scRNA-seq analysis shows that ABA biosynthesis occurs predominantly in inner cell layers, whereas ABA responses are activated in outer cell layers. This aligns with published findings that ABA synthesized in the root stele moves radially outwards with water flux to activate responses in outer tissues24. Hence, our scRNA-seq dataset demonstrates how compaction stress drives coordinated, cell-specific responses to stress signals, such as ABA, progressing from the inner to the outer root cell layers.

Soil compaction is known to exert water stress on roots as moisture release is reduced from the smaller soil pores25. The coordinated regulation of suberin and lignin accumulation in roots is essential to maintain the water balance for various plant species26,27. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed upregulated expression of many lignin and suberin biosynthesis genes in outer (exodermis) and inner (endodermis) root cell layers that can form apoplastic water-impermeable barriers (Extended Data Fig. 6i). We found similar induction of several lignin and suberin biosynthesis genes in our bulk RNA-seq dataset in compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i). To validate our expression results, histochemical staining was performed for lignin (basic fuchsin) and suberin (fluorol yellow) in mature wild-type (WT) rice root tissues exposed to non-compacted and compacted soil conditions. Our imaging of these barrier components revealed higher lignification (Fig. 4a versus 4e) and suberization (Fig. 4b versus 4f) in root exodermal, endodermal and vascular cell types exposed to compacted soil conditions. To test whether compaction stress induced barrier formation is regulated by ABA, we characterized lignin and suberin levels in roots of the rice ABA biosynthesis mutant mhz5 grown in compacted soils28,29. MHZ5 expression is significantly induced by soil compaction in the phloem-related vascular tissue in our scRNA-seq dataset (Fig. 3f). In contrast to WT, mhz5 roots did not show induction of lignin and suberin levels in response to compacted soil conditions (Fig. 4c versus 4g and Fig. 4d versus 4h and Extended Data Fig. 8m–t). Moreover, we also quantified lignin levels in WT and mhz5 root tips grown under both compacted and non-compacted soils, showing a significant increase of lignin in WT, whereas the mhz5 mutant showed no substantial difference under compacted conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8d). To further confirm the role of ABA in regulating barrier formation under compacted soil conditions, we analysed lignin and suberin patterns in two additional ABA biosynthetic mutants (aba1 and aba2), both of which showed minimal barrier induction in compacted soils (Extended Data Fig. 8e–l) Hence, our results show that ABA has a key role in triggering barrier formation during compaction stress conditions, similar to the radial oxygen loss barrier being induced in stagnant soil conditions30.

What is the physiological and functional importance of lignin and suberin barrier formation? One key link between secondary cell wall formation in barriers is the enhanced cell wall stiffness that helps to protect roots from soil mechanical stress. The higher expression and accumulation of lignin and suberin in the endodermis prompted us to analyse the cell wall stiffness of endodermal cells under both non-compacted and compacted soil conditions. Our phonon imaging revealed increased stiffness in the endodermal cell layer under compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7i–n), providing direct evidence of rice roots enhancing cell wall rigidity to deal with mechanical stress.

On the basis of the induction of key water stress-responsive genes and enhanced barrier formation under compaction, we sought to delineate the actual role of the barriers in dealing with water stress in compacted soils. To evaluate this, we performed radial water loss experiments using WT and mhz5 root tips grown in either non-compacted or compacted soil conditions. Three-centimetre-long root tips were excised from soil-grown roots and kept in a humidity-controlled environment to quantify the weight loss, as an indirect measurement of radial water loss. WT root segments grown in non-compacted soil conditions lost half of their water content in just 17 min, whereas root tips exposed to compaction stress took almost 25 min. Hence, cumulative water loss in compacted root tips was roughly 1.5 times slower than in non-compacted root tips (Fig. 4i). This reduction in radial water loss after exposure to compaction stress is not observed in mhz5 mutant root tips (Fig. 4i,j and Extended Data Fig. 8u).

Our results show that ABA has a key role in triggering adaptive responses to compaction stress, which include induction of lignin and suberin barriers in the exodermis and stele cell types, which collectively act to prevent root radial water loss. The induction of ABA biosynthesis is a hallmark of physiological water stress conditions31. Our scRNA-seq approach provides spatial insights into the cascade of signalling events taking place in specific cell types when roots are exposed to soil compaction. In response to this soil stress phloem cells upregulate expression of biosynthesis genes for the abiotic stress signal ABA, which then targets outer root cell types such as the exodermis to form water-impermeable barriers to reduce root moisture loss (Fig. 4k).

Our study shows how cellular-resolution transcriptomic approaches can provide unprecedented new insights into root–soil interactions and adaptive responses. Most root stress studies performed so far have been conducted in aseptic growth systems such as gel-based media. However, plant roots are normally exposed to a heterogeneous soil environment, encompassing a range of textures, microbiomes and levels of moisture and nutrients32. Single-cell transcriptomics showed key transcriptional differences among cell types when grown in a natural soil system versus an axenic gel system. Transcriptional differences were predominantly confined to outer root tissues, whereas inner root cell types showed limited response. Upregulated genes in soil-grown roots included NB-ARC, WRKY48 and those encoding cupin domain proteins and strip rust proteins, known to respond to bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. Transcript levels of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat genes (NLRs) are normally low in the absence of pathogens. The elevated spatial expression of NLRs indicates that outer root cell types are exposed to the soil microbes when cultured in real soil environments. Alternatively, plant roots may deliberately upregulate immune response component expression in outer root cell layers to prepare for the biotic heterogeneity in soil environments. In soil-grown roots, upregulated genes include transporters for macronutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and micronutrients (zinc, iron, magnesium, boron and potassium), as well as genes involved in defence responses, vesicle-mediated transport and cell wall remodelling. This expression pattern illustrates how plant roots sense diverse elements within natural soils and change molecular responses enhancing readiness to biotic challenges, nutrient transport to drive growth and development to explore the soil environments effectively. Thus, sensing of the external environment concomitantly with cell signalling and cellular reprogramming collectively orchestrate the growth and adaptation of plant roots in soil environments.

Root cell types growing in soils have to sense and respond to not only biotic but also abiotic stresses. Our study also explored how root cell types responded to the model abiotic soil stress, compaction. Radial expansion of outer root cell types (including exodermis, cortex and epidermis) represents a hallmark of plant adaptive growth response to soil compaction stress32 (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g). This adaptive growth response, primarily driven by radial cortical cell expansion, will necessitate the remodelling of cortical cell walls and, as a result of this expansion, all surrounding outer root cell layers would also undergo cell wall modifications. Consistent with this, our scRNA-seq dataset revealed enrichment of cell wall remodelling gene classes, including EXPA and GRPs (glycine rich protein genes), in outer cell types (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Also, considering the increased mechanical stress applied to neighbouring cell layers due to the expansion of cortical cells17 the responsive cell layers can either enhance the cell wall stiffness by cell wall remodelling, or expand themselves to release the stress. The accumulation of lignin and suberin at the exodermis and endodermis may also serve to enhance the mechanical stability of root tips. Indeed, our phonon imaging (Brillouin microscopy) provides direct evidence that rice roots reinforce cell wall rigidity at barriers to support and protect root systems and plants under compaction stress.

Soil compaction not only imposes mechanical stress on roots, but also reduces water and nutrient absorption. The latter is due, in part, to compacted soil pores being more difficult for roots to extract water from28,33, creating water stress-like conditions. Consistent with this, our scRNA-seq dataset revealed upregulation of key ABA biosynthesis genes in root vascular cell types in response to compaction stress (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Elevated ABA levels target outer root layers, potentially through the outward water flow24, triggering induced expression of ABA-responsive genes in these cell types (Fig. 3h). ABA-dependent root adaptive responses to compaction stress included elevated lignin and suberin accumulation in water barriers and stele cell types at the root maturation zone, as opposed to the younger regions (Extended Data Fig. 8m–t). We demonstrate that ABA-dependent formation of these barriers facilitates water retention in root tips during compaction stress.

Our study provides direct evidence of cell wall remodelling through increased expression of suberin and lignin biosynthesis genes, specifically in the exodermis and endodermis, as revealed by scRNA-seq data. This enhanced accumulation of suberin and lignin was further validated using fluorescent dye staining and direct quantification of lignin in rice roots. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed many aspects of cell wall remodelling closely linked to cell wall properties, morphology and growth. Beyond EXPA genes, we examined the expression of cellulose synthase (CESA) and xyloglucan biosynthesis genes (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). Both groups showed enhanced expression, with CESAs slightly induced in sclerenchyma and xylem cells, whereas xyloglucan biosynthesis genes showed strong but less cell type-specific patterns. These findings indicate that distinct aspects of cell wall remodelling are regulated by different cell type-specific mechanisms.

Besides ABA, ethylene and auxin are also reported to have roles in root responses to soil compaction. Comparative heatmaps of ethylene biosynthesis and signalling-related genes under compacted versus non-compacted soil conditions (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d,f) show the induction of several prominent ERF and EIL genes. Their enhanced expression was also supported by bulk RNA-seq data (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10). However, no cell type-specific expression patterns were observed for these genes. Similarly, auxin signalling genes show increased expression under soil compaction (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b,e), but without cell type-specific induction. These findings indicate that ABA, rather than ethylene or auxin, drives cell type-specific gene expression changes in response to soil compaction.

Is the ABA-mediated radial water loss prevention functionally connected to root growth in compacted soils? As our previous study has revealed that mhz5, as well as other ABA biosynthesis mutants, aba1 and aba2, all have relatively longer roots than WT in compacted soils28, we propose that increased water loss triggers enhanced root elongation. This may be a direct consequence of impaired cortical radial expansion and potentially reflects a root strategy to rapidly explore water resources.

In summary, our single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data provide insights into how root cells sense and respond to their biotic soil environment and abiotic stresses such as compaction in a cell type-specific manner. The single-cell resolution of our approaches has been instrumental in pinpointing key genes and cell types, pathways and processes, stress signals and inter-cellular signalling mechanisms that enable roots to adapt to growth in soils. Leveraging these new soil-grown root datasets will underpin efforts to develop crops more resilient to complex edaphic stresses and contribute to future-proofing plants against challenging environmental conditions.

The rice line used in this study is Xkitaake, a Kitaake line transformed with the XA21 gene driven by the maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter15,34. To ensure that the presence of XA21 does not influence the gene-expression trends observed in our scRNA-seq analysis, we also included the non-transgenic Kitaake line for comparison. Seeds were dehulled, sterilized with 50% bleach for 30 min and rinsed five times with sterilized water. Rice seedlings were then inserted into Yoshida's media solidified with 0.15% gellan gum (Gelzan, Caisson)35, with the embryo positioned facing upwards. Rice seeds were kept at 30 °C in the dark for 2 or 3 days until they germinated.

For gel-based growth conditions, germinated rice seedlings were then transferred to a Percival growth chamber set to 28 °C, and constant light (2,000 LUX) for 2–3 days before harvesting.

To establish the soil-based growth conditions, Wedowee sandy loam soils from Johnston County, NC, USA (15% clay, 75% sand, 15 g kg−1 organic C, 1 g kg−1 total N, cation exchange capacity (CEC) 6.4 meg per 100 g, base salt, 83%, P = 199 g m−3, K = 78 g m−3, Ca = 804 g m−3, pH 5.8) was used. Soils were air dried, crushed and then passed through a sieve with a 2-mm mesh size. To allow packing of soils to certain bulk densities, the soils were lightly sprayed with sterilized water and mixed thoroughly. Non-compacted soil condition was packed up to 1.2 g cm−3 (1.2 bulk density (BD)), Compacted soil was pressed to make 1.6 g cm−3 (1.6 BD). Soils were packed in three-dimensionally printed mesocosms at bulk density of 1.2 or 1.6 BD and then saturated with sterilized water14. In the soils (both compacted and non-compacted) used in our experiments, excess water was drained through gravitational pull to mimic the near-field capacity conditions. Germinated rice seedlings (maximum of four seedlings per mesocosm) with equivalent length radicles (roughly 0.5 cm) were placed below the soil surface (10 mm), and then grown in a Percival growth chamber set to 28 °C and constant light (2000 LUX) for 2–3 days before harvesting.

Sections (root tip to end of lateral root cap, meristem; end of lateral root cap to the start of root hair elongation, elongation; 1 mm each beyond the start of root hair elongation, maturation 1 and maturation 2) were collected into 10 μl of RNA-later (Ambion) in the lid of a 1.5-ml tube. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, and then processed by grinding with a blue homogenization pestle. RNA was isolated using the Zymo MagBead RNA Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Zymo). RNA was used as input into the Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ FWD RNA-Seq library preparation procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the unique molecular identifier (UMI) PCR add-on kit. Libraries were indexed and pooled on an Illumina NextSeq. Reads were aligned to Michigan State University Rice genome v.7 with the STAR aligner36, deduplicated using UMI-Tools37 and counted with HTSeq-Count.

For rice seedling harvesting, gel-grown rice seedlings were directly pulled out from the growth media and root tips were cut in the enzyme solution within the optimal osmotic conditions. For soil-grown rice seedlings, the three-dimensionally printed mesocosms were opened and rinsed with gentle water flow. The seedlings were exposed and further rinsed with a gentle water flow to remove attached soil particles. Gentle brushing with a small paint brush was also carried out to remove the remaining soil particles. The root tips were then cut in the enzyme solution with the optimal osmotic conditions.

For gel-based scRNA-seq protoplasting sample, roughly 1-cm root tips were harvested from 15–40 roots, chopped with sharp razor for 1 min and then placed into a 35-mm petri dish containing a 70-μm cell strainer and 4.5 ml enzyme solution (4% [w/v] cellulase (ONOZUKA R-10, GoldBio), 1.5% Macerozyme R10 (GoldBio), 0.24% Pectolyase (Sigma P3026), 0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM MES (pH 5.7), 20 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.000194% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). The digestion was incubated on an 85-rpm shaker at 28 °C for 2.5 h with extra pipette mixing every 30 min. The resulting cell solution was filtered twice through 40-μm cell strainers, transferred into a Falcon Round-Bottom Polystyrene Test Tubes and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500g in a swinging bucket rotor. The pellet was washed with 2 ml of washing solution (0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM MES (pH 5.7), 20 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.000194% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged again at 500g for 3 min. The washing step was repeated for one more time and the pellet resuspended in the washing solution (normally 50–80 µl) without CaCl2 at a concentration of roughly 2,000 cells per µl. Cell concentration was counted using a C-chips disposable hemocytometer (Fuchs Rosenthal, 20 µl, VWR, catalogue no. 22-600-102).

For soil-based scRNA-seq protoplasting, the procedure mirrors that of gel-based RNA-seq protoplasting, with modifications to chopping time (reduced to 45 s) and digestion time (extended from 2.5 to 3 h). These adjustments aim to enhance protoplast yield without introducing excessive debris. Despite careful washing of soil from root tips, a significant number of epidermal cells were probably removed, potentially altering the proportions of trichoblast and atrichoblast cells under different growth conditions. We conducted root trichoblast cell-specific reporter image analysis in gel, non-compacted and compacted soil conditions and we did not see a difference in the number of cells expressing the proCSLD1:VENUS-N7 reporter38.

For chromium-based droplet production, we loaded 16,000 (32,000) cells, with the aim to capture 10,000 (20,000 for High Throughput version) cells per sample with the 10X Genomics Chromium 3′ Gene expression v.3 (for sc_7), v.3.1 (for sc_108, sc_109, sc_115, sc_116, sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195 and sc_196) or v.3.1 High Throughput (for sc_199, sc_200, sc_201 and sc_202, sc_303, sc_304, sc_305 and sc_306) kits.

Raw sequencing reads underwent demultiplexing from Illumina BCL files to generate FASTQ files for each sample using CellRanger mkfastq (v.3.1.0, 10X Genomics). Subsequently, reads were aligned to the Oryza sativa genome BSgenome object (BSgenome.Osativa.MSU.MSU7) along with the MSU7 gene annotation file. This alignment was carried out using the scKB script within the COPILOT preprocessing pipeline9, which integrates kallisto39 and bustools40,41. Quality filtering of cells was performed with the R package COPILOT9. COPILOT uses a non-arbitrary scheme to eliminate empty droplets and low-quality cells, using a 5% mitochondrial expression threshold as the criterion for searching the initial cut-off defining low-quality cells (parameter mt.threshold set to 5). A single iteration of COPILOT filtering (parameter filtering.ratio set to 1) was applied, effectively segregating high-quality cells from the background, as indicated by barcode rank plots. To address issues related to doublets and outliers, the resulting high-quality cells underwent further filtering, removing the top 1% of cells based on UMI counts. Putative doublets were identified and removed using DoubletFinder42 with the estimated doublet rate from the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit user guide.

Downstream analyses were conducted using Seurat v.3.1.5. Individual processing and examination of samples were performed, followed by data normalization using SCTransform43. As a standard step in scRNA-seq data processing, we identified protoplasting-induced genes using bulk RNA-seq (Supplementary Table 2). These genes were excluded from our analysis. Specifically, we conducted bulk RNA-seq comparisons between intact roots and digested roots to identify general protoplasting-induced genes. Furthermore, we compared roots digested for 2.5 versus 3 h to account for digestion time effects and further minimize their impact on gene-expression trends in the gel versus soil comparison (Extended Data Fig. 10).

All detected genes, excluding those associated with mitochondria, chloroplasts or affected by protoplasting (absolute log2 fold change greater than or equal to 2), were retained for analysis (Supplementary Tables 2, 5, 8 and 10). PCA was executed by calculating 50 principal components using the RunPCA function (with approx = FALSE). Subsequently, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) nonlinear dimensionality reduction was computed by means of the RunUMAP function using all 50 principal components with default parameters.

These processing steps are detailed and documented in Jupyter notebooks (provided on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice).

Data integration was carried out using Seurat v.3.1.5, following the Seurat reference-based integration pipeline44,45. The sample with the highest median UMI/gene per cell and the highest number of detected genes was selected as the reference (sample name, tz2; Supplementary Data 1). The 12 WT replicates (tz2, tz1, sc_108, sc_109, sc_7, sc_115, sc_116, sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195, sc_196) were used to construct the WT atlas shown in Fig. 1, including two previously published samples (tz1, tz2; Supplementary Data 1). For the integrated object containing eight samples shown in Figs. 2 and 3, comprising gel-grown (sc_192, sc_193, sc_194, sc_195) and soil-grown samples (sc_199, sc_200, sc_201, sc_202), sample sc_201 was chosen as the reference. These processing steps are detailed and documented in Jupyter notebooks (provided on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice).

The cell type annotation for both integrated objects was based on markers (Supplementary Table 3) that have been previously validated and show specific local expression on the atlas UMAP. Marker gene-expression z-scores were calculated depending on clustering. Clusters were defined using the Seurat FindClusters function by testing the modularity parameter, ranging from res = 2 (low) to res = 300 (high), until the reasonable cluster numbers were reached. Coarse and finely-resolved clusters were annotated by comparing average marker gene z-scores. Cells annotated with the same cell identity by both resolutions were considered confidently annotated, forming the consensus annotation. This combination effectively annotated rare cell types while capturing major cell types given that high resolution and low noise provided by low-resolution are balanced. New reference expression profiles for each cell type were built by averaging the expression values for cells in the consensus annotation. All cells were then re-annotated using the correlation-based approach, which calculates Pearson correlation coefficients between each cell and reference expression profiles for cell types, assigning each cell the cell type with the highest correlation coefficient.

To eliminate the potential occurrence of specific cell groups being filtered out during our COPILOT-based scRNA-seq data preprocessing, possibility as a result of induced cell stresses, we also conducted an examination of the cell type identities for the low-quality cells and found no enrichment of any particular cell type (Supplementary Data 9). This confirmed that we have inclusively incorporated high-quality cells representative of all major cell types in an unbiased manner.

For developmental-stage annotation, correlation annotation compared each cell from scRNA-seq to bulk data from morphologically defined sections (Supplementary Data 2) for both the 12-sample WT atlas and the 8-sample integrated object grown in gel versus soil.

We examined the gene expression patterns by plotting the log-normalized, ‘corrected' counts produced by the SCTransform function rather than the batch-corrected ‘integrated' values. The UMAPs were generated with the ‘featureplot' function in the Seurat package.

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the gene expression plotting process are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice.

Rice root epidermal cells were extracted from the integrated Seurat objects (12 gel-grown Xkitaake). Pseudotime was then inferred on the SCT assay of the extracted epidermal cells using Monocle3 (ref. 46). The learn_graph and order_cell functions in Monocle3 package were used to generate pseudotime metadata. Owing to the complexity of defining epidermal principal points, we opted to calculate pseudotime values separately for atrichoblast and trichoblast cells. Subsequently, these values were merged back into the pseudotime metadata. Furthermore, we manually delineated ten developmental groups. The construction of a UMAP representing the pseudotime trajectory and gene expression (SCT) was achieved using the ‘plot_cells' and ‘plot_genes_in_pseudotime' functions in the Monocle3 package. Differential expression analysis for genes was conducted using the ‘graph_test' function within Monocle3. The modular expression trends of DEGs were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap package in R47.

Jupyter notebooks illustrating the pseudotime analysis process are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhumy09/scRNA-seq-for-rice.

Pseudobulk methods, which aggregate cell-level counts for subpopulations of interest on a per-sample basis, have been identified as top performers for cross-condition comparisons in scRNA-seq48,49. Hence, we used a pseudobulk approach implemented in muscat (multi-sample multi-group scRNA-seq analysis tools)48.

Differential expression analysis was conducted for our non-compacted soil-based samples versus gel-based samples, as well as for our compacted soil-based samples versus non-compacted soil-based samples. Pseudobulk expression profiles for individual cell types in each sample were aggregated for these subpopulations by summing the raw counts (RNA assay) using the ‘aggregateData' function. Subsequently, differential expression testing was performed using the edgeR method50 incorporated in the ‘pbDS' function. A gene was considered differentially expressed in a given subpopulation if the false discovery rate adjusted P value was less than or equal to 0.05, absolute fold change was greater than or equal to 1.5, and detection frequency was greater than or equal to 10% in any of the included conditions. GO enrichment analysis was carried out on the DEGs using the R package gprofiler2 (ref. 51). Visualizations were generated using Seurat45, ComplexHeatmap47 and ggplot2 (ref. 52). The full tables containing gene-expression trends and GO term enrichment information for all detected genes and GO terms from the scRNA-seq data comparison across various growth conditions is available in Supplementary Data 10.

The spatial transcriptomic sample preparation followed the protocol provided by Resolve Biosciences, with minor adjustment. Root parts of rice seedlings were isolated and fixed in a paraformaldehyde (PFA)-Triton-X solution: 4% [w/v] PFA (Sigma, catalogue no. 158127) and 0.03% Triton-X (Fisher Sci, catalogue no. AC327371000) in 1× PBS solution. The fixation was conducted within a 20-ml glass scintillation vial (Fisher Sci, catalogue no. 03-340-25N). The vial, containing rice roots, was placed on ice under a vacuum chamber. Vacuum was applied to the rice roots for 10 min, and this was repeated four times. Subsequently, the rice roots were rinsed with 1× PBS and dehydrated with an ethanol gradient (15, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 100%), each concentration for 1 h on ice. The roots were then kept in 100% ethanol overnight.

For clearing the roots, a mixture of ethanol and Histo-clear (VWR, catalogue no. 101412-878) was applied in the following concentrations: 100% ethanol, 75% ethanol + 25% Histo-clear, 50% ethanol + 50% Histo-clear, 25% ethanol + 75% Histo-clear and 2× 100% Histo-clear, each for 1 h. The Histo-clear was then aspirated, and the vial was filled halfway with a mixture of 100% Histo-clear and melted paraplast (Leica, catalogue no. 39601006). The roots were included overnight at precisely 60 °C. The top half of Histo-clear was later replaced with paraplast, following an embedding routine that involved exchanging the top half of the embedding solution twice a day for 2 or 3 days until the sample stayed at the bottom of the containers.

The embedded roots were then mounted into plastic tissue embedding moulds (VWR, catalogue no. 15160-339) with properly adjusted orientation using flamed forceps. Paraplast-embedded roots were cut into 10-µm sections. These root tissue sections were transferred to cover slips provided by Resolve Biosciences, and the cover slip was placed in a slide dryer at 42 °C overnight. To prevent detachment issues, the cover slip could be placed in a 60 °C incubator for 5–30 min before proceeding to the next step.

Tissue sections mounted were deparaffinized with Histo-clear (100% Histo-clear, 100% Histo-clear, 25% ethanol + 75% Histo-clear, 50% ethanol + 50% Histo-clear, 75% ethanol + 25% Histo-clear, 100% ethanol). This was followed by rehydration with an ethanol gradient (100, 90, 80, 70, 50, 30%). The tissue was then permeabilized with proteinase K (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 25530049) buffer: 10 µm ml−1 Proteinase K, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA) and a 0.2% [w/v] glycine (Promega, catalogue no. H5073) solution. The tissue was also refixed with a 4% [w/v] PFA solution and acetylated with an acetylation solution: 0.1 M triethanolamine (Sigma, 90279), 0.5% [v:v] acetic anhydride (Sigma, catalogue no. 320102) and 0.4% [v:v] HCl in 1× PBS. Dehydration with an ethanol gradient (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100%) followed.

Finally, SlowFade antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, catalogue no. S36967) was applied to the tissue, and the cover slip where the tissue sections were mounted was covered with another cover slip. A slide box was used to store the cover slips with root tissue, tightly sealed with parafilm and shipped with dry ice to Resolve Biosciences for messenger RNA (mRNA) detection and imaging, with Molecular Cartography technique.

In brief, preserved mRNA molecules were hybridized with specifically designed probes based on sequence complementarity. Each probe contained a long tail with many binding sites for various fluorescent dyes. These long tails facilitated several rounds of imaging of the same probe with different fluorescent colours, generating a unique barcode for each individual gene.

The probe–mRNA complexes were sequentially coloured, imaged and decoloured for several imaging rounds. Fluorescent signal images captured on the root tissue sections were processed to identify individual mRNA molecules. Detected mRNAs corresponding to the same gene were assigned a unified identity and false-coloured for clear visualization and presentation.

The raw data for the spatial transcriptomic data included in Figs. 1–3, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 5 can be found in Supplementary Data 4 (gel), Supplementary Data 6 (non-compacted soils) and Supplementary Data 8 (compacted soils).

The Resolve Biosciences dataset comprises both stained root images and transcript detection profiles. Staining images using Calcofluor white to visualize cell boundaries were processed using the ImageJ app provided by Resolve Biosciences. The Molecular Cartography plugin facilitated the visualization of mRNA detection. Transcript information was stored in a .txt file, which could be loaded using the Molecular Cartography plugin. Specific genes with mRNA detection were selected, and each assigned unique colours and dot diameters. The resulting mRNA detection images were saved as screenshots. Subsequently, image brightness and contrast were adjusted using the auto-setting in ImageJ, for presentation.

It is notable that the detected mRNA levels in roots grown in compacted soils were considerably lower compared to those grown in gel and non-compacted soil conditions. We suspect this may be due to reduced fixation efficiency. Roots grown in compacted soils undergo radial expansion, enhanced barrier formation and increased mucilage secretion (data not shown), all of which probably hinder formaldehyde penetration into inner cell layers. As a result, mRNA preservation efficiency is diminished, particularly for markers in the stele tissue. Despite these challenges, we successfully identified roughly 20 robust cell type-specific markers under compacted soil conditions, as detailed in Supplementary Data 8.

Root tips (roughly 1 cm) from Xkitaake rice varieties were harvested from gel, non-compacted and compacted soil conditions, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RNA isolation, root tips were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, followed by the addition of 1 ml of RLT buffer to the powdered tissue. RNA was then isolated and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw reads were processed by removing adapter sequences and filtering out low-quality nucleotides (base quality lower than 5). HISAT2 was used to align reads to the Oryza sativa (Japonica) genome, and gene-expression levels were quantified using the fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million mapped reads) method. Differential gene expression (log2 fold change greater than or equal to 1.0) was analysed through read count normalization, model-dependent P value estimation (Padj ≤ 0.05), and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment.

A 4% agarose gel was prepared and poured into a square petri dish, allowing it to cool for 2 min. Rice roots were then embedded in the gel for 45 min. Subsequently, the agarose block containing the root tips was radially sectioned with a razor. Transverse sections, each with a thickness of 500 µm at 0.7 cm from the root tips, were transferred to slides. Calcofluor white staining, at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1, was applied to the transverse sections on slides for 1 min. After aspirating the staining solution, a drop of sterilized water was added on top of the sections. The root transverse sections were imaged using Zeiss 880 Confocal microscopy (excitation wavelength 405 nm, emission wavelength 410–585 nm). For data collection with the confocal microscopy, we used Zen 2009 v.6.0.0.303.

The acquired confocal images in CZI format were converted to TIF format and opened with MorphoGraphX53. The images underwent the following processing steps: (1) Gaussian blur with x-sigma, y-sigma and z-sigma set to 1 µm. (2) Edge detect with a threshold of 100, multiplier of 2, adapt factor of 0.3 and fill value of 30,000. (3) Fill holes with the x and y radii both set to 10, threshold of 10,000, depth of 0 and fill value of 30,000. (4) Marching cube surface with a cube size of 5 µm and a threshold of 2,000. (5) Subdivide meshes and smooth meshes until the final vertices number was close to 700,000. (6) Project signal with minimum distance of 18, maximum distance of 22, minimum signal of 0 and maximum signal of 60,000.

The resulting mesh files, representing the sample structure, were then manually segmented to identify individual cells. The mesh number in segmented cells facilitated the final quantification of cell areas.

Rice roots (WT (cv Nipponbare), mhz5, aba1 and aba2) grown for 3 days under ± compaction conditions were gently removed from the 3D-printed soil columns, cleaned using deionized water and a thin brush, and embedded in 4% melted agarose. The agarose blocks containing the roots were then positioned in a vibratome (Leica), cut into 100-µm thick primary root cross-sections (1–1.5 cm or 2–2.5 cm behind the root tip), and stored in 20% ethanol. For lignin staining, the cross-sections were incubated for 10 min in a 0.2% solution of basic fuchsin dissolved in ClearSee54 and mixed 1:1 with aqueous calcofluor white to stain cell walls55. The stained cross-sections were quickly rinsed with ClearSee and then washed for 1.5 h in fresh ClearSee, replacing the solution halfway through.

For suberin staining, the primary root cross-sections were stained for 10 min in a 0.01% fluorol yellow solution dissolved in pure ethanol, prepared from a 1% fluorol yellow solution dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The stained cross-sections were rinsed once with deionized water and incubated for 10 min in aqueous calcofluor white. Finally, the cross-sections were washed 2–3 times in 50% ethanol for 20 min.

For confocal imaging, primary root tip cross-sections stained for lignin or suberin were mounted in a drop of ClearSee or 50% glycerol, respectively, and positioned on a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope. The excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) settings used were as follows: basic fuchsin, 561 nm (Ex), 600–650 nm (Em); calcofluor white, 405 nm (Ex), 425–475 nm (Em); fluorol yellow, 488 nm (Ex) and 520–550 nm (Em). For both basic fuchsin or fluorol yellow with calcofluor white, a sequential scanning was configured with the corresponding settings mentioned above.

The dried root tips (WT (cultivar Nipponbare) and mhz5 mutant root tips) were grinded into a fine powder using a microcentrifuge tube with two metal beads (3 mm) for 1 min 30 s at 20 Hz, and then solvent extracted with sequential extractions of water (1 ml, 30 min, 98 °C), ethanol (1 ml, 30 min, 76 °C), chloroform (1 ml, 30 min, 59 °C) and acetone (1 ml, 30 min, 54 °C). The extract-free samples were dried under vacuum (overnight, 50 °C) and considered as cell wall residue.

Acetyl bromide lignin was determined as previously described56 with modifications. In brief, 1–2 mg of cell wall residue was incubated in 200 µl of acetyl bromide solution (25% acetyl bromide in glacial acetic acid) in a 2-ml Eppendorf for 3 h at 50 °C. After cooling the samples on ice, 360 µl of 2 M NaOH, 65 µl of 0.5 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 375 ml of glacial acetic acid were added. After centrifuging for 5 min at 14,000g, 50 µl of supernatant and 150 µl of acetic acid were added to wells of a 96-well ultraviolet transparent plate (Thermo Scientific). The absorption was measured at 280 nm with a microtitre plate reader (Microplate-reader SpectraMax 250, Sopachem), SoftMax Pro v.5 was used for collecting data and applying the extinction coefficient for grasses 17.75 g l−1 cm−1. Two technical replicates of each biological replicate were analysed.

Rice seedlings (either WT or mhz5), grown for 3 days under ±compaction, were gently removed from the three-dimensionally printed soil columns. They were then delicately brushed with deionized water to remove soil particles, and the diameter of each seminal root was measured. The primary root of each seedling (4–6 seedlings were used for each replicate) was cut into a 3-cm segment, including the root tip. After gently blotting with paper towels, each segment was positioned inside a five-digit balance closed chamber (Automatic balance, Mettler Toledo) over a thin nylon mesh. The cut ends of the segments were sealed using vacuum grease (Dow Corning) before placing them in the balance.

After 1 min of equalization inside the chamber, the fresh weight was recorded and subsequently, the weight was recorded every 30 s for up to 25–30 min. A constant relative humidity was maintained by adding bags with silica gel, which maintained the relative humidity inside the chambers at 30–35%. The silica gel was replaced after every three replicates. The temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a digital logger. Following the measurements, the root segments were wrapped and preweighed in aluminium foil and placed inside a 65 °C oven for 48 h to obtain the dry mass. The dry mass was subtracted from the initial fresh mass to obtain the total water content of each replicate. Water loss at every time point was recorded to plot the cumulative water loss (percentage of total water content). The length and diameter of the roots were used to calculate the total lateral surface, and the water loss at each time point was divided by this value to obtain the radial water loss rates (µmol m−2 s−1).

Phonon microscopy is an optical elastography technique that uses the phenomenon of Brillouin scattering to probe mechanical information in biological specimens with subcellular resolution. Phonon microscopy photoacoustically stimulates GHz frequency coherent acoustic phonons that, as they propagate through the specimen, periodically modulate the local refractive index that induces resonant optical scattering of a probe laser57. Through conservation of energy, the Brillouin scattered probe photons are frequency shifted by the phonon frequency (the so-called Brillouin frequency shift) and this can be detected either using a high-resolution spectrometer as with Brillouin microscopy58, or interferometrically in the time domain59.

Phonon microscopy is capable of measuring a specimen's mechanical properties through the relationship between the measured Brillouin frequency shift (fB) and the sound velocity (v):

for normal optical incidence where n is the refractive index and λprobe is the optical probing wavelength. Provided n is known a priori, a measurement of the Brillouin frequency shift infers a measurement of the local sound velocity, which is determined by the elasticity of the specimen in the form of the longitudinal elastic modulus (\(M={\rho v}^{2}\)).

An absolute measurement of M requires knowledge about the mass density; however, refractive index and mass density of plant cells have been shown to vary substantially less than inter-specimen and inter-environmental variation in elasticity60. In this work, we use the relative difference in Brillouin frequency shift (\(\Delta {f}_{{\rm{B}}}\)) between the cell wall and the water:ethanol filled cytoplasm as a proxy for the relative difference in cell wall elasticity in compacted and non-compacted conditions. It is worth noting that the longitudinal modulus should not be directly compared with the Young's modulus, as the two describe elasticity at very different time and frequency scales (for example, Hz to kHz deformations compared with GHz); however, it has been shown that there is an empirical relationship between the two quantities61.

The harvested and cleaned root tips (1.5 cm) were embedded in 4% molten agarose within a three-dimensionally printed root tip cassette. Agarose blocks containing the root tips were sectioned transversely into 50-µm slices. These root cross-sections were fixed in 20% ethanol for phonon imaging experiments. A cross-section was laid flat onto a photoacoustic transducer (200-nm thick partially transparent metal:dielectric cavity on a 170-µm sapphire cover slip), covered in roughly 50–100 µl of water:ethanol medium and then topped with a glass cover slip. Residual medium was wicked away and the cover slip sandwich was sealed shut using varnish.

Once placed into the phonon microscope, a region of interest was selected (for example, the endodermis) and a 2D raster scan was performed. A phonon time-of-flight signal was detected at each spatial pixel position, and the relative Brillouin frequency shift (ΔfB) and the acoustic attenuation (αB) were measured for each pixel using a fast Fourier transform and wavelet transform, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7i,j and k,l, respectively). The spatial resolution of the technique will be determined by the optical diffraction limit (a function of optical wavelength and numerical aperture), and in this case was roughly 300 nm. This is greater than the expected thickness of the cell wall, and so the technique is probing the average elasticity of the sample volume weighted by the optical intensity distribution.

To isolate the endodermal region of interest, the Brillouin and attenuation maps were manually segmented based on positioning, morphology and size. From these segmented datasets, ΔfB versus αB cluster maps were generated and then segmented using a two-component Gaussian mixture model. This grouped the data into two clusters that were labelled ‘background' and ‘cell wall'. Intervals of roughly 70% confidence were determined within these clusters and mean ΔfB and αB values were calculated. The distributions identified through the two-component Gaussian mixture model are in good agreement with the spatial positions of the cell walls and cytoplasm regions.

Using the above methodology, we report in Extended Data Fig. 7n that the relative Brillouin frequency shifts in compacted endodermal cell walls are statistically significantly greater than the equivalent cell walls grown in non-compacted conditions (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the measurements extracted from the cytoplasm regions can be used as a control, and a Yuen's t-test indicates that the two groups are not statistically significantly different (P > 0.05). These data indicate that the compacted cell walls have greater elasticity than those grown in non-compacted soils.

a, UMAP with annotations for rice root developmental stages. The cells labelled as “Maturation-1” and “Maturation-2” cannot be distinguished at this stage due to the current limitations in our knowledge. b, Correlation analysis between 12 scRNA-seq datasets. The dataset, tz1 and tz2 are from Zhang et al. Nature Communication 2021. The datasets, starting with “sc_” represent single-cell datasets from the current study. The relatively low correlation observed between “sc_” and “tz” samples could be attributable to differences in cultivars and growth conditions. c, UMAP of epidermal cell populations. Colors indicate groups of equally sized bins based on inferred pseudotime from R-Monocle3 pseudotime analysis. d, UMAP of epidermal cell types of rice primary root. e, Heatmap showing gene expression pattern during differentiation of rice root epidermal cells. Three genes with different expression enrichment timing are highlighted. f-h, Expression curve of selected trichoblast markers along the pseudotime trajectory. i-k, UMAP showing the expression pattern of three selected epidermal cell specific genes.

a, Schematics illustrating the experimental procedures of spatial transcriptomics. Rice roots were fixed with formaldehyde and sectioned to a thickness of 10 μm. Preserved mRNA molecules were hybridized with specifically designed probes based on sequence complementarity. Each probe contained a long tail with multiple binding sites for various fluorescent dyes. These long tails facilitated multiple rounds of imaging of the same probe with different fluorescent colors, generating a unique barcode for each individual gene. The probe-mRNA complexes were sequentially colored, imaged, and de-colored for multiple imaging rounds. Fluorescent signal images captured on the root tissue sections were processed to identify individual mRNA molecules. Detected mRNAs corresponding to the same gene were assigned a unified identity and false-colored for clear visualization and presentation. b-j, Spatial expression pattern of identified cell type specific markers in both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. The root transverse section anatomy illustration is displayed in the bottom right corner of panel a. The insets provide a magnified view (2X) of the target region to enhance visualization of the detected mRNA signals. For the images representing the expression of endodermis marker POEI32, LOC_Os01g67390, arrows indicate the dislodgement of the endodermal layer. Magenta signal for vascular tissue marker expression is also shown to better indicate where the endodermis is. See also Supplementary Data. 3 and 4 for more gene expression data. n = 9 biological replicates for gel-grown root transverse section spatial transcriptomic data. Scale bars: 25 μm.

a, UMAP visualization of cell distribution in the integrative scRNA-seq object, which includes gel-based, non-compacted-soil-based and compacted-soil-based scRNA-seq data. Major cell type cluster annotation is based on the expression of cell type marker genes. For cell clusters in the maturation stage, there was no clear enrichment of any cell type-specific markers. This lack of distinction may be attributed to the convergent nature of mature root cells, a phenomenon also observed in our gel-based scRNA-seq atlas (Fig. 1b). At this stage, due to the absence of markers for mature root cells, we provisionally annotated the large group of cells as “mature root cells”. b, UMAP visualization of 55 cell clusters in the integrative scRNA-seq object, which includes gel-based, non-compacted-soil-based and compacted-soil-based scRNA-seq data. The z-scores (expression enrichment score) of major cell type markers were calculated for each cluster. We used the marker expression patterns (Supplementary Data 4, 6, 8) and the z-score maximum (Supplementary Table 4) to assign each cluster to different cell types. It is noteworthy that the number of captured epidermal cells (Atrichoblast and Trichoblast, cluster 39 and cluster 55) was significantly low under non-compacted soil conditions. To rule out the possibility that we accidentally filtered out epidermal cells as low-quality cells during scRNA-seq data processing with COPILOT, we examined the low-quality cell data. However, we did not observe any evident cell type enrichment in the low-quality cells, suggesting that epidermal cells were not erroneously filtered out as low-quality cells (Supplementary Data 9). c, UMAP visualization of cell distribution in the integrative scRNA-seq object. The high overlap level among almost all the cells indicates the similarity of scRNA-seq data originated from different growth conditions. d, Cell proportion of 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both gel conditions and non-compacted soil conditions. Despite gentle cleaning of soil particles from root tips, a significant number of epidermal cells were likely removed, potentially altering the proportions of trichoblast and atrichoblast cells under different growth conditions. Growth condition itself does not change the trichoblast cell proportion dramatically. Details can be checked in Extended Data Fig. 4i-k. There is a notable increase of exodermis and sclerenchyma cell number in non-compacted-soils samples compared to that in gel conditions. e, Cell proportion of 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both non-compacted soil and compacted soil conditions. The limited number of trichoblast cells detected under soil condition could be due to the cleaning of soil particles from root tips. f, Correlation analysis among the transcriptomic profiles of cells from 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages in both gel conditions and non-compacted soil conditions. Low correlation was detected for the trichoblast cells, possibly due to the limited number of annotated root hair cells. g, Correlation analysis among the transcriptomic profiles of cells from 10 major cell types and 2 developmental stages (meristem and matured root cells) in both non-compacted soil conditions and compacted soil conditions. Low correlation was detected for the trichoblast cells, possibly due to the limited number of annotated root hair cells. h, Correlation analysis included 8 scRNA-seq datasets. The datasets sc_192 to sc_195 are gel-based scRNA-seq samples. The datasets sc_199 and sc_200 are for non-compacted soil samples while sc_201 and sc_202 are for compacted-soil samples. Although the correlation between gel-based and soil-based samples is high, they can still be distinguished from each other based on their differential expression pattern. i-k, Representative images (maximum projection) of pOsCSLD1::VENUS-N7 expressing rice primary roots in gel, non-compacted (NC, 1.2 g/cm3) and compacted (CMP, 1.6 g/cm3) soil conditions. 3 days old rice roots were harvested from gel, and ± compacted soils. Soil grown samples were cleaned and fixed in 4% PFA (washed 5 times in PFA) and cleared for one day in ClearSee. Cleared root tips were imaged under SP8 confocal microscope. n = 3 biological replicates (roots), all showing similar trends. Scale bars represent 100 μm.

Source Data

a, UMAP projection of scRNA-seq from roots grown in gel, and roots grown in non-compacted (NC) soils of a non-transgenic, Kitaake genotype. Colors indicate cell type annotation. b, Correlation analysis between 8 scRNA-seq datasets; gel-based scRNA-seq Xkitaake (sc_192 to sc_195), non-compacted-soil-based Xkitaake (sc_199), gel-based scRNA-seq Kitaake (sc_303 and sc_304) and non-compacted-soil-based Kitaake (sc_305 and sc_306) samples. High correlation values (>0.94) between Xkitaake and Kitaake scRNA-seq profiles, support their overall gene expression similarities. c, The GO term of “Phosphorus metabolic process”, “Vesicle-mediated transport”, “Hormone signalling pathway”, and “Cell wall organization” are still the top enriched GO term for the up-regulated genes in Kitaake in contrasting growth conditions, sterilized gel vs natural soils. The absence of enrichment for the GO term “Defense response” in Kitaake suggests that the XA21 transgene enhances defense responses in Xkitaake under changing growth conditions. The similarity in enriched GO terms for upregulated genes at outer root cells (highlighted with the red box) when the growth condition was changed from homogeneous gel to heterogeneous soils suggests that enhanced nutrient uptake and strengthened cell wall integrity in outer cell layers are common strategies for roots to cope with soil stresses. The one-tailed hypergeometric test with g:Profiler2 g:SCS (Set Counts and Sizes) algorithm for multiple comparison correction was used for the p-value calculation. d,e, Heatmap shows enhanced expression of genes involved in cell wall integrity and nutrient uptake in soil conditions (compared to gel) in Kitaake genotype. The similar induction of genes related to nutrient uptake and cell wall integrity in outer root cells (highlighted with the red box) suggests that Xkitaake and Kitaake respond similarly to the growth condition changes. This further validates that the major trends identified through scRNA-seq analysis on Xkitaake are independent of the XA21 transgene. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis. Annotation for the included genes: Cell wall integrity: LOC_Os01g56130, Xyloglucan glycosyltransferase 1; LOC_Os02g51060, Glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase 6; LOC_Os09g25900, Xyloglucan glycosyltransferase 2; LOC_Os03g18910, COBRA-like protein 7; LOC_Os11g33270, Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase; LOC_Os03g21250, Galacturonosyl transferase7. Nutrient uptake: LOC_Os06g37010, Zinc transporter 10; LOC_OS11g12740, NRT1; LOC_Os10g30770, Inorganic phosphate transporter; LOC_Os12g37840, Boron transporter 1. f, Heatmap showing the induced expression of R (resistance) genes predominantly in outer cells in Xkitaake genotype in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. The R genes were induced when growth conditions shift to natural soils in Xkitaake, particularly in the outer cell layers, indicating the significant role of outer cell layers in the root's adaptation to soil environments. g, Heatmap showing the induced expression of R (resistance) genes in Kitaake genotype in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. The R genes were also induced when grown in natural soils in Kitaake, although the outer cell layer enrichment is not detected in Kitaake background. h, UMAP projection of scRNA-seq from Xkitaake and Kitaake roots grown in non-compacted soils. Colors indicate cell type annotation. i, Heatmap showing expression pattern of R genes in Xkitaake and Kitaake genotypes grown in soil conditions. The R genes show higher expression in Xkitaake roots grown under soil conditions compared to Kitaake roots grown under the same conditions. This suggests that the induction of R genes in soil conditions (compared to gel) can be further enhanced by the XA21 transgene. However, XA21 is not essential for this induction, as it is also observed in the Kitaake background. j, Heatmap showing the induced expression of the other defense response related genes in Xkitaake in soil growth conditions compared to gel growth conditions. Other defense response related genes show increased expression when compared in gel vs soil conditions in Xkitaake background. However, these genes do not exhibit a stronger induction pattern specifically in the outer cell layers. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis. k, Heatmap showing expression pattern of other defense response-related genes in Kitaake genotype in gel versus soil conditions.

a, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Xyloglucan biosynthesis genes are broadly upregulated across major cell types, with a slightly higher induction observed in the exodermis. The stronger induction of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in the exodermis aligns with the observed barrier reinforcement. NC: Non-compacted soils. CMP: Compacted soils. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq also reveals a general induction of xyloglucan biosynthesis genes in compacted soils. The upregulation of these genes suggests enhanced cell wall reinforcement in response to compacted soil conditions. b, Left panel: Heatmap showing differential expression (log2 fold change) of cellulose synthase (CESA) genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Notably, CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 exhibit increased gene expression in sclerenchyma, suggesting enhanced secondary cell wall formation in this tissue under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of CESA genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Interestingly, bulk RNA seq reveals a general down-regulation of CESA genes in compacted soils, although the decrease is subtle for most examined genes. The relatively stronger down-regulation of CESA1, CESA5, and CESA6, combined with the relatively weaker down-regulation of CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8, may suggest a transition toward secondary cell wall deposition. c, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of expansin genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Increased expression of expansin genes, particularly in the exodermis and cortex cell layers, suggests the enhanced cell expansion at exodermis and cortex under soil compaction. Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of expansin genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq further supports the upregulation of expansin genes in compacted soil conditions. The up-regulation of expansin genes correlates with the radial expansion of rice roots in response to soil compaction. d, Left panel: Heatmap showing increased expression (log2 fold change) of xylanase inhibitor genes in compacted soil conditions compared to non-compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake as detected by scRNA-seq. Xylanase inhibitor genes are broadly upregulated across major cell types.

Right panel: Heatmap showing scaled expression of xylanase inhibitor encoding genes in non-compacted and compacted soil conditions in Xkitaake, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. Bulk RNA-seq analysis further supports the upregulation of xylanase inhibitor genes in compacted soil conditions. Grey boxes mean that the gene was not detected during the comparative analysis.

The primary roots were harvested from compacted and non-compacted soils were radially sectioned and imaged using Brillouin microscopy. k,l, Similarly, maps of acoustic attenuation between the two cases demonstrate greater apparent longitudinal viscosity in the compacted soil conditions. Scale bars in i and k: 10 μm; Scale bar in j and l: 10 μm. m, Brightfield image of a rice root radial cross-section (red boxes are the relevant regions of interest in i-l). Scale bar: 50 μm. n, Violin plot showing the cell wall stiffness of rice primary root in compacted and non-compacted soil conditions. The width of each violin represents the kernel density estimation of the data distribution. The solid line within each violin denotes the median, while the dashed lines represent the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3). Q1 corresponds to the 25th percentile of the data, and Q3 corresponds to the 75th percentile. Yuen's t-tests (two-tailed) indicate that there is no statistically significant (NS, p value = 0.7500) relative shift in Brillouin frequency between the cytoplasm (control) regions in non-compacted (NC) and compacted (C) specimens. However, there is a clear frequency shift between endodermal cell-walls between the two cases (p value < 1.0000 × 10−10; *: p < 0.05) indicating greater elasticity for compacted cell-walls. Four cross-sections for each case of compacted and non-compacted were imaged containing 35 and 44 cells respectively. For cell wall measurements, n = 1744 (non-compaction, endodermis), 1843 (compaction, endodermis), 11852 (non-compaction, cytoplasm), and 17592 (compaction, cytoplasm) units, were analyzed respectively.

Metrics details

The Global Flourishing Study is a longitudinal panel study of over 200,000 participants in 22 geographically and culturally diverse countries, spanning all six populated continents, with nationally representative sampling and intended annual survey data collection for 5 years to assess numerous aspects of flourishing and its possible determinants. The study is intended to expand our knowledge of the distribution and determinants of flourishing around the world. Relations between a composite flourishing index and numerous demographic characteristics are reported. Participants were also surveyed about their childhood experiences, which were analyzed to determine their associations with subsequent adult flourishing. Analyses are presented both across and within countries, and discussion is given as to how the demographic and childhood relationships vary by country and which patterns appear to be universal versus culturally specific. Brief comment is also given on the results of a whole series of papers in the Global Flourishing Study Special Collection, employing similar analyses, but with more-specific aspects of well-being. The Global Flourishing Study expands our knowledge of the distribution and determinants of well-being and provides foundational knowledge for the promotion of societal flourishing.

Interest in questions of flourishing has expanded dramatically in recent years. This interest can be seen in various sectors, including psychology, economics, business, education, medicine, public health and public policy1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. While this has led to an expansion in research, much remains unknown, especially as it pertains to flourishing on the global landscape. The research on well-being has been shaped largely by Western perspectives and has been carried out mostly in Western contexts. This work has thus been subject to some critique11, as indeed is the case with social–scientific research more generally12. Such limitations hinder our conceptions of, and knowledge concerning, well-being. The Global Flourishing Study (GFS) was conceived as a large, open-access, 5-year longitudinal panel research study of 22 countries (see Fig. 1), spanning all six populated continents, with nationally representative sampling in each country, to study the distribution and determinants of well-being, to advance our knowledge of flourishing in general and especially in non-Western contexts and to uncover what patterns are culturally specific and which seem more universal. Compared with other cross-national studies of well-being such as the World Values Survey or the Gallup World Poll (GWP)/World Happiness Report13, the GFS aims to supplement and expand upon these by both (1) providing longitudinal panel data on the same cohort of individuals over time and (2) providing a broader range of assessments on well-being or flourishing.

Solid blue, included; light gray, not included.

Flourishing is an expansive concept1,2,5,14,15, and the working definition underpinning the GFS has been ‘the relative attainment of a state in which all aspects of a person's life are good, including the contexts in which that person lives.'5,16 Several aspects of this definition are important. First, flourishing is multidimensional—it concerns all aspects of a person's life. One may be flourishing in certain ways but not in others. No assessment of flourishing will ever fully measure flourishing, only aspects of it. Second, flourishing may be conceived of as an ideal, but it also concerns the ‘relative attainment' of that ideal17. We are never perfectly flourishing in this life, and there is always room for improvement. Third, flourishing concerns both objective and subjective aspects of life, although subjective aspects are more amenable to survey research. Fourth, the understanding of what is ‘good' will vary across cultures and contexts, but there is arguably a great deal of common ground as well, and such common ground is a reasonable starting point for measurement5,18. Finally, flourishing includes the contexts in which a person lives; such contexts include one's communities and environment. While the terms ‘flourishing' and ‘well-being' are often used interchangeably, flourishing arguably has a connotation of also having the environment itself being conducive to growth and being a part of one's flourishing. The community's well-being is a part of one's own flourishing—a person participates in the common good of the community. While well-being might be defined as ‘the relative attainment of a state in which all aspects of a person's life are good, as they pertain to that individual,' flourishing also includes the well-being of the community and environment. However, since individual aspects of flourishing effectively constitute well-being, the two terms will, in many contexts, often be used interchangeably. There may also often be greater consensus across cultures around what is desirable for individual well-being than in understandings concerning what constitutes the right type of community or government, and so the composite flourishing index considered in the following focuses on those individual aspects5. We do, however, also offer further comment on analyses using more community-related assessments.

This Article provides a description of the Global Flourishing Study, including the nature of the sample and data collection and a description of the methodology for the development of the questionnaire, the study design and survey sampling, and the analytic approaches guiding many of the initial analyses of the data. Analyses concerning composite assessments of flourishing are presented as to how flourishing assessments vary across demographic groups and countries and how various types of childhood experiences relate to adult flourishing. Comment is offered on a range of other analyses and studies arising out of the first wave of the GFS data, and discussion given to the study's importance and promotion of flourishing in a global context.

With the concept of flourishing being expansive, there is no unique or fully comprehensive way to partition ‘all aspects of a person's life.' Understandably, numerous well-being classifications have thus emerged1,2,5,14,19. While the GFS included questions from the flourishing conceptualization of ref. 5, the survey development process20,21 incorporated numerous cross-cultural perspectives and questions extending well beyond those proposed in ref. 5. In the following presentation of the initial GFS results, we roughly follow the flourishing domains of ref. 5—health, happiness, meaning, character, relationships and financial security. However, the GFS data and analyses do not presuppose the priority of these domains, and other researchers can certainly recategorize the items.

These aspects of well-being—health, happiness, meaning, character, relationships and financial security—may be understood as paradigmatic of broader well-being categories: physical well-being, emotional well-being, cognitive well-being, volitional well-being, social well-being and material well-being (see Table 1). A perhaps simpler division into domains derives from the World Health Organization's definition22 of ‘health' as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.' The categories used here further divide mental well-being into emotional, cognitive and volitional well-being, corresponding to traditional and empirical division of the mind into emotions, intellect and will23,24,25,26,27,28. Social well-being might itself have further been divided into relational and communal well-being; in more expansive understandings of flourishing, communal well-being might itself be sub-divided into community, political and economic well-being. Again, there is no unique way to divide the conceptual space. Much has been written on including a spiritual dimension within the WHO definition29, thereby yielding, ‘a state of complete physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being,' which we have referred to elsewhere as the WHO+ definition16,17. It is, however, more difficult to attain consensus on understandings of spiritual well-being across the world religions, and we will make some remarks on this matter later in the Article. Finally, material and financial resources are sometimes taken as determinants of well-being and sometimes understood as constitutive elements of well-being30,31,32,33,34. These conceptualizations rightly vary depending on how well-being is defined. We do not take a definitive stance on this matter in the Article and present analyses alternatively including and excluding financial well-being.

In what follows, we describe the GFS methodology, comment on results of the analyses for the composite flourishing index, offer brief comment on numerous papers concerned with more-specific aspects of well-being and conclude by offering discussion on the implications of the study and results for the promotion of flourishing.

Table 2 presents nationally representative descriptive statistics of the observed sample. Slightly more than half were middle-aged (30–59 years old (53%)), women (51%), married (52%), employed (either for an employer or self-employed, 57%) and had between 9 and 15 years of education (57%). Most participants were born in the country in which they were surveyed (94%), and approximately one-third of participants attended religious services at least weekly (32%). Sample sizes in each country ranged from 1,473 (Turkey) to 38,312 (United States). Participant characteristics for each country are shown in Supplementary Tables 1a–22a.

Table 3 presents nationally representative descriptive statistics of the observed sample for retrospective assessments of childhood experiences. Most reported ‘very good' or ‘somewhat good' relationships with mother (89%) and father (80%) and that their parents were married (75%); a large proportion reported their family ‘lived comfortably' (35%) or ‘got by' (41%) financially during their childhood. About 18% of participants reported experiencing abuse and 16% feeling like an outsider growing up; most assessed their health as ‘excellent' or ‘very good' (64%) in childhood. A large proportion of participants attended religious services at least once per week during childhood (41%). The rate of missing data for the first wave of the GFS was low (<5% for any variable). Over all the items used as childhood predictors, the percentage of respondents with any missing data was only 12.9%.

With regard to demographic relations and associations with childhood experiences, we will first comment on the results of random effects meta-analysis across the 22 countries. We then turn to variations across countries. Table 4 presents ordered means of a composite flourishing index. The index includes two indicators each across six domains: happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships and financial security (see Table 5 below and ref. 5). Table 4 presents weighted means so as to be nationally representative within country, and alternately includes means both without and with financial security (10 versus 12 indicators, respectively), with standard deviations, Gini coefficients and alpha reliability coefficients. Without financial security, the highest means were reported in Indonesia (8.47), Mexico (8.19) and the Philippines (8.11); the lowest were in Japan (5.93), Turkey (6.59) and the United Kingdom (6.88). When including financial security, Israel instead of Mexico has the second highest mean. Standard deviations for composite flourishing across countries range from 1.30 to 2.03. Gini coefficients for inequality tend to be highest in those countries reporting the lowest means. Cronbach's alpha for the index is relatively high in all countries. All subsequent tables report results with financial security. Analogous analyses without financial security are given in Supplementary Tables S26–S28.

Table 6 presents random effects meta-analysis of composite flourishing means by demographic category. Aggregated across all countries, flourishing increases with age from 7.03 for those aged 18–49 years to 7.36 for those aged 80 years or older; it is relatively similar for men and women, but lower for those identifying as ‘other' genders. Flourishing is notably higher for those married (7.34) than for those separated (6.77) or divorced (6.85) and higher for those employed (7.20) and self-employed (7.28) than for those unemployed (6.51). Flourishing tends to increase somewhat with education, but more dramatically with religious service attendance, ranging from a mean of 6.86 for those never attending to 7.67 for those attending more than weekly. It is slightly higher for those born in the country (7.16) than for those not (7.02). Results are generally similar when excluding financial security (Supplementary Table 26), but the relations with age are slightly more muted in these analyses.

Table 7 presents results from random effects meta-analysis of multivariate regression of composite flourishing on all childhood predictors (Table 7) simultaneously. Good childhood relationships with mother (0.18; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.24) and father (0.11; 95% CI :0.07, 0.18) were positively associated with adult flourishing. There is some evidence that having parents who were never married (−0.11; 95% CI: −0.21, −0.01), or when one had died (−0.07; 95% CI: −0.16, 0.02), or possibly divorced (−0.07; 95% CI: −0.17, 0.02), compared with having parents who were married, was associated with lower adult flourishing. There is a notable gradient in flourishing with childhood subjective financial status, with finding it very difficult to get by associated with lower flourishing (−0.27; 95% CI: −0.35, −0.19) and living comfortably associated with higher adult flourishing (0.20; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.26) compared with those who got by. A similar gradient can be seen regarding self-rated health growing up: poor health is associated with lower (−0.34; 95% CI :−0.54, −0.14) adult flourishing, and excellent health with higher (0.46; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.62) flourishing compared with those in good health. Abuse (−0.34; 95% CI: −0.40, −0.29) and feeling like an outsider growing up (−0.26; 95% CI: −0.33, −0.18) were associated with lower adult flourishing. Attending religious services weekly was associated with higher adult flourishing (0.27; 95% CI :0.17, 0.36) compared with never attending. Flourishing tended to increase with age, but there was relatively little difference with regard to immigration status, or men versus women.

Table 8 presents E-value (the minimum strength of the association an unmeasured confounder must have with both the outcome and the predictor, above and beyond all measured covariates, for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an association) sensitivity analyses35 of meta-analyzed childhood predictor associations to potential unmeasured confounding. Some of these associations between the childhood predictors and adult flourishing were moderately robust to potential unmeasured confounding. For example, to explain away the association between abuse in childhood with higher adult flourishing, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both absence of abuse and higher flourishing by risk ratios of 1.74-fold each, above and beyond the measured covariates, could suffice, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to shift the 95% confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both absence of abuse and higher adult flourishing by risk ratios of 1.64-fold each, above and beyond the measured covariates, could suffice, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.

The overall patterns in the preceding, pooled over all countries, are illuminating but disguise important country-specific variation (Supplementary Information). We comment on this variation in the following, but caution is needed with regard to over-interpretation, especially in cases when magnitudes are not strong. Flourishing tends to increase with age in many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Sweden and the United States, but not in all. In India, Egypt, Kenya and Japan, patterns are somewhat more U-shaped. In Spain, the pattern is somewhat U-shaped except for the youngest age group (18–24-year-olds), which reports the lowest flourishing. In Poland and Tanzania, it is mostly decreasing with age. Other countries show more complex patterns with age. Men and women are fairly similar globally, but there are greater differences in certain countries. In Brazil, men report higher flourishing than women (0.39; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.47); in Japan, women report higher flourishing than men (−0.26; 95% CI: −0.32, −0.21). The patterns of married individuals reporting higher flourishing than those divorced (or separated) are nearly universal, but differences vary from 0.92 (0.63, 1.22) in Israel to 0.10 (−0.10, 0.30) in Argentina. In most countries, those married report notably higher flourishing than those who are single, but not in all: married report lower flourishing than single in India (−0.39; 95% CI: −0.50, −0.28) and Tanzania (−0.35; 95% CI: −0.51, −0.20). Those employed effectively universally report higher flourishing than unemployed, but again differences vary from 1.50 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.83) in the United States to just 0.09 (95% CI: −0.03, 0.22) in Kenya. There is, however, considerable variation across countries in comparisons of employed versus self-employed, retired or student, with those self-employed and retired reporting higher flourishing than those employed in many developing countries and students reporting notably higher flourishing than those employed in Poland, India, Japan, Tanzania, Israel, Egypt and Kenya. Those attending religious services more than once a week (or weekly) universally report higher flourishing than those never attending, but differences vary from 2.33 (2.12, 2.54) in Hong Kong to 0.15 (−0.01, 0.30) in India. In most countries, those with more education report higher flourishing, but the reverse is the case in Hong Kong and Australia. Associations with immigration status also vary by country, with those born in the country reporting notably higher flourishing in the Philippines, Poland, India, Israel, Mexico and Hong Kong, whereas the reverse is the case in Spain and Australia.

Likewise, with the analyses concerning the childhood predictors, there are some patterns that are nearly universal and others that seem to vary by culture and context. Associations between good maternal relationship and adult flourishing were nearly universal but varied in magnitude from 0.63 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.99) in Indonesia to effectively null (−0.14; −0.43, 0.14) in Israel, and likewise for good paternal relationship. Compared with those with married parents growing up, those with divorced, separated, single or one or more deceased parents tended to have lower flourishing in adulthood, although Turkey was an anomaly with respect to divorce. Compared with a subjective financial status of getting by in childhood, living comfortably was essentially universally associated with higher adult flourishing with magnitudes ranging from 0.70 (0.53, 0.87) in Hong Kong to effectively null (−0.05; −0.17, 0.08) in Nigeria; and finding it very difficult was universally associated with lower adult flourishing with magnitudes ranging from −0.92 (−1.45, −0.40) in Turkey to null (0.00; −0.36, 0.35) in Sweden. Experiencing abuse and feeling like an outsider were likewise universally associated with lower adult flourishing. Excellent, as compared with good, childhood health was universally associated with higher adult flourishing, and while poor childhood health was nearly universally associated with lower adult flourishing, there were possibly a few exceptions: in Germany there was evidence of a positive association (0.40; 0.07, 0.74). Weekly religious service attendance growing up was associated with higher adult flourishing in almost all countries, with the largest effect sizes in Poland (1.02; 0.77,1.28) followed by Hong Kong and Turkey; however, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania manifested slightly negative estimates (−0.22, −0.15, −0.05, respectively), although with confidence intervals including 0. Patterns across countries for immigration status, age/birth cohort and gender roughly followed that reported in the preceding for demographic statistics, although after multivariate adjustment, further gender differences emerged, with notable evidence for women having higher flourishing than men in Egypt, Japan and Hong Kong, and men having higher flourishing than women in Spain, United Kingdom, Brazil, Kenya and Argentina.

The preceding analyses concerned composite flourishing. However, just as pooling across countries is of interest, but obscures country-specific relations, so also the use of a composite flourishing measure can obscure more nuanced relations with more-specific aspects of well-being. A series of papers, following the same methodology described in the preceding, has examined these various more-specific well-being domains, and many of these papers are part of the present GFS Special Collection. While these papers contain far more detailed analysis than can possibly be summarized here, some higher-level remarks may be of interest in trying to understand similarities and differences in relationships with more-specific aspects of well-being. We will provide a cursory overview of some of the results in each of the well-being domains in turn, focusing principally on any patterns that notably diverge from those reported concerning composite flourishing. Many, albeit not all, of the differences concern relations with age, gender and childhood adversity.

Patterns for self-rated physical health36 followed that of composite flourishing in many respects but differed in that scores decreased with age, although with some variation (for example, with U-shaped patterns in Australia, Japan and Sweden), and men report better health than women overall, with the reverse notable only in Japan. Patterns with health limitations37 and physical pain38 were conversely similar, that is, increasing in age. Physical pain was one of the very few outcomes that was adversely associated with religious service attendance38,39. For pain, there was evidence in some countries (for example, South Africa and Israel) that those who financially just got by reported lower levels of adult pain than those who lived comfortably in childhood39. Patterns for self-rated mental health tended to follow those of flourishing, but were U-shaped with age overall, although increasing in Australia, United States and Sweden and decreasing with age in Israel and Tanzania40. Depression and anxiety, assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)41, both decreased with age, were less related to religious service attendance and were somewhat higher for women than men.

With respect to emotional well-being, patterns for happiness and life satisfaction mostly follow those of flourishing, but are slightly more U-shaped (or ‘J-shaped') with age42, somewhat comparable to much previous research43. The increasing-with-age pattern for composite flourishing is thus shaped by other aspects of well-being documented in the following. There are also notable differences in the country-specific reporting and in some of the demographic relationships between life satisfaction, life evaluation and affective happiness, and further discussion of these matters and of differences between the GFS and the GWP is given elsewhere42. In contrast to life satisfaction/evaluation, the outcomes of balance, inner peace and optimism are all increasing with age44,45. Patterns with mastery are similar but somewhat smaller in magnitude46. In contrast to many outcomes, suffering is not strongly patterned with age overall, or with religious service attendance, but there is notable variation in this across countries; suffering varies more with marital status, employment, education and gender, with women reporting higher suffering than men in most countries47 even after multivariate adjustment48.

Meaning and purpose manifest similar demographic relationships as with composite flourishing and are likewise increasing with age49. For meaning and purpose, the relationships with childhood adversity seem more complex. Death of a parent seems to matter more for meaning and purpose in Spain, Israel and Nigeria than in Australia, Philippines, Argentina or Japan (wherein estimates were positive, albeit with wide confidence intervals). In some countries (United States), difficult, or even very difficult (Argentina), childhood financial circumstances were associated with higher adult meaning, and in others (Poland), living comfortably was associated with lower adult meaning. By contrast, childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider were essentially universally associated with lower adult meaning50.

Concerning character (‘volitional well-being'), assessments of promoting the good are mostly increasing with age (although not in all countries; in India and Tanzania this was decreasing with age); were slightly higher with women and notably higher with religious service attendance51,52. Similar patterns were manifest with more objective behaviors such as, within the last month, volunteering, charitable giving and helping a stranger, although charitable giving and helping were slightly higher among men, volunteering was more uniform in age (until decreasing at 80+), and helping a stranger decreased with increasing age53,54. The relationships of these behaviors with childhood adversity were also more complex. Childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider predicted higher adult volunteering, giving and helping; the relationship with childhood health with both volunteering and charitable giving was U-shaped with both excellent childhood health and poor childhood health predicting higher adult volunteering than good health55,56. By contrast, abuse, feeling like an outsider, poor childhood health and difficult childhood financial circumstances all tended to decrease capacity for delayed gratification, showing love/care for others, gratitude and hope57,58,59,60, although none of these variables mattered for forgiveness61. Forgiveness, gratitude and showing love/care were all increasing with age; hope was relatively flat with age; and adult delayed gratification was decreasing with age. Women reported higher gratitude and love/care than men and reported similar forgiveness and hope overall, but higher after multivariate control58,60,61,62,63,64.

With regard to social well-being, patterns for close social relationships mostly followed those of composite flourishing65,66 except women reported very slightly higher than men, and there was little relationship with education overall. Those with lower education reported higher relationship quality in Indonesia, Kenya, Sweden and the United States, but this pattern was reversed in Brazil, Israel, Japan and Poland. In general, those who were married reported the highest relationship quality, but widowed individuals did so in 6 of the 22 countries. Having an intimate friend was roughly constant with age (but highest among 80+); by contrast, having social support was U-shaped with age, higher for women and higher for students and those retired than for those employed; other patterns were relatively similar to that of composite flourishing67.

Patterns showed somewhat more variation with communal dimensions of social well-being. For non-religious community engagement, weekly participation decreased with age, was slightly higher for men, higher for those single than married, higher with students than the employed, but itself increasing with religious service attendance68. Having a sense of belonging within the country followed many of the same patterns as composite flourishing but was slightly higher for women, slightly decreasing with education and notably higher for those born within the country69,70. Similar results pertain to the demographic relations with satisfaction with the city or area in which one lives (‘place satisfaction'), except for essentially no male–female difference and a weaker relation with being born within the country. Trust within the country and feeling one had a political voice were both slightly U-shaped with age and slightly higher for men; with political voice, but not trust, which was increasing with education71,72. Other patterns were relatively similar to that of composite flourishing.

Concerning financial well-being, many of the patterns follow those of composite flourishing, especially with respect to the childhood predictors73. However, across the subjective and objective financial well-being indicators, there were additional important differences, especially with respect to age, gender and religious service attendance. See ref. 73 for further details.

With respect to spiritual well-being, as noted previously, how this is understood will vary by tradition and culture. Moreover, many of the religious or spiritual GFS assessments concern behaviors or beliefs that may be determinants of well-being, rather than constituting spiritual well-being per se. We consequently restrict comment to a single item involving feeling loved or cared for by God or a spiritual force74. Even this, of course, may not be applicable in non-theistic religious traditions. We thus focus on the sub-analysis that excludes respondents who indicate that the question is not relevant. The patterns for this indicator follow fairly closely those for composite flourishing except proportions are higher for women, slightly U-shaped with education and higher for those who have immigrated.

The patterns across countries are complex, and there is no straightforward way to summarize results across all of the indicators and papers. There is considerable variability in the ordered means of countries across indicators (Supplementary Table 29). However, as will be discussed, such ordering of means needs to be interpreted cautiously since interpretation of items and response scales may vary by language and culture75,76. The interpretation of these thus often makes sense only on a relative basis within countries. In Table 9, we report, for each country, the four well-being indicators (out of 47 total) for which the country, relative to the other indicators, ranked highest, and the four indicators for which the country, relative to the other indicators, ranked lowest, to give some indication of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each country.

With regard to the primary results from the flourishing index, several comments merit attention. One of the more concerning results is the relation with age. On average, when pooled across the 22 countries, flourishing is essentially flat with age through ages 18–49 and then increases with age thereafter. This is in striking contrast to earlier work—focused mostly on life satisfaction/evaluation—which had suggested a more dramatically U-shaped pattern with age43. Even with life satisfaction, pooled over the 22 GFS countries, this is now more J-shaped than U-shaped. As noted in the preceding, the increasing-with-age pattern in 2023, when pooled across GFS countries, now also holds on average with many specific aspects of well-being, including balance, inner peace, mastery, optimism, meaning and purpose, promoting good, charitable giving, forgiveness, gratitude, showing love/care, relationship quality, feeling belonging, place satisfaction and feeling loved by God or a spiritual force. Earlier nationally representative 2022 data in the United States identified these patterns with all of the various flourishing domains, including life satisfaction77. There is also other corroborating evidence concerning changes in patterns between age and life evaluation and mental health78,79,80. While there are distinctions across measures, covariate controls and countries, the cumulative evidence here and elsewhere likely reflects some real changes in well-being's relation with age that have been taking place over time. Young people are not doing as well as they used to be. While causes are likely diverse, mental health concerns with young adults are clearly on the rise. These patterns are not universal. As noted, in some countries the patterns concerning flourishing and age are still somewhat more U-shaped (India, Egypt, Kenya, Japan) and in others (Poland, Tanzania) decreasing with age. Nevertheless, the overall global pattern is troubling. An open question concerns whether these relations constitute a newly patterned ‘age effect' or whether this is in fact a new ‘cohort effect.' This will be resolved only with more data over time. It is possible that because of social and economic conditions, it simply is more difficult to be young today, but that well-being for these young people will increase with age. It is, however, also possible, for example, that, within-person, over time, well-being will continue to follow a U-shaped pattern (but with the mean of that U lower) so that the younger cohorts will decline in well-being over time. Only future waves of data collection will be able to distinguish between these two possibilities, or their combination. It should also be noted that the answer to this question is not predetermined, and in fact depends a good deal on the extent to which policy is shaped to try to better support the well-being of young people.

Some of the other pooled results presented are relatively unsurprising in the context of the existing literature. The well-being literature, focused mostly on life satisfaction/evaluation, has consistently replicated the results with marriage, employment and religious service attendance5,32,81, for example, and these patterns were relatively consistent across countries in the GFS. While the analyses here are purely descriptive, other longitudinal, experimental and quasi-experimental studies suggest that each of these factors also has a causal role; they are likely ‘pathways' to flourishing5. What was interesting in this context, however, is how substantially the magnitudes of differences in flourishing related to these demographic factors varied across countries. Future research could aim at trying to understand the explanations for these differences and whether different cross-cultural mechanisms or moderators (or possibly different patterns of confounding) may be at play. Similar considerations pertain to the differences across countries observed in the relations between flourishing and education, immigration and gender.

It is of course challenging to condense all of the varying evidence into a limited number of high-level insights. We will, however, offer three additional, admittedly selected, summary points of interest. First, flourishing is multidimensional, and different countries are flourishing in different ways. While many developed nations report comparatively higher levels of financial security and life evaluation, these same nations are not flourishing in other ways, often reporting lower meaning49, pro-sociality51 and relationship quality65. Japan reports strikingly low scores on many well-being indicators, and this appears to be not purely an artifact of a tendency to report in the middle of 0–10 response scales82 since the same patterns hold with binary indicators. Other, often middle-income, nations, such as Indonesia, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines report higher on these other more humanistic aspects of flourishing. The more material and the more humanistic forms of well-being sometimes diverge. While purely descriptive, the negative relationship between meaning and gross domestic product per capita is particularly striking49 and has been confirmed in previous work83. This may raise important questions about how to carry out economic development in ways that do not compromise meaning and purpose. The claim being made here is not a causal assertion about gross domestic product lowering meaning. Rather, the desired outcome of a society is presumably one with both high levels of economic development and high levels of meaning, and the question is then how to attain this. Similar considerations may pertain to relationships and character.

Second, there can sometimes be complex relationships between adversity and subsequent flourishing. Often adversity is indeed detrimental, and work must be done to address conditions of adversity and suffering. But sometimes these adverse conditions can for some give rise to development and growth and certain forms of flourishing84,85. The patterns are, however, complex, both across countries and across outcomes. In some countries, more adverse childhood socioeconomic circumstances were associated with lower levels of adult pain, perhaps suggesting a developed resilience. In the United States and Argentina, difficult childhood financial circumstances were associated with higher adult meaning. These patterns pertain to some countries but not others. However, there is also variation across outcomes. Aggregating across all countries, childhood abuse and feeling like an outsider somewhat surprisingly predicted higher levels of adult volunteering, giving and helping but predicted lower levels of showing love/care for others. The effects on these seemingly closely related outcomes are in opposite directions. More work needs to be done to understand the conditions or responses to adversity and suffering that lead to growth, rather than further decline. While more can and should be done to address suffering and adverse circumstances, some experience of suffering seems ubiquitous and an almost unavoidable part of the human condition86,87. In addition to trying to reduce suffering, we should also better seek to understand how we might approach and transform such suffering, when we cannot eliminate it, to enable, when possible, further flourishing85, and we should better understand the limits of such approaches.

Third, in both the demographic analyses and in the childhood predictor analyses, religious service attendance was one of the factors most consistently associated with present or subsequent well-being, across countries and across outcomes. This is consistent with much previous literature focused principally on the West88,89,90,91,92, but now expanded to a broad range of countries. Service attendance was not beneficially associated with all well-being outcomes. It was associated with slightly higher levels of suffering and of physical pain, which may arise from either differing experiences of it or sensitivity to it. However, with the vast majority of other well-being outcomes, in both the demographic analyses and the childhood predictor analyses, there were beneficial dose–response associations with service attendance, often with a fairly steep gradient. This does not of course guarantee that such associations will be found in all countries, but it is nevertheless notable that they do pertain to many of the 22 GFS countries. While the demographic analyses are purely descriptive, the childhood predictor analyses are intended to provide some evidence for causality. The near ubiquity of these associations is thought-provoking, and this factor is arguably too often neglected in our understanding of well-being and its trends over time. While the present data are insufficient to provide definitive evaluation, it is quite possible that the divergence of material and more humanistic forms of well-being noted in the preceding is in large part due to the declining religiosity of more economically advanced nations. We may need a reconsideration of spiritual pathways to well-being.

The strengths of the GFS are many and include nationally representative samples; broad cultural, geographical and non-Western coverage; large sample sizes; and indicators of numerous well-being and other outcomes along with their determinants. While there are other important multi-country international datasets that are already available (for example, GWP, World Values Survey, International Social Survey Program), the GFS has the advantage of a much wider breadth of well-being constructs and (starting with Wave 2) a longitudinal panel data structure.

The GFS and the analyses presented in this Article, however, undoubtedly also have limitations. While the GFS has a broad range of constructs and indicators and broad geographical coverage, many of the constructs are assessed with a single indicator. Although resulting issues of power are partially offset by large sample sizes, this does not mitigate concerns about validity and conceptual breadth for any given construct. The single indicators were selected on the basis of previous work on longitudinal predictive power and strong correlations with other indicators within a scale21, but this does not entirely resolve the concerns. The assessments are also based on self-report survey responses and may be subject to self-report biases and mode effects, which we also comment on in the following. Moreover, such insights principally concern subjective rather than objective aspects of flourishing.

It should also be noted that while the samples within each country were constructed to be approximately nationally representative, the countries themselves do not constitute a random sample of all countries. Rather, as noted, the countries were selected to (1) maximize coverage of the world's population, (2) ensure geographic, cultural and religious diversity and (3) prioritize feasibility and existing data collection infrastructure. The countries do come from all six populated continents and constitute nearly half of the world's population (with mainland China included in the second wave of the study, nearly two-thirds). However, no low-income countries are represented, although lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries are. Results may of course differ in other countries, perhaps especially those with higher levels of conflict or adversity. The meta-analytic means should thus be interpreted in the context of the 22 countries in the study, and these may be higher than global means. Thus, for example, using 2023 GWP data, the mean life evaluation across the 22 GFS countries is 5.91 (95% CI: 5.49, 6.33) whereas the mean across all 142 GWP countries is 5.60 (95% CI: 5.41, 5.78); and further mean differences comparing GWP and GFS may arise due to seasonality and mode effects21. Conclusions here should thus be restricted to the 22 GFS countries. The variation of results across countries also makes clear that extrapolation to other countries may be unwarranted. Nevertheless, as noted, some of the patterns appear to be universal across the 22 countries, and for these one might speculate that they may hold more generally, although this is not guaranteed.

With regard to limitations of the analyses presented in this Article, caution is needed in interpreting cross-national differences as these may be influenced by matters of translation75,76, different modes of assessment, differing interpretation of items and of response scales, and seasonal effects arising from data being collected in different countries at different times of the year. Table 5 should thus be interpreted as simply providing ordered means across what are somewhat differentially interpreted items, not as ‘rankings.' In addition, the demographic analyses are purely descriptive and should not be interpreted causally. The childhood predictors analyses constitute a synthetic longitudinal study and may provide some evidence for causality but should be interpreted cautiously. The childhood predictors assessments are retrospective and may be subject to recall bias. Nevertheless, for recall bias to completely explain away the observed associations would require that the effect of adult well-being on biasing retrospective assessments of the childhood predictors would essentially have to be at least as strong as the observed associations themselves93, and some of these were quite substantial. The childhood predictors analyses may also be subjected to unmeasured confounding, although these concerns were at least partially addressed through the E-value sensitivity analyses, and in some cases the associations were found to be quite robust. We did not regress current flourishing outcomes contemporaneously on all demographic factors as such analyses would have been purely cross-sectional and yet weaker in terms of capacity for providing causal evidence94. However, future waves of data will give further insight into potential causal relationships concerning well-being and its various potential determinants.

The GFS, and these initial results, help provide foundational knowledge for the promotion of societal flourishing. Understanding the distribution of flourishing across the globe, and by demographic group, helps us to understand who needs help, and in what ways. It allows us to identify the groups toward whom interventions or policies might be targeted to improve well-being. Our analyses likewise give insight into how childhood experiences shape well-being, which may be of interest both descriptively and in future intervention and policy development aimed at preventing adverse childhood experiences that impede adult flourishing. One cannot, however, erase the past, and the analyses here also suggest that sometimes adversity can give rise to greater resilience and can be a pathway for growth. Understanding under what circumstances this can and does take place and how it might be facilitated, and its limits, will be an important direction for future research.

The results also raise important questions for the future progress of society. Are we sufficiently investing in the future given the notable flourishing–age gradient, with the youngest groups often faring the most poorly? Can we carry out economic development in ways that do not compromise meaning and purpose and relationships and character, given that many economically developed nations are not faring as well on these measures? With economic development and secularization, have we sometimes been neglecting, or even suppressing, powerful spiritual pathways to flourishing? The very word ‘flourishing' can arguably be used either as an abstract noun to indicate a state (as per the composite flourishing index) or to suggest a dynamic process of growth95. How can each nation grow and flourish? If society is to ultimately pursue flourishing, these questions of age, and of economic development, and of spiritual dynamics need to be taken into consideration.

More remains to be done both to understand and to respond to these questions and challenges. The GFS is an open-access data resource available through the Center for Open Science. In addition to our analyses, we hope many others will access the data and contribute other important insights, insights that might advance our knowledge of and capacity to promote human flourishing. What we measure shapes what we discuss, what we know, what we aim for and the policies put in place to achieve those aims. We hope that the GFS itself, and the understandings that arise from it, will shift discussion and policy toward the promotion of flourishing.

We will first describe the methodology for the questionnaire development; then the measures, data collection, and sampling; and finally the analytic methods used both for descriptive statistics and for assessing associations of flourishing with childhood experiences assessed retrospectively.

Development of the questionnaire for the GFS took place over eight distinct phases: (1) selection of core well-being, religion and demographic questions; (2) solicitation of further well-being, social, political, psychological, economic, community and health questions from domain experts (for example, gratitude, social connection, etc.) worldwide; (3) feedback and questionnaire refinement from scholars around the world representing numerous academic disciplines on survey questions and structure; (4) input and questionnaire refinement from experts in multicultural survey research and survey translations; (5) feedback and questionnaire refinement from an open invitation to comment on the survey, posted publicly and sent to numerous listservs, with input from over 150 scholars; (6) further questionnaire refinement via input from Gallup's survey design specialists; (7) adaptation of items from an interviewer-administered to a self-administered survey instrument using best practices for web survey design to minimize item non response, illogical responses and incomplete responses; and (8) translation into other languages and subsequent confirmation by scholars in several participating countries that translations accurately captured the intended meaning of each question. This was then followed by piloting and cognitive interviews in all of the participating countries and subsequent introduction of retrospective childhood experience questions when it became clear that the intake and annual survey were to be separated in settings not administered by web. During the translation process, Gallup adhered to the TRAPD model (translation, review, adjudication, pretesting and documentation) for cross-cultural survey research96. See refs. 20,21 for more detailed information on the questionnaire development and the refinement of the survey, and survey items, at each stage.

Wave 1 of the GFS data included the following countries and territories: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of China), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States (Fig. 1). The countries were selected to (1) maximize coverage of the world's population, (2) ensure geographic, cultural and religious diversity and (3) prioritize feasibility and existing data collection infrastructure. Data collection was carried out by Gallup Inc. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Gallup and of Baylor University. Gallup secures in-country institutional review boards in countries where local authorities request one. Data for Wave 1 were collected principally during 2023, with some countries beginning data collection in late 2022 and exact dates varying by country97.

Four additional waves of panel data on the participants will be collected annually from 2024 to 2027. Data from Hong Kong (S.A.R. of China) are available in the first wave of data collection. Data from mainland China were not included in the first data release due to fieldwork delays. The first wave of fieldwork in mainland China began in February 2024, with a second wave in November–December 2024. All Wave 1 and 2 data from mainland China are part of the April 2025 dataset release. The precise sampling design to ensure nationally representative samples varied by country, and further details are available in refs. 97,98. Survey items included aspects of well-being such as happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships and financial stability5, along with other demographic, social, economic, political, religious, personality, childhood, community, health and well-being variables. Data were also collected concerning retrospective assessments of childhood experiences. The data are freely available to all through the Center for Open Science99, upon submission of a pre-registration.

The study population consisted of 202,898 adults: ages 18–24 years (n = 27,007 (13%)); 25–29 years (n = 20,700 (10%)); 30–39 years (n = 40,256 (20%)); 40–49 years (n = 34,464 (17%)); 50–59 years (n = 31,793 (16%)); 60–69 years (n = 27,763 (14%)); 70–79 years (n = 16,776 (8.3%)); 80 or older (n = 4,119 (2.0%)); missing (n = 20 (<0.1%)). Of these adults, 98,411 (49%) were male, 103,488 (51%) were female, and 602 (0.3%) indicated other. Data on gender were missing from 397 (0.2%). All participants provided informed consent to participate. Participants were generally compensated US$3–$6 depending on the country.

Continuous age was classified as 18–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79 or 80 or older. Gender was assessed as male, female or other. Marital status was assessed as single/never married, married, separated, divorced, widowed or domestic partner. Employment was assessed as employed, self-employed, retired, student, homemaker, unemployed and searching, or other. Education was assessed as up to 8 years, 9–15 years or 16+ years. Religious service attendance was assessed as more than once per week, once per week, one to three times per month, a few times per year or never. Immigration status was dichotomously assessed with: ‘Were you born in this country, or not?' Religious tradition/affiliation was captured with the categories of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Jainism, Shinto, Taoism, Confucianism, Primal/Animist/Folk religion, Spiritism, African-Derived, some other religion, and no religion/atheist/agnostic; precise response categories varied by country76. Racial/ethnic identity was assessed in some, but not all, countries, with response categories varying by country.

Relationship with mother during childhood was assessed with the question: ‘Please think about your relationship with your mother when you were growing up. In general, would you say that relationship was very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, or very bad?' Responses were dichotomized to very/somewhat good versus very/somewhat bad. An analogous variable was used for relationship with father. ‘Does not apply' was treated as a dichotomous control variable for respondents who did not have a mother or father due to death or absence. Parental marital status during childhood was assessed with responses of married, divorced, never married, and one or both had died. Financial status was measured with: ‘Which one of these phrases comes closest to your own feelings about your family's household income when you were growing up, such as when YOU were around 12 years old?' Responses were lived comfortably, got by, found it difficult and found it very difficult. Abuse was assessed with yes/no responses to ‘Were you ever physically or sexually abused when you were growing up?' Participants were separately asked: ‘When you were growing up, did you feel like an outsider in your family?' Childhood health was assessed by: ‘In general, how was your health when you were growing up? Was it excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?' Immigration status was assessed with: ‘Were you born in this country, or not?' Religious service attendance during childhood was assessed with: ‘How often did YOU attend religious services or worship at a temple, mosque, shrine, church or other religious building when YOU were around 12 years old?' with responses of at least once per week, one to three times per month, less than once per month or never. For additional details on the assessments, see the GFS codebook (https://osf.io/cg76b) or ref. 20.

The primary outcome measure in this Article concerns a composite index for individual aspects of flourishing5 using two self-report questions in each of six domains: happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, and financial and material stability (Table 2). The composite flourishing index is simply a mean of the individual indicators and should be understood as nothing beyond the average of each of the more meaningful domain scores5. This is an index—not a scale—and aggregates across a number of disparate aspects of well-being. There is a somewhat arbitrary nature to an index insofar as one could always include more, or fewer, or different items, but ideally a suitable well-being index would have considerable conceptual breadth across numerous domains100. This particular assessment has received considerable empirical validation in cross-cultural research101,102,103,104. Other papers in the special collection focus on specific aspects of well-being or its determinants, including numerous questions that are not included in the 12-item composite. Brief comment is made on the results of these and on when the patterns differ from that of composite flourishing to provide a more comprehensive description of the results. While the flourishing index assesses various individual aspects of flourishing, comment is also made in the following, and in the other papers in the special collection on more community-oriented aspects of flourishing. Also reported in the Supplementary Information are similar analyses to those in the tables but carried out using only the first five domains (excluding financial and material stability) as financial resources are often considered an important determinant of flourishing, rather than a constitutive part of flourishing.

Descriptive statistics for the full sample, weighted to be nationally representative within each country, were estimated for each of the demographic variables. Nationally representative means for the flourishing index were estimated separately for each country and ordered from highest to lowest along with 95% confidence intervals, standard deviations, Gini coefficients (for assessing inequality in the population distribution of flourishing) and alpha reliability coefficients. Variation in means for the flourishing index across demographic categories were estimated, with all analyses initially conducted by country (Supplementary Tables S1–S22). Primary results in the tables consisted of a random effects meta-analyses105,106,107 of country-specific flourishing means in each specific demographic category along with 95% confidence intervals, standard errors, lower and upper limits of a 95% prediction interval across countries, heterogeneity (τ) and I2 for evidence concerning variation of flourishing means within a particular demographic variable across countries108. Meta-analysis was employed over hierarchical modeling so as not to presume measurement invariance107,109. Forest plots of estimates are available in the Supplementary Information (parts 2–4). All meta-analyses were conducted in R110 using the metafor package111. Within each country, a global test of variation of outcome across levels of each demographic variable was conducted, and a pooled P value112 across countries reported concerning evidence for variation within any country. Bonferroni corrected P-value thresholds are provided on the basis of the number of demographic variables113,114. Religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity were used, when available, as control variables within country, and associations by country are presented in Supplementary Tables S1–S29 but are not meta-analyzed since the availability of these response categories varied by country. See ref. 107 for more extensive description on the analytic methodology for the demographic analyses for this Article and other papers in the special collection.

Descriptive statistics for the observed sample, weighted to be nationally representative within country, were estimated for each childhood demographic category. A weighted linear regression model with complex survey adjusted standard errors was fit within each country of composite flourishing on all of the aforementioned childhood predictor variables simultaneously. In the primary analyses, random effects meta-analyses of the regression coefficients105,106,109 along with confidence intervals, estimated proportions of effects across countries with effect sizes larger than 0.1 or below −0.1, heterogeneity (τ) and I2 for evidence concerning effect size variation within a given predictor category across countries are given108. Forest plots of estimates are available in the Supplementary Information (part 4). Religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity were used within country as control variables, when available, but these coefficients themselves were not included in the meta-analyses since categories/responses varied by country. Within each country, a global test of association of each childhood predictor variable group with outcome was conducted, and a pooled P value112 across countries was reported concerning evidence for association within any country. Bonferroni corrected P-value thresholds are provided on the basis of the number of childhood predictor variables113,114. For each childhood predictor, we calculated E-values to evaluate the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding. An E-value is the minimum strength of the association an unmeasured confounder must have with both the outcome and the predictor, above and beyond all measured covariates, for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an association35. See ref. 109 for a more extensive description on the analytic methodology for the childhood predictor analyses for this Article and other papers in the special collection.

As supplementary analyses, population weighted meta-analyses, using 2023 population sizes, were also conducted.

Missing data on all variables were imputed using multivariate imputation by chained equations, and five imputed datasets were used115,116,117,118. To account for variation in the assessment of certain variables across countries (for example, religious affiliation/tradition and race/ethnicity), the imputation process was conducted separately in each country. This within-country imputation approach ensured that the imputation models accurately reflected country-specific contexts and assessment methods. Sampling weights were included in the imputation models to account for specific-variable missingness that may have been related to probability of inclusion in the study.

The GFS used different sampling schemes across countries based on availability of existing panels and recruitment needs97. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design components by including weights, primary sampling units and strata. Additional methodological detail, including accounting for the complex sampling design, is provided elsewhere97,98.

All analyses were pre-registered with the Center for Open Science (https://osf.io/registries/gfs) before data access; all code to reproduce analyses are openly available in an online repository119.

We thank everyone who has contributed to the development of the GFS, as outlined in greater detail in ref. 15. This includes especially the study participants in all countries, along with the translators, interviewers, partners, vendors and Gallup team in all of these countries, the many scholars from numerous global institutions who were involved in more substantial ways in question selection and validation of the survey instrument, and the very many people around the world who provided detailed feedback, suggestions, additions and revisions during the open global feedback phase of the questionnaire development. The Global Flourishing Study was supported by funding from the John Templeton Foundation (grant no. 61665, B.R.J., T.J.V.), Templeton Religion Trust (no. 1308, B.R.J., T.J.V.), Templeton World Charity Foundation (no. 0605, B.R.J., T.J.V.), Well-Being for Planet Earth Foundation, Fetzer Institute (no. 4354, B.R.J., T.J.V.), Well Being Trust, Paul L.

Under Trump's second administration, the fragile preservation of abortion access in the United States is slowly being eroded. To nobody's surprise, Texas lawmakers are looking to lead the charge. On Tuesday, the Texas Senate passed a law targeting abortion pills in efforts to dramatically expand the state's near-total abortion ban.  

Dubbed the Women and Child Protection Act, SB 2880 would allow lawsuits against anyone manufacturing, mailing, or delivering abortion pills to someone in Texas for up to $100,000.  These lawsuits can center around “injury sustained by an unborn child” or the “wrongful death of an unborn child” (which the bill specifies can be filed by either parent). The statute of limitations for wrongful death cases would also be extended to six years instead of just two.

Per the Texas Tribune, the bill's current language means it cannot be challenged in state court before it goes into effect. In fact, a state court judge could be sued for $100,000 if they say that it's unconstitutional. Furthermore, any lawyers who try to challenge the bill would be responsible for both sides' legal fees.

This use of civil lawsuits was central to Texas's original anti-abortion legislation in 2021, as it allowed the state to expand its reach by effectively handing over the policing and enforcement of laws to private citizens. Scarily enough, though, the Senate actually passed a scaled-down version of the law. When it was originally introduced in March, it included felony charges for paying for or reimbursing abortion-related costs or destroying evidence. It also criminalized things like helping with travel or lodging.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, medication abortions account for the majority of abortions in the United States. An average of 2,800 Texans receive abortion-inducing medication by mail from shield states whose laws protect abortion providers, helpers, and patient medical records from any civil or criminal proceedings. Currently, eighteen states (and D.C.) have shield laws, including California, Minnesota, and New York. Recently, Texas tried to circumvent New York's law by suing a doctor for mailing abortion pills. But last month, a county clerk refused to file the judge's fine of over $100,000.

As its name implies, SB 2880 is framed as a way to protect women. Per the Texas Tribune, bill author Sen. Bryan Hughes said that pills “are being mailed…directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without any follow-up care after…This is illegal in Texas, but it is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.”

In addition to trying to eliminate medications, SB 2880 would criminalize providing information on how to obtain them. This includes anyone who makes a website about abortion access or exchanges emails. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation summarized in a recent statement, “The goal is to wipe this information from the internet altogether…The bill is carefully designed to scare people into silence.”

Texas is not stopping at SB 2880. The Senate is considering testing sewage for abortion pills, and also passed SB 31, which clarifies when doctors can perform medically necessary abortions. The bill comes after ProPublica reported in February that sepsis rates soared following the abortion ban. Per the outlet, two women died from sepsis after doctors refused to evacuate their incomplete miscarriages because that would be an abortion. Although once again framed as protecting women, the Texas Equal Access Fund described it as a “political distraction” that “only exists to provide anti-abortion politicians cover for their decision to ban abortion, while keeping care inaccessible.”

Both SB 2880 and SB 31 are now heading to the House.

A young man with no government experience who has yet to even complete his undergraduate degree is working for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and has been tasked with using artificial intelligence to rewrite the agency's rules and regulations.

Christopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and most recently a third-year at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month.

“I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,'” Scott Langmack, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”

Sweet's primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD's regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD's data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)

Plans for the industrial-scale deregulation of the US government were laid out in detail in the Project 2025 policy document that the Trump administration has effectively used as a playbook during its first 100 days in power. The document, written by a who's who of far-right figures, many of whom now hold positions of power within the administration, pushes for deregulation in areas like the environment, food and drug enforcement, and diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

One area Sweet is focusing on is regulation related to the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), according to sources who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Sweet—who two sources have been told is the lead on the AI deregulation project for the entire administration—has produced an Excel spreadsheet with around a thousand rows containing areas of policy where the AI tool has flagged that HUD may have “overreached” and suggesting replacement language.

Staffers from PIH are, specifically, asked to review the AI's recommendations and justify their objections to those they don't agree with. “It all sounds crazy—having AI recommend revisions to regulations,” one HUD source says. “But I appreciated how much they're using real people to confirm and make changes.”

Once the PIH team completes the review, their recommendations will be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel for approval.

One HUD source says they were told that the AI model being used for this project is “being refined by our work to be used across the government.” To do this, the source says they were told in a meeting attended by Sweet and Jacob Altik, another known DOGE member who has worked as an attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Mangesthat, the model will crawl through the Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR),

Another source told WIRED that Sweet has also been using the tool at other parts of HUD. WIRED reviewed a copy of the output of the AI's review of one HUD department, which features columns displaying text that the AI model found to be needing an adjustment while also including suggestions from the AI for alterations to be made, essentially proposing rewrites. The spreadsheet details how many words can be eliminated from individual regulations and gives a percentage figure indicating how noncompliant the regulations are. It isn't clear how these percentages are calculated.

Sweet did not respond to requests for comment regarding his work. In response to a request to clarify Sweet's role at HUD, a spokesperson for the agency said they do not comment on individual personnel. The University of Chicago confirmed to WIRED that Sweet is “on leave from the undergraduate college.”

It's unclear how Sweet was recruited to DOGE, but a public GitHub account indicates that he was working on this issue even before he joined Musk's demolition crew.

The “CLSweet” GitHub account, which WIRED has linked to Sweet, created an application that tracks and analyzes federal government regulations “showing how regulatory burden is distributed across government agencies.” The application was last updated in March 2025, weeks before Sweet joined HUD.

One HUD source who heard about Sweet's possible role in revising the agency's regulations said the effort was redundant, since the agency was already “put through a multi-year multi-stakeholder meatgrinder before any rule was ever created” under the Administrative Procedure Act. (This law dictates how agencies are allowed to establish regulations and allows for judicial oversight over everything an agency does.)

Another HUD source said Sweet's title seemed to make little sense. “A programmer and a quantitative data analyst are two very different things,” they noted.

Sweet has virtually no online footprint. One of the only references to him online is a short biography on the website of East Edge Securities, an investment firm Sweet founded in 2023 with two other students from the University of Chicago.

The biography is short on details but claims that Sweet has worked in the past with several private equity firms, including Pertento Partners, which is based in London, and Tenzing Global Investors, based in San Francisco. He is also listed as a board member of Paragon Global Investments, which is a student-run hedge fund.

The biography also mentions that Sweet “will be joining Nexus Point Capital as a private equity summer analyst.” The company has headquarters in Hong Kong and Shanghai and describes itself as “an Asian private equity fund with a strategic focus on control opportunities in the Greater China market.”

East Edge Securities, Pertento Partners, Tenzing Global Investors, Paragon Global Investments, and Nexus Point Capital did not respond to requests for comment.

The only other online account associated with Sweet appears to be a Substack account using the same username as the GitHub account. That account has not posted any content and follows mostly finance and market-related newsletters. It also follows Bari Weiss' The Free Press and the newsletter of Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley billionaire investor and group chat enthusiast who said he spent a lot of time advising Trump and his team after the election.

DOGE representatives have been at HUD since February, when WIRED reported that two of those staffers were given application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside the agency.

Earlier this month, US representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said DOGE had “infiltrated our nation's housing agencies, stealing funding Congress provided to communities, illegally terminating staff, including in your districts, and accessing confidential data about people living in assisted housing, including sexual assault survivors.”

AI-generated computer code is rife with references to non-existent third-party libraries, creating a golden opportunity for supply-chain attacks that poison legitimate programs with malicious packages that can steal data, plant backdoors, and carry out other nefarious actions, newly published research shows.

The study, which used 16 of the most widely used large language models to generate 576,000 code samples, found that 440,000 of the package dependencies they contained were “hallucinated,” meaning they were non-existent. Open source models hallucinated the most, with 21 percent of the dependencies linking to non-existent libraries. A dependency is an essential code component that a separate piece of code requires to work properly. Dependencies save developers the hassle of rewriting code and are an essential part of the modern software supply chain.

These non-existent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. These attacks work by causing a software package to access the wrong component dependency, for instance by publishing a malicious package and giving it the same name as the legitimate one but with a later version stamp. Software that depends on the package will, in some cases, choose the malicious version rather than the legitimate one because the former appears to be more recent.

Also known as package confusion, this form of attack was first demonstrated in 2021 in a proof-of-concept exploit that executed counterfeit code on networks belonging to some of the biggest companies on the planet, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla included. It's one type of technique used in software supply-chain attacks, which aim to poison software at its very source in an attempt to infect all users downstream.

“Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users,” Joseph Spracklen, a University of Texas at San Antonio Ph.D. student and lead researcher, told Ars via email. “If a user trusts the LLM's output and installs the package without carefully verifying it, the attacker's payload, hidden in the malicious package, would be executed on the user's system.”

In AI, hallucinations occur when an LLM produces outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely unrelated to the task it was assigned. Hallucinations have long dogged LLMs because they degrade their usefulness and trustworthiness and have proven vexingly difficult to predict and remedy. In a paper scheduled to be presented at the 2025 USENIX Security Symposium, they have dubbed the phenomenon “package hallucination.”

For the study, the researchers ran 30 tests, 16 in the Python programming language and 14 in JavaScript, that generated 19,200 code samples per test, for a total of 576,000 code samples. Of the 2.23 million package references contained in those samples, 440,445, or 19.7 percent, pointed to packages that didn't exist. Among these 440,445 package hallucinations, 205,474 had unique package names.

One of the things that makes package hallucinations potentially useful in supply-chain attacks is that 43 percent of package hallucinations were repeated over 10 queries. “In addition,” the researchers wrote, “58 percent of the time, a hallucinated package is repeated more than once in 10 iterations, which shows that the majority of hallucinations are not simply random errors, but a repeatable phenomenon that persists across multiple iterations. This is significant because a persistent hallucination is more valuable for malicious actors looking to exploit this vulnerability and makes the hallucination attack vector a more viable threat.”

In other words, many package hallucinations aren't random one-off errors. Rather, specific names of non-existent packages are repeated over and over. Attackers could seize on the pattern by identifying nonexistent packages that are repeatedly hallucinated. The attackers would then publish malware using those names and wait for them to be accessed by large numbers of developers.

The study uncovered disparities in the LLMs and programming languages that produced the most package hallucinations. The average percentage of package hallucinations produced by open source LLMs such as CodeLlama and DeepSeek was nearly 22 percent, compared with a little more than 5 percent by commercial models. Code written in Python resulted in fewer hallucinations than JavaScript code, with an average of almost 16 percent compared with a little over 21 percent for JavaScript. Asked what caused the differences, Spracklen wrote:

“This is a difficult question because large language models are extraordinarily complex systems, making it hard to directly trace causality. That said, we observed a significant disparity between commercial models (such as the ChatGPT series) and open-source models, which is almost certainly attributable to the much larger parameter counts of the commercial variants. Most estimates suggest that ChatGPT models have at least 10 times more parameters than the open-source models we tested, though the exact architecture and training details remain proprietary. Interestingly, among open-source models, we did not find a clear link between model size and hallucination rate, likely because they all operate within a relatively smaller parameter range.

“Beyond model size, differences in training data, fine-tuning, instruction training, and safety tuning all likely play a role in package hallucination rate. These processes are intended to improve model usability and reduce certain types of errors, but they may have unforeseen downstream effects on phenomena like package hallucination.

“Similarly, the higher hallucination rate for JavaScript packages compared to Python is also difficult to attribute definitively. We speculate that it stems from the fact that JavaScript has roughly 10 times more packages in its ecosystem than Python, combined with a more complicated namespace. With a much larger and more complex package landscape, it becomes harder for models to accurately recall specific package names, leading to greater uncertainty in their internal predictions and, ultimately, a higher rate of hallucinated packages.”

The findings are the latest to demonstrate the inherent untrustworthiness of LLM output. With Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that 95 percent of code will be AI-generated within five years, here's hoping developers heed the message.

Rivian built up a stockpile of batteries for its trucks, SUVs, and commercial vans before and after the election of Donald Trump, a strategy used to soften the blow of the president's tariffs, according to Bloomberg News.

The company apparently bought an undisclosed number of lithium iron phosphate batteries from Chinese firm Gotion before the election. The batteries were for Rivian's delivery vans, the bulk of which are made for Amazon. After the election (although it's not clear exactly when) Rivian worked with Samsung SDI “to move a large amount of battery inventory to the U.S. from South Korea,” Bloomberg reports.

The stockpiles should help reduce the pricing pressure caused by Trump's auto tariffs, which are applied to components that car companies bring into the U.S. to use in vehicles. Trump altered those tariffs this week, providing some relief compared to his original plan of applying an across-the-board 25% tax on imported parts; Trump's revised tariff plan will still likely lead to price hikes on new cars.

Researchers have trained a new kind of large language model (LLM) using GPUs dotted across the world and fed private as well as public data—a move that suggests that the dominant way of building artificial intelligence could be disrupted.

Flower AI and Vana, two startups pursuing unconventional approaches to building AI, worked together to create the new model, called Collective-1.

Flower created techniques that allow training to be spread across hundreds of computers connected over the internet. The company's technology is already used by some firms to train AI models without needing to pool compute resources or data. Vana provided sources of data including private messages from X, Reddit, and Telegram.

Collective-1 is small by modern standards, with 7 billion parameters—values that combine to give the model its abilities—compared to hundreds of billions for today's most advanced models, such as those that power programs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Nic Lane, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and cofounder of Flower AI, says that the distributed approach promises to scale far beyond the size of Collective-1. Lane adds that Flower AI is partway through training a model with 30 billion parameters using conventional data, and plans to train another model with 100 billion parameters—close to the size offered by industry leaders—later this year. “It could really change the way everyone thinks about AI, so we're chasing this pretty hard,” Lane says. He says the startup is also incorporating images and audio into training to create multimodal models.

Distributed model-building could also unsettle the power dynamics that have shaped the AI industry.

AI companies currently build their models by combining vast amounts of training data with huge quantities of compute concentrated inside data centers stuffed with advanced GPUs that are networked together using super-fast fiber-optic cables. They also rely heavily on datasets created by scraping publicly accessible—although sometimes copyrighted—material, including websites and books.

The approach means that only the richest companies, and nations with access to large quantities of the most powerful chips, can feasibly develop the most powerful and valuable models. Even open source models, like Meta's Llama and R1 from DeepSeek, are built by companies with access to large data centers. Distributed approaches could make it possible for smaller companies and universities to build advanced AI by pooling disparate resources together. Or it could allow countries that lack conventional infrastructure to network together several data centers to build a more powerful model.

Lane believes that the AI industry will increasingly look towards new methods that allow training to break out of individual data centers. The distributed approach “allows you to scale compute much more elegantly than the data center model,” he says.

Helen Toner, an expert on AI governance at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, says Flower AI's approach is “interesting and potentially very relevant” to AI competition and governance. “It will probably continue to struggle to keep up with the frontier, but could be an interesting fast-follower approach,” Toner says.

Distributed AI training involves rethinking the way calculations used to build powerful AI systems are divided up. Creating an LLM involves feeding huge amounts of text into a model that adjusts its parameters in order to produce useful responses to a prompt. Inside a data center the training process is divided up so that parts can be run on different GPUs, and then periodically consolidated into a single, master model.

The new approach allows the work normally done inside a large data center to be performed on hardware that may be many miles away and connected over a relatively slow or variable internet connection.

Some big players are also exploring distributed learning. Last year, researchers at Google demonstrated a new scheme for dividing and consolidating computations called DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo) that enables more efficient distributed learning.

To build Collective-1 and other LLMs, Lane and academic collaborators in the UK and China developed a new tool called Photon that makes distributed training more efficient. Photon improves upon Google's approach, Lane says, with a more efficient approach to representing the data in a model and a more efficient scheme for sharing and consolidating training. The process is slower than conventional training but is more flexible, allowing new hardware to be added to ramp up training, Lane says.

Photon was developed in collaboration with researchers at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Zhejiang University in China. The group released the tool under an open source license last month, allowing anyone to make use of the approach.

Flower AI's partner in the effort to build Collective-1, Vana, is developing new ways for users to share personal data with AI builders. Vana's software allows users to contribute private data from platforms like X and Reddit to training a large language model, and potentially specify what kind of end uses are permitted or even benefit financially from their contributions.

Anna Kazlauskas, cofounder of Vana, says the idea is to make untapped data available for AI training and also to give users more control over how their information is used for AI. “This is data that isn't usually able to be included in AI models because it's not publicly available,” Kazlauskas says, “and is the first time that data directly contributed by users is being used to train a foundation model, with users given ownership of the AI model their data creates.”

Mirco Musolesi, a computer scientist at University College London, says a key benefit of the distributed approach to AI training is likely to be that it unlocks new kinds of data. “Scaling this to frontier models would allow the AI industry to leverage vast amounts of decentralized and privacy-sensitive data, for example in health care and finance, for training without the risks associated with data centralization,” he says.

Since it launched nearly 20 years ago, Speedtest.net has been one of the most popular tools used to measure internet speeds. However, Doug Suttles, the founder and former CEO of Ookla, the network testing company behind Speedtest, felt that just measuring speed was not enough to tell people all they wanted to know about their internet connections. 

That's why Suttles is now launching a new tool called Orb that measures latency, packet loss, jitter, and speed to give you a measure of how stable your internet connection is.

Suttles, who started Orb with Ookla exec Jamie Steven in 2023, said Speedtest.net was the right tool for its time, but as internet speeds became less of an issue around the world, he felt people needed new, more holistic ways to assess their internet connections.

“Speed tests are like the dipstick in your car, which will tell you that you ran out of oil once your car breaks down. We wanted to build a dashboard to tell you that you are low on oil, so you can fix that problem,” Suttles told TechCrunch over a call.

Orb checks network connections for three key variables: responsiveness, which is measured by a combination of lag, jitter, latency, and packet loss; reliability, which measures responsiveness over time and packet loss over time; and speed, which is your usual download and upload speeds. All these variables can be measured over different time intervals — one minute, five minutes, one hour, and 24 hours.

Combining all three variables, the tool gives you a score to indicate how stable your network connection is. An Orb score above 80 indicates a good connection; 70-80 means you have an okay connection; and if you get anything below that, you may have noticeable problems.

If your score is under 80, the app suggests steps you can take to improve the performance of the network. The startup says it uses LLMs to show descriptions of key issues and the suggestions related to solving those. 

Orb has apps for various platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. The company also provides a guide for installing the tool on Raspberry Pi, Onewrt, Docker, Steam Deck, Prox Max, WLAN Pi, older smartphones, and other platforms for those who would want to monitor their connections more frequently.

The startup is also working on a feature that would let users set up an Orb and share it with someone else to have them monitor your connection. Both users will receive notifications if the connection quality wavers.

Orb is currently free to use, and the company wants to keep it that way. Suttles said he'd like to license the technology to enterprises and ISPs so they can monitor and identify network issues with advanced alerts and analytics.

The startup has so far raised $3.8 million in funding from Sidekick Ventures, as well as individual investors, including Fastly senior director Edward Bender; Netflix engineer Jana Iyengar; Big Network CEO Tom Daly; Fastly's former head of streaming, Lee Chen; the head of strategy and operations of Oculus Studios, Jason Kay; former president of THQ and founder of Naughty Dog, Jason Rubin; and Vetro's head of strategic initiatives, Will Cooper.

Steven, who also worked on creating Down Detector, said Orb also aims to create recipes for different services that help you detect if you can access a particular site, like Zoom, Netflix, X, or Google Drive, to check if the services are working.

Fighting bots with malware.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Programmer Ibrahim Diallo runs a blog hosted on his own tiny server, and based on his experience, he knows that most of his traffic are bots that troll the internet to find content. Many of these bots are harmless, but there are a few that attempt to hijack his system by injecting malicious attacks or probing for a response. When that happens, Diallo says on his blog that he serves up a hot zip bomb that will expand to a thousand times its original size — and crash the bot's server.Zip bombs are tiny, compressed archives that hide a massive file size. An egregious example of this type of sneaky file is this 46MB archive that turns into a massive 4.5 petabyte file, overwhelming the resources of most computers. These are considered to be malware, as they're designed to disable a target system by crashing it. However, Diallo has flipped the script and is now using zip bombs as a way to defend against malware attacks.Diallo says he made a 1MB file that decompresses into 1GB to disable bots trying to break into his system. He also has a 10MB-to-10GB compressed file for bots with more resources, ensuring that their memory is overwhelmed by this massive archive. This is how this defensive bombing system works: when Diallo detects an offending bot, his server returns a 200 OK response and then serves up the zip bomb. The file's metadata tells the bot that it's a compressed file, so it will then open it in an attempt to scrape as much information as possible. However, since the file is at least 1GB when unpacked, it will overwhelm the memory of most simple — and even some advanced — bots. If he faces a more advanced scraper with a few gigabytes of memory, he'll feed it the 10GB zip bomb, which will most likely crash it.If you want to try this system for yourself, Diallo outlines how you can create your own bot-targeting zip bomb on his blog. He notes that you should be careful when doing that, though, as you can potentially self-detonate (i.e., accidentally open the zip bomb), and crash your own server. They're also not 100% effective, as there are ways to detect zip and disregard zip bombs. But for most simple bots, this should be more than enough to cause its server to freeze and take it out — at least until its system is restarted.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

TSMC's A16 and N2 are coming to the USA.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TSMC on Wednesday officially started building its third semiconductor facility — Fab 21 phase 3 — near Phoenix, Arizona, according to a report from Bloomberg. The third module of the company's Fab 21 site will be capable of producing chips using the company's N2, N2P (2nm-class), and A16 (1.6nm-class) process technologies when it's completed, between 2028 and 2030. The development coincides with rising political pressure on TSMC, as just last week Taiwan's parliament passed a law under which TSMC cannot export its most advanced fabrication process to overseas facilities and must get approval from the Taiwanese government to invest in its projects abroad. By late 2028, TSMC will have started production of chips on its A14 manufacturing process in Taiwan, so it will have the legal right to begin making chips on its N2P, A16, and derivative nodes in the U.S. Construction of TSMC's Fab 21 phase 3 is a part of the company's project to invest $165 billion in its American production facilities, which was announced in March. Under the plan, Fab 21 module 3 and module 4 will produce chips on TSMC's 2nm-class process technologies (which includes N2, N2P, N2X, and A16), while Fab 21 module 5 and module 6 will use even more advanced processes, including A14 (1.4nm-class) and derivatives. Although TSMC is investing a huge amount of money in its Fab 21 site — which will eventually house not only six fab modules, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center — and plans to make it one of its major production hubs, it does not look like the contract chipmaker will be legally able to transfer its most advanced production technologies to Fab 21. This will affect its profitability, as the company charges premium for its leading-edge fabrication processes. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick visited the location, which is frequently described as the largest foreign-funded project ever undertaken in the U.S., on the week it broke ground. Lutnick has reportedly indicated that companies may need to deepen their U.S. presence to access federal semiconductor funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, suggesting that subsidies could be withheld from companies who do not meet expectations. However, the U.S. government is also legally bound to provide CHIPS Act funding to companies such as TSMC, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and others through the end of 2026.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Along with several new Ryzen mobile offerings.

A detailed breakdown of AMD's planned CPU releases has been shared by leakers Olrak and InstLatX64, via VideoCardz. These upcoming products span across the desktop, mobile, and workstation designations. All these will employ the same Zen 5 architecture, and most appear to be refreshes of current offerings. For desktop, or specifically the AM5 platform, AMD is reportedly planning Ryzen 9000G APUs alongside server-grade EPYC 4005 CPUs. According to the leak, the Ryzen 9000G family is based on Gorgon Point, which earlier leaks revealed to be rebadged Strix Point silicon. We can expect up to 12 hybrid cores (4x Zen 5 + 8x Zen 5c) along with an RDNA 3.5 graphics engine with 16 Compute Units (Radeon 890M). These AM5 APUs are tipped for a Q4 release. Next up on the table is the EPYC 4005 family. Last year, AMD introduced Raphael-based EPYC 4004 processors (AM5) for commercial users with enterprise-grade features. The EPYC 4005, codenamed Grado, is a follow-up — likely wielding Granite Ridge (Ryzen 9000) silicon under the hood. Given that manufacturers are already preparing their motherboards for support, we expect these processors will be announced at Computex, alongside Ryzen 9000WX (Shimada Peak) offerings for workstations.We also have another version of Krackan Point (dubbed Krackan2). We expect Kracken2 to follow the pattern of Phoenix2 and HawkPoint2 , which were smaller variants of the original dies with fewer cores and no NPU. As of writing, the Krackan Point family features just two SKUs: the Ryzen AI 7 350 and Ryzen AI 5 340, with most laptops above the $700 price point. Krackan2 might enable AMD to expand Zen 5 to a wider range of customers as it should be cheaper to produce, but we aren't sure of the specifications or how cut-down it will be.Following that are several Gorgon Point variations: GorgonPoint1, GorgonPoint2, and GorgonPoint3. It's impossible to decipher these codenames without official confirmation. However, assuming GorgonPoint1 refers to the full-fat original die, GorgonPoint2 should carry a similar premise to Krackan2: a trimmed-down GorgonPoint1 die with fewer hardware features. Hardware leaker Kepler expects GorgonPoint3 to be a refresh of Krackan2. And, just to clarify, Gorgon Point is actually a refresh of Strix Point. Using the never-before-seen FF5 socket, AMD is also allegedly working on a new lineup of mobile offerings dubbed Soundwave. The rumor mill positions this as a low-power, Arm-based device from AMD, employing Radeon graphics. This might be AMD's response to Nvidia's rumored N1X SoCs for the WoA (Windows on Arm) ecosystem. If these SoCs are anywhere near their launch, we'll probably hear more about them at Computex.Finally, as spotted by InstLatX64 at AMD's Technical Information Portal, next-generation Zen 6 based APUs (Medusa Point) will reportedly use the FP10 socket, meaning they won't be compatible with existing designs. Following AMD's typical two-year cadence, Zen 6 should be announced by Q3 - Q4 2026, so we might see these APUs spring up at CES 2027 or later.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Duolingo is introducing 148 new language courses that were created with generative AI, the company announced on Wednesday. The launch comes as Duolingo has been facing backlash this week after sharing that it was going to replace contractors with AI and become an “AI-first” company.

The company says the launch of the new courses doubles its current course offerings and marks the largest expansion of content in Duolingo's history.

“Developing our first 100 courses took about 12 years, and now, in about a year, we're able to create and launch nearly 150 new courses,” said Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a press release. “This is a great example of how generative AI can directly benefit our learners. This launch reflects the incredible impact of our AI and automation investments, which have allowed us to scale at unprecedented speed and quality.”

While Duolingo is touting its use of AI, the company is facing backlash from users who are disheartened by its plans to use the technology to replace workers and use it more deeply in its app.

On Monday, von Ahn told staff in an email that the company was shifting to AI and that it would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.” He also wrote that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.”

“Al isn't just a productivity boost,” he wrote. “It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn't scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without Al, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”

Users have taken to social media to share their displeasure with the company's plans, with some arguing that its use of AI is making the app worse with inaccurate and lower-quality content. Others have deleted the app and are encouraging others to follow suit.

As for the new language courses, Duolingo says they are primarily designed to support beginner levels. They include features such as Stories, which helps develop reading comprehension, and DuoRadio, which helps with listening comprehension. The company plans to launch more advanced content in the coming months.

When Twin Peaks: The Return hit Showtime in 2017, there was one very poignant presence tucked amid all the signature David Lynch style and weirdness. It wouldn't be a true Twin Peaks revival without the Log Lady, and Catherine E. Coulson—whose portrayal of the enigmatic character made her a cult-beloved icon—got to play her one last time before her death from cancer in 2015.

Richard Green's new documentary, I Know Catherine, The Log Lady, reveals just what went into creating that final performance while also celebrating the life and career of a woman David Lynch called “one of my dearest, closest friends.”

With Lynch himself now having departed, there's an extra layer of melancholy woven into the documentary, though he looks in perfect health here as he looks back on his longstanding relationship with Coulson. Lynch met her in the 1970s—she was then married to Jack Nance, star of Lynch's first feature, Eraserhead.

Coulson, who'd met Nance when they were both part of the late-1960s theater scene in San Francisco, shot a role that didn't make it into the final film, but she mostly worked behind the scenes, building skills that led to a career as a camera assistant on films like Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

Though she was a talented behind-the-scenes craftsperson, performing was clearly Coulson's first love, and I Know Catherine follows her career trajectory to the role she became most famous for, as well as beyond that as she continued acting, mostly on stage. Instead of simply following a straight line, the documentary makes very clear that her death will be a big part of its narrative, opening with a phone call she herself made to a mortuary to “set things up a little bit” ahead of the inevitable.

Throughout, it incorporates stories from her friends and colleagues as Coulson's health began to get worse; they all marvel at the amount of drive and energy she managed to hold onto until the very end.

Though I Know Catherine makes clear that there was a lot more to her than the Log Lady, Twin Peaks is still a big part of Coulson's story, and cast mates including Kyle MacLachlan appear to reminisce about the spirit she brought to the production. “She loved the joy it brought to people,” one associate remembers, and she was pleased when Lynch's offbeat ABC soap opera became a TV sensation.

Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost also pops up to talk more about what Coulson brought to the character—who everyone agrees was nothing like Coulson in real life—and why the Log Lady resonated so strongly with fans. Frost recalls a huge laugh at the Twin Peaks pilot screening when the Log Lady is seen flicking the lights on and off at the town meeting. When MacLachlan's Agent Cooper asks what's up with the lady with the log, he's matter-of-factly informed “we call her the Log Lady.” It's all you need to know!

A mix of humor and seriousness, the Log Lady (real name: Margaret Lanterman; she was a character Lynch had been pondering since the Eraserhead era) was a person everyone in Twin Peaks took very seriously despite her oddities. As Frost explains, she was respected, a little bit feared, and if her log had something to say to you, it was understood that you would listen.

Coulson conveyed all of that in her measured performance, and as a result the Log Lady made a big impact every time she was onscreen. That includes her handful of scenes in Twin Peaks: The Return, which were captured just days before her death at a set-up that came together very quickly in her home. (Lynch, who was on location filming the series, directed her over Skype.)

David Lynch fans—Twin Peaks fans in particular—won't want to miss this heartfelt doc, an exceptionally intimate portrait of Coulson's life story constructed by some of the people who knew and loved her best.

I Know Catherine, The Log Lady opens in NYC May 1 and in Los Angeles May 9; you can find a list of screenings at various theaters nationwide here.

The aspiring air taxi company Joby Aviation just completed a complicated in-air maneuver that puts the company's futuristic-looking aircraft on the path toward Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight testing.

Joby successfully flew one of its six-rotor aircraft from vertical hover to horizontal cruise flight and back again with a pilot onboard, showcasing the aircraft's versatility in the air—a key value proposition of Joby's sleek, electrically powered design.

The test flight took place on April 22 at the company's facility in Marina, California, and was piloted by James “Buddy” Denham, Joby's chief test pilot. Denham is no stranger to envelope-pushing aircraft—he previously helped design flight control systems for the F-35B fighter jet.

But the recent aircraft, called N544JX, is designed to be an air taxi, not a fighter jet. Thus, it's only designed to travel up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour), carrying up to four passengers and producing less noise than a helicopter.

The electric aircraft makes vertical lift-offs and landings (eVTOL), allowing it to fly to and land in dense urban centers or places otherwise devoid of runways. According to a Joby release, the company is on track to complete its flight testing in the middle of 2025, ahead of its first passenger flights in the Middle East.

“Designing and flying an aircraft that can seamlessly transition between vertical and cruise flight has long been considered one of the most challenging technological feats in aerospace,” said Denham in the Joby release. “The aircraft flew exactly as expected, with excellent handling qualities and low pilot workload.”

Joby didn't just, uh, wing this. The company has completed 40,000 miles (64,374 km) of test flights to date and hundreds of transitions from the aircraft's vertical takeoff to its cruise flight position. The FAA certified Joby's air taxi to carry passengers in 2022, a year after the company went public, but the company has yet to clear every hurdle necessary to bring the aircraft to market.

Joby's fleet of five electric air taxis is routinely performing piloted vertical-to-cruise transitions, most recently completing the full flight cycle from horizontal cruise to vertical landing under pilot control. But there's a long road ahead towards type inspection authorization (TIA) flight testing with FAA pilots aboard the craft. TIA testing is one of the final steps in certifying the aircraft to hold commercial passengers, and crucially checks whether the aircraft is up to snuff in terms of performance and safety metrics.

The company still has some testing hurdles to clear, including a foray into the Middle East, but Joby's unique-looking air taxis may make their way into America's skyways very soon.

Wikipedia on Wednesday revealed its new AI strategy for the next three years — and it's not replacing the Wikipedia community of editors and volunteers with artificial intelligence, thankfully.

Instead, Wikipedia says it will use AI to build new features that “remove technical barriers,” allowing editors, moderators, and patrollers tools that allow them to accomplish what they need to do, without worrying about how to “technically achieve it.”

Amid concerns that AI could eventually impact jobs held by people today, especially in terms of content creation, Wikipedia indicates that it intends to use AI as a tool that makes people's jobs easier, not replace them. 

Instead, the organization says that it will utilize generative AI in specific areas where it tends to excel. 

This includes the creation of AI-assisted workflows that will automate tedious tasks. In addition, AI will be used to improve the discoverability of information on Wikipedia, giving editors more time for the human deliberation that's required to build consensus over the creation, changes, and updates to Wikipedia entries. 

AI will also aid editors by automating translation and will assist in the onboarding process of new volunteers.  

“We believe that our future work with AI will be successful not only because of what we do, but how we do it,” writes Chris Albon, the director of machine learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, in a blog post announcing the news.

“Our efforts will use our long-held values, principles, and policies (like privacy and human rights) as a compass: we will take a human-centered approach and will prioritize human agency; we will prioritize using open-source or open-weight AI; we will prioritize transparency; and we will take a nuanced approach to multilinguality, a fundamental part of Wikipedia,” Albon adds. 

The director also argued that maintaining Wikipedia's knowledge base is a mission that's grown in importance since the rise of generative AI, which today is known to make mistakes and hallucinate answers at times.

Intel has reportedly been working on this for years

Intel is testing a new way to tackle the growing heat output of its power hungry chips. At its recent Foundry Direct Connect event, the company showcased an experimental package-level water cooling solution designed to more efficiently cool CPUs . Intel has working prototypes for both LGA (Land Grid Array) and BGA (Ball Grid Array) CPUs, with demos using Intel's Core Ultra as well as Xeon server processors.

The cooling solution doesn't apply coolant directly to the silicon die. Instead, a specially designed compact cooling block sits atop the package, featuring microchannels made of copper that precisely guide the coolant flow. These channels can be optimized to target specific hotspots on the die, potentially improving heat removal where it matters the most.

Intel claims the system can dissipate up to 1,000 watts of heat using standard liquid cooling fluid. That kind of thermal load isn't typical for consumer CPUs, but it could be relevant for high-end AI (Artificial Intelligence) workloads, HPC (High Performance Computing), and workstation applications.

The cooling assembly is also said to make use of solder or liquid metal TIM (Thermal Interface Material), which is said to offer better contact than polymer based TIM. Compared to a traditional liquid cooler mounted to a delidded bare die, Intel says this solution can deliver 15–20% better thermal performance.

Notably, Intel's approach isn't just a lab experiment. The company has reportedly been working on this technology for years. With rising thermal demands from modern chip designs, Intel is now exploring how to produce this system for real-world deployment.

While Intel refines its prototype, the enthusiast community is already experimenting with similar concepts. YouTuber octppus recently modified the heatspreader of an Intel Core i9-14900KS, machining it into a functioning miniature water block. With internal channels carved into the IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) and sealed under acrylic, the mod somewhat mirrors Intel's concept in DIY fashion.

Intel hasn't confirmed when or if this cooling approach will hit mainstream products, but the demonstration is critical for CPU thermal design. As power consumption and package density increase, direct cooling may become a necessity for both professional and enthusiast hardware in the coming future.

Christoph Schell, Intel's EVP and chief commercial officer, is leaving the company after two years in the role, according to a filing with the SEC.

Schell notified Intel of his decision to leave on Monday, and will resign on June 30 “in order to pursue another career opportunity,” per the filing.

It isn't clear who will replace Schell. Greg Ernst, CVP of Intel's sales and marketing division, will step in as interim leader, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

“Christoph has worked tirelessly on behalf of our customers during his time with Intel and we are grateful for his many contributions to our business,” the spokesperson said. “We wish him the very best in his next role.”

Schell, who also led Intel's sales, marketing and communications group, reporting directly to the office of the CEO, joined the company in February 2022. He previously was the chief commercial officer at HP; EVP of growth markets for Philips; and a brand management lead at Procter & Gamble.

Schell's departure comes as Intel undergoes a dramatic transformation under recently appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The new CEO has moved to spin divisions of the company into “noncore” units, sold its majority stake in its Altera semiconductor business, and flattened the tech giant's executive structure. He also appointed a new AI chief and plans to greatly reduce the company's workforce.

Earlier this month, Tan mandated four days in the office for all employees (the company had previously allowed some hybrid and remote work), and announced that Intel wouldn't spin off its Intel Capital corporate VC arm as previously planned.

Updated 7:38 a.m. Pacific: Added a statement from an Intel spokesperson.

That's almost one-third.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the company now uses Artificial Intelligence to write between 20% and 30% of the code powering its software. Satya joined Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg this Tuesday at the LlamaCon conference to discuss developments in AI and their contributions to the open-source ecosystem. The fact that a major company like Microsoft relies so much on AI underlines how this technology is revolutionizing software development. Still, it also draws attention to the growing unease and uncertainty experienced by fresh software developers.

Almost every company uses Artificial Intelligence to a certain extent. At its Q3 financials last year, Sundar Pichai revealed that 25% of new code at Google is AI-generated. As it stands, AI is mostly there to power repetitive, data-heavy, and predictable tasks, which would yield a noticeable gain to corporate efficiency by cutting down on entry-level jobs. While it is true that AI-generated code has improved significantly over the recent years, it still requires senior developer oversight to ensure the production environment doesn't go haywire.

Mark and Satya spent part of their discussion detailing each company's AI adoption scale. AI generates one-third of the code in Microsoft's repositories and projects. The Meta CEO didn't provide an exact figure, but did outline plans for a future AI model to build and create future iterations of their Llama AI models. Although using AI to design AI might sound counterintuitive, there's an entire dedicated field that focuses on automating this design process, called AutoML.

“I'd say maybe 20%, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today and some of our projects are probably all written by software,” 

Microsoft is seeing better results with AI-generated Python code than C++, remarked Satya Nadella. There are several good reasons, including Python's simpler syntax, dynamic typing style, error handling, and memory management, since C/C++ don't natively feature a garbage collector. Likewise, C/C++ are mainly related to low-level code, which can be challenging to automate. You probably wouldn't want AI to be writing the next major Windows update.

Such developments naturally lead to job displacement concerns for new programmers, particularly in today's competitive job market. That said, it would be unwise for a software developer to ignore AI or become overly dependent on it. A balanced approach, with a grasp on fundamentals, knowing how to leverage AI as a tool, and strong critical thinking skills, appears to be the best way forward. Though the future is hard to predict, this percentage will probably change.

President Donald Trump keeps talking about how his policies will supposedly bring manufacturing jobs to the United States. But Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, keeps accidentally admitting those jobs are going to be done by robots. Hard-working, patriotic robots.

Lutnick was asked about his previous comments on CNBC Tuesday during an interview where the secretary tried to downplay the harm Trump's tariffs are already causing. The commerce secretary tried to push back against people who were upset that he kept saying the jobs coming to the U.S. would be for robots.

CNBC host Brian Sullivan pointed out that Lutnick was “taking a lot of guff” about his “robot comments.”

“Will the robots take the jobs? I mean, it's a serious question,” Sullivan said. Lutnick said that the factory being built behind them by TSMC would have plenty of jobs for workers.

“We're going to go look through this plant, and what you're going to see is a highly automated plant that employs 3,000 people per plant. Right?” Lutnick said. “You've got to remember these plants, all these automated arms and stuff, they need to be fixed. They all need a technician to fix them. They need the air conditioning system to fix them. Right? All of these things. This is tradecraft.”

Lutnick went on to say that the jobs in these factories would pay between $70,000 and $90,000 and “go up to $150,000 and $200,000” per year. “This is the future of American manufacturing. It is not as the joke online, you know, like Americans work on the sewing machine. Oh, come on,” Lutnick insisted.

The joke Lutnick was referring to is the AI-generated videos that recently went viral, showing Americans making clothes.

“We are going to drive the high-value, high-performance jobs to America,” Lutnick insisted. “And of course, the rest of the world is going to make the low-value things and sell it to us inexpensively. Of course, that's the model. People just don't want to listen to the truth. no matter how many times we say.”

The commerce secretary said that President Trump's tariffs would drive factories back to the U.S. and people would be trained “not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future.”

And then Lutnick seemed to suggest that generation upon generation of people would work in these factories, the kind of idea that seemed antithetical to what's commonly called the American Dream.

Lutnick: “It's time to train people not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future. This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here. We let the auto plants go overseas.”

Typically, the American Dream involved parents working hard so that their children could have some social mobility, achieving greater wealth than the previous generation. But Lutnick's idea of a permanent underclass is pretty common among the ruling class, even if it's rarely articulated so bluntly.

Lutnick first got a lot of flack back in February after repeatedly saying that jobs would be coming back to the U.S. but characterizing it as something that would only allow American workers to either “screw little screws” or complete menial tasks. Lutnick also suggested robots would be doing most of the work.

“Think about it, we all hold our iPhones, which we love. Why do they have to be made in Taiwan and China? Why can't those be made with robotics in America?” Lutnick told CNBC earlier this month. “And you know what President Trump has said? They're going to be made in America.”

Lutnick also claimed on Tuesday that Apple CEO Tim Cook wanted to bring jobs to the U.S., again emphasizing the role of automation while getting defensive about past comments.

“So I talked to Tim Cook the other day. I said, when are you going to bring the iPhone? Right?” Lutnick said. “When are you going to bring the iPhone? He said, I need to have the robotic arms, right? Do it at a scale and a precision that I could bring it here. And the day I see that available, it's coming here because I don't like to employ all these people foreign, that's my biggest risk. What if in China there was a strike?”

Lutnick went on to claim that Cook really “wants to build it here. He's going to build it here,” but didn't provide a timeline.

“Americans are going to be the technicians who drive those factories. They're not going to be the ones screwing it in. People just take my statements out of context,” Lutnick said.

The Dow rose 300 points after Lutnick appeared on CNBC Tuesday, where he also claimed that a trade deal had been achieved and just needed to be announced. The rumors, as suggested on Fox Business, were that it was a deal with India, but it's not clear whether that was true.

U.S.-based consumers should have one expectation for the future: your tech will be more expensive. The most obvious culprit is Trump's tariffs, and already prices for TVs, wearables, PC gear, gaming devices, chargers and many more product categories demand more from your wallet than they did a month ago. Companies have made radical changes in their pricing structure without telling customers or even using the word “tariffs.” While big tech tries to keep in President Donald Trump's good graces, the rest of the U.S. is going to pay for it—literally.

Some tech brands, such as Acer, have explicitly blamed tariffs for why they increased prices by 10% across the board for their products. Nintendo initially pulled preorders of its Switch 2 earlier this month, citing tariffs. After offering a new preorder date, the company told customers it had raised the price of multiple controllers and other accessories. There are many, many more examples of stealth price gouging.

This year's slate of TVs, such as Sony's Bravia 8 II, now cost $4,000 at 65 inches, when the previous A95L OLED display from 2023 went for $3,500 at launch. Samsung's latest 8K TV, the QN990F, will sell for $6,500 at 75 inches. Last year's QN900D sat at $6,300 for the same size. Neither company has issued a statement about the reason for the increased costs, but we all know why.

Even when they're caught raising prices, few companies will use the “T” word out loud, whether that's out of concern for how consumers may react or in an effort to not catch the ire of America's capricious chief executive. On Tuesday, retail giant Amazon was caught in a political firestorm of its own design. Punchbowl News, citing a single anonymous source, suggested Amazon would display the tariff markup on each impacted product. That would be a big deal. CBS cited data from analytics software maker SmartScout that showed sellers as big as Anker—the maker of popular home gadgets and portable chargers—have raised prices an average of 30% since April 2, aka “Liberation Day.”

It would have been one of the few pro-consumer actions the site most known for trying to kill off the independent bookstores has taken since its inception. Unfortunately for buyers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a cushy relationship with Trump. After White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “this is a hostile and political act,” Amazon told Gizmodo the idea for “listing import changes on certain products” was only a consideration for Amazon's Temu and Shein clone, Amazon Haul.

Both Amazon and Trump's reaction to the controversy point to one simple fact: products are getting more expensive, and few are willing to say how and why. The Trump world can live in their imaginary bubble where companies don't increase costs when faced with 145% tariffs from China, but companies themselves are hoping consumers won't notice when prices are jacked up.

As compiled by YouTuber Cameron Dougherty, PC accessory maker Logitech increased costs on nearly half of all its most popular gear, like the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse and MX Keys S, whose prices both went up by $20. Its G915 X Lightspeed TKL gaming keyboard went from $200 to $230. Logitech did not immediately respond to Gizmodo's request for comment.

Smaller brands and companies in more-niche hobbies have been more willing to talk about the impact of tariffs, but others have kept mum. MSI increased the cost of its gaming handhelds, the Claw 7 AI+ and Claw 8 AI+, by $100 to $900 and $1,000, respectively. I personally was in the middle of writing a review for the beastly MSI Titan 18 HX gaming laptop, only to learn that the computer company had increased the cost of its $5,000+ laptop by several hundred dollars. MSI did not respond to my queries about whether the price was due to tariffs. You would be lucky to buy an MSI product in the U.S. currently, and that's a shame considering the handheld just received a performance boost through an update to Intel's ARC 140V integrated GPU.

In some cases, prices have gone up by closer to 50%. OnePlus shocked fans of its wearables earlier this month when it took its OnePlus Watch 3 from the expected $330 all the way to $450. In a statement shared with Gizmodo, OnePlus marketing head Spenser Blank said the company had updated the pricing for the Watch 3 from $500 to $350. This change was due to “recent adjustments in our supply chain” that “have allowed us to pass some savings” to consumers. Customers who bought the wearable at the inflated price can contact the company to adjust the price, though OnePlus said it was reaching out to those customers to talk about the refund.

OnePlus is the exception, and still the price of its Watch 3 is higher than before. Companies may be waiting to learn if Trump eventually backs down from his trade war targeting every landmass on Earth, whether it's occupied by fellow humans or waddling penguins. The damage has already been done. Companies are far less likely to decrease prices to rates before Trump introduced tariffs. Many tech companies, like Apple, have already started to reorganize supply chains, moving manufacturing to India and away from countries that were harder hit by Trump tariffs. That costs money, and if every company is raising prices in tandem, we can only expect today's inflated costs to be our new normal.

Donald Trump has never been a huge fan of journalists—unless they say nice things about him, that is. His relationship with the press was probably much better in the days when the only threat he posed to the country was in the form of a brain-cell-killing reality show. Since becoming president, however, the media has been increasingly hard on Trump, and Trump, in turn, has been increasingly hard on the media. Since taking office for a second term, the billionaire has aggressively sought to chip away at the traditional access that legacy media institutions have typically enjoyed. In place of real journalists, Trump has sought the company of people like Tim Pool: infotainment podcasters who often have a surplus of opinions and a deficit of information.

This week, the White House sank to a new low on that front, holding a first-of-its-kind “New Media Press Briefing.” While inviting journalists from smaller, less established outlets to the White House is ostensibly a good idea, that's not what the administration did. Indeed, instead of inviting actual journalists to the event, the White House populated it with a slew of friendly influencers who were all too happy to kiss the president's ass and ask White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt the softest of softball questions. It was bullshit questions and bullshit answers all the way down.

Leavitt kicked the briefing off by bragging about the administration's various “accomplishments” over the past 100 years, er sorry, I meant days. “As I promised at my first briefing as press secretary back in January, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities—not just the legacy media who traditionally has covered this institution,” Leavitt said.

Leavitt threw one of the first questions to a MAGA influencer, Arynne Wexler, who kicked things off in an appropriately MAGA fashion:  “Thanks so much, Karoline—both for having us and for granting me the first question here,” Wexler said. “And I can attest to the deportations in Florida. My Uber drivers finally speak English again, so thank you for that.”

Also in attendance was the Ghost of White House Press Secretary's Past, Sean Spicer. For whatever reason, Spicer was invited to be a part of the new media “press pool,” and took the opportunity to suck up to his former boss. “You've done a phenomenal job opening up the briefing room, bringing in new voices,” said Spicer, who, in 2017, briefly held Leavitt's position before being firmly booted from the White House. “The president's commitment during the campaign to do long-form podcasts was, I think, extremely helpful to this new media environment that we live in. But a lot of conservatives will ask me, ‘Why does he sit down with people like Terry Moran of ABC or Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic?' What is the rationale behind that rewarding people who have very vehemently expressed disdain for him personally?”

Leavitt replied: “The president is unafraid, and he is inspired by competition.”

The government also recently set up something called “Podcast Row,” a new forum that lets “creators” ask questions of government officials while streaming their shows live from the White House. The personalities included in the first event, which is set to be a regular occurrence, reportedly included Natalie Winters from Steve Bannon's War Room podcast and Breanna Morello, an independent journalist who previously worked for Newsmax.

Also, this guy was there. The internet quickly dubbed him “MAGA Draco Malfoy.”

Intel made a slew of announcements at its Intel Foundry Direct 2025 event in San Jose, California, and finally shared performance metrics for its upcoming 14A process node, slated for risk production in 2027, touting headline improvements of up to a 35% reduction in power consumption. Intel also teased its new Turbo Cell technology, a customizable design approach geared to provide maximum CPU frequency and to boost performance for critical speed paths in GPUs.

The 14A and 14A-E nodes are the next generation after the company's 18A node. Intel says 14A will deliver a 15 to 20% performance-per-watt increase over 18A, which can be leveraged as either higher clock speeds or 25-35% lower power consumption at the same performance, depending upon chip-specific tuning. Much of this improvement is due to Intel's new direct-contact backside power delivery network, which the company has dubbed PowerDirect (more here).

Intel has also sprinkled in other new features to improve the node, such as a wider threshold voltage (Vt) range that enables a more expansive voltage/frequency curve.

The 14A nodes also deliver a 1.3X increase in transistor density over the 18A node. Intel has also revamped its RibbonFET transistors for 14A, now known as 'RibbonFET 2.' Intel hasn't shared details about the new generation of RibbonFET, but the general design provides improved transistor density and faster transistor switching by utilizing four stacked nanosheets surrounded entirely by the gate (you can see the cross-section with nmos and pmos transistors above).

Intel's new Turbo Cells are a standout feature, but they are a bit complicated. Turbo Cells can be used for a multitude of purposes, but Intel specifically calls out that they will be utilized in the critical paths of the CPU and GPU, often referred to as speed paths. And for good reason.

Timing paths within a processor are routes that a signal travels along, through wires and logic gates, during normal operation. However, delays to those signals can interrupt the clock timing of the processor. The critical paths are those that have the longest total delay.

Because processors operate based on clock signals, the slowest critical path dictates the highest possible frequency limit of the entire chip, serving as a bottleneck to overall performance (there are distinctions here for the various clock domains, but the general principle holds true). Chip designers often use higher-speed transistors in these areas of a chip, but this comes at the cost of reduced transistor density and increased power consumption, as faster transistors are leakier and thus consume more power. The new Turbo Cells provide chip architects with a more refined tool to mitigate critical paths.

The 14A node features three distinct standard cell libraries, which use process node-specific building blocks (standard cells constructed with transistors) of pre-designed logic gates and circuit elements. Designers use electronic design automation (EDA) software tools to utilize the libraries during the design flow and generally lay them out in rows.

Intel's 14A has three different libraries: the 'tall' library has transistor cells optimized for high frequency (low density, leaky), the 'mid-size' library is optimized for performance per watt, and the 'short' library is focused on density for area- and power-sensitive applications. Intel has not shared density information for the various libraries yet.

Short libraries are used heavily in CPUs and GPUs to pack in the most transistors possible while keeping power density at manageable levels. That's where Intel's new Turbo Cells step in.



Turbo Cells are designed to enhance performance by increasing the transistor drive current for short libraries when they're used to create double-height libraries (the height of two standard rows), all while maintaining a high-density arrangement for optimal area efficiency.

The above graphic represents four different arrangements of nmos and pmos ribbons/nanosheets (pink and green) with varying widths and configurations to optimize drive current for different scenarios. The width of the ribbons can be adjusted, or they can be merged independently to create very wide ribbons for maximum drive current delivery. The various options provide designers with a robust toolkit for tailored implementations.

Intel says Turbo Cells can ultimately be used to mix in faster and less power-efficient cells with the power-efficient cells within the same design block to create the right balance of power, performance, and area (PPA) for any given use case.

Critical paths are the ultimate bottleneck; think of them as the weakest link in the chain. Intel's new Turbo Cells are designed to boost overall processor performance by speeding up those paths, but without making the compromises often used to solve the critical path problem. We'll have to wait until 2027 to see how that pans out.

This filter will stop an old song from crashing your PC.

In 2005, it was discovered that Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation would crash a particular laptop because it matched the natural resonant frequency of its hard drive. The PC manufacturer behind this model solved the issue by introducing an audio filter to Windows XP that dampened the offending frequency and prevented it from killing the laptop. Programmer Raymond Chen posted on the Microsoft Dev Blog that this particular filter was installed “at least until Windows 7”.

However, Microsoft imposed a new directive that required Audio Processing Objects (APO), the technical term for these audio filters on Windows, to be disabled by the user on command. That means if you go to Windows' classic Sound settings Control Panel app, open the properties of your default speaker, click on the Advanced tab, and uncheck Enable audio enhancements, all filters, including the one potentially protecting your PC from Janet Jackson's errant hit, will be deactivated.

This isn't good news for the manufacturer, because if some of its users turned off all APOs and started playing the number 2 Billboard Hot 100 song for January 1990, its laptop would start crashing. And because this is such an obscure issue, most people would not relate the problems they're experiencing to the action they took in their PC's sound settings. Instead, they'd just start blaming the manufacturer or Windows itself for sucking.

Thankfully, the software giant gave it an exception. This means the APO stopping Janet Jackson from crippling a laptop now runs permanently, even if you turned off all audio enhancements on your Windows PC.

Chen did not reveal who the manufacturer was or which laptop (or hard drive) model was affected by Rhythm Nation, so we wouldn't know how long Janet Jackson's track from 1989 would have affected laptops. Instead, he simply called it Fabrikam, the fictional company name Microsoft uses in documentation, examples, and other scenarios requiring real-world examples.

Nevertheless, we believe this hard-drive-crash-inducing resonant frequency no longer bothers most computers, especially as most devices have now switched to SSDs. But even if you keep an older laptop running and upgrade it to Windows 11, the special audio filter should still protect it from 30-year-old audio tracks that wreak havoc on newer gear.

The Trump administration's aggressive efforts to open up swathes of the American wilderness to commercial logging are raising everything from eyebrows to serious concerns among scientists and current and former federal land managers.

A month after President Trump signed two executive orders regarding the national security concerns of timber and lumber exports and expansion of American timber production, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins tripled down.

The secretary published a memo creating an “emergency situation determination” for over 112,646,000 acres (455,862 square kilometers) of national forest. There are 154 national forests in the United States, comprising about 188.3 million acres (762,000 sq. km), so the affected areas are about 60% of all the country's national forest lands.

Framed as a way of addressing a crisis of wildfires, the memo “relies heavily on references to ‘domestic timber production' and ‘heavy-handed federal policies' like environmental safeguards,” as noted in a Los Padres Forest Watch release.

When contacted for comment, ForestWatch executive director Jeff Kuyper referred Gizmodo to his comments in the release: “This is a thinly veiled attempt to ramp up logging on our national forests, bypass environmental laws, and line the pockets of the timber industry,” which “coupled with mass firings, budget cuts, and environmental rollbacks … will wreak havoc on the Los Padres and other national forests across the country.”

The second Trump administration's first 100 days has focused on systematically slashing funding and staff across key federal science agencies, undermining their ability to research, monitor, and respond to environmental and public health crises.

At the behest of the administration, agencies like NOAA and NASA are having to lay off staff and cancel contracts and research programs in the name of cost-cutting, despite their critical roles in tracking everything from hurricanes to wildfires. Many scientists and public servants are also being pushed out or reassigned from the National Park Service, part of a broader effort by the administration to cull the numbers of workers managing our country's wildlife refuges.

As indicated in the secretary's memo, the government would argue that the emergency determination is protecting the forests, not rolling back their protected status. But some experts disagree.

“These orders are under the pretense of enhancing national security which most realize is bogus,” said Elaine Leslie, the former chief of biological resources for the National Park Service, in an email to Gizmodo. “The policies articulated and implemented will weaken environmental protections to benefit wealthy corporations in an expedited manner.”

That's not to say that Leslie and other ecologists are against managing wildland. Quite the opposite: Prescribed fires and thinning are regular devices in the forest management toolkit, helping to reduce the spread of out-of-control and massive wildfires and encouraging local environments to thrive.

There is plenty of evidence that particular tree removal treatments reduce the severity of wildfires, said Mark Ashton, an ecologist at Yale University and director of the university's forests, in an email to Gizmodo.

Besides that, the country's national forests are managed quite differently than its national parks. “Much of their land base has been managed for timber and logging—so there is nothing new to that,” Ashton said. “It is a question of how and where it is done.”

And there's the rub. The scale and approach to logging and land management may look very different under the Trump administration, affecting a huge swath of national forests under the recent executive orders and secretarial memo.

“Thinning isn't logging—generally removing smaller [diameter at breast height] trees,” Leslie said. “Logging generally harvests large, mature, often old-growth trees in quite large tracts.” In other words, the government's executive orders seem to target a very different component of forested areas than those targeted by people reducing the risk from fires.

“If it was normal administration with an intact full professional workforce working for the Forest Service—this should not be an issue,” Ashton noted.

“The Forest Service has a level of expertise matched by no other organization in the world—or at least it did have,” he added. “It is worrying in the fact that so many of these people have been released and it is difficult to see if this administration will adhere to the multitude of rules and regulations that governed the management of the land.”

“As shown, many forests supervisors have quit or retired. Civil servants are at a point of follow orders or they know they will be fired,” Leslie said. “Hopefully the environmental groups come together to sue.”

The Biden administration didn't do as much as it could to protect America's forests, either, but the new administration's attitude towards science agencies and national parks to date doesn't offer much confidence in their stewardship of our unspoiled national forests.

“I think what is of critical importance are the long-term consequences of these expanded actions,” Leslie said. “This type of logging without thorough environmental analysis will put endangered species at risk. It will threaten biodiversity, water quality and whole watersheds. It will decrease wildlife habitat and increase fragmentation.”

According to the Los Padres Forest Watch, the most destructive fires won't be prevented by commercial logging—rather, those blazes are fueled by extreme winds (like those that powered Los Angeles' devastating wildfires at the beginning of the year) and climate conditions.

“By using 'emergency' declarations to fast-track commercial logging under the false promise of fire protection, the Trump Administration is putting special interests ahead of science and leaving local communities more vulnerable at a critical time when climate change is worsening fire risk across the country,” the Forest Watch stated.

But this administration has made no secret of its position on climate, either. The fractious situation between the administration and the national forests may well end up in the courts, but Trump's actions indicate that the current administration would prefer to move fast and break things than whatever the less chaotic alternative is. And if you chop down old growth forest, it'll take a long time to get it back.

Last week, the US Department of the Interior announced that it would speed up the approval process for certain fossil fuel projects, proclaiming that environmental analyses that previously would have taken years must now be taken down to, at maximum, a month. While the new procedures are seemingly a gift to the industry, this may actually be terrible news for pipeline developers, drillers, and miners.

“If I were a developer of any of these projects, I would look at this order and smack my forehead,” says Sam Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, the United States' biggest environmental nonprofit law organization. “I don't want my project to be authorized pursuant to these laughable procedures. It won't hold up in court.”

The new procedures use President Donald Trump's “national energy emergency,” proclaimed in an executive order in the first week of his presidency, to shorten timelines for federal reviews, including environmental reviews and reviews attached to cultural landmarks. Reviews that take into account a project's impact on the environment are particularly truncated under this new policy. Processes that would normally take a year, the Department of the Interior says, must now be completed within just two weeks, while those reviews that might last longer than a year must now be done in under a month.

Experts say, however, that the new timelines are so short that they almost certainly run afoul of the bedrock laws involved: the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Mass ongoing layoffs inside the federal government—including at Interior, where The Washington Post reported that a quarter of the agency's staff may eventually be cut—means that there may soon be far too few staff to handle reviews that would be near impossible to fulfill even in normal circumstances. This leaves any projects that try to break ground under the new timelines open to very easy legal challenges—something that Sankar says is “low-hanging fruit” for people who are impacted by a project and who want to take a developer to court.

“The people who wrote NEPA and the Endangered Species Act meant for the public to be involved, meant for real expertise to be applied, and meant for these to be meaningful ways to protect the environment and biodiversity,” Sankar says. “To shorten these periods to where you can barely get a letter from point A to point B in that time means that they're not trying to comply at all. The good news is that it's all so manifestly illegal that virtually anything they do under these new legal procedures will be ripe for a legal challenge.”

These fast-forwarded processes are tied to a part of NEPA that states that agencies can bypass environmental reviews in case of an emergency. Ryan Hathaway, who worked on NEPA-related issues within Interior for more than a decade, says that this emergency justification has been used in the past for concrete events that pose an immediate threat to health and public safety, like wildfires or floods, with specific actions that needed to be taken—rather than a vague and open-ended energy “emergency.”

“Lawyers are going to have a field day with this,” says Hathaway, who now works as a director at Lawyers for Good Government, a legal nonprofit dedicated to progressive advocacy.

It's clear these new rules are exclusively a gift to extractive industries like drilling and mining. Solar and wind projects—which the administration has repeatedly attacked, withdrawing leases for offshore wind and ordering a construction halt on projects already underway—are notably absent from the list of projects allowed to undergo accelerated timelines. But ironically, these orders are only contributing to an increasingly uncertain environment for fossil fuel producers under the new Trump administration.

Even before the chaos caused by Liberation Day, Big Oil faced a potential reckoning with the president it helped elect. While the shale oil boom of the early 2010s rewarded executives for increased production, that strategy led to too much supply, leading prices per barrel to drop during the first Trump administration. After prices bottomed out during the pandemic, investors became more careful about unrestrained production.

“It's not government regulation that's limiting the production growth rate in the United States. It's Wall Street,” says Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, DC.

The industry was given a boost in the early 2020s with the worldwide energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but investors kept a cautious eye on prices. Despite President Joe Biden's climate focus, the US oil and gas industry became the world's biggest crude oil producer in 2023, and reached a record high of producing 13.4 million barrels per day late last year. The challenge under the Trump administration would become balancing profitability with the president's goal of unleashing “energy dominance.” Trump, after all, has stated that he wants oil to drop to $50 a barrel—a price far too low to be profitable for the industry.

Each quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas publishes a regional report on the state of the oil and gas industry in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, which includes anonymous survey responses from executives. The vitriol towards the White House in these comments from the first survey of this year, published in late March, shocked analysts.

“The key word to describe 2025 so far is ‘uncertainty' and as a public company, our investors hate uncertainty,” one anonymous executive said. “This uncertainty is being caused by the conflicting messages coming from the new administration. There cannot be ‘US energy dominance' and $50 per barrel oil; those two statements are contradictory.”

"'Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” another wrote.

Trump has continued to hand out questionable gifts to industry. On Thursday, Interior announced that it had changed some policies around offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that could, according to the agency, increase production in the Gulf by up to 100,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, Interior is also reportedly assembling a list of fossil fuel deposits on public lands that it plans to open up for production.

Like the accelerated timelines for environmental permitting, these gifts come with significant strings attached. While the Gulf order will help companies currently producing to up their productivity, they're unlikely to lure new customers to the region: Offshore drilling is expensive, and four-fifths of the more than 2,000 active leases in the Gulf are sitting unused.

And while opening up public lands to drilling may sound like an industry wish-list item, companies faced with an uncertain American regulatory environment—from the looming threat of tariffs, to accelerated permitting timelines that could get projects held up in court, to promises made under a Republican administration that may be withdrawn the next time a Democrat is president—may not want to invest years and capital in starting up a project in a risky area.

“For more than a century, energy companies have looked at projects in part based on the host country's political risk, but the United States wasn't on that list,” Seigle says. “These days we see huge swings in political support for oil and gas, and the trend of reversing the prior administration's approach. So energy companies and their investors are now thinking about the political risk of energy projects right here at home.”

Despite steady increases in rates of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) after mastectomy, racial disparities in IBR have persisted in the years since implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), reports a study in the May issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer.

"Our study demonstrates that Hispanic women are more likely to undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts in the post-ACA era," comments lead author Rachel E. Schafer, MPH, a medical student at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. "However, our analysis shows persistent racial disparities in breast reconstruction care. To better understand these trends, future studies are needed for targeted interventions to ensure equitable reconstructive care for all patients with breast cancer."

The researchers used data from the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Project to analyze trends in IBR. The analysis focused on the impact of the ACA, which had some provisions – such as expanding protections for pre-existing conditions and reducing the number of uninsured Americans – with the potential to enhance healthcare access to historically marginalized groups. The analysis included 224,506 patients undergoing mastectomy in 2005-08, before passage of the ACA; or 2016-22, after full ACA implementation.

Pre-ACA data showed significant racial disparities in IBR. Reconstruction rates ranged from 35.1% in White patients to 28.8% in Asian patients, 22.3% in Black/African American patients, and 3.8% in American Indian/Alaska Native patients. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity were also less likely to undergo IBR: 28.0%, compared to 33.4% in non-Hispanic patients.

After ACA implementation, IBR rates increased across racial groups. The largest increases were seen for American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American patients: by 27.6% and 24.2%, respectively, compared to a 16.9% increase among White patients. Smaller but significant increases were seen in Asian patients and those classified as "other" race. Hispanic patients had a 25.8% increase in IBR, compared to 14.5% in non-Hispanic patients.

However, racial minority groups continued to have lower IBR rates in the years since the ACA rollout. In 2016-22, the IBR rate was 52.0% among White patients, compared to 46.5% for Black/African American, 38.7% for Asian, and 31.4% in American Indian/Alaska Native patients. In contrast, Hispanic patients were more likely to undergo IBR compared to non-Hispanic patients: 56.6% versus 45.7%.

The researchers note some important limitations of their study. It cannot account for the wide range of factors affecting access to reconstructive surgery or for the "complex interplay of cultural, social, and individual factors" affecting decisions about breast reconstruction.

For patients undergoing mastectomy, breast reconstruction can restore form and enhance patient satisfaction. The new analysis shows "a steady increase in immediate breast reconstruction rates in all minority groups when compared to White patients" since the ACA.

"However, despite this advancement, disparities persist among different racial groups, indicating a complex landscape of reconstructive surgery rates despite legislative efforts," the researchers write. "These findings underscore the need for continued efforts to address disparities and promote equitable reconstructive care."

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Art Caplan. I'm at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. 

One of the things I think was a very sad, terrible theme that came up in many political campaigns — it was in the Trump campaign and in campaigns of various governors and senators — was the idea that immigrants, whatever one thinks of our clearly broken immigration policy, somehow are threats to the health of the American people. 

There were suggestions flying around that immigrants were bringing bad genes into the country. These were kind of allusions to out-of-date discredited views about eugenics, and that we don't want them here because they're going to somehow weaken the health of our race. You can hear businessmen touting these ideas. Some of our billionaire entrepreneurs talk about the threat they see. This sometimes goes under the name of the “great replacement theory.” 

We know that most of the groups that people are talking about aren't even a genetic class. There are no Guatemalan genes. There are no Panamanian genes. There really aren't any groups that cluster around many of the cultural and social terminologies that we use to describe people. There are no Somali genes. There are no Vietnamese genes.

These people have genes, but it's culture, history, and even, to some extent, colonialism and racism, that defines the group, not some cluster of genes that's in the group. I don't mean to suggest there aren't genetic diseases. There are. I don't even mean to say that there aren't genetic diseases that cluster within some ethnic and racial groups, but in the immigration debate, those categories are often phony.

It's even worse now as people begin to think about deportation. Some officials, in high office and at the state and even local levels, are talking about identifying diseases that people might be bringing with them if they come into the country legally or illegally. 

There's a public health law known as Title 42, which in the earliest days of the pandemic when coronavirus was bouncing around, gave people the right to prohibit immigrants who were thought to be carrying diseases into the country. I think, currently, some are thinking they can extend that to get people out of the country — citizens or not, dreamers or not, whatever they might be — because they are carriers of disease. 

I think it's hugely important for doctors and public health professionals to speak up and say that this is just false, whether you're telling patients who bring it up and worry about it in the office, you're at a town meeting, or you're thinking about testifying about one of these issues in your community. There is no evidence that any immigrants, particularly, let's say, on the Mexican border, are bringing in more coronavirus, tuberculosis, or measles.

It's just not true that immigrants are disease carriers or that they brought plagues or disease problems into this country. It's an old idea. It was used in the 19th and 20th centuries to prohibit migrants from Eastern Europe, China, and Ireland, again and again, with people charging that they were carriers of disease and that they would infect us. 

There's not much evidence that it was true then, and there's certainly no evidence that it's true now. Fishing for disease as a reason to restrict, ban, or deport people is not something that medicine should be complicit with. 

We can still decide what immigration policies we want. Adding bogus, phony, or disinformation science as a rationale is bad not only in terms of being the wrong reasons to deal with someone who wants to immigrate, but also it is a way to stereotype and make a group bear a claim of being disease ridden or having inferior health. That really isn't fair and isn't right to saddle them with, wherever they live. 

I'm Art Caplan, at the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Thanks for watching.

A new systematic review has found that parents and other child caregivers who have alcohol-related diagnoses are twice as likely to maltreat children in their care than parents and caregivers with no alcohol-related diagnoses. 'Alcohol-related diagnoses' included alcohol-related hospitalisation, alcohol-related service use, or a history of clinically determined alcohol dependence. 'Child maltreatment' included physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse; neglect; and other types of maltreatment such as harsh parenting.

The study pooled the results from twelve studies of child maltreatment. All were cohort studies in high-income countries: three in Australia, one in Denmark, one in New Zealand, two in South Korea, one in the United Kingdom, and four in the United States. The sample size ranged from 501 to 84,245 (median 4782). Caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses were associated with higher child maltreatment incidence (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.89) and recurrence (1.92; 1.13-3.28) compared with caregivers without alcohol-related diagnoses.

Lead author Dr. June Leung, of the SHORE & Whariki Research Centre, Massey University, says "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the relationship between caregiver alcohol use and all types of child maltreatment. We found consistent associations between caregiver alcohol-related diagnoses and child maltreatment. We also could not rule out a link between any caregiver drinking and child maltreatment. Our findings call for stronger actions to limit alcohol harm, including child maltreatment."

 April 30, 2025  

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed precisely measured human fecal material to foster a new era in gut microbiome research. 

According to the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for Gut Microbiome Research & Education, this critical resource will help advance the utility and reproducibility of microbiome-based diagnostics — “which still remain relatively meaningless clinically, although patients continue to buy direct-to-consumer tests, and a standard reference material will mean there's a better way to ensure quality control and accuracy.” 

Though not a therapeutic, Human Fecal Material RM is expected to speed up gastrointestinal (GI) therapeutics since many microbiome-based drugs are inspired by fecal transplants with human stool as the developmental starting point. A standardized reference material will be an important resource as industry develops and tests new drugs. It can be purchased online at the NIST Store (shop.nist.gov).

The product consists of eight frozen vials of exhaustively studied human feces suspended in aqueous solution. Available are more than 25 pages of data identifying the key microbes and biomolecules in the material. Scientists, including those working at biopharmaceutical and biotech companies, can use this material to further their research and develop new drugs that target the microbiome, including treatments that contain living bacteria. 

According to NIST, the stool material is “the most precisely measured, scientifically analyzed, and richly characterized human fecal standard ever produced. 

“The project ran for about 6 years from start to finish, the last 2 for manufacturing, characterization, and writing,” said NIST molecular geneticist Scott A. Jackson, PhD, who helped develop the product. “We hope our reference material will lay the foundation for gut microbiome research to thrive and reach its full potential.” 

As founder of NIST's Complex Microbial Systems Group, Jackson is leading international efforts to improve microbiome and metagenomic measurements by organizing inter-lab studies and refining reference materials and methods. 

The project collected stool from two cohorts of donors, ie, vegetarians and omnivores, with each cohort comprising four to six donors. Material from each cohort was pooled and homogenized before being aliquoted into 5000 vials per cohort. About 300 tubes from each cohort were picked, and aliquots then underwent multiomic analyses. 

Offering his perspective on the new product, Sudhir K. Dutta, MBBS, MACG, associate professor in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, said, “This tool will be 100% useful for microbiome research.”

And according to Lori Holtz, MD, MSPH, professor of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, the material will aid microbiome research by allowing interpretability and repeatability across studies. “Microbiome research is a relatively new field, and protocols differ from group to group and lab to lab, so it's been difficult to compare results across studies,” she told Medscape Medical News. “A standard stool product will allow for greater comparability in preclinical studies and later clinical trials testing interventions to alter the microbiome.”

The NIST developers are looking forward to reaction from the GI research community. “Over the last several years, we've released smaller pilot batches of material to smaller groups of stakeholders,” said Jackson. “We've used the feedback on these earlier batches to inform the manufacturing and characterization of the final batch that was released in March, but we don't yet have any feedback yet on the current material.”

Jackson, Dutta, and Holtz disclosed having no relevant competing interests.

A new study highlights the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disorders and brain health.

A recent Nutrients study explores the medicinal role of curcumin in the treatment and prevention of neuroinflammation and metabolic disorders.

Curcumin is extracted from the rhizome of turmeric, which is otherwise known as Curcuma longa, a plant in the Zingerberaceae family.

Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound characterized by two aromatic rings with conjugated double bonds. The chemical structure of curcumin supports its electron donor role and prevents free radical formation.

Phenolic compounds impart color to many fruits and play a vital role in facilitating seed dispersal. Polyphenols also protect plants from oxidative damage caused by sunlight and other environmental factors, in addition to preserving the organoleptic qualities of plant food products like red wine, olive oils, and wheat.

Polyphenols are mostly soluble in organic solvents like acetone and ethanol and insoluble in water. These compounds also remain stable in acidic conditions, such as the stomach, which allows curcumin to remain intact to influence metabolic processes beyond the gastrointestinal tract.

Enzymes in the intestines and liver degrade curcumin in two phases. During phase I, the double bonds in curcumin are reduced to produce metabolites like dihydrocurcumin, hexa-hydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, and octahydrocurcumin.

During phase II, these metabolites are conjugated with glucuronic acid and sulfate. Some studies have reported that curcumin may also be metabolized by gut bacteria, particularly in the colon.

Polyphenols can counteract inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are processes implicated in the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Certain metabolites derived from curcumin, such as tetrahydrocurcumin, exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory activity of curcumin. In human THP1 monocytes, curcumin doses ranging from 7.5 μM to 30 μM successfully mitigated the effects of stimulation with bacterial toxin (LPS) and INFγ (interferon γ) in a dose-dependent manner. This antioxidant activity was attributed to the blocking of toll-like receptor 4 / mitogen-activated protein kinase (TLR4/MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways, as well as reversed M1 polarization.

Curcumin doses of 25.5 μM or less have also been shown to reduce inflammasome activation. One recent study also reported that 20 μM of curcumin may prevent inflammation-related damage caused by hypoxia.

A recent meta-analysis revealed that consuming 1,500 mg or more of curcumin every day for one month could significantly reduce body mass index (BMI) values and other body parameters, especially when combined with lifestyle changes. Considering its medicinal properties, various curcumin-based formulations have been devised to improve the bioavailability of this polyphenol compound, such as co-administering curcumin with piperine and nanocurcumin encapsulation.

In vitro studies have reported that curcumin influences the cellular viability rate and cell cycle regulation of preadipocytes. At high doses, curcumin promotes DNA fragmentation and enhances the apoptotic rate by activating caspases.

Low doses of curcumin reduce cell proliferation without affecting viability. Mechanistically, curcumin reduces the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and delays clonal expansion and the cell cycle, thereby exerting antiadipogenic effects.

Curcumin also interferes with adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) activity to block anabolism and promote lipid catabolism, both of which can support the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome. More specifically, activated AMPK reduces lipogenesis by inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), prevents triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (GPAT-1), and triggers β-oxidation of fatty acids by increasing transport with carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1).

Within the brain, low doses of curcumin may prevent inflammation by inhibiting microglia polarization and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, like interleukin 1β  (IL-1β) and IL-6. Curcumin also increases the activity of anti-inflammatory molecules like arginase 1 and IL-4.

Clinical trial results have highlighted the beneficial effects of curcumin in treating overweight patients with chronic systemic inflammation. For example, 80 mg of curcumin daily for three months led to a significant reduction in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in overweight/obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) between 25 and 50 years of age.

In a separate study, type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients treated with 300 mg daily of curcuminoids for three months exhibited a significant reduction in insulin resistance parameters and circulating levels of free fatty acid (FFA), which are often present in high amounts in obese patients with inflammation. Obese patients with T2D and depression who were treated with 1,500 mg daily of curcuminoids for one year also reported a significant reduction in depressive symptoms.

The oral administration of curcumin affects the intestinal microbial composition, particularly the genera Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella, which increases short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis in the cecum and colon. Multiple studies have also reported the neuroprotective effects of curcumin through its activity throughout the gut-brain axis.

In the future, additional research is needed to confirm the translational potential of curcumin in clinical practice. Large clinical trials with heterogeneous populations should also be conducted to confirm the clinical utility of curcumin in treating patients with metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

AVI-4773 and related MPro inhibitors outperform existing treatments like nirmatrelvir in preclinical studies, offering a promising path toward pan-coronavirus therapies.

Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous novel antiviral therapeutic agents have been developed to target key proteases involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication. Nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir, for example, are main protease (Mpro) inhibitors that are currently approved for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.

The continuous emergence of highly transmissible, pathogenic, and immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants has weakened the efficacy of existing antiviral agents. Moreover, the looming threat of future pandemics due to coronaviral reservoirs in bats and other small mammals emphasizes the importance of identifying novel therapeutics with pan-coronavirus activity.

A recent study published in Science Advances reports the recent discovery of Mpro inhibitors that exhibit broad activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

Previously, the researchers of the current study screened 862 million custom molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, which led to the identification of several scaffolds with micromolar inhibitory activity. AVI-1084, for example, exhibited a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 29 μM.

This scaffold was subsequently used to contract a library of over 17,000 analogs that were evaluated for their binding activity to and docking into Mpro. Seven of these analog compounds exhibited in vitro Mpro activity, the most potent of which was AVI-3570 with an IC50 of 1.5 μM. The improved potency of these compounds was attributed to fluoro- and chloro- substitutions in the thiophene ring of AVI-1084 that increased their interactions with the Mpro S2 pocket.

However, none of the seven identified compounds were capable of modifying the key pyridinone group occupying the S1 pocket. When an isoquinoline group was used to replace the pyridinone ring, AVI-3318 was created and found to be 50-fold more potent than AVI-1084.

X-ray crystallography of the AVI-3318-MPro complex provided similar results to the docking simulation assay and confirmed all hypothesized major interactions between the compounds and both the S1 and S2 pockets of Mpro. Additional structure-activity relationship (SAR) expansion involved adding various side chains at the remaining two positions of the dihydrouracil core in an effort to further improve compound potency.

AVI-4303, which is a C5 benzotriazole analog, exhibited ten-fold higher potency than AVI-3318. Comparatively, N1 propargyl analogs including AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 successfully bound to the S1 site with a nanomolar IC50, which is 100-fold more potent than the des-propargyl molecule AVI-4375, which had an IC50 of 7.4 μM.

Mouse in vivo studies demonstrated powerful antiviral activity of AVI-4516 against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant of concern (VOC). AVI-4692 and AVI-4694 also exhibited potent activity against human common cold coronaviruses like α-HCoV 229E and β-HCoV OC43, as well as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the SARS-CoV-2 Beta, Delta, and BA.2 variants.

Most analogs lost activity against nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants; however, AVI-4516 remained highly potent against the SARS-CoV-2 E166Q variant. AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 retained similar potency to nirmaltrevir, whereas AVI-4692 and AVI-4694 were more potent than nirmatrelvir when tested against a triple mutant containing the most common mutations associated with drug resistance.

AVI-4773 reduced viral titers to undetectable levels  after three doses, which is a three-log reduction in viral load as compared to ensitrelvir treatment.

The combination of C6-aryl substitution with the propargyl warhead [AVI-4694] has great potential to produce an agent that effectively targets recently emergent variants of SARS-CoV-2.”

The inhibitory activity of AVI-4773 and other compounds in this series is likely due to the unactivated N-propargyl side chain. Despite being a weak electryophyl, the N-location of the terminal alkyne of this side chain helps to stabilize the compound to facilitate its reaction with the Mpro Cys145. The alkyne warheads cause powerful and permanent inhibition, which is comparable to the reversible inhibition produced by the noncovalent binding of the nitrile warheads in nirmatrelvir.

AVI-4516 and AVI-4773 exhibit potent MPro inhibition, which warrants additional research to optimize the chemical structure of these tool compounds for the development of future pan-coronavirus therapeutics.

Some of the key advantages of this distinct chemotype include easy modification by functional groups or substitutions at different binding sites, simple synthesis protocol, reduced manufacturing costs, potent pan-coronaviral activity, as well as superior pharmacokinetic properties and tissue distribution.

Researchers at UCL have uncovered why individuals who experience anxiety and depression often struggle with persistent low self-belief in their abilities.

A new study, published in Nature Communications, examined two large groups of people (230 and 278 participants) to measure their "confidence" when doing individual jobs and their "self-belief" when judging their overall performance of these individual jobs collectively.

They found that those with symptoms of anxiety and depression tended to build their overall self-belief by focusing their attention on jobs where they thought they didn't perform as strongly (i.e. on low confidence) – rather than also considering jobs where they did perform well (i.e. on high confidence).

In order to gain a better understanding of how participants evaluate themselves (also known as metacognition or their awareness and understanding of their own thought processes), they were asked to complete a computer game, which asked them to help the residents of a fictional town, named "Fruitville", to complete their farming jobs.

These jobs required skills involving fine-grained vision (to distinguish different fruits) as well as memory (to remember which fruits were picked). For each completed job, participants were also asked to report their confidence in their performance.

Then at the end of each session of the game, they reported how well they thought they performed on the entire session (i.e. overall self-belief about their ability).

During the game, an auditor occasionally appeared to give people feedback on how well they were doing.

The researchers found that people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression did not differ in their performance on the games than those with less strong symptoms.

They also found that positive feedback boosted overall self-belief, and negative feedback reduced it in all participants – regardless of whether they had symptoms of anxiety or depression.

However, people with stronger symptoms of anxiety and depression still had lower overall self-belief. This is because they tended to ignore those jobs within the game where they felt confident in their choices and instead, focused on times when they were less confident.

This reduced sensitivity to their own confidence helps explain why people with certain mental health conditions have persistent low self-belief - despite their actual performance not differing from others and despite receiving similarly positive feedback.

Lead author, Dr. Sucharit Katyal who completed the work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and is currently at the University of Copenhagen, said: "Overall, our findings offer a simple yet powerful message – that the persistent negative self-beliefs experienced by people with anxiety and depression are often illusory, and may be rooted in a dysfunctional view of how they evaluate themselves . This would also explain why anxiety and depression symptoms are also closely linked to imposter syndrome where some people persistently doubt their achievements despite being competent.

"When forming beliefs about ourselves, we should take our own metacognitive estimates with a pinch of salt, and perhaps adequately rely on the feedback provided by others."

The researchers now hope that their findings will help pave the way for more effective interventions and support strategies for people with anxiety and depression.

By understanding how these individuals respond differently to their own performance and feedback, we can develop better strategies to support them in building and maintaining confidence – so they can flourish in the workplace and beyond."

Employing too few permanent nurses on hospital wards is linked to longer inpatient stays, readmissions, patient deaths, and ultimately costs more in lives and money, finds a long term study published online in the journal BMJ Quality & Safety.

Redressing the balance is cost-effective, saving an estimated £4728 for each year of healthy life gained per patient, but not if temporary agency staff are used to plug the gaps, the findings indicate. 

Inadvertent understaffing–through unfilled vacancies–or deliberate–through cost cutting measures–of ward nurses risks harming hospital patients, and is a key contributor to nursing recruitment and retention issues, say the researchers.

Much of the existing research on the impact of the nursing staff:patient ratio is cross- sectional and so of limited use in determining causal factors, they add.

To find out if investing in higher nurse staffing levels to offset understaffing would be cost-effective, they set out to estimate the associations between registered nurse and healthcare assistant staffing levels and risk of patient deaths, readmissions, and length of stay in acute adult inpatient wards.

They drew on data provided by four NHS hospital trusts with diverse nurse staffing levels, sizes, teaching status, serving diverse local populations in England. Three of the trusts provided acute inpatient services predominantly from single hospital sites, and the fourth provided inpatient services across four sites within one city.

The data were derived from electronic healthcare records and staffing rosters and spanned the period April 2015 to March 2020 for a total of 626,313 patients in 185 different acute care wards.

Two main nursing team roles were included in the study: registered nurses (RNs) who have completed university degree level training and are registered with the profession's regulator; and nursing support staff (such as healthcare assistants) who don't have this level of training and who are largely unregulated.

The incremental cost effectiveness of eliminating the understaffing of these two roles was estimated from the costs and consequences of moving from the observed staffing shortfall averaged over the study period to the planned staffing level. 

Patients spent an average of 8 days on the ward. Over the first 5 days of their inpatient stay, patients were provided with a daily average of just over 5 hours of care from RNs and just under 3 hours of care from nursing support staff.

The calculations showed that patients on wards understaffed by RNs were more likely to die (5% vs 4% for those with adequate RN staffing levels), to be readmitted (15% vs 14%), and to stay in hospital longer (8 days vs 5 days), with similar figures for inadequate numbers of nursing support staff. 

Patients who experienced understaffing received an average care shortfall of 1 hour 9 minutes/day in the first 5 days, while those who didn't experience understaffing, received an average of 3 hours 22 minutes of care above the ward average. 

During the study period, 31,885 patients died. Each day a patient experienced RN understaffing (staffing below the ward average) during the first 5 days of their stay, the risks of death and readmission within 30 days increased by 8% and 1%, respectively. When all 5 days after admission were understaffed, length of stay increased by 69%. 

Days of nursing support understaffing were also associated with similar increases in the risks of death and length of stay within 30 days: 7% and 61%, respectively. But the risk of readmission within 30 days fell by 0.6%.

The estimated total cost of providing care for the 626,313 adults included in the study amounted to £2,613,385,125, or £4173 per admission.

The researchers calculated that eliminating understaffing of both nursing roles would cost an additional £197 per patient admission, avoiding 6527 of the 31,885 deaths during the study period and gaining 44,483 years of life in good health. 

This equates to an additional staff cost of £2778 per healthy year of life, and £2685 if reduced sick leave and averted readmissions are taken into account. But accounting for reduced length of stay amounts to savings of £4728 per additional year of healthy life gained-an overall cost saving from increasing staffing levels.

If agency staff are used to eliminate understaffing instead, staff costs for each additional healthy year of life gained were higher, ranging from £7320 to £14,639.

"The findings give no indication that it makes rational economic sense to target efforts to rectify low staffing only on the most acute patients. Not only is this logistically difficult for patients whose acuity is emergent (occurring while on a general ward), it also gives much less benefit at a considerably higher cost per unit improvement in outcome," explain the researchers. 

"Steps to address low staffing for the general (lower acuity) population are likely to benefit high-acuity patients as well, in so far as they are in the same units, whereas the opposite is unlikely to occur if interventions are targeted on high-acuity patients in high-acuity units," they add.

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that the data came exclusively from hospitals in the English NHS, so may not be more widely applicable. Understaffing was also judged relative to ward norms rather than a validated assessment of staffing need.

But the researchers conclude: "When considering alternative policy strategies, this study indicates the importance of prioritising investment in RNs employed on wards over support staff, as well as showing there are no shortcuts to employing enough RNs, as using temporary staff is more costly and less effective."

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have developed a new diagnostic test that can quickly and accurately diagnose bacterial meningitis. The test measures the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid, a protein that is already often tested in blood to detect bacterial infections. Research shows that elevated CRP in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. Currently it often takes a long time before meningitis is diagnosed, which delays the start of adequate treatment. The study is published today in The Lancet Regional Health Europe. 

Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening condition in which one in six patients die and half of the survivors have residual symptoms. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. 

The distinction between bacterial meningitis and similar conditions is often difficult for doctors. Until now, reliable diagnostic tests that could quickly distinguish were lacking."

Matthijs Brouwer, last author and Amsterdam UMC neurologist 

Researchers at Amsterdam UMC have discovered that the CRP protein in cerebrospinal fluid is a very reliable indicator of bacterial meningitis. CRP is already frequently tested in blood to detect bacterial infections, but the value of this test in cerebrospinal fluid had not been well researched until now. After previous successful laboratory tests, the researchers now showed that the device that measures CRP in blood is also sensitive enough to measure CRP in cerebrospinal fluid. 

"It is a huge gain that the existing infrastructure of the laboratory can be used for the CRP measurements in cerebrospinal fluid. As a result, the test result is already known half an hour after the epidural and the correct treatment of the patient can therefore be started quickly," says Brouwer. 

Since June 2024, the new test has been used in the daily practice of the Amsterdam UMC. In the study published today, researchers describe how the test was introduced and how effective it is in practice.

"Our results show that all patients with bacterial meningitis had an elevated CRP in their cerebrospinal fluid. This was the case in only a few patients without bacterial meningitis, " adds Brouwer. The test also proved reliable in additional studies in children and patients from at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark. 

It is expected that more hospitals will adopt the test, because it can easily be performed in laboratories with existing equipment. The test only costs between three and five euros, providing an affordable and accessible solution to diagnose and treat bacterial meningitis faster. 

"Any laboratory in which CRP is measured in blood can introduce this test for cerebrospinal fluid tomorrow. We could not have predicted in advance that a new diagnostic test would be used in patients within a year of its discovery," concludes Brouwer.

Researchers have shown that better cardiovascular and mental health, as measured by the Life's Crucial 9, correlates with lower infertility rates in women; however, its predictive power offers no advantage over existing tools.

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored the associations between Life's Crucial 9 (LC9) and female infertility.

Female infertility is a common reproductive condition. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study found that female infertility prevalence has increased by over 56 million cases in the past three decades worldwide, and is also projected to increase over the next decade. Female infertility can cause emotional and psychological stress. Besides, female infertility may be linked to the development of various gynecologic cancers, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular disease.

As such, exploring risk factors for infertility for the reduction of disease burden and early prevention has important implications for reproductive health. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) is a tool for cardiovascular health assessment by the American Heart Association. Recently, LC9 was proposed, building on the LE8, and includes a mental health assessment component. LC9 is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, but with a limited increase in predictive power over LE8.

The present study examined the associations between female infertility and LC9. Female participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2013 to 2018 were included. Females not of reproductive age and those with missing data were excluded. LE8 was assessed by pooling four health behaviors (sleep health, physical activity, diet quality, and nicotine exposure) and four health factors (body mass index [BMI] and blood pressure, glucose, and lipids).

The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 was used to assess diet quality. Sleep health, physical activity, and nicotine exposure were self-reported. The blood glucose score was determined based on glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, or a history of diabetes, while the blood lipid score was derived from serum levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A depression score was calculated from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

The LC9 score was calculated as the average of the scores from the eight LE8 components and the depression score, each scaled from 0 to 100. Female infertility was ascertained from the self-reported Reproductive Health Questionnaire. Covariates included age, ethnicity/race, education, marital status, income-poverty ratio, alcohol intake, age at menarche, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) history, and intake of birth control pills.

Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between female infertility and LC9. The models were unadjusted (crude), partially adjusted (model 1), or fully adjusted (model 2). Furthermore, restricted cubic spline models were examined to investigate non-linear associations between the independent variable and female infertility. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate whether LC9 improves over LE8 in predicting female infertility.

The study enrolled 2,088 females, with an average age of 32.6 years. The prevalence of infertility was almost 14%. The infertile population was more likely to be non-single, non-Hispanic White, and older than females without infertility. Infertile females had lower LE8 and LC9 scores. As LC9 scores increased, subjects were younger, non-Hispanic White, free from infertility, moderate/light or never drinkers, and had higher age at menarche and no PID history.

The fully adjusted model indicated that a 10-point increment in LC9 reduced the odds of female infertility by more than 21%. Similarly, a 10-point increment in LE8 decreased the odds of infertility by nearly 18%. Both LE8 and LC9 showed negative linear associations with female infertility. Further, higher scores for BMI, sleep health, blood glucose, and depression were each independently and inversely associated with infertility. Other LC9 components—diet quality, physical activity, nicotine exposure, blood lipids, and blood pressure—were not significantly associated.

Further, the team identified ethnicity/race and age as significant effect modifiers. That is, the associations between infertility and LC9 were more pronounced in the Mexican American population and in women under 35 years. The ROC curve analysis revealed that LC9 and LE8 had comparable predictive capabilities for female infertility, with modest area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.594 and 0.590, respectively, indicating limited predictive utility.

The findings reveal inverse linear associations of LE8 and LC9 with female infertility. Depression, blood glucose, BMI, and sleep health were the components of the LC9 that were (inversely) associated with female infertility. However, LC9 did not significantly outperform LE8 in predicting female infertility. These results suggest that incorporating a depression score into LE8 may not be essential for infertility prediction, despite depression's association with infertility. The authors note that the overlap between depression and other cardiovascular risk factors may reduce its added predictive value, and that depression assessment tools like the PHQ-9 may introduce subjectivity. Future research should examine the benefits of LC9 in other health domains, particularly in young women and underserved ethnic groups, and explore interventions targeting modifiable LC9 components, such as sleep and mental health. Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported measures, and the inability to infer causality.

A new study finds that regardless of how loneliness is defined, by how often, how distressing, or how long it lasts, it leaves a consistent psychological footprint, with common patterns like low self-esteem and heightened social sensitivity.

Study: Revisiting the cognitive and behavioral aspects of loneliness: Insights from different measurement approaches. Image Credit: Jorm Sangsorn / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers in Austria and Switzerland investigated the cognitive and behavioral differences between participants with low and high loneliness using three independent classification methods: frequency, distress, and chronicity. The study aimed to assess the agreement between these classification methods, informing future research and treatment interventions for this growing public health concern.

Study findings demonstrated a fair to substantial classification agreement, but also revealed the considerable impact of cognitive and behavioral traits, such as interpretation bias, participant self-esteem, and social avoidance, on participant group differences across classification methods. These results highlight the complexity of loneliness and call for future treatments to carefully consider the several dimensions of loneliness across both cognitive and behavioral axes.

Loneliness is a distressing emotional state characterized by a subjective gap between desires and perceived social connection. While exceedingly common (almost everyone experiences periods of loneliness across their lifetimes), today's fast-paced world and reductions in sufficient social interaction have exacerbated chronic loneliness to a globally relevant public health concern, affecting between 5.3–12.7% of all people and causing significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

Previous research on loneliness has distinguished between adaptive and maladaptive forms of loneliness. While the former is an evolutionary cue that encourages increased social connections, the latter results from cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies and can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues, as outlined in Cacioppo and Hawkley's cognitive loneliness model.

"This model suggests that loneliness triggers a cascade of cognitive processes that heighten awareness of social disconnection. These processes include heightened sensitivity to subjective social threats, negative attributions, and biased social information processing, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors such as social withdrawal and increased vigilance toward potential social threats and thereafter maintain or increase feelings of loneliness."

A distinct yet often overlooked difference between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness is its persistence. Current measures of loneliness, including the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the Rasch-Type Loneliness Scale (RTLS), may not sufficiently account for the persistence and other dimensions of maladaptive loneliness's complexity, thereby compromising their ability to classify patients accurately and inform subsequent treatment. It is essential to note that while this study explores the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, its primary focus is on the maladaptive aspects and does not directly investigate adaptive loneliness in practice.

The present study revisits the evaluation of loneliness through the lens of the cognitive model of loneliness. It evaluates cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals across the loneliness spectrum by first classifying them via three distinct classification methodologies (frequency, distress, and chronicity), subsequently evaluating the degree of agreement between these methodologies, and finally elucidating the impacts of these psychological variables as dependent outcomes (rejection sensitivity, interpretation bias, self-esteem, etc.) among individuals grouped as lonely or not lonely.

Study data was obtained via an online survey hosted on SurveyCircle, internet forums, and social media. Target participants were German-speaking adults aged 18 years or older. Additional participant information included age, sex, education level, employment status, and relationship status.

Loneliness frequency was evaluated using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short version). Loneliness distress was measured using a 2-item custom query ('Do you feel lonely?' in combination with 'extent of distress due to loneliness'). Loneliness chronicity was evaluated via participant-reported loneliness duration, with a 24-month cutoff.

Additionally, interpretation bias was recorded using the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ), social avoidance behavior using the Cognitive-Behavioral Avoidance Scale (CBAS), rejection sensitivity using the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (A-RSQ), comfort of self-disclosure using the Distress Disclosure Index (DDI), self-esteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and avoidance goal intensity using the Inventory of Approach and Avoidance Goals (IAAM) scale.

To account for confounds introduced by overlaps with anxiety and depression, psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Subscale (SIAS-6).

Of the 1,389 individuals who participated in the online survey, 553 did not complete it, and 44 participants failed data integrity checks, resulting in a final study cohort of 790 participants (mean age = 31.86, 81% female). Loneliness classification methodologies classified 15.95%, 29.75%, and 19.49% of participants as 'lonely' based on frequency, distress, and chronicity criteria, respectively.

Agreement analyses between classification methodologies revealed moderate agreement between frequency and distress criteria (78.10%, Cohen's κ = 0.40), fair agreement between frequency and chronicity (79.74%, Cohen's κ = 0.31), and substantial agreement between distress and chronicity (86.96%, Cohen's κ = 0.65).

"…these results indicate that while there is some overlap between different loneliness classification methods, they are not entirely interchangeable. The varying levels of agreement across measures suggest that each method captures a distinct aspect of loneliness, with distress and chronicity showing the highest alignment and frequency showing lower agreement with the other methods."

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that individuals classified as lonely using frequency classification were more likely to experience rejection sensitivity and lower self-esteem (large effects), interpretation bias, social avoidance behavior, and lower distress disclosure (medium effects), as well as avoidance goal intensity (small effects). Notably, similar cognitive and behavioral differences were observed across all three classification methods. However, the effect sizes varied, with distress-based classifications showing the strongest associations and chronicity-based classifications showing similar but sometimes smaller effects.

The authors note several limitations to their findings. The cross-sectional design of the study does not permit conclusions about causality; therefore, it remains unclear whether cognitive biases and behavioral tendencies cause persistent loneliness or result from it. There is also a potential for self-selection bias, as individuals experiencing loneliness may have been more inclined to participate in a study explicitly advertised as focusing on loneliness, potentially inflating prevalence rates. The sample was predominantly female (81%) and relatively young, which may limit the generalizability of the results to broader or different populations. Additionally, the study relied solely on self-report measures, which can introduce response biases such as underreporting or overreporting feelings due to social desirability or recall issues. The assessment of chronic loneliness overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced participants' perceptions of the duration of their loneliness. Furthermore, the study was not pre-registered, which limits transparency regarding hypothesis testing.

The present study reveals that while classifications of loneliness patients according to differing criteria (frequency versus distress versus chronicity) may display fair to substantial agreements, nuanced evaluations of these patients highlight stark differences in their dimensions and experiences of loneliness. At the same time, the cognitive and behavioral correlates associated with loneliness were consistent across classification methods, suggesting a shared profile of maladaptive traits among those identified as lonely by any of the three approaches. This is indicative and cautionary as it underscores the complexity of the behavioral and emotional response to feelings of loneliness, emphasizing the need for a broader understanding of patient needs when initiating interventions against the condition.

"Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to build on these findings, further to investigate the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive loneliness, and develop effective strategies to combat loneliness."

After a poor continental showing in 2024-25, the Bianconeri look to emerge as contenders in Club World Cup

It's been a troubling trend for Juventus. Always competing for a Serie A title, always flashy at one point or another in European competition - but without a trophy in the domestic league since the 2019-20 season, and without a UCL title since 1996, nearly 30 years.

Once home to Zinedine Zidane, Andrea Pirlo, Gianluigi Buffon and Alessandro Del Piero - all legends of the game - the club has stagnated over the past five years. Could this summer be their return to the top?

Led by U.S. men's national team star Weston McKennie and winger Tim Weah, Juve have a lot of hills to climb. On their third manager since last spring, the Italian club aren't flourishing. They can't seem to find a consistent striker to lead their line, multiple formations have been used amid different coaching philosophies and despite having a plethora of attacking options, they're not scoring at winning rate.

Again, though, it's Juventus. They always manage to impress at some point. The Club World Cup could present them with a sort of reset button. And if they manage to do so? The rest of the field should look out.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Next up is Juventus, with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the Italian side at the tournament.

Editor's Note: USWNT Footnotes takes you inside the major talking points around the U.S. women's national team, the NWSL, European leagues, and all across American women's soccer.

The Women's Champions League final is set: two-time defending champs Barcelona will take on Arsenal at Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon on May 24.

Barcelona flat-out embarrassed Chelsea, advancing to the final after an 8-2 aggregate win. Later, Arsenal shocked Lyon by coming back to beat the French superpower 5-3 on aggregate to clinch a spot in its first UWCL final in 19 years.

The Blues had hoped to make it to the final after getting ousted in back-to-back semifinals. Under new head coach Sonia Bompastor — the former Lyon manager who took over for Emma Hayes after she left for the U.S. women's national team — had enough weapons. Chelsea didn't have star forwards Sam Kerr or Lauren James, but won the 2025 transfer window by adding defender Naomi Girma and midfielder Keira Walsh (who came from Barcelona).

Even so, Bompastor's formidable roster wasn't enough to overtake the inevitable Barça. 

Now the Spanish side will prepare to face Arsenal in the final. The Gunners also made some quality additions during the January window, including USWNT defender Jenna Nighswonger and England forward Chloe Kelly. U.S. defensive stalwart Emily Fox joined the club last year and has become a regular starter on the backline. 

Lyon entered the match with a 2-1 advantage after winning the first leg, but Arsenal leveled the score in the fifth minute. The goals kept coming after that, with the Gunners ultimately beating Lyon 4-1. Lyon manager Joe Montemurro, who previously coached Arsenal, described the final result as "unexplainable."

Now Arsenal, the only English team that's ever won a Women's Champions League title back in 2007, has a chance to hoist the trophy next month.

Mia Fishel is back and scoring goals

Staying overseas, USWNT forward Mia Fishel scored her first goal for Chelsea since tearing her ACL in February 2024. Fishel, who had been earning regular national team call-ups at the time of her injury, was angling to contend for a 2024 Olympics roster spot. She's been building back minutes and was invited to the last USWNT camp as a training player. 

Fishel came on as a substitute in Chelsea's April 23 match vs. Crystal Palace and scored the fourth goal in Chelsea's 4-0 rout. U.S. forward Catarina Macario, who had also previously been on the mend following an injury, bagged a brace for the Blues in the win. Chelsea is on track to win its sixth consecutive WSL title, sitting six points ahead of Arsenal at the top of the table with three games left.

NWSL expansion

The NWSL submitted an application to U.S. Soccer for a second division with the focus on enhancing player development. The news was first reported by CBS Sports.

The report detailed that NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman sent a letter to U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson on April 1, proposing a Division II league that was "imperative" to the league's growth. The formal proposal describes the league as a "pipeline" for college and young players to experience the "technical, tactical and mental demands" of professional soccer.

According to the report, the NWSL would initially have eight Division I teams affiliated with a Division II team: North Carolina Courage, Kansas City Current, Racing Louisville, NJ/NY Gotham, Orlando Pride, Bay FC, Seattle Reign and the Washington Spirit. The proposal states that ideally, all Division I teams would have a Division II team within the first four years.

Meanwhile, this news comes at the same time as the new WPSL Pro announced plans to launch a Division II women's pro league after the 2026 men's World Cup. Similar to the NWSL's Division II proposal, WPSL Pro also aims to be a transitional space for rising talent.

What does this all mean? In layman's terms: more opportunities for women's soccer players in the United States. There is currently no second-division professional league for women's soccer in the U.S. The USL Super League, which debuted in 2024, was initially going to be a second division until it changed course and has the same Division I designation as the NWSL. 

These new proposed leagues can only help continue growing the game.

USWNT in the NWSL

The last-place North Carolina Courage trailed the undefeated Kansas City Current 2-1 entering stoppage time. And just when the game appeared to be over, Kaleigh Kurtz equalized in the 90th minute and Ashley Sanchez nailed the game-winner in the 92nd to pull off a dramatic 3-2 victory. 

It was the Courage's first win of the 2025 season.

Elsewhere, 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year and Olympic gold medalist Croix Bethune returned to the Washington Spirit after recovering from a torn meniscus, while Houston Dash goalkeeper Jane Campbell recorded her 40th clean sheet in 1-0 win over the Utah Royals.

Vancouver Whitecaps striker Brian White was named MLS Player of the Month for April 2025 on Wednesday. And while he's certainly earned the honor with five goals in league play and seven in all competitions, perhaps he should also send U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino a bottle of wine to say thanks for the confidence boost.

There's no way of knowing, of course, but it's surely well within the realm of possibility that White's uptick in form came in part because of an increase in confidence that followed his national team call. While White only played a few minutes in what was -- from a team perspective -- a total debacle, he wasn't even on the radar of most USMNT followers.

And frankly, compared to other strikers in the fold, it was probably a victory for his national team future that he didn't set himself apart in a bad way. (Only Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang could be considered to have had a truly positive impact among the strikers who played in the losses to Panama and Canada)

We've seen similar form recently from Diego Luna since his return from the USMNT to Real Salt Lake, where he's scored a pair of braces this month in two RSL victories.

Luna's case is slightly different; many USMNT followers actively wanted him in the March camp with the closer-to-full-strength squad after his strong showing with a mostly MLS-based USMNT in Pochettino's January camp. He also likely has a considerably higher ceiling at age 21, compared to the 29-year-old White.

Even so, there's no denying that Luna's ascension has continued and maybe even accelerated following his inclusion in March. And he was arguably the lone true bright spot for the Americans in that window with his creative midfield work, including his setup of Agyemang's goal in the 2-1 loss to Canada in the third-place match.

Calling up players into a national team with a deliberate intention of boosting confidence can be an extremely delicate matter, and shouldn't be a standard MO when there are other more obvious choices.

But Pochettino's masterstroke may have been recognizing the particular situation allowed for it in a way that wouldn't be an undue disservice to other USMNT hopefuls.

Injuries to Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun created an obvious opening at center forward. In central midfield, the most disputable omission was probably Leeds United's Brendan Aaronson. But the former Philadelphia Union man had played so many minutes during the grueling EFL Championship campaign that the respite may have been welcomed by Aaronson's camp.

These are stories that were lost in the overriding furor over results that the U.S. fanbase deemed unacceptable. But if Pochettino truly went into the Nations League games with the longer view of 2026 in mind, White and Luna's current league form may validate that approach.

The 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup is a matter of weeks away, and one MLS starlet continues to make a case for himself to be heavily involved for Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. Men's National Team.

The Argentine's first Gold Cup since taking charge in September, and his last opportunity to test his players in a competitive environment before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the upcoming tournament will also be a valuable opportunity to win back the hearts of fans following two underwhelming losses in the Nations League Finals.

One player who came out of the Nations League with something to be proud of was Real Salt Lake attacker Diego Luna. The 21-year-old Californian was as energetic and creative as ever when given a starting role in the third-place playoff loss to Canada, and in the weeks since, he has continued to impress in the MLS.

In Salt Lake's most recent game, a 3-1 away win against San Diego FC, Luna made his way to the scoresheet yet again, with his second brace since his March international break. This latest in a string of impressive performances from the four-time international prompted his head coach, Pablo Mastroeni, to laud the young star when speaking with reporters post-game.

“I don't think we can talk about Diego developing anymore. He's the guy,” Mastroeni said, via Goal. “He's the guy that plays with the chip on his shoulder. He's one of our best defenders. He's obviously the guy that's putting the ball in the back of the net. He's doing it all for our group.”

Despite this high praise, Luna intends to remain grounded and focused on the process. “For me, it doesn't change what I'm doing on the daily or what I'm trying to do for myself and the career I'm trying to build for myself,” he explained. “He's my coach, so, of course, he's up there, right? But it's just like anyone else talking or anyone else saying something.”

Now with five goals in 10 games across all competitions to his name this season, Luna will hope his form will eventually prove enough to convince Pochettino to give him another chance to show what he's capable of with the USMNT.

The former Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea boss is soon set to call up his team for their back-to-back friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland on June 7 and 10, before they head to California for their Gold Cup opener on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago.

Along with Trinidad and Tobago, the USMNT's Group D also consists of Haiti and guest participants Saudi Arabia, with Pochettino expecting the group to be “difficult.”

“We must match the intensity of our opponents, because in these tournaments they are always motivated to play against the USA,” Pochettino told U.S. Soccer. “Of course, we must perform well to win, and you don't always get a result, but for sure, in order to win, you have to compete.

“It's not just about showing up in your home country and trying to play nice soccer. No, you must be proud, you must fight for the people that would love to be in your position, for the millions of kids that are going to see us and dream to be one day where we are.

“This is type of responsibility and commitment we need to show in a different way than we did in Los Angeles (at the Nations League Finals).”

Some of soccer's most revered professional clubs are headed to Seattle in June for a major international event that serves as a dress rehearsal for the men's World Cup coming to North America next year.

Once an afterthought on the international soccer calendar, the revamped Club World Cup offers Cascadian fans an opportunity to see their favorite players and teams in a bona fide competition.

“It's an opportunity to really spoil ourselves with soccer,” said Craig Waibel, general manager of Seattle Sounders FC. “It is an opportunity to watch some of the top teams in the world not play exhibition games, which has always been a thing that we've digested in America.”

The action begins in Seattle on June 15 at 68,700-seat Lumen Field with Sounders FC facing Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro in a Group B stage match.

The Sounders' three group games are scheduled at their home field, which is hosting six of the 63 matches being played across the United States from June 14 to July 13.

The tournament will unfold in the backdrop of the Trump administration's controversial deportations of immigrants, tariffs and threats to annex Canada and Greenland. High-profile cases of foreign nationals being arrested at the U.S. border this year have also alarmed potential visitors.

Global sports and government leaders are expected to scrutinize the handling of visiting fans, even as U.S. officials have offered assurances over security concerns for this year's tournament and the 2026 World Cup.

“We'll bring the world to the United States of America,” said Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. He recently told reporters, “The world will be welcomed.”

Tourism Economics, a travel forecasting firm, expects a significant decline in foreign tourists over the summer, which could help explain why tickets for the tournament are still available.

The situation provides Washington fans with a better chance to see world-class soccer this summer than next year when the United States, Canada and Mexico co-host the sport's most popular event.

Infantino blamed slow ticket sales on the fact that the latest version of the quadrennial tournament is new.

“We have to explain what it is to people,” he told reporters.

Waibel, who also serves as Seattle's chief soccer officer, has found that many people still don't know much about the event.

“I would love to see all the marketing in the world, but FIFA is in charge of it,” he said in an interview with CDN. “It's their event. It's their stadium.”

In an incentive to attend the club championships, FIFA officials are offering a ticket package that will guarantee access to the 2026 World Cup. Ticket information is at FIFA.com/tickets.

Ticket broker StubHub showed prices on April 29 varying from $44 to $1,200, depending on the game. Tickets for Sounders' games cost more than some of the other games at Lumen Field.

Speaking to reporters during a recent U.S. tour, Infantino said, “Everyone thinks that the country winning their own national or continental competition is the best in the world. But that's actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.”

The club tournament features 32 elite teams from the sport's six confederations with a $1 billion prize pool. It culminates with the championship on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Sounders FC of Major League Soccer qualified by winning the 2022 Champions Cup for CONCACAF, the confederation of North and Central America and the Caribbean.

The underdog Sounders, who have started the MLS season slowly with a 3-3-4 record, landed in what is termed “the Group of Death” — the toughest of the eight, round-robin groups. The top two teams in each group advance to the knockout stage.

The challenge increases after facing Botafogo, one of four renowned Brazilian clubs competing. Seattle will play Spanish powerhouse Atletico de Madrid on June 19 before finishing the group stage on June 23 against France's most decorated club, Paris Saint-Germain, which already has won another Ligue 1 title with a month left in the season.

“We don't have the pressure some of these other clubs have in this competition,” Waibel said. “We get to show up, play a little loose and try to be as dangerous as we can.”

The Sounders have struggled in their domestic season because of injuries. Participating in the Club World Cup adds wear and tear to a depleted roster, “but it's so worth it from an experience standpoint,” Waibel said. “This could be the one time that we get to do this for some of us as executives, for some of us as players.”

Another storied club playing in Seattle is River Plate of Buenos Aires, a team that has been a pipeline to Argentina's No. 1-ranked national squad. Los Millonarios will play Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds on June 17 and Italian superclub FC Internazionale, also known as Inter Milan, on June 25.

Another game in Seattle on June 21 features Inter Milan against Urawa.

Other celebrated clubs in the tournament are defending champion Manchester City and Chelsea from England, Real Madrid from Spain, Bayern Munich from Germany, Juventus from Italy, Benfica from Portugal and Boca Juniors from Argentina.

Inter Miami, with world star Lionel Messi, joins the Sounders as the two MLS representatives. Inter Miami earned the host country's lone berth after Messi led his team to the MLS's best regular-season record last year.

However, FIFA might hold a play-in game between the MLS's Los Angeles FC and Mexico's Club America to replace Club Leon, which has appealed its removal from the tournament. CONCACAF teams will receive $9.55 million each for competing and will earn more with each victory or draw.

While the Club World Cup highlights teams that play throughout their respective seasons, the World Cup involves all-star national rosters like in the Olympics.

World Cup organizers placed six games in Seattle next year, including the United States' second match of group play on June 19, 2026. BC Place in Vancouver has secured seven games of the expanded 48-team tournament from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The two sites put Whatcom and Skagit counties in the middle of the action. Local Seattle organizers designated Bellingham as one of nine 2026 World Cup “Fan Zones” in the state.

Greg Brisbon, the Western Washington men's coach, said both tournaments resonate with local soccer junkies who closely follow international leagues.

Getting a chance to see players in Seattle “is such a different lens than watching them on TV,” he added. “It gives you a really good perspective on how good these players are.”

Waibel described the back-to-back tournaments as once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for fans: “Who knows if a Club World Cup match will ever be played in Seattle again,” he said.

All club tournament games are scheduled to be shown for free on DAZN.com, a live-streaming platform.

Some of soccer's most revered professional clubs are headed to Seattle in June for a major international event that serves as a dress rehearsal for the men's World Cup coming to North America next year.

Once an afterthought on the international soccer calendar, the revamped Club World Cup offers Cascadian fans an opportunity to see their favorite players and teams in a bona fide competition.

“It's an opportunity to really spoil ourselves with soccer,” said Craig Waibel, general manager of Seattle Sounders FC. “It is an opportunity to watch some of the top teams in the world not play exhibition games, which has always been a thing that we've digested in America.”

The action begins in Seattle on June 15 at 68,700-seat Lumen Field with Sounders FC facing Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro in a Group B stage match.

The Sounders' three group games are scheduled at their home field, which is hosting six of the 63 matches being played across the United States from June 14 to July 13.

The tournament will unfold in the backdrop of the Trump administration's controversial deportations of immigrants, tariffs and threats to annex Canada and Greenland. High-profile cases of foreign nationals being arrested at the U.S. border this year have also alarmed potential visitors.

Global sports and government leaders are expected to scrutinize the handling of visiting fans, even as U.S. officials have offered assurances over security concerns for this year's tournament and the 2026 World Cup.

“We'll bring the world to the United States of America,” said Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. He recently told reporters, “The world will be welcomed.”

Tourism Economics, a travel forecasting firm, expects a significant decline in foreign tourists over the summer, which could help explain why tickets for the tournament are still available.

The situation provides Washington fans with a better chance to see world-class soccer this summer than next year when the United States, Canada and Mexico co-host the sport's most popular event.

Infantino blamed slow ticket sales on the fact that the latest version of the quadrennial tournament is new.

“We have to explain what it is to people,” he told reporters.

Waibel, who also serves as Seattle's chief soccer officer, has found that many people still don't know much about the event.

“I would love to see all the marketing in the world, but FIFA is in charge of it,” he said in an interview with CDN. “It's their event. It's their stadium.”

In an incentive to attend the club championships, FIFA officials are offering a ticket package that will guarantee access to the 2026 World Cup. Ticket information is at FIFA.com/tickets.

Ticket broker StubHub showed prices on April 29 varying from $44 to $1,200, depending on the game. Tickets for Sounders' games cost more than some of the other games at Lumen Field.

Speaking to reporters during a recent U.S. tour, Infantino said, “Everyone thinks that the country winning their own national or continental competition is the best in the world. But that's actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.”

The club tournament features 32 elite teams from the sport's six confederations with a $1 billion prize pool. It culminates with the championship on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Sounders FC of Major League Soccer qualified by winning the 2022 Champions Cup for CONCACAF, the confederation of North and Central America and the Caribbean.

The underdog Sounders, who have started the MLS season slowly with a 3-3-4 record, landed in what is termed “the Group of Death” — the toughest of the eight, round-robin groups. The top two teams in each group advance to the knockout stage.

The challenge increases after facing Botafogo, one of four renowned Brazilian clubs competing. Seattle will play Spanish powerhouse Atletico de Madrid on June 19 before finishing the group stage on June 23 against France's most decorated club, Paris Saint-Germain, which already has won another Ligue 1 title with a month left in the season.

“We don't have the pressure some of these other clubs have in this competition,” Waibel said. “We get to show up, play a little loose and try to be as dangerous as we can.”

The Sounders have struggled in their domestic season because of injuries. Participating in the Club World Cup adds wear and tear to a depleted roster, “but it's so worth it from an experience standpoint,” Waibel said. “This could be the one time that we get to do this for some of us as executives, for some of us as players.”

Another storied club playing in Seattle is River Plate of Buenos Aires, a team that has been a pipeline to Argentina's No. 1-ranked national squad. Los Millonarios will play Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds on June 17 and Italian superclub FC Internazionale, also known as Inter Milan, on June 25.

Another game in Seattle on June 21 features Inter Milan against Urawa.

Other celebrated clubs in the tournament are defending champion Manchester City and Chelsea from England, Real Madrid from Spain, Bayern Munich from Germany, Juventus from Italy, Benfica from Portugal and Boca Juniors from Argentina.

Inter Miami, with world star Lionel Messi, joins the Sounders as the two MLS representatives. Inter Miami earned the host country's lone berth after Messi led his team to the MLS's best regular-season record last year.

However, FIFA might hold a play-in game between the MLS's Los Angeles FC and Mexico's Club America to replace Club Leon, which has appealed its removal from the tournament. CONCACAF teams will receive $9.55 million each for competing and will earn more with each victory or draw.

While the Club World Cup highlights teams that play throughout their respective seasons, the World Cup involves all-star national rosters like in the Olympics.

World Cup organizers placed six games in Seattle next year, including the United States' second match of group play on June 19, 2026. BC Place in Vancouver has secured seven games of the expanded 48-team tournament from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

The two sites put Whatcom and Skagit counties in the middle of the action. Local Seattle organizers designated Bellingham as one of nine 2026 World Cup “Fan Zones” in the state.

Greg Brisbon, the Western Washington men's coach, said both tournaments resonate with local soccer junkies who closely follow international leagues.

Getting a chance to see players in Seattle “is such a different lens than watching them on TV,” he added. “It gives you a really good perspective on how good these players are.”

Waibel described the back-to-back tournaments as once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for fans: “Who knows if a Club World Cup match will ever be played in Seattle again,” he said.

All club tournament games are scheduled to be shown for free on DAZN.com, a live-streaming platform.

Brazil's iconic yellow soccer jersey has become such a potent conservative political symbol that many leftists refuse to wear it. Now, rumors the team might don a different color with deep associations to the left at the 2026 World Cup are inflaming the right.

The Brazilian Football Confederation denied that the country's national team would wear red secondary uniforms next year in a statement Tuesday night, a day after the website Footy Headlines reported that the country planned to replace the blue kits that typically complement its more famous yellow shirts.

Manchester City have a busy Summer ahead of them as they take part in the first-ever edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, which gets underway in the middle of June and concludes a month later. 

Manchester City are set to see their season come to an end in the next few weeks, with their final aims coming as finishing in the top five of the Premier League and also winning the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. 

The FIFA Club World Cup is set to start on the 15th of June and run all the way until the 15th of July. This will be the first time this worldwide competition will take place. 

32 of the world's biggest clubs are participating in the group stage, where eight groups of four have been drawn. Then, the tournament will feature the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and then the grand finale, where one club will become the first to lift the trophy and become champions of the world. 

"We will see how we finish the season and see how we arrive in that tournament together, and then we will see what happens."

"Normally, whenever I start a competition, for example, like the Premier League, never do I start thinking, 'Oh, we are going to win, etc.' So, one step at a time."

"Try to play better than we played in the league, arrive in better conditions everyone and after we see."

CBF reportedly considering red jersey ahead of World Cup but rightwingers consider the colour anti-patriotic

“Our flag will never be red!” rightwing Brazilians took to chanting during the heyday of the left-bashing former president Jair Bolsonaro.

But their football shirts soon might be, amid incendiary reports that the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) is considering introducing a crimson jersey for the national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Those claims have sparked predictable outrage among hardcore rightwingers who consider red the anti-patriotic colour of Brazil's leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Workers' party (PT) and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST).

“Our team's shirt will never be red – and neither will our country!” thundered Romeu Zema, a conservative governor hoping to claim the mantle of Bolsonaro, who faces jail for allegedly masterminding a failed rightwing coup after losing the 2022 election. In a social media video, Zema hurled a mock-up of the red shirt on to the ground in theatrical disgust.

Bolsonaro's politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn't red – and it never will be.”

But Bolsonaristas are not the only ones up in arms about the reported attempt to swap Brazil's blue away shirt – in use since the country won the first of its five World Cup, in 1958 – for a red one.

Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday in a viral report by the football website Footy Headlines.

The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year's World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil's official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed.

Walter Casagrande, a Lula-voting former player and commentator who is associated with Brazil's left and pro-democracy movement, called the scheme “idiocy”.

Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelho said the move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven.

Galvão Bueno, Brazil's most famous TV commentator, called the idea “a crime” and a “gigantic insult” to the glorious history of a national team which has won more World Cups than any other country.

Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. Over the past decade the country's iconic yellow jersey has become a symbol of the far right and is regularly worn at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. Many progressives now refuse to wear it.

In a pro-red shirt manifesto, columnist Milly Lacombe declared that she would wear the jersey with pride and rejected the outbreak of “collective hysteria” over the mooted shirt. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote.

Juca Kfouri, a left-leaning football writer who is among those who shun the yellow shirt, also rejected the “bad taste” change, arguing that a red shirt would further fuel the toxic politics swirling around the national team's attire and divide supporters.

“Red doesn't have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree called pau-brasil (brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century, had red in its first flag.

Kfouri suspected the red shirt story was “a trial balloon” devised to see how the money-making ruse went down with fans. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said.

For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil's next manager and a compromising exposé in a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.

How much will Bundesliga clubs Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund make at the upcoming 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States? A report by the German magazine kicker this week shed light on the finances of the tournament.

The world soccer governing body FIFA had previously communicated that the tournament would include a $1 billion prize pool distributed to the 32 teams. The winner of the tournament could earn up to $125 million.

For European clubs like Bayern and Dortmund that would have been €923 million when FIFA made the announcement. The collapse of the US dollar, however, means that the prize pool to be earned by clubs from UEFA has dropped to just €877 million.

The prize pool is divided into two categories. The first category is the sporting performance pillar which is worth $475 million. The second category is the participation pillar worth $525 million.

While all teams from South America ($15.21 million), Oceania ($3.58 million), and all other confederations ($9.55 million) will receive the same guaranteed amount of money this isn't the case for Europe. According to FIFA, clubs from UEFA, the participation money will vary between $12.81 million and $38.91 million.

How does this break down for the two Bundesliga clubs? While Austrian club RB Salzburg is the lowest end of the prize pool available for European clubs. This is determined by the UEFA club co-efficient ranking and the club's contribution to UEFA marketing over the last four years.

Based on that, kicker have calculated that Manchester City ranks ahead of Real Madrid within UEFA's ranking. Man City will, therefore, receive around $38 million from participating in the tournament. Real Madrid ranks second with $35.8 million.

The two Bundesliga clubs Bayern and Dortmund rank third and sixth respectively. This means that Bayern will earn a guaranteed $33.5 million and Dortmund $26.6 million. The report adds that Man City could earn a maximum of €110.4 million ($125 million).

With Bayern ranked only marginally behind the Premier League giants, the expectations in Munich are that the Rekordmeister could earn over $100 million from playing in the tournament. Dortmund would come in just under the $100 million mark should the Black and Yellows win the tournament.

Both clubs have aspirations to go deep in the tournament. The Rekordmeister has been very aggressive in its pursuit to sign Florian Wirtz from competitor Bayer Leverkusen. With Leverkusen expecting €140 million ($160 million) for the player, a deep run at the Club World Cup would help Bayern.

For Dortmund, in the meantime, the expectation was that the tournament would help alleviate the financial impact of missing out on Champions League football. But recent results in the Bundesliga have put Dortmund back in the race for a top-four spot. Hence, the tournament could now be a significant financial bonus rather than an insurance policy for Dortmund.

After a rather irregular season, Ancelotti's departure from Real Madrid is practically a reality. With some LaLiga matches still pending, these are likely to be his last games with Real Madrid. An event that would confirm that, looking ahead to the Club World Cup, Real Madrid would have another coach.

While Ancelotti's future seemed to be leading the Brazilian national team toward the 2026 World Cup, everything seems to have changed. Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia has presented an interesting offer of 50 million euros per year for Carlo Ancelotti. A considerable amount, especially for such a historic coach as Carlo Ancelotti.

If Carlo Ancelotti accepts this offer, the coach would have to face Real Madrid. This is because, for the Club World Cup, Al Hilal is one of the teams that will face Madrid to try to win this championship.

Having two successful periods with Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti is preparing to end the second one. Despite all the titles he has achieved with Real Madrid, this season ended with his chances of staying at the club. Eliminated from the Champions League and losing the Copa del Rey, Ancelotti only aims to win LaLiga.

A championship that, while not insignificant, falls quite short of what was desired from Ancelotti and the club this season. Although his farewell is planned to be appropriate for him, Madridists could quickly change their opinion.

This is because, if he accepts Al Hilal's offer, he will form a team difficult to overcome for the Club World Cup. His experience at Real Madrid could work against a club that seeks to make history by being the first to win this tournament.

With Real Madrid focused on finding their next coach, facing Ancelotti has been quite a surprise. Although Ancelotti is expected to accept being Brazil's coach, Real Madrid must prepare for any occasion.

DAMAC Properties will be Chelsea's front-of-shirt sponsor for the remainder of the 2024-25 season — but the agreement will not cover this summer's Club World Cup.

The Emirati property development company will sponsor Chelsea's shirts for the side's remaining four Premier League games of the campaign, alongside their Conference League semi-final tie against Swedish club Djurgarden and a potential final in the competition. The men's team's semi-final first leg in Stockholm on Thursday will see the debut of the new sponsor.

Club sources say a competitive process is continuing for Chelsea's long-term front-of-shirt sponsor, having not had one yet this season, including potentially one covering their participation in this summer's Club World Cup. Chelsea will play at least three group games in the tournament, which is taking place in the United States and will run from June 14 through to July 13.

The 2024-25 season is the second consecutive year that Chelsea have not had a front-of-shirt sponsor for the full campaign. Infinite Athlete only signed up to a one-year deal, worth around £40million ($53.4m) in September 2023 before later agreeing to continue to be on the club's shirt during pre-season.

Proud to unveil @DAMACOfficial on the front of our shirts for the rest of the 24/25 season! 💙

Also launching: Chelsea Residences by DAMAC — luxury living, Chelsea style. 🏙️#ChelseaResidences #CFC #DAMAC #DAMACProperties

— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 30, 2025



DAMAC will oversee the development Chelsea-branded residences in Dubai, a project costing upwards of £1bn, which is described by the club as “luxury living”.

Chelsea's chief operating officer Jason Gannon has said “the collaboration will bring Chelsea to life in Dubai”.

The reaction of many Chelsea supporters to this news might well be something along the lines of, ‘What's the point?'

DAMAC is only guaranteed to adorn the front of the Chelsea shirt for a maximum of seven matches if Enzo Maresca's team reach the final of the Conference League. The 2024-25 season has one month left to run, and the fact the deal does not cover the Club World Cup raises questions about just how much revenue this particular sponsorship will actually raise.

Chelsea will point to the fact that DAMAC has signed up to a longer-term commercial partnership which will see club-branded residences in a £1bn development in Dubai. This is the most interesting aspect of the deal, which club officials believe is the first arrangement of its kind, and could potentially unlock a lucrative new revenue stream.

In the meantime, the endless questions about Chelsea's lack of a front-of-shirt sponsor will go away, if only for a little while.

The club are in talks with multiple companies with a view to shirt sponsorship during the Club World Cup and beyond, and will hope to avoid a repeat of this season's unbranded shirt fronts. Securing qualification for next season's Champions League would help their chances of getting the long-term deal they want considerably.

FIFA World Cup used Argentina superstar Lionel Messi to make a special wish for Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma on the latter's 38th birthday. Rohit, who quit T20Is last year, has witnessed some unmatched highs and traumatic lows in the past one year but, still remains one of the greatest stories in Indian cricket.

Taking to social media, the FIFA World Cup collaged a picture of Rohit's T20 World Cup 2024 celebration with that of Lionel Messi during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar to wish the 'Hitman'.

During the final prize distribution ceremony at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi made a slow-motion walk to collect the coveted trophy. Rohit emulated the same when India won the T20 World Cup last year in Barbados, beating South Africa in the final.

FIFA World Cup captioned the post, “Two (emoji of crown). #HBD.”

Meanwhile, Indian cricketers, past and present wished Rohit. " Happy birthday Ro, Wish you the very best," KL Rahul posted on his Instagram story. Rohit's former opening partner, Shikhar Dhawan, posted on his official Instagram handle," From chasing runs to sharing laughs, it's been a legendary journey together. Happy Birthday, partner in crime."

Former Indian legend Yuvraj Singh posted on his official X handle," Some build records, some build legacies - you've done both brotherman! Hope you have an amazing year ahead! Happy birthday, Loads of love always @ImRo45."

Former Indian cricketer Suresh Raina posted on his official Instagram handle," Happy Birthday, Rohit! Wishing you an incredible year ahead, brother! From sharing the field to sharing laughter, it's always been a pleasure watching you lead with calm and class. Your journey has inspired millions, and I know there's still so much more to come. May this year bring you great success, happiness, and time with your loved ones. Keep hitting those big sixes--on and off the field! Cheers to many more milestones ahead! @rohitsharma45."

NWSL

The Washington Commanders are returning to Washington, D.C., after nearly three decades away, thanks to a new proposal to build a 65,000-seat stadium on the current RFK Stadium site.

And, if organizers get their way, it's not just American football that will be played at the new venue, with officials also eyeing professional soccer.

Those behind the project have proposed professional soccer, specifically women's soccer, as one of the more than 200 annual events they hope to stage there year-round.

Because the stadium will be roofed, officials have expressed ambitions to pursue major tournaments such as the Super Bowl, NCAA basketball Final Four and Women's World Cup, which the U.S. is likely to co-host in 2031 with other Concacaf nations.

U.S. Soccer did not immediately respond to questions for this story.

A full deck published by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser outlines the project's plans. There are logos for the NWSL's Washington Spirit and U.S. Soccer's national team, as well as other soccer logos for the Concacaf Gold Cup, English Premier League, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.

The project's term sheet, dated April 28, also outlines potential uses of the stadium. It states the city “recognizes the public value in providing spaces for women's sports and is discussing … whether such an opportunity can be provided for professional women's soccer” at the stadium.

Tuesday, the Spirit welcomed the Commanders' new stadium, saying it supported the opportunities the venue presents. The teams share an investor in former NBA star Magic Johnson.

“We're excited for Spirit investor Magic Johnson and the Commanders as they work to bring a new, world-class stadium back to D.C.,” the team said in a statement. “Audi Field has been an incredible home for the Spirit, and we're proud of the energy our fans bring to matchdays. As D.C. sports continues to grow, we're always supportive of opportunities that celebrate the city's rich sports legacy — including the role RFK (Stadium) played in launching professional women's soccer.”

The Commanders and Spirit also have a history of working closely, beyond Johnson's shared investment.

Former Commanders president Jason Wright recently told The Athletic the two teams had a working relationship while he was in D.C. The former NFL player is part of the ownership group behind NWSL Denver through Ariel Investments' Project Level. Wright was with the Commanders from 2020 to 2024, crossing paths with the Spirit's current majority owner, Michele Kang.

“I had been working with the Washington Spirit to try to think about joint plans on a practice facility and how a new stadium development could work,” Wright said. “Michele Kang is a remarkable owner. She's super thoughtful and just a great human being. I talked to her and her staff for years about how we could possibly partner.”

RFK Stadium played host to several historic moments for women's soccer, including the inaugural match of the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) in 2001 and several USWNT games. WUSA was the first iteration of professional women's soccer in the U.S., and RFK Stadium served as the home stadium for the league's Washington Freedom — the former club of many U.S. greats, including Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach.

Though a 65,000-seat stadium might seem ambitious for an NWSL crowd, the Spirit have consistently filled the 20,000-seat home venue at Audi Field, known affectionately as Rowdy Audi, which they lease from Major League Soccer team D.C. United. So far this season, the team has enjoyed three consecutive sellouts.

The current single-match record for an NWSL game was set last year by the Chicago Stars and Bay FC when 35,038 fans filled Wrigley Field on June 8 for the league's first match held in an MLB stadium. That record has the potential to be broken this season when Bay hosts the Spirit at Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, on Aug. 23. The MLB stadium has a capacity of 42,300.

Kang, who became the majority owner of the Spirit in 2022, has been outspoken about the team's plans to find space for its own facility, specifying the team hoped to find “70 to 100 acres” of land for its ambitious plans.

Irvine will be sidelined for at least three months after having surgery on a foot injury suffered when playing for Bundesliga club St. Pauli.

Popovic said Irvine's absence was "certainly a blow" for the Socceroos as their hopes of an automatic ticket to the 2026 finals hang in the balance ahead of a home qualifier against Japan (June 5th) and a trip to face Saudi Arabia (June 10th).

"He played very well for us in the last (international) window and has been doing very well at St. Pauli," Popovic told Australian media.

"It's a blow, but we have to find a solution. There are solutions.

"We've got an eye on the A-League players that are playing, but we've got a lot of midfielders playing overseas at the moment, getting regular minutes, so we're monitoring everyone.

"There's an opportunity for someone to come in."

Popovic said uncapped Europe-based midfielders Max Balard and Nectarios Triantis could come into consideration in the absence of 78-cap veteran Irvine, who scored in the 2-0 qualifier win over China in Hangzhou in March.

Second in Asia's Group C on 13 points, Australia will qualify directly for the World Cup in North America if they can hold their place.

Japan have already qualified on 20 points, while third-placed Saudi Arabia, three points behind the Socceroos, are also in the hunt for the automatic berth which comes with a top-two finish.

The third and fourth-placed teams will have further chances to qualify in the fourth round, though.

Australia will have a training camp in late-May in Abu Dhabi that will allow staff to assess all the options for the qualifiers.

Popovic said an assistant coach would also run the rule over young Italy-based defender Alessandro Circati as he closes in on a return to action for Serie A side Parma following an ACL injury.

"Paul Okon will be going to visit him in the next few days to have a really close look at where he's at in terms of his training and to see his level,” Popovic said.

"(Circati) feels he's ready, but we have to consider all factors before selecting him."

The processes cover three tournaments (two men's, one women's), with a deadline for bid submissions of May 27.

Soccer's global governing body FIFA has launched tender processes in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands covering the next three FIFA World Cups – two men's and one women's.

Specifically, a tender has been launched covering the 2026 (Mexico, the US, and Canada) and 2030 (mainly Portugal, Spain, and Morocco) men's World Cups in New Zealand, as well as the 2027 Women's World Cup (Brazil). In the Pacific Islands, meanwhile, the tender covers the 2026 and 2027 tournaments.

Interested parties should email newzealandmediarights@fifa.org, or fwc26-media-rights@fifa.org and fwwc2027-media-rights@fifa.org for those in the Pacific Islands. The deadline for bid submissions is May 27 at 10am Central European Standard Time.

The Pacific Islands tenders stretch across the following territories: the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu; French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna; and American Samoa.

New Zealand qualified for the 2026 men's World Cup earlier this year – the country will make its first appearance at a men's World Cup in 16 years – with the Oceania Football Confederation's qualifying process for the 2027 women's tournament set to begin in November.

The country jointly hosted the previous Women's World Cup, alongside its neighbor Australia, with the New Zealand national team eliminated in the group stages.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

In terms of previous rights-holders in these markets, the 2022 World Cup was shown in New Zealand by pay-TV heavyweight Sky NZ, while the 2023 women's edition was covered live domestically by both Sky NZ and the Stuff multi-media hub.

In the various Pacific Islands, meanwhile, the Women's World Cup was shown free-to-air by Pasifika, while the 2022 men's tournament was aired by pay-TV's Digicel.

Regarding recent FIFA tenders for its next men's and women's World Cups, late last week (April 25), the governing body launched a process for the 2027 Women's World Cup in select European and Central Asian territories.

Entities that want to participate in the tender process can request the ITT documents by emailing fwwc2027-media-rights@fifa.org. The bid submission deadline is 12pm CEST on June 3.

The 2027 Women's World Cup, the first edition of the tournament to be hosted in South America, will see 32 teams competing in at least eight host cities.

For the men's 2026 and 2030 tournaments, meanwhile, late March saw processes get underway in the Caribbean, Greece, and Cyprus.

As for completed rights deals, Spanish public-service broadcaster RTVE and sports rights agency Mediapro unveiled an agreement for the 2026 tournament last week, reportedly bidding €55 million ($60.1 million) to secure the package.

The 2030 edition will see the vast majority of games held across Iberia and Morocco, with three split equally between the South American countries of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the first-ever FIFA World Cup.

Jackson Irvine will have foot surgery and miss Australia's World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Saudia Arabia.  (AAP :Joel Carrett)

Jackson Irvine has confirmed he will miss the Socceroos' final two World Cup qualifiers to undergo foot surgery.

Australia is currently second in their group and is holding an automatic qualification spot with two matches left.

Australia will face Japan in Perth on June 5, followed by Saudi Arabia in Jeddah on June 11.

Jackson Irvine has confirmed he will miss the Socceroos' final two World Cup qualifiers to undergo foot surgery, placing fresh stress on the depth at Tony Popovic's disposal.

Irvine backed the Socceroos to get past Japan and Saudi Arabia in crunch qualifiers and seal their passage to next year's World Cup in North America after writing on social media that he would go under the knife.

With World Cup qualification now within reach, the Socceroos are still in search of a first-choice number nine.

"I have complete confidence that both the teams I love can take the final steps towards our ultimate goals," Irvine posted on Instagram.

"I will be watching and supporting alongside our amazing fans every step until the end."

The influential Australian midfielder has been sidelined for Bundesliga side St Pauli for the past fortnight with the club sending him for scans, the results indicating an operation was the best course of action for the 32-year-old.

His absence is a blow for St Pauli, who are on the cusp of avoiding relegation from the German top flight with just three games left in the season.

It's an even bigger concern for Socceroos boss Popovic, whose side hope to beat the already-qualified Japanese in Perth on June 5 and then conquer the Saudis — their closest challengers for the final automatic spot — in Jeddah on June 11 to reach next year's tournament.

The loss of Irvine comes at a time when the Socceroos are already without defensive leader Harry Souttar and wingback Jordan Bos.

In the midfield specifically, Massimo Luongo has been overlooked due to a lack of game time at Premier League side Ipswich Town, Aiden O'Neill has recently moved to the MLS with New York City, while Irvine's St Pauli teammate Connor Metcalfe has only just returned from an ankle injury.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is still over a year away, but the build up has begun with the release of the first-ever set of World Cup host city poster designs.

The World Cup 26 logo has been controversial with its move to a standardised design (compare with our pick of the best World Cup logos). But the newly revealed posters at least make up for some of that uniformity and remind us why Pelé called football the beautiful game, bringing together a diverse range of influences to celebrate the vibrancy of the sport.

The artwork for major sports events can often be as memorable as the sporting action (see our pick of the best Olympics posters), so we're always pleased to see more being made of it. Big international events are also a chance for host cities to promote themselves on the world stage, so it makes sense for each to have a design showcasing its culture.

Euro 2024 took a step in this direction with artwork for each host city. FIFA's World Cup 26 designs go further giving each host city a full-size poster illustrated by a local artist, from Dave Murray's Cassandre-esque cubist piece (Toronto) to Matt Cliff's bicycle kicking cowboy (Dallas) and a vibrant mix of symbolism from illustrator Mario Cortés, AKA Cuemanche, (all three posters for Mexico's host cities).

Houston's poster features an astronaut playing keepy uppy, and Boston's stars a giant lobster flicking the ball with its tail. Meanwhile, Miami is unmistakable with its pink hues, flamingo and palm trees.

Each design seeks to capture the landmarks, cultural identity and distinctive characteristics of these cities, integrating iconic elements that represent them while showing a shared passion for the artistry of football.

Liverpool may be the new champion of England, but that won't be enough to give it a shot at being crowned the world champion this summer.

The party on Merseyside continues after the Premier League title was won at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a resounding 5-1 win over Tottenham. Having secured a 20th league title, the Reds are now back on their perch, as Sir Alex Ferguson would say, after going back level with Manchester United's tally.

And, no matter what Rio Ferdinand says, there can be no debate now about who the most successful team in England is, with Liverpool's next task being to go beyond its Old Trafford rival once again.

Despite boasting more silverware than any other team in England, Liverpool won't be traveling to the United States to represent the Premier League in this summer's revamped Club World Cup.

FIFA's expanded tournament gets its first run-out in June, with 32 teams from the six continental confederations set to battle it out to be crowned champions of the world.

AFC - Al Hilal, Urawa Red Diamonds, Al Ain, Ulsan HD

CAF - Al Ahly, Wydad Casablanca, Esperance de Tunis, Mamelodi Sundowns

CONCACAF - Monterrey, Seattle Sounders, Pachuca, Inter Miami, TBD

CONMEBOL - Palmeiras, Fluminense, Flamengo, Botafogo, River Plate, Boca Juniors

OFC - Auckland City

UEFA - Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, PSG, Inter Milan, Porto, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Red Bull Salzburg

Liverpool misses out on a place at the tournament, with qualification restricted to the winners of the respective confederations' top club competitions between 2021 and 2024. That's why Chelsea and Manchester City are both involved, having won the Champions League in 2021 and 2023 respectively.

As you may have noticed though, that criteria doesn't cover every club. In fact, it only applies to three of the 16 teams from UEFA.

Additional places are determined by a club ranking over the four-year period, with FIFA imposing a two-team-per-nation rule, hence why Liverpool misses out despite reaching the 2022 Champions League final. In fact, had the Reds beaten Real Madrid in Paris that year, they would have taken Chelsea's place at the tournament due to their superior ranking in Europe.

In truth though, Liverpool shouldn't be too disappointed with its snub by FIFA. After a long season which came off the back of a hectic international summer, Arne Slot will no doubt relish the opportunity for his players to take a well-earned break before embarking on their Premier League title defense.

One of his current squad could be involved in the US though, with Real Madrid reportedly hoping to have Trent Alexander-Arnold available for the tournament - assuming he doesn't choose to extend his stay at Anfield.

Alexander Zverev has seen tennis change dramatically since he first arrived on the ATP Tour.

Zverev is currently at his career-high ranking of world number two, after reaching two Grand Slam finals over the past year.

The German won his 24th ATP title at the BMW Open recently, where Zverev beat Ben Shelton in the Munich final.

However, he faced a setback after Zverev was beaten by Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round of the Madrid Open.

After Zverev was beaten in straight sets by the aforementioned Cerundolo, he headed to his post-match press conference.

In this press conference, one of the questions addressed to Zverev concerned whether he thought it was easier to become a top 10 player nowadays compared to previous years.

While Zverev suggested that there were perhaps better players at the very top of the game when he first made a breakthrough, he was adamant that there is more depth on the ATP Tour in 2025.

“Definitely not. It's much more difficult,” answered Zverev. “The depth of players is much more. 

“Before when I remember when I got to the top 10 for the first time in 2017, which was eight years ago, the top 10 was very strong and we had the four best players in the world with Novak [Djokovic], Rafa [Nadal], Roger [Federer], Andy [Murray], Stan [Stan Wawrinka] and [Juan Martin] Del Po[tro]. 

“Those guys. But the level from 10 to 20 and then 20 to 30 was much lower than it is now. Yes, the top was unbelievable but the depth now is much more.”

Zverev first broke into the top 10 in 2017 after he won his first ATP Masters 1000 title at the Italian Open.

At the time, Andy Murray was the world number one, ahead of the likes of Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

The only two players that were in the top 10 at that point and still remain there today are Zverev and Djokovic.

One of the most notable differences is the number of points that the world number three has, with Carlos Alcaraz currently holding 2,605 more points than Wawrinka, who was in third spot in May 2017.

Very little currently separates Zverev and Alcaraz, with Jannik Sinner still world number one despite being banned for three months.

The gap between the top two players could grow even further, as Zverev is the defending champion at the Italian Open.

Waters urged him to move up the kitchen line before the serve was played, and they went onto win the game 11-8.The Agassi-Waters winning streak continued quickly to 5-3 in the second game, where the teenagers used their first timeout of the match.

Andreeva, who just celebrated her 18th birthday on Tuesday, had won her last five matches in a row against Top 10 players, and it looked like she might be on her way to a sixth in a row as she not only served for the first set at 5-4, but also got to double set point at 40-15.But the match turned on a dime from there, as the 21-year-old Gauff not only saved those set points and broke back for 5-all, but eventually won eight games in a row to build a runaway 7-5, 5-0 lead.Andreeva held one last time to get on the board in the second set before Gauff served out the one-hour, 32-minute encounter."I had that tough match in the first round, and even though it was tough, I feel like it really prepared me," Gauff said, referring to her 0-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory over Dayana Yastremska in her opening match."It kind of woke me up, and I've been able to keep doing better, and hopefully I can keep going all the way to the end."Gauff finished the match with three more winners (18 to 15) and six fewer unforced errors (22 to 28) than the No. 7-ranked Andreeva.

The 2025 French Open is approaching as the tennis season nears its second grand slam.

Last year, it was glory for Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles, and in the women's, Iga Swiatek continued to show why she is the queen of clay.

Alcaraz had to come from two sets to one down against Alexander Zverez to emerge victorious in Paris, but he produced two wonderful sets of tennis to see off the German.

Meanwhile, Swiatek dispatched of Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 to win her fourth singles title at this tournament.

The Pole is just 23 but has won four of the last five at the French Open.

Of course, Coco Gauff and others will be out to stop her, while in the men's, Jannik Sinner is set to return from his three-month drug ban in time to compete.

For Britain, Jack Draper is one to watch.

Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic is more than likely to not play on clay until the start of the French Open after withdrawing from the Italian Open.

The 2025 French Open is set to get underway on Sunday, May 25, and will run until Sunday, June 8.

The whole event will be held at the Roland Garros complex in Paris.

Practice for the tournament begins on Monday, May 19, while qualifying to find out the remaining competitors also starts then as well.

Qualifying is expected to get going at 10am local time, which is 9am in the UK.

First-round matches will be starting at 10am UK time, and the tournament will progress from there.

The women's singles final is scheduled for Saturday, June 7 and will take place at 2pm.

The men's is on Sunday, June 8 and again will start at 2pm.

A full provisional schedule for the event can be found here.

The French Open will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports.

Fans can sign up for coverage of the entire tournament here.

The full draw for the 2025 French Open will be conducted much closer to the event starting.

Of course, all of the usual suspects will be there in both the men and women's singles.

America's Gauff already has her eyes set on glory at the French Open.

The 21-year-old made it to the final in 2022 only to be beaten by Swiatek.

However, she is determined to emerge victorious this time.

Speaking at a recent press conference about if she would like to be world No.1 or win a grand slam more, Gauff said: "Another major.

"I've always said… I don't know, I feel like people remember you more off majors than the world No. 1 ranking. 

"Obviously, if you could have both, that's great.”

After losing at the Madrid Open, Djokovic admitted he wasn't feeling at his best.

He said: "It's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis.

"It's a challenge for me mentally to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in tournaments."

Stan Wawrinka has played and beaten some of the best ATP players in history including Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

Wawrinka and Federer are compatriots, winning both the Davis Cup and an Olympic gold medal together.

The Swiss has reached four Grand Slam finals in his career, with all of them coming against either Djokovic or Rafael Nadal.

Djokovic has recently praised Wawrinka, but the three-time major winner was put in a tricky situation when asked to rank the Serbian amongst other tennis greats.

In a blind ranking with Eurosport France, Wawrinka was asked to position 10 of the best ATP players in history.

It started with Andy Murray, who Wawrinka believes is better than him, and placed in seventh place.

The first of the big three to come out of the hat was Nadal, who Wawrinka notably placed straight into third place ahead of 14-time Grand Slam champion Pete Sampras.

Current world number one Jannik Sinner was then mentioned to Wawrinka, who notably placed him straight into 10th position, while he later put Carlos Alcaraz in fifth.

Wawrinka put himself in ninth place, before positioning record 24-time major winner Djokovic in top position.

Federer was the final name in the hat to come out of the draw, falling into the last remaining spot in Wawrinka's rankings of number two.

A post shared by Eurosport France (@eurosportfr)

Wawrinka positioning Sinner in 10th spot is particularly noticeable, as he has been quite outspoken about his recent ban from tennis.

Sinner has received many critics since accepting a three month ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) back in February.

Wawrinka sent a strong reaction to Sinner's ban in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, and has recently spoke further about why he disagrees with the handling of the case.

I don't believe in a clean sport anymore …

“We have seen it in several cases in recent years,” Wawrinka told Eurosport France. “Some have been suspended for two years because they forgot to properly report their address. 

“It has been handled in a way that I believe harms tennis because, in the end, you wonder what battle you are trying to win. Whether you are really looking for players who test positive or if it all comes down to having a good lawyer who can get you out in the best possible way.”

WASHINGTON (TNND) — Andre Agassi, a former world No. 1 tennis player and Grand Slam champion, has debuted professionally in another racket sport: Pickleball. 

Agassi teamed up with 18-year-old  pro Anna Leigh Waters, who, according to Tennis.com, is "highly regarded at being the greatest women's player of all time," to compete at the Minto U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, Fla.

The Agassi-Waters duo took home the win against 13-year-old Stevie Petropouleas and 16-year-old Tristan Dussault 11-8, 9-11, 11-7 in the Round of 32.



Agassi and Waters will play in the Round of 16 match later on Wednesday against Trang Huynh-McClain and Len Yang.

Their first match together was held on Wednesday afternoon, just one day after Agassi celebrated his 55th birthday at the tournament.



Before the match, Agassi and Waters warmed up extensively in East Naples Community Park, where the tournament, which runs from April 26 to May 3, is expected to draw more than 50,000 spectators.

The warmups drew a crowd of both Agassi and Waters fans. 



When announcing their partnership, Agassi had great praise for Waters' success in the sport.



Waters has 173 Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles matches, with 148 of those titles being gold.

She is the defending women's doubles champion at the U.S. Open, while  Agassi's name has recently become synonymous with not just tennis, but pickleball too, with appearances in the Pickleball Slam and an endorsement with popular pickler brand JOOLA.

Agassi's debut comes as Sinclair Inc. announced former Amazon Executive and veteran media and technology executive Jeff Blackburn has been appointed Chairman and CEO of Tennis Channel.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner is set to make his return to the world of tennis after a three-month suspension. The Italian tested positive for clostebol last year at Indian Wells, and the news got leaked to the press in August, shortly after his Cincinnati Open win. Despite getting criticized immensely, he played throughout the 2024 season and finished the year ranked No. 1.

This year, after winning the Australian Open, he agreed with WADA on a three-month suspension. With his suspension ending on May 4, there are plenty of talking points surrounding Sinner. As his return looms large at the Rome Masters, his form will be under a microscope. However, we will share three reasons why the Italian will maintain the form that has made him unbeatable in the past 16 months.

Sinner has been the undisputed best player in the world since January last year. Although much was discussed about his talent, his mentality has grown even more in the past 9-10 months after the doping scandal. After the doping case came to light in August, Sinner was under intense criticism from Stanislas Wawrinka and Nick Kyrgios.

Critics claim that the World No. 1 should have been put in the same boat as Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova, who were suspended for more than a year for their doping cases. However, Sinner could not do much but keep his head down and perform on the court. His performance was immaculate as he won the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup to close his 2024 season. Then, he won the Australian Open to start the year.

Considering that he is coming from a three-month suspension in front of his adoring fans, his expectations would remain the same. However, Sinner has shown he can perform when the critics are loud. That reminds tennis fans of Novak Djokovic and how the Serb used to dismantle crowd favorites during his prime years.

Since the start of the 2024 season, Jannik Sinner has won against every player he has faced except Carlos Alcaraz. The young Spaniard has developed one of the best modern rivalries with Sinner as the duo is set to take over from the “Big 3.” However, in terms of head-to-head battles, Sinner failed in all three attempts against Alcaraz in 2024.

One of those losses came at the Roland Garros semifinals, where Alcaraz won in five sets to reach the final and win his first title on the Paris dirt. The Spaniard's injury issues in the past few weeks add to the positivity around Sinner. The Italian is unbeatable against almost everyone, but if his nemesis has issues with injuries, that opens the path for him.

Outside of Alcaraz, the rest of the field has been like a house of cards in 2025. From Alexander Zverev to João Fonseca, each player has had lapses in consistency. There is a reason why, despite being away from the sport for three months, no one has come close to toppling Sinner from the No. 1 ranking.

These are encouraging signs for Sinner, who has been anything but inconsistent since the start of the 2024 season. He has won the most Grand Slams, titles, and matches since the start of the last season. With an inconsistent field, he knows that he just needs a few matches under his belt to click into gear.

Rafael Nadal has been enjoying retirement since hanging up his racket in November, when he took on the Davis Cup for one last time.

Nadal finished his career happy, despite the Spaniard having been plagued by injuries towards the latter stages.

Legendary figure Nadal won a stunning 22 Grand Slam titles during his time on the court, bettered only by the 24 of Novak Djokovic.

The Serbian is currently chasing a 25th, although many tennis fans think Djokovic must retire now amid a poor run of form.

He has just suffered a third successive defeat, and most recently won an ATP title at the 2024 Paris Olympics last summer.

But the veteran has seemingly been handed a new lease of life by Andy Murray, his former rival who is now his coach.

That is, however, not a career trajectory that is currently on the cards for Nadal, who told CNN of becoming a coach: “I mean in this life you can never say never.

“It's difficult to imagine myself now doing this kind of thing… it's not my moment, at all. I am in a different moment of my life and I don't see myself travelling now with a player.”

In an exclusive interview with @AmandaDCNN, Spanish tennis legend @RafaelNadal says that he ‘100%' believes Jannik Sinner is innocent, as the Italian prepares to return from doping suspension.Read more and watch the full interview here: https://t.co/3aX9mbIR3e pic.twitter.com/UsJUpKsmuV

Tennis fans will love to hear that while Nadal isn't ready for coaching anytime soon, the possibility has not been ruled out.

Stranger things have, of course, happened in the sport, not least Murray deciding to link up with his former rival Djokovic shortly after retiring last summer.

But for now, Nadal can look back on his playing career with fond memories, with absolutely no need to rush into anything new.

His stunning achievements and indeed personality and approach to tennis and life have ensured that a superb legacy will be left.

Asked what he wants to be remembered for after that unforgettable playing career, he said: “The results are the results, you know. I won what I won, I lost what I lost, that's the results and nobody can change that.

“Of course, I will be remembered as a good tennis player, but for me, it's important to be remembered as a good person, a player who fights as hard as possible but with positive values, being always fair and correct with everyone on court. Trying to respect every single moment, for me that's the most important thing.”

The 23-year-old, who will return to action at Italian Open after short ban, ‘wasn't in a very happy place' before year's first grand slam

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner said this week he considered quitting the sport because of the turmoil surrounding his doping suspension.

When asked in a Rai TV interview on Tuesday if there was ever a moment when he wanted to give it all up, the 23-year-old hesitated briefly before responding: “Yes. I remember that I wasn't in a very happy place before the Australian Open this year.”

At the start of January in Melbourne – a grand slam that he won – it was still unclear whether Sinner would face a lengthy suspension before his doping case from 2024, when he blamed a masseur for giving him a banned cream.

In the end, a deal was made whereby he would receive a short three-month ban and return for the Italian Open starting next week.

He said he was anxious around the turn of the year about what 2025 might bring.

“I arrived in Australia and didn't feel comfortable, whether in the locker room or while eating. The players were looking at me differently,” he added. “That wasn't nice.

Tennis

After 20 minutes on the clay courts of Madrid, Iga Świątek threw her racket down on to her bag in frustration. She was experiencing something that she has inflicted on numerous opponents throughout her tennis career: the fear of humiliation.

A couple of minutes later, the fear became reality, as Madison Keys served up the first 6-0 set, or bagel, that Świątek has received in almost four years. Not since a match against Daria Kasatkina at Eastbourne in England in June 2021 had she lost a set 6-0.

In the end, the bagel from Keys will register as little more than a new statistic for commentators, because Świątek recovered to win the next two sets and take the match 0-6, 6-3, 6-2, gaining a measure of revenge for her defeat to the American in January's Australian Open semifinals. The result gives her a 3-0 record on clay in matches in which she lost the first set 6-0.

It also offers another data point during what has been a strange Madrid Open for the defending champion. Świątek, who has won 10 clay-court titles including four French Opens, has looked more vulnerable than perhaps she ever has on her favorite surface while never getting into real jeopardy because she is so otherworldly on it when she finds her game. The prodigious topspin on her groundstrokes rears up and pulls players off the court, creating short replies which she can devour. Her defense is often impregnable. And when matches do get more complicated than she expected, she has a wellspring of winning experience to draw from.

Her matches in Madrid have been so in her control that she has determined their closeness for good and for bad. Against Alex Eala in her opening match, she was the dominant player in almost every point — to the extent that her errors accounted for 22 of the 35 points that Eala needed to take the opening set. The same thing happened against world No. 13 Diana Shnaider in the fourth round. After winning the first set 6-0, Świątek lost the second in a tiebreak, but of the 48 points Shnaider won in that set, 34 were unforced errors from the world No. 2's racket.

Against Keys, Świątek was truly overrun for the first time. Having handled Linda Noskova's aggression with relative comfort in between her matches against Eala and Shnaider, Świątek had no answer to Keys' forehand and, though she said she was “feeling the ball,” sprayed groundstroke after groundstroke long. She repeatedly changed her racket and asked for restrings, looking for the higher tension that would give her more control. Her first serve faltered. The match was no longer on her racket.

After beating Eala, Świątek said of the changes she made: “I wanted to keep my margins and play a little bit more safe, to just play more balls in because I was making some unforced errors that weren't really necessary.” That quote could just have easily come from her match with Keys.

As soon as the 6-0 set was over and the second set had begun, Świątek started easing the ball deep, particularly in backhand-to-backhand rallies. She dragged Keys wider using sharper angles. She moved the ball, rather than trying to blast it. Keys duly started producing more mistakes, and from there Świątek flowed.

She faces either Mirra Andreeva or Coco Gauff in the semifinals May 1.

Analysis from tennis writer Charlie Eccleshare

Clay season is the time to start making more of a judgement on Świątek's form in 2025 — or so it appeared. It is her favorite part of the year, but also the part at which she is under the most pressure. Winning tournaments is par for her, so much so that if she were to win the Madrid Open, the Italian Open and the French Open, she wouldn't even gain any points on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka — because she won them all last year.

She has also hardly had a bad year by any rational tennis measure. Świątek has reached the quarterfinal or better in every tournament she's entered. She was one point away from the Australian Open final. Of her seven losses in 2025, five have come either in a final or to the defending champion and two have come against Ostapenko, one of the only active players against whom Świątek has a negative head-t0-head. In many of those defeats, she came up against someone playing one of their best matches of the season, if not their career.

Against Keys in Madrid it initially looked like more of the same. The American has been visibly unshackled by her acceptance that tennis results need not define her, taking her to her first Grand Slam title in Australia and to a 23-4 record in 2025 prior to this encounter. Keys destroyed Świątek in the second set of their Australian Open semifinal, and the quicker conditions at Madrid's altitude make it more hospitable to big-serving hitters like her, even more so than they do Świątek.

All this means that a comeback win for Świątek should suggest that her form is in a very healthy place, but external factors and some elements of her game make it hard to reach that conclusion with any certainty. Her serve let her down against Keys in the first set, but even her movement, normally such a weapon, was slightly hesitant. Normally so decisive, Świątek was second-guessing herself, exemplified by the short forehand she sprayed long to fall down 5-0. In numerous matches in Madrid, she has hit shots straight to her opponent from seemingly unassailable positions with expanses of the court gaping, extending points that could have been over in just one strike.

Despite four wins in Madrid, frustration appears to be a watchword for Świątek right now. After beating Eala in her opening match, Świątek was so dissatisfied with her performance that she put in some extra practice before speaking to the media. Once in the interview room, Świątek referenced that after the Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, where she suffered a dispiriting loss to Ostapenko, “she had some other stuff going on”.

After beating Noskova, Świątek clarified that she'd had to go home to Poland between Stuttgart and Madrid, “for private reasons.”

“Then coming here being in a little bit of rush for sure wasn't super comfortable,” she said. She has not looked super comfortable in most of her matches in Madrid, but nevertheless is into another semifinal for 2025.

Sinner accepted a three-month ban in February after a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, who had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision in August to clear him.

The Italian had tested positive for anabolic agent clostebol, which Sinner said entered his system from a member of his support team through massages and sports therapy.

Sinner won the Australian Open in January, with the WADA case hanging over him, and was asked during an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI on Tuesday whether he had ever considered giving up tennis.

"Yes, yes. I remember before the Australian Open this year, I was not in a very happy moment because there was still that case of doping," Sinner said.

"I didn't feel really comfortable in the locker room, where I ate. It was a bit like some players looked at me differently, and I didn't like it at all. And there I said it's heavy to live tennis in this way.

"I didn't feel comfortable, and then I said, maybe after Australia, a little bit of free time, in the sense that I take a little break, it will do me good."

Sinner was then forced into a break by the ban, but is now back in training for the upcoming Italian Open next month.

"Slowly, I'm getting back into the rhythm of real training with a goal in front of me," Sinner said.

"Sometimes it goes very well, sometimes there is a drop, and I don't know why, so I will certainly be very happy to return to the court.

"Especially in Rome, it is a special tournament for me, but I certainly enter with a slightly different mentality. I miss the competition. 

"I am certainly very happy that this phase is now over and we are ready to start again."

Sinner's settlement brought plenty of criticism from both current and former players, with Serena Williams saying she would have been banned for 20 years and had her Grand Slam titles taken away had she tested positive in a similar fashion.

"I mean, I don't even want to answer. Everyone is free to say what they want, everyone can judge, but that's okay," Sinner said.

"It's important to me that I know how that happened, but above all, also what I went through, and it was very difficult.

"I don't wish it on anyone to really pass as innocent something like that because it wasn't easy, but we are in a world where everyone can say what they want, so it's okay."

Tennis

Jannik Sinner said he “didn't feel at ease” during the Australian Open in January and considered taking a break from tennis after he was sanctioned for two anti-doping violations.

Sinner, men's world No 1, twice tested positive for banned anabolic steroid clostebol in March 2024. The Italian, who was found by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) to bear “no fault or negligence” for the two violations, accepted a three-month ban in February after reaching a case resolution agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

Sinner opened his 2025 season by winning his second consecutive Australian Open title in January, defeating Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the final. In an interview with Italian broadcaster TG1, Sinner said he “thought about taking some time off” after the Melbourne major and felt a shift in how he was perceived by his peers.

“I remember the Australian Open this year. I didn't really feel at ease in the locker room, in the player dining area,” said Sinner. “There were some players that looked at me differently, and I didn't really like it. It's heavy, to live tennis this way — I was always someone who joked around, who went in the locker room talking with this person, that person, anyone — and at that time I was a different person, I didn't feel at ease.

“At that time I said to myself, maybe some time off after Australia, a break for a little bit, would do me good.”

Sinner withdrew from the Rotterdam Open, the ATP 500 event in the Netherlands that takes place just over a week after the Australian Open final. At the time, he said he needed to give his body “time to rest,” missing an event at which he was defending champion.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed the ITIA's finding in September and sought a period of ineligibility of at least a year, but later deemed a three-month ban an “appropriate outcome.”

Sinner was free to resume training from April 13, having parted ways with trainer Umberto Ferrara and physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi following the initial decision in his case. He is set to return to competition at the Italian Open in May.

“Sometimes it goes very well, at other times there is a drop and I don't know why,” he said about his level in training. “I will be very happy to return to the match court, especially in Rome, a very special tournament for me … I miss competition.”

From May 19 to June 8, 2025, the Roland Garros clay-court tennis tournament takes place in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, at Porte d'Auteuil. For three weeks, from qualifying to the final draw, hundreds of players battle it out on the orange clay under the Parisian sun. Armed with their trusty rackets, they string together backhands, drop shots and aces, slaughtering many a tennis ball with their powerful strokes. But how many of these little yellow balls are used each year at Roland-Garros?

It's hard to say for sure how many balls were used, but in 2017, our colleagues at Le Parisien reported that around 70,000 balls were used over 15 days of competition, or around 5,000 per day. If the figures haven't changed since then, we can count on more than 100,000 tennis balls being used over the three weeks of the tournament! In the course of a tennis match, balls are changed every 9 games. As clay wears out the balls more than any other surface, you need to count on more than for any other Grand Slam tournament.

However, there's no question of throwing away these balls, which are still almost new after use! Some are resold in the tournament store, but the majority are sold to tennis clubs, where they are largely used up. They are then recycled thanks to Opération Balle Jaune, run by the FFT since 2009, crushed in factories and reused to create sports floors and courts!

Former ATP star John Isner has cast doubt on Novak Djokovic's chances of winning the French Open as he claimed the great Serb “only cares about Wimbledon at this point.”

Djokovic withdrew from the Italian Open on the back of his second round defeat to Matteo Arnaldi at the Madrid Masters.

The move means Djokovic is set to arrive at the French Open having lost the two clay-court matches he has played in 2025 in straight sets.

The 37-year-old's last win on clay was his stunning victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the Paris Olympics gold medal match in August.

Djokovic has won two of the previous four editions of the Roland Garros, having secured his second and third titles on the Parisian clay in 2021 and 2023.

The Serbian, who is chasing a record-extending 25th major, won his maiden French Open crown in 2016 to complete the Career Grand Slam.

Speaking on the Nothing Major Podcast, Isner argued Djokovic will already have his sights set on Wimbledon — where he is a seven-time champion.

“Obviously, it's really hard for us to say, but if I have to guess, I think he only cares about Wimbledon at this point,” said the former world No 8.

Novak Djokovic's Rome decision labelled ‘troubling' and ‘very strange' as two tennis icons react

Novak Djokovic's retirement announcement would no longer be a shock

“It's very unlikely that he can win Roland Garros and maybe he might even understand that now.

“Three out of five sets over two weeks on clay, with all the great players, with [Jannik] Sinner coming back – it is very unlikely. It's not his best surface to begin with, he is playing poorly on it right now.

“He was very frustrated, I don't know if you guys saw, in Madrid on the practice court. You know, he just had a frustrated moment on the practice court, which we've all had, but it's pretty amazing to see for the guy who has completed the game of tennis.

“He still wants more, it's always so admirable. He is still getting frustrated on the practice court, he wants to continue to get better and try and compete for these big tournaments like in Madrid. That obviously did not happen this week, did not happen in Monte Carlo.

“I think give him another day, he'll put this loss behind him and we all know his goals for the rest of his career are try to win another Grand Slam, which would be ridiculous for him to do at 37 or 38 years old.”

British tennis players face a challenge that is unrivalled in world tennis when Wimbledon rolls around each year and that juggernaut is about to rush towards Jack Draper.

Draper made a huge leap in the tennis world as he lifted his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells last month, with his rise into the top 10 of the rankings for the first time a fitting reward for that achievement.

Yet tennis in his British homeland tends to be a sport that only captures the wider public's attention when Wimbledon gets underway and that is when Draper will feel the full impact of his breakthrough in tennis.

There is a big chance Draper could be one of the top four seeds at Wimbledon if he continues his run at the Madrid Open, wins more matches at the Rome Masters and then makes a mark at the French Open.

Draper has just 70 ATP Ranking points to defend from 2024 and he can compete for 4,000 during the clay court season, with the opportunity he has in front of him.

Yet if Draper achieves his targets over the next few weeks, the hype machine that is at a different level in the English media will be given even more fuel than they have already got.

Draper has been a rising star in tennis for some time, but this is the first British summer when he will be THE star.

Tim Henman lived through this experience and then Andy Murray took it to the next level as he won two Wimbledon titles, with Draper now set to be thrown into the fire they had to learn to deal with.

A familiar format will be followed with Draper in the British summer of 2025.

He can be expected to be third on Centre Court at Wimbledon for all of his matches this summer, with that slot designed to capture the biggest TV audiences in the UK as it will grab viewers who get home after being at work all day.

The domestic newspapers and rolling news channels will hype up Draper as Britain's next Wimbledon champion and as former world No 1 Andy Roddick suggests, the attention will be relentless.

“Murray mania all the time. To give you a sense of how nuts it is there, I made the semis in 2009,” said Roddick on his Served podcast.

“You go to Aorangi Park [Wimbledon practice courts] or wherever to hit and his practice court is surrounded. You cannot get a 40-minute hit in without some picture being taken.

“He has an energy bar and it's like what is this? They actually treat this as news. It's absurd.

“I woke up in 2009 and at this point, I had won Queen's four times and I was the second-best player in the world on grass for a moment in time.

“I had made the finals of Wimbledon twice, the semis again. It wasn't like I was a dud. I find myself in the semis, beat Hewitt in five in the quarters and I wake up to a preview of the final – Murray vs Federer. And so I am seeing that and thinking this is ridiculous, I can only imagine what Murray's life looked like for a moment in time.

“I always equate it to the Red Sox not having won since whenever, the Cubs not having won, there were 10's of millions of people – and if I am hyperbolic saying 100 million people, it's not by much. Around the UK, they had screening parties. Imagine when a team wins a game at the World Cup, that was when Murray won. In an individual sport, one person.

“I am sure some of that is probably mitigated by Murray's successes [for Draper], you are not trying to break Fred Perry's record from the 1920s,” he added. “So him having done it probably softens the first time thing a little bit, but it is mania.”

Draper has grown into his role as a leading star in tennis after initially struggling to display his emotions on court and in interviews, but he will face a whole new challenge this summer and it will test him to the full.

There is no doubt that this big-serving star who has beaten Carlos Alcaraz twice in the last year will be a contender to win his first Wimbledon title this summer, but he will need to deal with more pressure than anyone else in the draw if he is to achieve that dream.

Daniil Medvedev said he'd be willing to pay for Novak Djokovic's services as a coach, when the Serbian eventually retires. The 37-year-old, 24-time Grand Slam winner is still a formidable opponent on the court, but has many more tournaments behind him than in front.

Medvedev, who faces Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open, is no stranger to Djokovic's remarkable skill set and mastery of the game. The Russian acknowledges that Djokovic has stopped him from winning numerous titles, including the 2023 US Open, which the World No.5 won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

With Djokovic currently leading their head-to-head 10-5, Medvedev expressed a desire to collaborate rather than clash with the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the future.

In an interview with the Serbian publication Sportal, Medvedev admitted: "I would pay for Novak to be my coach. I don't believe that Novak will be a coach right away.

"It is more realistic that he will give advice and share his experience with his friends who are closest to him on the Tour. Therefore, if there is such a possibility, I would also be happy to be in such a situation.

"Of course, that won't happen while Djokovic is playing, because that would put him in the wrong position. It would be embarrassing for him, but he certainly wouldn't share his secrets. That's why it will happen when he ends his career."

When prodded about the timeline of Djokovic hanging up his racket, Medvedev said with a grin, "In five years."

He then dropped an astounding revelation that Djokovic has already made a pact to coach another competitor, specifically Alexander Zverev, after his retirement.

Medvedev added: "I heard in Australia that Sasha Zverev said that Novak promised him that he would work with him for a year when he finished his career."

Following Medvedev's statements at the Madrid Open, Djokovic acknowledged his interest in teaming up with the Russian in the future, but stressed that there's "no price" that could entice him at this moment.

The Serbian champion opened up by saying: "It's very flattering that he thinks I can help him and be useful to his career. I really like Medvedev a lot, we always had a great relationship off the court.

"I am sure that because of my relationship with Daniil, I would always like to work with him if I could. As an advisor or mentor. One day I would consider becoming a member of their team.

"First, I have to end my career in order to think about that offer, and I don't know when that will happen yet. I said before, as long as I'm playing it's early for that. That's why there is no price."

Djokovic, who turns 38 three days before the year's second Grand Slam begins on May 25th, has been woefully out of form and was comprehensively beaten in his opening matches at Masters tournaments in Monte Carlo and Madrid this month.

The Serb was expected to jumpstart his clay campaign in Rome before returning to Paris, where he won Olympic gold last year, but on Tuesday, he said he was skipping the Masters 1000 event, without providing a reason.

"That's troubling. It's worrying for me as a Novak fan," Courier, who won back-to-back Roland Garros titles in 1991 and 1992, said on the Tennis Channel.

The American added that Rome would have been the perfect venue for Djokovic to find his rhythm as it had similar conditions to Paris without the challenge of playing at altitude in Madrid.

"If you're going to play one between Madrid and Rome (then) Rome would be the one you would want to play to get ready for Roland Garros," he said.

Djokovic, who is chasing a 100th tour-level title and first since his ATP Finals triumph in 2023, said after his loss in Madrid that he was trying to come to terms with a "new reality" in tennis where he is just "trying to win a match or two."

"I don't know what to make of it, but I don't like the way it feels in the gut," Courier added.

"It's a very strange thing to announce a pullout now, well in advance of it, and we'll see what it all means when we get to Roland Garros."

Five races in, Williams currently hold the ‘best of the rest' tag, lying fifth in the Teams' standings behind the big four teams: McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari.

It represents a very significant improvement on last year as Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have taken a solid 25 points between them. But in trying to close the performance gap to the big teams, there are clear limitations to their car in its current guise, something which the arrival of Sainz from Ferrari has helped define.

“One of the things Carlos finds very different to the Ferrari is that they could carry a lot more ‘combined' into certain corners,” explained Williams Team Principal James Vowles in Japan, “and that's not an area we have worked on over the years.”

EXCLUSIVE: NBCUniversal recently went through two major changes: the spinoff of a new standalone company that will house cable networks such as E!, Syfy, Oxygen and USA Network and a restructure that saw new roles for top executives including Pearlena Igbokwe and Frances Berwick.


	Deadline understands that the Comcast-owned company is now starting a process of layoffs tied to these moves.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We're hearing that a few dozen employees across NBCUniversal's television and streaming business are being let go. Insiders tell Deadline that these cuts are more “surgical” compared to previous “sweeping” cuts. This covers NBC, cable networks, Peacock as well as on the studio side, although is largely focused on marketing and communications as well as some more junior folk in certain areas of programming. 

	











	It was always expected that a number of NBCUniversal executives who worked across multiple cable networks and streaming service Peacock, would depart with SpinCo looming. Deadline understands that people who were moving to SpinCo from NBCU were informed earlier this week and these cuts are now being made following that. 


	Earlier this year, SpinCo named Val Boreland, who was EVP and Head of Content Acquisitions, TV & Streaming for NBCUniversal, as its President of Entertainment. These networks, which may well get their own head of originals working for Boreland, don't greenlight as many originals as NBC, Peacock or Bravo, which are all obviously remaining with NBCUniversal, but there are still plenty of original series across E!, Syfy and USA Network, in particular such as House of Villains and Botched. Oxygen also orders a raft of true-crime content such as Cold Justice, produced by Dick Wolf, Deadly Waters with Captain Lee, and long-running series Snapped.


	Following a previous restructure, many of its top execs bought and developed programming across NBC, its cable networks and Peacock.


	But the move in January by Donna Langley, Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment in January to make Pearlena Igbokwe  Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted and Frances Berwick, Chairman, Bravo & Peacock Unscripted, cleared some of this up. It also led to the departure of the likes of Peacock President Kelly Campbell and Corie Henson, who was EVP, Unscripted Content, Competition and Game Shows, NBCUniversal Entertainment.

Numerous Hallmark Channel stars have rallied around actor Noel Johansen, whose wife died on April 26, 2025, when an SUV plowed into the crowd at Vancouver's Lapu Lapu Day festival, per the Associated Press, killing 11 and injuring dozens at the annual Filipino cultural celebration. 

Artist Jen Darbellay, 50, was among those killed, while Johansen and their seven-year-old daughter Darby were injured, according to the Vancouver Sun. Family friend Michael Daingerfield Hall told the paper that the family was preparing to walk a block-and-a-half home when chaos broke out. He has created a GoFundMe campaign for the family, which many Hallmark stars have shared with fans. 

Two days after the tragedy, on April 28, Johansen was on crutches while attending an emotional candlelight vigil for victims, per the Global News, and expressed how heartbroken his family is over his wife's death. 

Johansen's Hallmark credits, per IMDb, include supporting roles in Nikki DeLoach's “Reunited at Christmas,” the “Unleashing Mr. Darcy” and “Marrying Mr. Darcy” movies with Cindy Busby and Ryan Paevey, Catherine Bell's “Home for Christmas Day,” “All of My Heart: Inn Love” with Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliott, and episodes of “When Calls The Heart” and “Chesapeake Shores.”

In footage captured at the candlelight vigil by Global News, Johansen responded to the crowd's kind words about the victims, including his wife, who was known in the community as a visual artist, costume designer, and doting mom to Darby and their 15-year-old son, Ford. 

Propped up on his crutches, Johansen choked back tears as he told the crowd, “What you see here, it's just an injury that means nothing to me because what's inside my heart is broken. Because my wife passed away behind me at the incident, and everything that you said, she would have said.” 

Johansen added, “Everytime, I think, you hug someone, you should feel someone and I felt (with) everyone who hugged me since then, I felt her.” 

A 30-year-old man whom Vancouver police said has a “significant history of interactions with authorities involving mental health,” has been charged with the murders of those who died, according to Reuters.

On April 29, multiple Hallmark stars shared a GoFundMe campaign set up by Daingerfield Hall for Johansen and his kids. Originally created with a fundraising goal of $20,000, the community has rallied, raising close to $150,000 for the beloved family by April 30. 

WCTH actress Loretta Walsh posted a photo of the couple on Instagram and shared that Darbellay was personal friend, writing, “Jen was a bright light – beautiful inside and out. An artist, a creative, an empath, she was always so sweet with her greeting of ‘Hey Beauty' and always so positive and kind.” 

“She was a deeply loving wife to Noel and a dedicated and wonderful mother to 2 beautiful children,” Walsh continued. “She is so deeply missed. Noel and his 2 kids (aged 7 and 15) are going to need our support. Noel has his own physical injuries from the incident, plus he will need time away from work to be with his children and to heal physically and emotionally. Please donate and support this lovely man and his family.” 

Andrea Brooks shared the GoFundMe in her Stories and commented on Walsh's post, “I cannot even find the words. 💔”

Others who have shared the fund for Johansen include “The Chicken Sisters” actress Rukiya Bernard, “Curious Caterer” actress Jaycie Dotin, and WCTH star Pascale Hutton.

In an update on the GoFundMe page, Daingerfield Hall said a vigil will be held on April 30 specifically to honor Darbellay. The gathering will take place at 6:30 p.m. Pacific time at Sir Alexander Mackenzie Elementary School where, he wrote, “we will hold space to honour Jen and celebrate her life and her magical, generous, and creative spirit.”

The label founded by Todd Moscowitz has grown rapidly since it adopted a three-tiered approach to signing and developing artists.


													By

Bayker Blankenship's “Maxed Out” is a bankrupt ballad set in a barren landscape of dead-end towns and nearly-empty bars. The narrator drinks a few too many Jack and Cokes when he's not spending the night in the clink: “I'm getting into fights and I'm falling hard,” Blankenship sings. “I maxed out one more credit card.”


	Blankenship released the track in April 2024 through a distribution company called Foundation. “Maxed Out” performed well — so well that Blankenship graduated to Foundation's sister operation, Santa Anna Label Group, a more high-touch distributor that's able to put marketing muscle behind its artists.


	“I appreciate their expertise on the content and digital side,” says Brian Schwartz, who manages Blankenship. When Santa Anna promotes songs, “they analyze, see what's working and what's not,” Schwartz continues. “And they know how to pour the fuel on what's working.” “Maxed Out” now has more than 121 million on-demand streams in the U.S., according to Luminate.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Foundation and Santa Anna are both under the command of Todd Moscowitz, the founder of Alamo Records. After launching Alamo in 2016 and introducing Santa Anna at the start of 2023, Moscowitz has cobbled the companies together into “a soup-to-nuts, fully integrated ecosystem where artists [have] a path to graduate to a premier frontline label,” as he puts it. This approach is becoming increasingly common, as both major labels and independents look to sign more acts and offer an array of options that allows those artists to grow over time — while also remaining attached to the company that initially offered them funding.


	Foundation functions as a feeder system, signing a lot of young artists, many in hip-hop and R&B, primarily to low-money, short-term distribution deals. Santa Anna is a level up, with the capability to support labels — including OVO Sound, which scored a No. 1 album recently with the PARTYNEXTDOOR–Drake collaboration $ome $exy $ongs 4 U — as well as individual artists who have already generated some momentum. And Alamo is the more traditional frontline label: It signs a small number of artists directly and provides services to each of them.


	Hybrid companies like this — offering the flexibility of a distributor but the promotional firepower of a major label — often work better in theory than in practice. Most distributors “don't know how to take artists to the next level,” Moscowitz acknowledges. At the same time, frontline labels still “don't have much experience in indie distribution.” Artists can get lost in the messy middle ground between the two business models. 


	This makes the growth of Santa Anna/Foundation all the more impressive. In 2024, Santa Anna added more than a point (1.04%) of current market share to Alamo's 2.11% total. Many competitors would hack off an arm to add a point of current market share in a year. (Foundation's contribution is included in that number.) 


	Already this year, Alamo has grown to a 2.91% current share through the first quarter — 1.83% of it from Santa Anna/Foundation — which is good for eighth among all labels in the U.S. Getting to release a Drake collaborative album was a coup for the company; $ome $exy $ongs 4 U, which Santa Anna co-distributed with Republic Records, earned 246,000 equivalent album units its opening week. The radio-ready single “Nokia” has risen as high as No. 2 on the latest Billboard Hot 100, and remains in the top 10.


	“If it's a lot harder to create superstars, it's all about, how do you soak up more?” says a senior executive at a competing company. He calls Alamo's integration with Santa Anna and Foundation “brilliant — and potentially an indicator of where things are going in the future.” 


	Moscowitz was experimenting with hybrid models inside the major-label system long before it was fashionable. He worked at Def Jam during its 1990s heyday and then moved to Warner Music Group (WMG) in 2004, initially as president of Asylum Records. There, he designed “a fluid system in terms of the deals, because when you're dealing with entrepreneurs, you must be flexible,” as he put it in 2022. When WMG launched its Independent Label Group in 2006, Moscowitz was named president of the new outfit. 


	He later co-founded the indie 300 Entertainment, which launched in 2014, before jumping ship to get Alamo off the ground two years later. Alamo, which now functions as a frontline label under the Sony Music umbrella, signed chart-topping rappers like Rod Wave and Lil Durk, who have combined to earn 11 top five Billboard 200 albums for the label, including four No. 1s. 


	Even as Alamo enjoyed that traditional label success, however, Moscowitz couldn't help but notice that “distribution [was] becoming an ever more important entry point into the business for artists.” Major labels have launched their own distribution wings one after another in recent years, whether that's REPUBLIC (Imperial), 300 (Sparta), or more recently, Warner Records (Revolution). To compete in this landscape “with a credible, recognized offering,” Moscowitz invested in Foundation at the end of 2022 and launched Santa Anna shortly after. 


	In hip-hop, Foundation “was first with this very small advance, very early outreach, blanket approach,” the senior executive says. Another executive familiar with the company says they can easily send out hundreds of deals in a year. Five separate Foundation contracts viewed by Billboard show that in the past, the company often offered artists advances between $20,000 and $30,000 with few guaranteed services. In exchange, the artist has to fork over a set number of songs — maybe two dozen new tracks, or some already-released music along with a smaller number of future records. 


	Foundation takes a cut of royalties, usually between 20 percent and 30 percent, which attorneys say is in line with industry norms for these sorts of agreements. (Though more competitors are offering similar contracts recently, according to music lawyers, causing advances to rise.) Foundation keeps earning until it recoups its expenses; after that, the company typically gets two or three additional years to collect on the music (known as the “retention period”) before rights revert to the artist. The contracts seen by Billboard auto-renew after recoupment unless artists give the company 30 days' notice that they want to end the relationship.


	Moscowitz is adamant that Foundation's purpose “is not to have a thousand artists doing 100,000 streams a week and make some distribution revenue.” “Most of our artists' streams go up dramatically after signing with us,” he says. “Some go up so much that it makes sense to engage the entire company and spend substantial money and effort marketing them.”


	That's where Santa Anna comes into play. While many new distributors have entered the industry in the last decade, “a lot of them don't do anything,” says Conor Ambrose, founder of the label Listen to the Kids. He partnered with Santa Anna in 2023 due to their ability to help his acts. “Their marketing people are talking to our artists; their playlisting team is talking to our artists,” he says. “Everybody's actually on the phone every week.” 


	“Every time we've asked Todd for something,” Schwartz adds, “he's showed up.”


	Another difference between Santa Anna and its competitors, according to Moscowitz, is that his operation “will not offer marketing on any artist unless we have a path to long-term rights.” In other words, he doesn't want to help blow up an artist, only to have that act split to another record company.  


	“Many of these sorts of deals come with upstream clauses, meaning the major-affiliated distributor — in this case, Santa Anna — may have the right to trade the artist up to a frontline label,” says Loren Wells, a music lawyer familiar with Santa Anna. “The terms of the upstream will be much less favorable than the initial deal. But many young artists may see that outcome as unlikely, or simply think, ‘If the worst case scenario is getting signed to a major label with a decent advance, that's not really a worst case scenario.'” And in genres like country that still favor old-school record deals, Wells continues, the upstream terms may still seem more appealing than other labels' traditional offers. 


	Moscowitz says Santa Anna is able to secure future long-term rights because artists “value what we bring to the table” in terms of marketing and promotion. “If we don't value ourselves, then no one will ever value us,” the Alamo founder adds. 


	He is pleased with the results so far. “We have eight or 10 artists like Chuckyy, Raq baby, and Bayker Blankenship who are breaking and will be the future stars of our company,” Moscowitz says. “Santa Anna is functioning exactly the way we want.”

Robert De Niro‘s daughter Airyn is ready to talk about her transition. In a new profile with Them, the actor's daughter with model Toukie Smith opened up about how she wants to emulate her mother as she continues to embrace her trans identity and be a symbol of representation.


	“I'd want to hopefully be an inspiration for at least one other person like me who is Black, who is queer, who's not a size extra small,” the 29-year-old told the outlet. “I'd want to see more trans women, more Black women who are maybe bigger-bodied or don't fit the mold of super thin or heroin chic.”


	The new interview comes after Airyn was the target of tabloid headlines that called her “Robert De Niro's nepo baby son,” questioning her pink locs and feminine outfit. “Not only did they get information wrong about me… They just sort of reminded me that people really don't know anything about me,” she said. None of the outlets, she said, reached out to her before the stories were published. It's part of why she's decided to speak about her identity publicly.

	Airyn shared in the interview that she has been femme-presenting since she was in middle school, but she only started hormone therapy last November after hearing from other trans women who spoke about their own transitions.  “Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success… I'm like, you know what? Maybe it's not too late for me,” she said. “Maybe I can start.”

	As she enters this new phase of her life, Airyn said she worries about how her family might “still think of me as the person I was before the transition,” but she looks forward to stepping into this new time of her life with bravery.


	“The way [my mom] would conduct or hold herself, the way that I saw her interact with others in public when I was younger, I see myself emulating that in some way,” Airyn said. “Whether it's just turning on the charm or not putting on a mask, but wanting to be feminine in a way that's inviting and warm and welcoming.”

	Airyn said she plans to continue pursuing voice acting and modeling, although she has struggled to land roles as she tries to build her own path separate from her dad's success. She auditioned for Jules in Euphoria and a voice role in League of Legends, but is also studying to be a mental health counselor. “My dad was very big on us finding our own sort of path,” Airyn said. “I would want [success] to happen on my own merit.”

	











	After her story was published, Laverne Cox shared a sweet message for Airyn, saying she was “deeply honored” to have helped inspire Airyn in her transition. “I want to congratulate you for embracing the beauty that you are… the beauty that is being trans,” Cox said. “I believe in every fiber of my being that we are anointed… Claiming our transness and owning it is stepping into a sacredness that is really beautiful.”

Sgt. Rock, DC's superhero flick to team Luca Guadagnino and The Penguin‘s Colin Farrell, has halted production plans, sources have confirmed to Deadline.


	While the film was supposed to enter production in the coming months, we're now told it'll look to shoot next summer. Studio insiders said that ultimately, shooting this summer was untenable, as the team would have had to rush through prep to hit the right weather conditions at the right time. The film is being shot primarily on location in the U.K. and shooting exteriors in the dead of winter would not have been optimal conditions for cast, crew and equipment.

	The Sgt. Rock news comes as a shock as the film was greenlit months ago with a $65 million budget and plan to shoot this August. Sources close to the project say Guadagnino was scouting locations last week and that the studio was far down the line with Alien: Romulus breakout David Jonsson to join Farrell, as well as Challengers star Mike Faist, who also had an offer.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In Sgt. Rock, a World War II-set superhero actioner, Farrell was set to play Sgt. Franklin John Rock, the character created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert, who first debuted in the 1959 DC issue Our Army at War as a WWII infantry soldier. The character gained stature in 1977 when he got his own comic book series, which ran through 1988.


Sgt. Rock was conceived as part of the DC universe overseen by studio chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, rather than as part of the world inhabited by Farrell's The Penguin and overseen by The Batman's Matt Reeves. Farrell agreed to take on the title role following the exit of Daniel Craig, who kicked tires for a moment to reteam with Guadagnino on the heels of the duo's collaboration on A24's Queer. The project was set to reteam Guadagnino with Justin Kuritzkes, his screenwriter on Challengers and Queer.


	Guadagnino will next see the release of After the Hunt, his #Me Too-themed thriller for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will be released on October 10. The filmmaker had also recently been looking to mount a revamp of American Psycho for Lionsgate, but we'll have to stay tuned to see which project the filmmaker commits to next, with the delay on Sgt. Rock.


	Next up for DC Studios is Gunn's Superman, which hits theaters on July 11. THR broke the Sgt. Rock news.

Chris Hemsworth is set to star in Subversion, a submarine action flick coming together at Amazon MGM Studios, with Patrick Vollrath (7500) directing from a script by Andrew Ferguson, and Di Bonaventura Pictures producing, Deadline has confirmed.


	The film follows a once-promising Naval commander (Chris Hemsworth) who is blackmailed by a cartel-like operation into piloting a dangerous submarine carrying illegal cargo across international waters, thrusting him into a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, outmaneuvering blockades, and navigating perilous threats both in and outside of the submarine.

	











	The project reunites Hemsworth with Amazon MGM Studios as he's also starring in Crime 101 for writer-director Bart Layton alongside Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Halle Berry, and Monica Barbaro, which is set to be released theatrically next year.  The film also reunites four-time Black List honoree Ferguson with the studio, where his script Blood Rush is in development.

	Coming off of projects like Extraction II, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga — where he gave a career-best performance as Dementus — and Transformers One, Hemsworth is confirmed to reprise his role as Thor in Avengers: Doomsday, which also hits theaters in 2026. Other projects to which he's recently been linked include an Untitled Transformers/G.I. Joe Crossover at Paramount and a Prince Charming movie that Paul King is expected to direct for Disney, if the studio doesn't completely back off from its strategy of mining animated IP for live-action films, in the wake of Snow White.


	German filmmaker Vollrath's first feature 7500, a hijacking action thriller starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was acquired and released by Amazon Studios in 2020. He was also Academy Award-nominated for his live-action short Everything Will Be Okay in 2016.

Chris Hemsworth is taking a deep dive for Amazon MGM Studios.


	The actor, last seen in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, is set to star in Subversion, a submarine thriller that Patrick Vollrath will direct for Amazon MGM.




	Lorenzo di Bonaventura is producing via his di Bonaventura Pictures banner. The project is eying a production start this fall in Australia.


	Written by Andrew Ferguson, the story has been described as a “Die Hard on a submarine” style thriller that centers on a once-promising Naval commander (Hemsworth) who is blackmailed by a cartel-like operation into piloting a dangerous submarine carrying illegal cargo across international waters. Thrust into a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, the man must outmaneuver blockades and navigate perilous threats both in and outside of the submarine.

	Vollrath already proved his mettle with a story set in a contained environment. He made his feature directorial debut with 7500, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a pilot stuck in his cockpit while his plane is hijacked. The filmmaker, whose live-action short film Everything Will Be Okay was nominated for an Academy Award in 2016, is repped by Gotham Group and Davis Law Group.




			Popular on THR		







	Ferguson's scripts frequently land on the Black List (four times, to be exact), with one titled Blood Rush currently in development at Amazon MGM.  


Subversion reunites Hemsworth with Amazon MGM as he's also starring in Crime 101, an all-star thriller that also counts Mark Ruffalo, Barry Keoghan, Halle Berry and Monica Barbaro in its cast. The company is giving the feature a theatrical release in 2026. Hemsworth, who is among the cast of Avengers: Doomsday, is represented by CAA and Greenberg Glusker.

	WWE's WrestleMania 41 in Las Vegas showcased the best wrestlers and musicians. From meet-and-greets with fans to Travis Scott's appearance, fan opinions on John Cena and Cody Rhodes, and catching up with Bianca Belair before SmackDown, keep watching to catch everything you missed during the big weekend!


	Were you at WrestleMania 41? Let us know in the comments!


	Fan 1:It's my first mania. I had to, I saved so much, went through so much, just to get here. And you know, the payoff is good. 


	Carl Lamarre:They were just like, “Yo, if we see New Day, we might have to jump.” 


	The New Day:For what? Who gonna jump us? Who gonna jump us?  They can barely get off the couch how are they going to jump at anybody?  Who said that? 


	Fan 2:Travis Scott is a b—h.


	Fan 3:These fans. I mean, they're the best in the world. I mean, they're so passionate about everything that happens around WWE. 


	Excision, or Marilyn Manson because it's angry and sexy.


	Carl Lamarre: I love that. We spent the week in Las Vegas for all of the WWE activities before and after the main event. What's going on y'all? I am deputy director of R&B/hip-hop, Carl Lamarre, and we are here live at WrestleMania in Las Vegas at WWE World. Billboard kicked off WrestleMania week on Thursday at WWE World. Think of it like Comic Con for wrestling fans. Wrestlers were signing top cards and belts. You could walk down the ramp to your favorite superstar's entrance. Some pros were even giving wrestling demos in the ring. You could also catch a live podcast recording and thank John Cena for his 25 years in wrestling. Fanatics hosted a Make-a-Wish event with superstar wrestlers Tiffany Stratton and Braun Strowman in attendance. 


	Tiffany Stratton:I love the kids. That's, like, my favorite part of being a superstar is getting to meet them and, like, do stuff like this, where they get to do their own entrances.

Big Mouth, Netflix's long-running animated comedy, is premiering its eighth and final season next month but its creators have remained busy.


	The team behind the Nick Kroll-voiced series are working on Mating Season, a new animated series for the streamer.


	The show, which will launch in 2026, is set in the animal world starring a cast of bears, raccoons, deer, foxes and a host of other horny, lovable forest critters, as they navigate love, sexual relationships and the universal need to hook up and find a partner.

Big Mouth, which launched in 2017, has racked up 375M views, per Netflix, over its seven seasons and season eight launches on May 23. It featured voice work from the likes of Maya Rudolph, Cynthia Erivo, Megan thee Stallion, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Zach Galifianakis, Seth Rogen, Martin Short, Kristen Bell, Wanda Sykes, Tyler the Creator, Jeff Goldblum, Ira Glass, Steve Buscemi, Billy Porter, Padma Lakshmi, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Jean Smart.


	Voice cast for Mating Season was not revealed.


	“Big Mouth broke new ground in the world of adult animation with heart, humor and total chaos — they took the awkwardness of adolescence and turned it into something universal and deeply human,” said John Derderian, VP, Animation Series, Netflix. “Working with Nick Kroll and the brilliant minds at Brutus Pink over the course of eight seasons has been legendary. Now, with Mating Season, they'll bring that same bold and hilarious creativity into the animal kingdom. We're beyond excited to unleash this next chapter together.”

EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate‘s franchise returner The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping is set to be the biggest-budget project on sale at next month's Cannes market.


	Market sources tell us the film's budget is being pegged north of $150M. Two sources tell us between $170-200M gross. This isn't shocking given the last film in the popular franchise, made almost a decade ago, had a reported budget of $160M. But it would still be the biggest budget movie to hit a film market in some time, a market that has become accustomed to smaller genre fare and where tentpole franchises aren't as common as they used to be. It's hard to recall the last movie with a budget in this range hitting the indie market. The Irishman did, but then was flipped to Netflix. Before that, it would probably be Mockingjay Part Two. More recently, Better Man had a budget north of $100M (that didn't end well), as did Emancipation (that was flipped to Apple) and Saudi-shot Desert Warrior (which remains in post after a long delay) has been reported as costing north of $100M gross, though that number is contested.

	Buyers are always hungry for a winner and the Hunger Games franchise has delivered for many in the past. The five films in the franchise have taken in more than $3.3BN at the box office. The asking prices are likely to be steep, however, and given global economic challenges and the sparsity of major indies today it'll be interesting to see who is able to stump up. We should know more on asking prices soon. At a time when so many buzzy properties get flipped to streamers and studios (in recent months, we've had Lionsgate and Henry Cavill's Highlander reboot and Natalie Portman rom-com Good Sex both go that way), it's good news for indie buyers to at least have a shot at a big franchise. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Filming is due to get underway in July on the film, which Francis Lawrence will direct from Billy Ray's adaptation of the Suzanne Collins novel.  


	As we revealed, Oscar nominee Jesse Plemons has been cast as Plutarch Heavensbee, joining Joseph Zada As Haymitch Abernathy, Whitney Peak As Lenore Dove Baird and Mckenna Grace as Maysilee Donner. Additional casting is in process.


Sunrise on the Reaping revisits the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. The protagonist of the novel is the young Abernathy (portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the previous movies), the second male tribute from District 12 to enter the deadly arena.

	











	The appetite for the books remains strong. The novel sold 1.5M copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand after it hit shelves in March. The 1.2M copies sold in its first week in the U.S. are twice the first-week sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and three times those of Mockingjay.


	Pic is slated for release on November 20, 2026. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce. In the U.S., Starz will have an exclusive first pay window, which will be followed by another exclusive window for Amazon Prime.


	As for other buzzy pre-sale projects set to be on sale at Cannes, A24 will be on the Croisette with the Brad Pitt movie The Riders from director Edward Berger and producer Scott Free, which we revealed earlier this week. The company will also be talking to buyers about Robert Pattinson and Zendaya starrer The Drama. There are plenty more projects still to be announced. Stay tuned to Deadline for the latest.

From con men to real estate closers, David Mamet has made a career out of writing characters who know how to spot a sucker. And with “Henry Johnson,” his first film in 10 years, he invites his devotees to look under the hood and examine the psyche of one of the weak, easily manipulated individuals that his most memorable characters spend their lives exploiting.

Adapted from his play of the same name, which premiered in Los Angeles in 2023 before mounting a Chicago production this spring, “Henry Johnson” unfolds over the course of four two-handed scenes. Like any Mamet endeavor, the real star is the language. Major plot events happen almost entirely offscreen, with its ensemble of characters using them as jumping off points to soliloquize about everything from the value of therapy to Snow White's vagina. Everyone has preconceived opinions about his writing style, but Mamet puts it to use, with more substance than recent misfires like the endless phone conversation in “China Doll” or the critically panned Harvey Weinstein play “Bitter Wheat.” The Pulitzer winner has something to say, but whether anyone still wants to hear it is another question entirely.

From the moment Henry Johnson (Evan Jonigkeit) appears on screen, he's working in service of more powerful men. He timidly approaches Mr. Barnes (Chris Bauer), his boss at an unspecified job, with a request to hire a friend of his who is eligible for parole. Mr. Barnes — who emasculates Henry with his body language and confident presence before he ever opens his mouth — doesn't understand why he should help someone who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and proceeds to grill his employee about his affection for this imprisoned man. 

While Henry initially tries to spin his behavior as a benevolent act of kindness, Barnes effectively makes the case that Henry was merely manipulated by a charming sociopath. Furthermore, he reveals that he knows Henry embezzled $300,000 from the company to help pay the man's defense attorneys, and Barnes has every intention to press charges.

The rest of the film takes place in a prison, where Henry's gruff but philosophical cellmate, Gene (Shia LaBeouf), tries to teach him the ways of the world. Henry still views the embezzlement as a noble deed, but Gene is certain that only a chump would go out on a limb for someone else without getting something in return. He encourages Henry to be more aggressive in life, no matter the cost. Henry eventually complies in the form of actions that will have to remain unmentioned, as it's quite easy to spoil a film with only four scenes.

 










For a character whose actions set so many consequences in motion, Henry is remarkably passive. The kind of empty suit who, as Shiv Roy so memorably put it, will always suck the biggest dick in the room, his only function in life is to make himself useful to one strongman before jumping ship to another when he's inevitably cast aside. Both Mr. Barnes and Gene subject him to scoldings about how he needs to stand up for himself when other people manipulate him, but he's never clever enough to see that they're simply diverting attention from their own schemes to deploy him for their personal benefits.

A prominent Trump supporter whose outspoken opinions have overshadowed his work for the past decade, Mamet presents a fairly damning indictment of weakness in our society that has a wide berth of interpretations depending on where your own views fall. In one sense, Henry is the kind of useless man who creates hard times with his own passivity. Nearly all the film's tragedy could be avoided if he could just grow a backbone for five consecutive seconds and stand up to a bully. I'm sure there's someone who'd make the case that a childhood spent replacing seed oils with beef tallow and saying slurs in school could have fixed all of it, but Mamet mercifully never goes there. If anything, the selfish voices in Henry's ears are closer to the MAGA grifters selling male vitality supplements on the most vile podcasts you've ever heard. His own lack of a sense of self creates a vacuum that is immediately filled by nefarious actors who are eager to sell him an illusion of masculinity that hides the fact he's completely under their thumbs.

 










Many critics have hailed “Henry Johnson” as Mamet's best play in years. And while I have not taken in a stage production, I see no reason to disagree with that praise (however faint). But theater and film are wildly different media, and Mamet's movie does not attempt to adapt his work for a new visual language. The film was unsurprisingly shot in under a week, and the only words added to the shooting script may have been “Fade In” and “Fade Out.”

Mamet's loquacious characters have always been most at home on stage because there's no reason to expect them to do anything other than talk. Even the most realistic kitchen sink dramas ever staged aren't true “realism,” because there's always the inherent absurdity of watching live actors whose entire world is confined to a small stage. Mamet never takes advantage of film's capacity to offer a more naturalistic portrayal of human life, and watching two men chew scenery for 20 uninterrupted minutes in an office seems considerably goofier when it's shot in high definition. There's also no reason for so much of the action to take place offscreen. The approach worked for Sophocles (and probably for the stage productions of “Henry Johnson” as well), but what comes across as clever in one format simply seems lazy in another.

“Henry Johnson” offers Mamet fans reason to believe that the playwright still has more to offer us than starry “Glengarry Glenn Ross” revivals and Fox News screeds, and the small ensemble cast all make convincing work of the material. But as a film, Mamet's adaptation should leave you with little more than a desire to see the play. 

 










“Henry Johnson” opens at the Aero Theatre in Los Angeles and becomes available on VOD on Friday, May 9, with more theatrical markets added throughout May.

He's dodged bullets in action movies like “Furious 7” and left viewers swooning in many Hallmark rom-coms. But for the last three months, actor John Brotherton has stepped into the role of real-life superhero in Los Angeles, where wildfires burned thousands of homes and businesses to the ground in January 2025, mere miles from where he lives. 

Like most superheroes, though, Brotherton downplays his efforts and doesn't want any credit for all the heavy lifting he's done since tragedy struck. While driving to sort donations for displaced families on in late April, the actor told EntertainmentNOW he simply wants to spread the word that the need for donations and volunteers remains high because “the devastation is so massive.”

Having worked for many years with late actor Paul Walker's foundation, Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), Brotherton knows that after a natural disaster, “everyone kind of plays that superhero right away. It's our instinct to give, give, give, give, give. And then life takes over, and you kind of get back (to) your own stuff.” 

“But the need is constant,” Brotherton said, acknowledging that while he'd been an ambassador for ROWW for a dozen years, having a disaster happen in his own backyard is a different experience. “And I can see now, having now been in the community for a while, the need will probably be here for another two years.” 

A post shared by John Brotherton (@johnbrotherton)

Brotherton and his wife Alison, whom he called “the real hero” in their relationship, have been on the frontlines of ROWW's work in L.A. since the fires began blazing across entire communities, including the hardest-hit Altadena neighborhood and Pacific Palisades. 

The organization collects donated, new merchandise from individuals and companies and matches the items with families who have specifically requested those items, from furniture to clothes to kitchenware. Displaced people — thousands of whom are still living in hotels, apartments or makeshift housing — come to ROWW's “depot” by appointment to receive a curated collection of donations specifically pulled together for them by volunteers, including Brotherton. 

Wearing a Romance University hoodie as he chatted with EntertainmentNOW, Brotherton said Benjamin Ayres' initiative — an online collective of generous Hallmark fans that holds fundraisers for various charities — provided them with a cash infusion of over $7,000 in February, raised in just one week, that allowed them to purchase specific items for families. 

“We were able to spend every dollar exactly where we wanted it to go,” Brotherton marveled. “We bought a bunch of air fryers and air purifiers to put in our curated care packages, and they were such a hit.” 

“With big (nonprofit) organizations, often you give a check, and it's hard to understand exactly where those dollars are going,” Brotherton continued. “They're doing amazing things, but it's like, where does my $100 go? I don't know. This was fun to be able to say, ‘Okay, Ben, you've got a piggy bank of whatever the final number was, and we got to go shopping for exactly what we needed. It's fun to be part of something that I know I can be completely transparent, totally proud of.” 

As families come to ROWW's collection site for individual appointments to receive their care packages, Brotherton said almost all of the recipients wind up crying. 

“For anyone who knows what that's like (to lose your home), it's why we're trying to provide a moment to take a breath,” he said. “Have your needs met, have a conversation, come back if we can fulfill more as your needs unfold — anything from a bed to toothpaste.”

Brotherton told EntertainmentNOW that the need is still great in L.A., but that contributing is easy — whether financially, physically or even through social media. Those who'd like to volunteer in-person in L.A. or in other hard-hit areas of the country where ROWW has deployed response teams, can sign up on their website or send an email to responders@roww.org. 

Financial donations of any amount are always welcome, Brotherton said, because it all adds up, and companies can coordinate donations of merchandise; his “Fuller House” castmate and friend Candace Cameron Bure, provided many items from her clothing line. But for those who'd like to know exactly where their money is going, they can purchase items on ROWW's Amazon wish list for displaced families in L.A., from kitchen utensils to laundry baskets to nonstick cookware. 

“And then, you know, there's also (building) awareness,” Brotherton said, noting how helpful it is when people share ROWW's mission with friends or social media followers. “Sharing on Instagram, that's awesome. Even re-posting a story. There's a million ways that people can give, even if they don't have $1 to spare.”

During the seven years Katy Perry spent as a judge on “American Idol,” she was frequently the focus of online outrage over comments she made or costumes she wore on the show. But since her May 2024 departure, the vitriol has only intensified, from harsh critiques of her new music to backlash over her Blue Origins space flight. 

On April 29, 2025, a week after launching her world tour, Perry thanked fans for defending her “when the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata.” The pop star issued a lengthy response to the online buzz in the comment section of a video posted by several fan accounts that pooled their money to put up a digital billboard in New York's Times Square, celebrating her first week on tour. 

Expressing her gratitude for the bond she has with her fans around the world, Perry told them, “Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me. My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘no one can make you believe something about yourself that you don't already believe about yourself' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it's an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it.”

Perry kicked off her “Lifetimes” world tour in Mexico City on April 23 and has concert dates scheduled through December.  

The Times Square ad created by fan groups dedicated to Perry features white text on a blue background that said, “Congratulations on the opening week of the tour. We are so proud of you and your magical journey. And we love you to the moon and back! Know that you are safe, seen, and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning!”  

The ad was signed by “your worldwide cats,” given that Perry calls her fandom the KatyCats. The post's caption said the ad would be live for 24 hours in Times Square. 

In the comment section, Perry replied by writing, “I'm so grateful for you guys. We're in this beautiful and wild journey together. I can continue to remain true to myself, heart open and honest especially because of our bond. I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year!”

Addressing all the buzz surrounding her, Perry wrote, “When the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.” 

She continued, “What's real is seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth. I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that ♾️” 

“I'm not perfect,” Perry wrote, “and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I'm on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS ♥️”

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

Also on April 29, Perry posted a video of herself playfully greeting and hugging a look-alike fan wearing a costume from her “Play” residency in Las Vegas, who was allowed to join her onstage. 

“Never forget this is the whole point,” she put in text over the video, which also showed a packed arena. 

Perry received harsh criticism online, in the media, and even from some fellow celebrities after her eight-minute trip to space on April 14, as part of an all-female crew that also included “CBS Mornings” anchor Gayle King and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Blue Origins founder Jeff Bezos. Celebs including Olivia Munn and Amy Schumer ridiculed the flight as a publicity stunt, per Variety. 

She was also widely criticized in July 2024 over her first single in four years — “A Woman's World.” The first track and music video from her “143” album failed to climb the charts in the U.S. or Europe, prompting  Rolling Stone to call it a “catastrophic flop” and potentially the “worst comeback song of all time.”

Originally calling it an ode to female empowerment, Katy responded to the criticism on July 15 by calling the video “satire,” according to E! News.

							By 

	Garret K. Woodward



	Canadian singer-songwriter Matt Andersen has an unrelenting work ethic. Since the early 2000s, he's seemingly always been on tour or recording new music. Andersen immediately cites his father, a self-employed tree logger who worked long days in the northern woods of Andersen's native province of New Brunswick.


	“He always told me he wanted to work for himself,” Andersen tells Rolling Stone. “And I always had that in my head.”


	Calling in from his home not far out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the cell service is spotty and scratchy at best. It's a symbol of just how far away Andersen is from not only the United States border, but the southern origins of the music he champions and radiates so beautifully — Delta blues, Memphis soul, and Appalachian folk.


	“A lot of the people who I listened to, who were playing the blues [in Canada,] they learned the blues from the first-generation guys that were coming across and playing the clubs in Toronto,” he says. “And I got to hear the people who listen to them firsthand.”

	











	The culmination of those distinct genres is at the core of Andersen's latest album, The Hammer & The Rose. Recorded in his garage-turned-studio, the 10-song LP is a refreshing, uplifting voice in uncertain times — especially for Canadian musicians, whose access to the U.S. market is being increasingly threatened by President Trump and his tariffs.


	“Darkness calls you to the sea/drags you down to the deep,” Andersen howls in his powerful, soaring baritone vibrato in “Hold on to Me. “When the world's got ahold of you/you can hold on to me.”


	For Andersen, 44, the journey to the here and now has been long, but bountiful. Early on, he found himself at weekly family music jams in his hometown of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick (population: 1,574), gradually learning guitar. By age 14, he finally acquired his own six-string.


	“Music is a big part of the culture there. We didn't do board games, we played music,” Andersen says. “The closest movie theater was across the border, so everything was a trip if we wanted to do something like that. We made our own fun. A lot of times that revolved around music.”

	Held at his grandfather's house every Saturday night, the gatherings were a much-needed way to connect with others and pass the time in a very rural area, especially during the unforgiving winter months of ice, snow, and below-zero temperatures. Even then, Andersen was a sponge for music.

	











	“When I was younger, especially being from a small town, we were at the mercy of whatever was on the radio,” Andersen chuckles. “It was a classic rock and a country station. There wasn't really anything in-between.”


	Andersen had to seek out other influences and musical rabbit holes when it came to the blues and folk, whether it be via the internet in search of guitar tabs for obscure tunes or simply discovering Eric Clapton's seminal 1992 album Unplugged.


	“I got more into the bluesy-folk stuff and just started to branch out,” Andersen says.


	Beyond the daunting nature of touring cross-country in Canada, there's also been the invisible line of breaking into America as an artist from above the border. In a credit to his father's work ethic again, Andersen has been able to overcome those obstacles.


	“The things that would make most people tired are the things that get me pumped up,” Andersen says. “Playing one end of the country and going to the other end the next night? I just love that. It's places I would never go without my guitar. To get to wake up and play music is still amazing.”

	A lot of that gumption comes from Andersen's love of traveling and bringing his music to new towns. That, and the “hell or high water” ethos he's always emphasized in his work, where it doesn't matter where the road takes him, so long as he gets to play for someone, somewhere.


	“Growing up, making a living [as a musician] wasn't really something you can see. I might as well be an astronaut,” Andersen says.


	Much like his famed Canadian songwriting heroes — Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Gord Downie, among them — Andersen distills the essence of life in the vastness of the country in songs about love, friendship, and passion.


	“[With songwriting], you can kind of tell where people are from,” Andersen says. “It's almost like an accent — how you talk, how you write. With my writing, local colloquialisms work their way in.”


	Once he hit the touring circuits, Andersen became a notable force up and down the highways and backcountry roads of greater North America. Averaging 200 shows a year, he found himself accepted into sacred American blues circles, soon touring and performing alongside the Tedeschi Trucks Band, Buddy Guy, and Bo Diddley.


	“My grandfather loved to play, and he always thought as long as somebody wanted to listen, somebody could play,” Andersen says. “I always kept that with me when I was starting out playing rooms with two or three people [in attendance].”

	











The Hammer & The Rose culminates in an ode to Andersen's father, who's now 77. Titled “Always Be Your Son,” the poignant melody gives thanks to a man who has believed in his child's talents since day one — the ultimate fuel to the fire of one's intent within the creative realms.

	“You'd tell me every morning/‘time to rise and greet the day,'” Andersen sings. “You said, ‘Give an honest effort,' and sent me on my way/with mum beside you crying, that was all you had to say.”


	“He was the first one to help me co-sign for my vehicle so I could tour, the first one to help me get a PA system,” Andersen says on his father. “As we've gotten older, it's less father and son, and more friends. I like that idea [he instilled in me] that you get out of it what you put into it. It keeps me motivated.”

The singer gave his first interview about his diagnosis after first sharing he'd had a tumor removed in January 2024.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	More than a year after revealing that he had undergone surgery to remove a tumor from his brain, Michael Bolton is opening up about his cancer battle at length for the first time.


	Speaking to People for a cover story with his family published Wednesday (April 30), the 72-year-old icon shared new details about being diagnosed with glioblastoma — an aggressive form of cancer that “starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord” and “can invade and destroy healthy tissue,” according to Mayo Clinic — in December 2023. After receiving the diagnosis, he quickly underwent surgery, something he shared with fans while announcing that he'd be postponing his upcoming concerts in a January 2024 Instagram post.

	











	Fortunately, Bolton's doctors were able to remove the tumor in its entirety during surgery, and after a second brain surgery in January 2024 to treat an infection — plus a combination of radiation and chemotherapy — the musician has had no new tumors as of early April, when he had his last scan. But the road ahead will still be challenging, with Bolton now undergoing MRIs every two months to stay vigilant against glioblastoma's high recurrence rate. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Fifteen months after surgery, Bolton reflects, “You're reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought.”


	“Succumbing to the challenge is not an option,” he added to the publication, which noted that Bolton's short-term memory, speech and mobility have suffered as a result of his treatments. “You're really quickly drawn into a duel. I guess that's the way you find out what you're made of.”


	Amid the life-changing experience, Bolton says he's been redefining his definition of legacy. Rather than thinking about it in terms of his career — which includes two Grammys, 19 Billboard Hot 100 hits and two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 — the “How Am I Supposed to Live Without You” vocalist is now choosing to focus on what he's leaving behind for his family. 


	“How do I give things that they can take forward?” he told People. “Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give [them] — I want to be on the right side of that so they feel great about who they are. It's a reality of mortality. Suddenly a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?'”

	











	“I want to keep going. I feel there's still a lot to do on the fight side,” added Bolton, who has deliberately not received a prognosis to keep his hopes high. “I got a title for a song: ‘Ain't Going Down Without a Fight.'”


	Also featured in the cover story were the musician's daughters Isa, Taryn and Holly, who remembered how their dad started singing in his hospital room just minutes after waking up from surgery. Bolton and his family — which also includes six grandchildren — posed together in a photo for the piece, which Bolton shared on Instagram Wednesday and wrote, “My hope in sharing this part of my journey is that it might offer comfort to other families facing similar challenges, and perhaps even inspire those navigating their own adversity.”


	“I also want to thank all of you for the love, support, and patience you've shown over this past year,” he added. “I've drawn strength from your encouragement, and I continue to draw strength from it every day as I move forward on this journey.”


	The interview marks the first time Bolton has shared an in-depth update on his health. In March 2024, he simply wrote on Instagram, “I am healing well and doing better every day,” adding that he was “enjoying the company of my daughters and grandkids during this time at home and practicing on my putting green whenever it's not raining!”


	The following May, he announced that his postponed Greatest Hits Live concert at the O2 Arena in London would be rescheduled for July 5 this year. “Thank you all for your continued support during my recovery!” he wrote at the time. “Although I wanted to be there sooner I'm so looking forward to spending a special evening together at the O2 London next summer!!!”

Paapa Essiedu, who is set to star in the HBO “Harry Potter” series, has made a public statement in support of trans, non-binary, and intersex communities. Essiedu signed an open letter calling for film and TV industry action to protect trans rights after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that gender is defined by biological sex. That action goes directly against Essiedu's producer, J.K. Rowling, who created the “Harry Potter” franchise and is producing the Max series. 

In addition to Essiedu, stars Harris Dickinson, Nicola Coughlan, Bella Ramsey, Jack Rooke, Faye Marsay, Kate Herron, director Molly Manning Walker, and more than 400 other filmmakers supported the open letter, which was first circulated by Motive Pictures producer Sid Strickland and script editor Jack Casey. The letter asks organizations such as BAFTA, BFI, Directors U.K., Picturehouse, BBC, Writers Guild, and Channel 4 to commit to protecting trans people.

“We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 17,” the letter, as circulated by Deadline, reads. “The Supreme Court's ruling that, under the Equality Act, ‘woman' is defined by biological sex, states that ‘the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man'. We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the U.K. Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history […] We wish to add our voices to the 2000+ signatories of the Open Letter from U.K. Writers to the Trans Community published last week and call upon members of our industry and cultural bodies to join us.” 

Read the full letter here.

The U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously on April 17 that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. Public spaces such as restaurants, theaters, shops, and hospitals will no longer allow trans women to use the women's restrooms, as stated by the Equalities & Human Rights Commission guidance. 

Of course, notorious TERF-er (and Essiedu's soon to be collaborator) Rowling celebrated the ruling on social media. “‘Womanhood' is not some quasi-mystical state into which men can identify. Pretending it is makes both studying the harms done to actual women, and enforcing women's rights, impossible,” Rowling wrote. “A straight man who likes wearing stockings is not a lesbian. Wanting breasts doesn't make a teenaged boy a girl. Both are male, and giving them access to women's single-sex spaces has caused proven harm to women and girls. How does taking away single-sex spaces away from vulnerable women advance feminism? How did three men occupying the medal podium at a women's sporting event help female athletes? You cannot describe what you're too frightened to admit. You cannot defend what you can't define. The last decade has seen a wholesale attack on the rights our foremothers fought for. It continues to astound me that privileged young women who've benefited from those advances all their lives are proudly urging on the dismantling of the protections and spaces that were so hard won, and pretending this is progressive.”

 










HBO CEO Casey Bloys previously said that Rowling was “fairly involved in the process of selecting the writer and director” for the series and that she also gave her “opinions on casting.” He added that Rowling's anti-trans statements “haven't affected the casting or hiring of writers or production staff” for the series.

John Lithgow, who also will star in the “Harry Potter” show, told The Times of London that he did not expect to receive backlash for joining the cast. There too was an open letter directed to Lithgow in particular, titled “Please Walk Away from Harry Potter,” due to Rowling's political views. Lithgow said that “a very good friend who is the mother of a trans child” first gave him the letter; however, he did not reconsider taking the role of Dumbledore because of it. 

“I thought, ‘Why is this a factor at all?' I wonder how JK Rowling has absorbed it,” Lithgow said. “I suppose at a certain point I'll meet her, and I'm curious to talk to her.”

Donald Trump's first 100 days have been the most chaotic and consequential in modern political memory. He has wielded the presidency like a king, seeking to bend America (and, far less successfully, the world) to his will. The result has been about what you'd expect from the first convicted felon and twice-impeached insurrectionist to return to the White House: a reckless campaign of overreach and lawlessness that has strained the federal judiciary, the Constitution, and American democracy itself.Trump has emerged with few legislative accomplishments — the fewest in a president's first 100 days, in fact, since the 1950s. They include a short-term spending bill and a law named for murder victim Laken Riley that strips immigrants of due-process rights — both enabled by Democrats. But as he's taken a hatchet to the government, empowering Elon Musk, the world's richest man and Trump's largest political benefactor, to decimate the federal bureaucracy, eliminating entire agencies, slashing and demoralizing others, while hoovering up Americans' personal data for as yet unclear (but surely not benign) purposes.Trump's 100 days are consequential, but not politically successful. At the 100 day mark he's the least popular president in some 80 years. His chaotic and nasty style of governance has sent his approvals into the toilet. He now finds himself under water even on his signature issue immigration. Trump has spent the days leading up to the milestone melting down over his polling.It hasn't been all bad, though. He did move to get rid of the penny.Below we survey 100 of the most terrifying, corrupt, and otherwise absurd actions that Trump and his administration have taken since he was inaugurated on Jan. 20.

It will be a challenge to find a 2025 film that Josh O'Connor is not in. The “Challengers” breakout star is leading the third “Knives Out” feature (all we know is that he's playing a priest), plus is starring alongside Paul Mescal in “The History Of Sound” and will be in Steven Spielberg's next project about UFOs. First, though, O'Connor is starring in Kelly Reichardt‘s latest, “The Mastermind.” 

The film will debut in competition at Cannes. Oliver Hermanus' “The History Of Sound” will also be in the main competition so O'Connor has two shots at being in a Palme d'Or winner this year.

 










For “The Mastermind,” O'Connor plays JB Mooney, an unemployed carpenter who becomes an aspiring amateur art thief. The only issue is that JB's first big heist goes haywire, leading him to confront his life choices. The film is set in rural Massachusetts in the 1970s. Alana Haim, John Magaro, Hope Davis, Bill Camp, Gaby Hoffmann, Amanda Plummer, Eli Gelb, Cole Doman, Javion Allen, Matthew Maher and Rhenzy Feliz co-star.

Reichardt most recently directed 2022 film “Showing Up” which starred her frequent collaborator Michelle Williams. She has also helmed “First Cow,” “Meek's Cutoff,” and “Wendy and Lucy,” all of which were co-written by Jon Raymond. “The Mastermind” is also Reichardt's third film with actor Magaro. 

Neil Kopp, Anish Savjani, and Vincent Savino of filmscience produce the feature, reuniting with Reichardt. The company has financed all of Reichardt's films since “Old Joy.” “The Mastermind” will be distributed by MUBI in North America, U.K., Ireland, LATAM, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Turkey, and India, with The Match Factory handling international sales. This is the second time MUBI has worked with Reichardt, the first being for “First Cow” in 2021. 

“The Mastermind” is one of six female-directed features debuting in competition at Cannes. The others include Julia Ducournau (“Alpha”), Mascha Schilinski (the buzzy “Sound of Falling,” previously titled “The Doctor Says I'll Be Alright, But I'm Feelin' Blue”), Hafsia Herzi (“La Petite Dernière”), Chie Hayakawa (“Renoir”), and Carla Simón (“Romeria”), among the main competition at the Croisette.

Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks are keeping it in the family after a gruesome murder. The highly-anticipated Prime Video limited series “The Better Sister” brings Alafair Burke's bestselling novel to life with the two actresses leading (and executive producing) the thriller show. 

Biel plays Chloe, a high-profile media executive who seems to have the perfect life with her lawyer husband Adam (Corey Stoll) and teenage son Ethan (Maxwell Acee Donovan). The only stain on Chloe's family is her estranged sister Nicky (Banks), who struggles to stay clean. Yet after Adam is brutally murdered, Chloe realizes she has to have Nicky by her side to solve the case. The official synopsis teases that the “prime suspect sends shockwaves through the family, reuniting the two sisters as they try to untangle a complicated family history to discover the truth behind his death.”

Kim Dickens, Maxwell Acee Donovan, Bobby Naderi, Gabriel Sloyer, Gloria Reuben, Matthew Modine, and Lorraine Toussaint co-star. 

The series will debut with all eight episodes, which are produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Tomorrow Studios (part of ITV Studios). Olivia Milch (“Ocean's 8”) and Regina Corrado (“Mayor of Kingstown”) are the executive producers and co-showrunners. 

Craig Gillespie directs and executive produces with Annie Marter through Fortunate Jack Productions alongside executive producers Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements, and Alissa Bachner through Tomorrow Studios (One Piece). Lead stars Biel and Banks also are EPs, as well as Michelle Purple and Kerry Orent. 

Biel recently starred in Hulu series “Candy” from creators Robin Veith and Nick Antosca, and USA Network anthology series “The Sinner.” She also produced teen mystery “Cruel Summer.” 

“Anytime you're sort of putting on a new hat and exploring your business from a different outlook, there's so much to learn, and there's just so much more you can get out of it. Which is why I love it when directors say that they've taken an acting class, or actors will write as well. I love it when everyone is doing multiple jobs,” Biel told IndieWire about both acting and producing. “What I've learned from a technical standpoint is I really understand how challenging it is to create the schedule, and as an actor, if you're looking at your week or your day, and you're like ‘What? This doesn't make any sense. Why? Why do I have to do this scene, and then I have to change looks, and then I have to go back? This doesn't make sense.' But from the producers' standpoint you're like, ‘Well, there's a location issue, and here's the deal with the locations,' or, ‘An actor has a personal thing they need to get out of,' or whatever it may be.”

 










“The Better Sister” premieres May 29 on Prime Video. Check out the trailer below.

The viral-turned-radio hit expands to also tackle pop, R&B/hip-hop and even Latin airplay charts.

	Trevor Anderson



	Riding a hot streak that has already established her among 2025's buzziest names, Doechii lands a historic win on Billboard's Rhythmic Airplay chart as the first artist to send her first three charting titles as a lead artist to No. 1 on the radio ranking.


	The feat comes as “Anxiety” storms 6-1 to crown the list dated May 3 and was the most played song on U.S. panel-contributing rhythmic radio stations in the tracking week of April 18-24, according to Luminate, a 20% surge from the prior week. Thanks to the boon, “Anxiety” wins the week's Greatest Gainer award, given to the song with the largest increase in play count.

	











	Doechii, Billboard's 2025 Woman of the Year recipient, traces her Rhythmic Airplay achievement to her first No. 1, the one-week champ “What It Is (Block Boy),” featuring Kodak Black, in June 2023. She returned to the summit in March with “Denial Is a River,” which reigned for three weeks, before “Anxiety” completed her third trek to the top spot. As noted, the trio makes Doechii the first act to send her first three entries as a lead artist to No. 1 in the 32-year history of the Rhythmic Airplay chart.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Expanding to include lead and featured credits, Doechii is the third act in the overall club. There, she joins Ashanti, whose first two No. 1s were through featured slots on Ja Rule's “Always on Time” and Fat Joe's “What's Luv?,” before her own chart-topping “Foolish,” all in 2002. The next year, Beyoncé inaugurated her solo career with three Rhythmic Airplay champs — a featured slot on Jay-Z's “'03 Bonnie and Clyde,” and her own “Crazy in Love,” featuring Jay-Z, and “Baby Boy,” featuring Sean Paul.


	Beyond the three aforementioned No. 1s, Doechii has one other Rhythmic Airplay entry in her account, a featured slot on Sleepy Hallow's “A N X I E T Y,” which reached No. 31 in February. That track, from 2019, received a second wind thanks to TikTok-fueled virality, that in turn sparked Doechii's own “Anxiety” single's release.


	Elsewhere, “Anxiety” leaps 10-5 on the Pop Airplay chart with a 21% rally in weekly plays and pushes 15-11 on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart (up 14%), and even debuts on the Latin Airplay chart at No. 50. From the developments at pop, rhythmic and R&B/hip-hop and Latin sectors, “Anxiety” explodes 9-3 on the all-genre Radio Songs chart to 45.9 million in all-format audience for the week, a 24% improvement from 37.1 million in the week prior, and enough to win the Greatest Gainer prize.

	











	“Anxiety,” initially a standalone single, was added to the digital and streaming editions of Doechii's Grammy Award-winning mixtape, Alligator Bites Never Heal, in March. The hit single's inclusion has helped the project break barriers of its own, including its first time in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 this week.

Real Estate have announced a new rarities album. Out this Friday, May 2, The Wee Small Hours will feature B-sides, covers, and previously unreleased songs from the New Jersey band's 14-year tenure with Domino. It includes also Real Estate's renditions of Television's “Days,” the Nerves' “Paper Dolls,” and the Strokes' “Barely Legal.” See the new album's full tracklist below.

“This is something we've talked about doing for a while now,” Real Estate frontman Martin Courtney said in a press statement. “The title comes from the lyrics to an unreleased song we recorded during the Atlas sessions at Wilco's loft in Chicago back in 2013, which in turn references a great Frank Sinatra record. This feels to us like a worthy addition to the catalog and we hope you all love it.”

Real Estate's latest studio album, Daniel, came out in 2024. Today, they've also shared a Micah Welner–directed music video for “Pink Sky,” which opens The Wee Small Hours and previously appeared on the Cardinals at the Window benefit compilation. Watch the video—featuring Martin Courtney dressed as a wizard—below.

Real Estate released their self-titled debut via Woodsist in 2009. They joined Domino in 2011, and the label issued the group's next five studio albums: Days (2011), Atlas (2014), In Mind (2017), The Main Thing (2020), and Daniel.

Metallica will revisit their 1996 album Load with a remastered reissue that includes a “Super Deluxe” edition that clocks in at 30 hours, much of it unreleased music.


	Out June 13 via their Blackened Records, the Load reissue will be released as a remastered 2LP, CD, and cassette, as well as an expanded 3CD version. Both the 2LP and 3CD versions feature the album closer “The Outlaw Torn” unedited for the first time, as time constraints forced the track to be cut short on the original 78-minute-and-59-second-long album.


	Ahead of the reissue's arrival, Metallica shared the lyric video for the remastered version of “Until It Sleeps,” which remains a fixture in the band's setlists:


	However, the real draw is the loaded “Limited-Edition Deluxe Box Set,” which includes, as Metallica said, “the whole kitchen sink.” The 15CD/6LP/4 DVD set boasts the remastered Load on CD and vinyl plus tons of unreleased extras from the Metallica vaults, including one of the band's headlining gigs from the 1996 Lollapalooza, five CDs of “Riffs, Demos, Session Takes, Rough & Alternate Mixes,” a collection of B-sides and rarities, more live shows, soundboard tapes and more. In total, the set houses 245 unreleased songs.

	











	The DVDs feature making-of footage from the studio, plus two European concerts and all the music videos from the era. “All said and done, the Deluxe Box Set delivers a fully loaded (and then some) total runtime of 1839:31!” Metallica calculated.


	“To complete the experience, immerse yourself in memorabilia including a pack of 14 Rorschach Test cards, a Pushead patch, an 11×17 Lollapalooza poster, a Rolling Stone cover reproduction, a 5-pack of guitar/bass picks, lyric sheets, two laminated tour passes, and a deluxe 128-page book filled with unreleased photos and stories from those who were there,” the band added.


	The Load reissue is available to preorder now. Check out the never-ending track list below:

Vicky Krieps, arguably France's Cate Blanchett, is leading the ultimate vacation FOMO film of the year: “Hot Milk.” With a title that begs the question of whether or not its spoilt, the queer drama balances the cream of romance with the sourness of a fraught mother-daughter dynamic. It's Emma Mackey who leads the feature, and is torn between pursuing the allure of a fellow traveler (Krieps) and tending to her ailing mother (Fiona Shaw) while in the seaside town of Almería, Spain. 

The official synopsis reads: “Set in the scorching heat of a Spanish summer, the film follows Rose (Shaw) and her daughter Sofia (Mackey) as they travel to the seaside town of Almería to consult Gómez (Vincent Perez), an enigmatic healer who may hold the key to Rose's mysterious illness, which has led her to now use a wheelchair. But in the sun-drenched town, Sofia, trapped till now by her mother's condition, begins to shed her inhibitions as she is drawn to the magnetic charms of a free spirited traveler, Ingrid (Krieps). Sofia's increased freedom becomes too much for her controlling mother, and as the hot sun beats down, their relationship simmers with pent-up resentments and bitterness, threatening to tear the fragile threads that hold them together.”

Pasty Ferran, Yann Gael, and Vangelis Mourikis also star. 

“Hot Milk” is based on Deborah Levy's 2016 novel. Rebecca Lenkiewicz (“She Said,” “Disobedience”) writes and directs the film, which premiered at Berlin. The film is produced by Christine Langan, Kate Glover, and Giorgos Karnavas. 

The IndieWire review credited cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt with infusing the film with a “sun-stroked detachment” that embodies the sudden relationship between Mackey's Sofia and Krieps' Ingrid. 

IFC Films releases “Hot Milk” in theaters on Friday, June 27. Check out the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

Before the whirlwind, two-hour live episode of “American Idol” got underway on April 28, 2025, judge Luke Bryan took a break from wondering who would make it into the top 10 and focused, instead, on two very special audience members. 

Nine-year-old Adira and 10-year-old Brantley got to meet the country superstar before the show, thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation. According to ABC's “Good Morning America,” the children have both overcome significant medical challenges and have now, incredibly, become the 58th and 59th kids Bryan has granted wishes to during his career.  

As part of World Wish Day on April 29, “GMA” shared footage of Bryan meeting Adira and Brantley, who both told ABC they were huge fans of the country star, singing his songs since they were “little.”

The kids and their families, were treated like superstars as part of Disney's first-ever Week of Wishes, during which dozens of kids are living out their dreams, according to ABC News, from a princess-themed ball at Disney World for 50 families to a child who will meet one of her heroes from Marvel Cinematic Universe.  

Video from GMA showed Adira and Brantley arriving at the “American Idol” studios via a luxury sprinter van and walking around the soundstage with their families, posing for photos. They got to meet some of the contestants, including Kolbi Jordan, Slater Nalley, and Filo — hours before he was eliminated from the show that night. 

Before meeting Bryan, Adira smiled as she told GMA, “I'm pretty excited about it 'cause he's my favorite singer and I know a lot of his songs.”

“I've always liked him my whole life,” Brantley echoed, as GMA shared home videos of the kids dancing and singing along with Bryan's songs. “When I was littler, I would sing a lot of Luke Bryan's songs.”

While the kids were standing on the “blue carpet” where the stars conduct press interviews, Bryan burst onto the scene and they both looked star struck as he got down on his knees to chat with them. He then took them backstage, admitting he'd never brought kids back there before, and showed them where he, Lionel Richie, and Carrie Underwood stand before the wall opens for their grand entrance at the start of each live show.

“These walls come open and then everybody starts screaming,” he told them. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Although GMA did not disclose the Adira and Brantley's specific medical conditions, Make-a-Wish says it grants wishes to children ages two-and-a-half to 18 who've been diagnosed with a critical illness, defined as “a progressive, degenerative or malignant condition that is placing the child's life in jeopardy.”

Ryan Seacrest gave a shout out to Adira and Brantley during the April 28 live show, and said that Disney is the world's largest wish for Make-a-Wish, “granting one wish every hour of every day.” Over the last 45 years, per ABC, the company has granted 165,000 wishes to kids facing serious medical issues.

Bryan also posted some pics on Instagram and wrote, “Backstage at #idol with my new friends from @makeawishamerica. Thankful to have met both of you!”

Underwood is also a big supporter of Make-a-Wish, donating a dollar from every ticket to her Las Vegas residency to the organization, which resulted in presenting them with a check for $236,844 in April, according to the Tennessean. 

On the last night of her residency, April 12, she brought Noel Miller onstage, a woman who'd met Underwood as part of her own Make-a-Wish experience when she was just 12 in 2008. As part of their reunion, Underwood and Miller sang “American Girl” together.

The singer-songwriter was a relative unknown when she signed her first label deal. Now, 15 years later, she returns to relaunched Lost Highway Records a country superstar who fought to make music on her terms, expanding the genre in the process. With a divorce in the rearview and blue skies ahead, she talks to THR about why she wanted to go home again.

	Lori Majewski



	It's a warm, cloudless April Saturday in Tennessee, and right now, Kacey Musgraves' life is a Kacey Musgraves song. The singer-songwriter is driving southbound to rural Williamsport — exactly an hour from her Nashville home — where she'll be going horseback riding and rambling along the river with a few friends.  


	“A good friend of mine has a beautiful farm on hundreds of acres,” she says in her Texas twang. “It's on the Duck River, which is one of the most biologically diverse rivers in the world. It has all these specific species of things that don't exist anywhere else. It's really clean and beautiful, organic and peaceful. My friends and I go out there, bring a picnic and just live our best lives — barefoot, dirty, in the river. It's so fun.”

	Excursions like these have colored her songwriting on tracks like “Space Cowboy,” “Oh What a World,” “Butterflies” and “Cardinal,” and they're good for her mental health, too. “Horses have given me such an outlet for tranquility. It's something that takes me outside of looking at my phone screen,” Musgraves says. “It gets me to look up, look out, breathe oxygen in.”


	It's a day before Easter — and 4/20. There was a time when it'd be a sure bet to think Spacey Kacey would be out there in nature, lighting up in early celebration. But on the title track to last year's Deeper Well, the singer-songwriter admits she “used to wake and bake,” and follows that up with, “I'm getting rid of the habits that I feel are real good at wasting my time.” 


	Last year, a cover story with The Cut suggested she'd quit weed, though today, she laughs at the idea that she's totally sober. “Um, I never said I don't ever partake,” she says. “I just don't wake up and hit a gravity bong the size of my face anymore, which is what I did for a long time. But, hey, more power to whatever suits you.”


	Beyond those idyllic moments out in nature, now over a year removed from Deeper Well, Musgraves is entering a new era in her career that has one of country's most innovative superstars going back to her beginnings. 


	As The Hollywood Reporter can announce, Musgraves is returning to the newly relaunched Lost Highway Records as the famed country label's first signee since Interscope announced the revival a month ago, with Robert Knotts and Jake Gear taking the helm. It's a full-circle moment for Musgraves, who got her start at Lost Highway in 2011 as its final artist signing, before the label folded into Mercury Nashville a year later after respected label head Luke Lewis retired. 

	











	It's a major moment in the country music industry and the latest sign of the coasts' presence in Nashville as country has become one of the hottest genres in the world. To celebrate the occasion, she recorded her own version of “Lost Highway” — the 1949 Hank Williams classic and the label's namesake. The move is a logical fit for Musgraves, who's spent much of her career unafraid of going against the grain of how the Nashville establishment operates. The same could be said of Lost Highway, which cemented its place as a home for nontraditional successes, like 2000's O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack, a multiplatinum selling album that won the Grammy Award for album of the year in 2002.


	“Kacey is exactly the type of artist we are looking for with Lost Highway,” Interscope CEO John Janick tells THR. “We wanted someone who's going to move and shape culture, not follow it. Kacey marches to the beat of her own drum, she does what she feels creatively is exciting and makes sense for her, and she's happy to push boundaries and not conform to what someone tells her to do. That's what Lost Highway was, and that's why we were so attracted to bringing it back.” 


	Speaking exclusively about her label move — over the phone while she drives “on the literal lost highway,” Mugraves quips — the eight-time Grammy winner opens up about where she started, her fight to create music the way she wants, and what the future looks like for herself and for Nashville.

	











You've re-signed with Lost Highway and recorded a version of “Lost Highway” as its theme song. Listening to your straight country cover, I imagine some may see this as your return to traditional country music.


	While some might think of it as a “return,” I want to make it super clear that I never left. It's always been a home base, and it's truly where I'm sonically the most happy. But since the beginning, I've always had an exploratory foot out the door a little bit, allowing myself to infuse all these other genres that speak to me.


Maybe it's not quite right to say you're “going back” — you just won the Grammy for country song of the year. But people have looked to you as an artist who stretches the boundaries of what a country song could be. That said, your “Lost Highway” cover feels much more traditional.


	From the age of 7, 8 years old, I was singing all the country standards and classics: Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Snow, Cindy Walker. It's such a part of me, I can't escape even if I wanted to. 


	And it really feels good to wholeheartedly embrace that sound, because I'm always listening to that kind of thing. There may be a misconception that country music is easy to replicate. When you look at the bones of traditional country — the structure, the sounds, the subject matter — it's not easy to replicate. It comes across as very simple, and the best country music is. 

	











	But it's full of so many layers of heart and real life, real stories. And there's a lot of restraint. Really good traditional country music, there's a lot of space for the lyrics, the story, for the heartbreak and the texture. I really appreciate that about that era of country music. It paints a picture, but it's subtle and it's simple.xx


What was your reaction when you were asked to be the first signee to the new Lost Highway?


	My manager, Jason [Owen], was at my house for dinner, and he asked, “What would you think of doing this?” I was so excited, like, “Absolutely, yes!” It's a no-brainer. It made me very emotional, because it brought back so many memories and an aerial view of looking at all I've gotten to do, all the wonderful people I've gotten to meet, and the songs that have come out of that. (Editor's note: Listen to Musgraves' “Lost Highway” below.)


You were also the last artist to sign to Lost Highway before it folded.


	I have always been such a massive fan of Lost Highway. It was my dream to be signed there. Luke Lewis, whom I adore, signed me. Luke is a true risk-taker, always a champion of the artist. I was devastated when he left. He retired halfway into the making of my first record, and Lost Highway went under the bigger umbrella. So, being asked to be part of the relaunch, it's awesome. 


	There's talk about other creative ventures within this as well, like merch capsules and me helping to shape things outside of my own projects. We're still looking at what that exactly means, but it's a true passion project for me. In this world where there are so many varying degrees of genre, to have a home for artists who are left of center is necessary.

	











Lost Highway was home to a certain type of artist — call it the outlaw: Willie Nelson, Shelby Lynne, Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier.


	I am a huge fan of Mary Gauthier. What a diverse roster, right? Lyle Lovett, Tift Merritt. Ryan Adams — I've always loved his music. Wasn't Morrissey there for a minute?


You're right. Do you think that being in their company helped you to envision your future self as someone who could color outside traditional country's lines?


	Definitely. When you can look at artists who have made it work doing it their own way, not chasing a prior mold, it does give other artists permission to say, “That's what I want to do.” There's a reason people on the creative side and people on the business side traditionally, stereotypically, have rubs: because they are looking through different lenses. 


	It makes sense that when labels basically serve as a bank to fund things, they're going to want the least risk involved. Unfortunately, that doesn't work with creativity, because creativity, at its core, is risky. To have the opportunity to bring something back that honors the relationship between creativity, being unique and risk, we need more of that. I find it so interesting that we point to these artists who were outliers and outlaws, like Willie Nelson. He has had a long-standing struggle with Nashville; he was pissing off a lot of people. Now we all point to him as this icon, a new north star for normal. It takes someone breaking out and doing something different.

	











The same can be said about you. “Follow Your Arrow” embraced cannabis and homosexuality and ruffled a lot of conservative feathers.


	Oh my gosh, it was so controversial. I was told not to [release the song] and all these reasons why. I was nervous, because Luke Lewis had left, Lost Highway had folded, and I was already halfway through making [2013's Same Trailer, Different Park], my first real creative statement to the world. I was just scared [Mercury Nashville] wouldn't accept what I was already putting my heart into. “Arrow” was the last song I turned in for that record.


	It ended up tanking — it was banned by country radio. But I would never trade that for the love and the people it brought to my world. I'm not going to present a watered-down version of myself to be accepted. I'll fucking shovel shit for a living at a horse barn, and I'll be really happy. Or I'll just be a songwriter. Anyway, it ended up working out.


As a vocal ally for the LGBTQ+ community, can you see how “Arrow” helped establish the more inclusive country music scene we're seeing now?


	Yeah. It's funny, though, because I wasn't setting out to be some martyr or freaking rule-breaker. I'm just doing my job as a songwriter. When you look at country music as a genre and where it started, it is really textured, beautiful layers of real stories, heartbreak, things that aren't always easy to talk about. It's stories for the everyday person. And that's what always draws me back to country music: It's there for you, no matter what you're going through.

	











How did you approach recording your version of “Lost Highway?”


	I didn't think it needed some avant-garde reimagining. I wanted to bring it back to life. When I was in the studio, I looked into the genesis of the song, and I was taken aback to find it has real ties to where I'm from. Hank Williams [recorded] the version we know and love, but the songwriter is Leon Payne. 


	The story goes he was attempting to hitchhike from California to Alba, Texas. His mother was sick, and he was trying to get to her. I almost fell out of my chair — Alba is the next town over to the teeny, tiny town I'm from, Golden. Alba has no more than 500 people; I've never heard it referenced anywhere in pop culture. This song is full-circle for me, in terms of where I started and where I am now, my label.


Your take has a nod to old-school Nashville radio. It starts with the sound of someone tuning a lo-fi radio and a DJ introducing you.


	That's my sweet grandpa bringing me onto like a country-music hour. He's 88. He was visiting Nashville and I wanted his voice on this, so we convinced him to get in the vocal booth. He was always one of the biggest champions of my singing and learning traditional country music. It's hard to put into words just how beautiful that is for me. I'll have that forever, you know?

	











	Also, this is kind of interesting. When I was down in Texas, I was at this weird, little junk shop, and they had this rattlesnake tail for sale — a rattler from a real rattlesnake. It sounds like a shaker instrument. I bought it and thought, “I'm going to use this somehow, somewhere.” I'm playing the rattlesnake tail on “Lost Highway.” It's just a little percussive part, but there's a rattlesnake tail on there. Back in the era that this song was written, it was common for folk artists to have rattlesnake tails in their guitars because they thought it would bring good mojo.


Is the more traditional country sound of your “Lost Highway” cover indicative of where you're going next musically?


	I've written a ton of songs already. I love being in a period of time where I'm not rushed by a deadline and have the space to mosey and poke around. I'm not sure yet where it's going to end up. 


	There was Same Trailer, then Pageant Material went even harder in the country direction — it was a love letter to all the classic country I love. Naturally, it felt good for me to explore some other sounds, and I went into Golden Hour territory. Then I went through a divorce and was in a really intense place in my life, and I went in the opposite direction with Star Crossed. With Deeper Well, I swung back in toward my center. 

	











	I've been feeling really good playing around with some more — I want to say “traditional” — but at the same time, there always has to be a modern edge there in some way. There has to be a balance between tradition and future. 


You're now in your Lost Highway era, but you're not quite done with Deeper Well either. You're about to announce international tour dates?


	I'm going to South America, then Asia and Australia. I'm playing Brazil for the first time. I know the energy and the fans there are unlike anywhere else. I'm playing this massive rodeo [São Paulo's Jaguariúna], which is really cool. Rodeo is huge in Brazil. It's been really cool to see the rest of the world come to love country music, because, really, country is more about a mentality and an attitude versus geography. Real country music is based on real emotions all humans have, no matter where you're from.

The new project also boasts duets with Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and Hozier.

	Eighteen months ago, Barbra Streisand released My Name Is Barbra, an anecdote-rich memoir about her 60-plus years of blazing trails in music, film, Broadway, activism and beyond. But the story isn't over. On Wednesday (April 30), the eight-time Grammy winner and five-time Billboard Hot 100 topper announced a new studio album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, is coming out on her longtime label Columbia Records on June 27.


	A sequel to 2014's Billboard 200-topping album Partners (which made her the only artist to have a No. 1 album in six different decades), this new project also features a cross-genre, cross-generational list of duet partners. And some of the names on this tracklist are likely to leave more than a few jaws on the floor.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	There are duets with classic rock royalty, including Sir Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Taylor and Sting (separately); Irish rocker Hozier; Icelandic jazz singer-songwriter Laufey; English crooner Sam Smith; country hitmaker Tim McGraw; Josh Groban, fresh off his celebrated Broadway stint in Sweeney Todd (he also appeared on her 2014 Partners album); and British soul mainstay Seal. Plus, there's a collab with not just one but two vocally dynamic divas – Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande — that is sure to set the Internet aflame when it lands.


	The first taste of the album, Streisand's duet with Hozier, is already here. Listen to their take on Roberta Flack's 1972 Hot 100 No. 1, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” below.


	“Barbra Streisand is one of the most enduring and iconic vocalists of our time, and somebody who defined an era with the sheer force of her voice, her talent, charisma and vision. To be asked to join her on a duet was a huge honor and came as a wonderful and welcome surprise,” Hozier said in a statement. “Ewan MacColl's ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face', made famous by the stunning Roberta Flack recording, has always mystified me. It is, to me, one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. Like so many, I was deeply saddened to hear of her recent passing. Along with the honor I have to sing on this record with Barbra, I hope this duet offers something of a gesture to Roberta Flack's incredible legacy.”

	











	“I've always loved singing duets with gifted artists. They inspire me in unique and different ways…and make our time in the studio a joy,” Streisand said in a statement. “My new album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, gave me the chance to work and play with some of my old friends, label mates, and new artists too. I admire all of them… and I hope that you'll enjoy listening to our collaborations as much as I enjoyed recording with all of my wonderful partners.”


	Check out the full tracklist for The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two below. The album is produced by Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher, with orchestrations provided by William Ross and David Campbell. Streisand and Jay Landers, her longtime A&R executive, are the album's executive producers.

Barbra Streisand‘s upcoming album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, is a collaborative effort that will feature duets with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, James Taylor, Sting, Hozier, Laufey, Sam Smith, Tim McGraw, Josh Groban, Seal, and Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande.


	It arrives in stores on June 27, but Streisand released her first single, “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” featuring Hozier, today.


	“I've always loved singing duets with gifted artists,” Streisand says in a statement. “They inspire me in unique and different ways … and make our time in the studio a joy! My new album gave me the chance to work and play with some of my old friends, label mates, and new artists too. I admire all of them … and I hope that you'll enjoy listening to our collaborations as much as I enjoyed recording with all of my wonderful partners.”


	Streisand and Dylan have never appeared on a song together before. But a 1971 letter from Dylan to his friend Tony Glover surfaced in 2020 that said “Lay Lady Lay” was originally written for Streisand. And in 2016, The New York Times revealed that Dylan saved a 1978 letter from Streisand thanking her for sending flowers, and suggesting they record a song together.

	











	“I was so touched to find out he had saved a note from me,” she wrote in response to The New York Times. “It prompted me to go back into my own archive and retrieve a letter I had saved from him. As I remember it, first he sent me flowers and a lovely note, asking me if I would like to sing with him. In return, I sent him the note that's in his archive, thanking him for the flowers and the invitation. But for whatever reason, it never happened at the time.”

	It's taken 47 years, but the Dylan/Streisand collaboration dreamed up in 1978 is taking the form of a duet on the Thirties pop standard “The Very Thought of You.” (By coincidence, Dylan recorded an original song in 1985 also called “The Very Thought of You.”)

The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two was produced by Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher. It was recorded at the Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, California, and at Abbey Road Studios in London with the London Symphony Orchestra.

	Michael B. Jordan is reacting to Tom Cruise encouraging movie fans to go see Sinners. On Sunday, Cruise posted this photo of himself holding up a movie ticket for Ryan Coogler's Sinners on Instagram. He captioned the pic, “Congratulations Ryan, Michael, and to the entire cast and crew. Must see in a cinema and stay through the end credits.” Jordan reacted by sharing the post in an Instagram story and writing, “nah this crazy…” after a mind-blown emoji.

International Features Editor


EXCLUSIVE: The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey, Babygirl's Harris Dickinson, Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan, The Outrun's Paapa Essiedu and How to Have Sex filmmaker Molly Manning Walker are among more than 400 industry professionals who have signed an open letter calling for industry action on trans rights following the UK Supreme Court ruling on April 17 that defines a woman based on biological sex. 


	The letter, which was started by development producer Sid Strickland of Motive Pictures and script editor Jack Casey, expresses solidarity for the trans, non-binary and intersex communities impacted by the supreme court ruling. The ruling and subsequent Equalities & Human Rights Commission guidance will see trans people excluded from many single-sex facilities, which will have an impact across the industry from sets to cinemas.

	The letter calls on industry bodies and cultural institutions such as Bectu, BAFTA, BFI, Directors UK, Picturehouse, BBC, Writers Guild and Channel 4 to commit to protecting trans people within the industry and their respective organisations.

	“We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 17,” the letter said. “We wish to add our voices to the 2000+ signatories of the Open Letter from UK Writers to the Trans Community published last week and call upon members of our industry and cultural bodies to join us. 


	“The Supreme Court's ruling that, under the Equality Act, ‘woman' is defined by biological sex, states that ‘the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man'. We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the UK.”


	It added: “Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.”


	The letter has acquired more than 400 signatures in 24 hours and has also been signed by talents such as writer Jack Rooke (Big Boys), actor Faye Marsay (Adolescence) and writer-director Kate Herron (The Last of Us). 

	











	Execs from companies such as New Pictures, Sister Pictures, Motive Pictures, Balloon Entertainment, World Productions, Federation Stories, Red Planet Pictures and Objective Fiction have also signed the letter, which can be found here. 


	The UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously earlier this month that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. The guidance now says in places like restaurants, shops and hospitals “trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities.” 


	The ruling continues to divide those who are pro-trans rights and who are in opposition of them. J.K. Rowling, a longtime critic of transgender rights, celebrated the ruling on social media.

Katy Perry has assured fans that she's “ok,” despite a recent barrage of online vitriol that has come her way.


	The singer addressed the recent negativity from online commentators in an Instagram comment on a fan page, expressing her gratitude toward her fans for their ongoing support during what she labels an undoubtedly difficult time.


	“I'm so grateful for you guys. We're in this beautiful and wild journey together,” Perry wrote. “I can continue to remain true to myself, heart open and honest especially because of our bond. I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year!”

	Perry has found herself as something of a lightning rod for negativity in the past few weeks, with much of the discourse related to her spaceflight aboard the Blue Origin NS-31 on April 14.

	











	While the likes of Kesha had been roped into the ongoing drama following an online post that seemingly referenced fast-food chain Wendy's' snarky jab at the “Firework” singer, English musician Lily Allen recently walked back her comments about calling Perry and her spaceflight “out of touch.”

	“There was actually no need for me to bring her name into it, and it was my own internalized misogyny,” Allen said on her Miss Me? podcast. “I've been thinking about it a lot, and it was just completely unnecessary to pile on with her. I disagree with what it was that they did, but she wasn't the only person that did it. She was possibly the most famous and the one that divides people the most.”


	The Instagram post which Perry responded to was a video of a Times Square billboard that congratulated the singer for the opening week of her Liftimes tour, and ostensibly aimed to serve as comfort amidst the online backlash. 


	As Perry continued, she explained that much of her ability to survive the barrage of negative comments has come about through plenty of therapy and personal growth.


	“Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,” she noted. “My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘no one can make you believe something about yourself that you don't already believe about yourself' and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it's an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it. 


	“When the ‘online' world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.”

	











	Perry recently launched her Liftimes tour in Mexico on April 23, with each night also featuring fans being brought onstage during a special request section of the set. “What's real is seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth,” she concluded. “I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that.


	“I'm not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I'm on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS.”


	Perry will bring her Lifetimes tour to the U.S. next week, with a headline date in Houston, TX set to take place on May 7.

Donald Trump has been on quite a press tour around his first 100 days in office, the latest stop of which was a sit-down interview with ABC News that aired tonight. It wasn't always cordial between the president and correspondent Terry Moran — particularly as Moran tried to tell Trump that an obviously edited image of “MS-13” appearing across the knuckles of Kilmar Abrego Garcia was not, in fact, real.


	“On his knuckles he had MS-13,” Trump said of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Trump administration must facilitate his return. Trump and his allies have baselessly tried to cast Abrego Garcia as a terrorist gang member they were justified in expelling from the country without due process (even though the administration itself has admitted in court his deportation was due to an “administrative error”).


	“He had some tattoos that were interpreted that way,” Moran replied.


	Abrego Garcia has four symbols tattooed across his knuckles, and the White House has been circulating an image onto which someone photoshopped — or just superimposed with a basic paint app, really — “MS13,” purporting that it's what Abrego Garcia's actual tattoos represent. Trump even posed with a printout of the photo in the Oval Office.

	











	Trump kept insisting the text overlaid across Abrego Garcia's knuckles were the actual tattoos. “Wait a minute. Terry, Terry, Terry. Don't do that. It says ‘MS13.'”


	“That was photoshopped,” Moran said.


	Trump then started mocking Moran. “That was photoshopped? Terry, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I'd never heard of you, but that's OK,” Trump said. “You're not being very nice.”


	Moran again tried to move to another question, but Trump wasn't having it.


	“Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?”


	“I saw the picture.”


	Moran kept trying to move on — even saying “agree to disagree” — but Trump kept insisting: “No, no: He had ‘MS' as clear as you can be, not ‘interpreted.' This is why people no longer believe the news, because it's fake news.”

	The exchange was emblematic of the Trump administration's unconstitutional deportation agenda, which seems to be predicated on doing anything possible to label immigrants gang members and then banishing them to a Salvadoran prison without due process. When Moran pressed Trump about the apparent illegality of the deportations and the court orders blocking them, the president passed the buck to the Justice Department. “I'll have to ask the lawyers about that,” was a typical response.

	











	Of course, the interview touched on several other lowlights from Trump's second first 100 days. Moran asked the president what he said to people who felt that the president was acting recklessly in his tariff and economic policy, and that they “didn't sign up for this.” 


	Trump replied that the people who voted for him “did sign up for it, actually.” 


	“This is what I campaigned on,” Trump added. “I said that we have been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We were losing $3-5 billion a day on trade.” 


	When asked if he had a message for “small businesses who are saying we can't live two months with these tariffs,” or was willing to offer them a break like his administration did for Apple and other major companies, the president deflected: “Not only Apple. We have $7 to $8 trillion being invested in our country in two months. Biden didn't have that for over a year. I mean, if you look at Biden, nobody was really investing in this country. Everybody was ripping off our country.”

	There was tension between Trump and Moran for most of the interview.


	When Moran asked Trump whether he had “100 percent confidence” in Pete Hegseth, his scandal-plagued defense secretary, the president replied, “I don't have 100 percent confidence in anything,” adding that it was a “stupid question” and that he doesn't even have “100 percent confidence that we're going to finish this interview.”

	From the Slums of Beverly Hills to the heart of Silicon Valley: actress, writer, and director Natasha Lyonne isn't shying away from artificial intelligence, even as fellow creatives in Hollywood fret over what the tech means for their industry.


	As revealed by The Hollywood Reporter, Lyonne is teaming up with The OA co-creator Brit Marling and virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier on a sci-fi film called Uncanny Valley. The movie will include AI-generated visuals from Asteria, a self-described “artist-led generative AI film and animation studio” co-founded by Lyonne and her partner, the filmmaker and entrepreneur Bryn Mooser. Asteria and its partner Moonvalley AI recently debuted the video model Marey, which they tout as “clean and ethical” because it was trained only on licensed content, whereas similar models have scraped publicly available or copyrighted material without permission.


Uncanny Valley, co-written by Lyonne and Marling, co-stars both actresses, with Lyonne making her feature directorial debut. It follows Mila, a teenage girl who becomes immersed in an open-world augmented reality video game, with the boundaries between physical and digital realities increasingly blurred. In a statement, Lyonne described working on the project with Marling as if “Dianne Wiest and Diane Keaton, at their loquacious best, decided to take a journey through The Matrix for sport, only to find themselves holding up an architectural blueprint.” It's not yet clear whether the film, which Lyonne has also compared to the films of the Wachowski sisters, who wrote and directed The Matrix, is intended for theatrical release or a streaming platform.

	Presumably, generative AI will figure into sequences involving the game played by Mila. An Asteria representative told The Hollywood Reporter that the movie “will blend traditional storytelling techniques with cutting-edge AI technologies to create a radical new cinematic experience.”


	AI has been a fractious issue across the entertainment industry and was a major sticking point in the 2023 Hollywood strikes, which found screenwriters and actors fearful that studios could use it to churn out scripts or insert a movie star's likeness into visual content long after their death. Hundreds of actors, directors, and other film insiders — led by Lyonne — recently signed a letter urging the federal government not to loosen copyright protections preventing AI companies from training their models on a wider pool of writing, visuals, and more.

	But while unions have pushed back on these tools, companies like OpenAI, which in West Hollywood this March staged a festival of shorts made with its text-to-video model Sora, have sought to convince Hollywood of their potential. Some studio executives, meanwhile, are eager to implement such models in their production flows, not least for achieving impressive visual effects with far less human labor.

	All of which makes Uncanny Valley a precarious proposition for Lyonne and her creative team. On the one hand, it sounds like the story aims to comment on the latest innovations in tech while showcasing them, and Asteria has clearly marketed itself as a non-predatory AI company. On the other, the public has a generally negative view of AI, and is far less optimistic about its prospects than those currently working in the field. Among 2024's Oscar favorites, more than one film faced criticism for relying on AI.


	That said, it's anyone's guess whether Hollywood can fend off the machines in the long run, and those who embrace them now may just be adapting to the inevitable. As for Uncanny Valley, audiences will decide for themselves if it represents the future they want to see.

The motion introduced by Councilmember Adrin Nazarian calls for research into “establishing more competitive fee structures” and “streamlining the film permitting review process.”


							By

Labor & Media Reporter


	As the flight of entertainment production work from California accelerates, Los Angeles' film permitting process has come under fire from local advocates as overly onerous and expensive, adding to the cocktail of reasons why productions might leave the state for their shoots. 


	On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously passed a measure that aims to change that. The motion, introduced by Councilmember Adrin Nazarian, calls for various city departments to research new fee structures, potential discounts or fee waivers for public property shoots, different ways to use public safety officers, streamlined film permitting and stage certification procedures and solutions to alleged price-gouging for crew parking and base camp locations.

	It calls for the city's chief legislative analyst and departments including L.A.'s film office, FilmLA, to report back in 30 days with their findings. “We must do our part at the local level to keep production in Los Angeles,” Nazarian wrote in his motion.

	Councilmembers Hugo Soto-Martinez, Nithya Raman, Traci Park, Monica Rodriguez and Imelda Padilla spoke out in support of the measure at Tuesday's City Council meeting. Park, who said one in five people in her district works in the entertainment industry, called the motion “incredibly urgent.” She added, “I couldn't be more concerned about the mass jobs that we are losing out of the city of Los Angeles.”


	As the motion passed the Council on Tuesday, applause broke out in City Hall from attendees who came to support the bill.  


	A number of industry workers spoke up about the challenges that productions face in the city during the public comment period at Tuesday's meeting. ”We need to re-address what we're doing. I think this is a great, major step forward,” Directors Guild of America member Greg Zekowski said. Added the president of IATSE Local 728, Martin Weeks, “Any headwinds for production is causing production to leave Los Angeles and it's causing our members to lose their jobs and have a lack of work, so I urge the council to vote in support.”


	In a statement to THR, FilmLA president Paul Audley said the City Council vote was a “welcome move.” He added, “As we've discussed with Councilmember Nazarian and other City representatives, the City's FilmLA-assisted process for permit coordination is already quite fast. There remains considerable opportunity for improved access to City personnel for permit activity review, as well as making sure City departments are aligned in their support for film production as a matter of economic necessity.” 

	











	During a brief speech before the vote on Tuesday, Nazarian stated that in the mid-1980s, Los Angeles regularly hosted shoots for major tentpole productions; by 2013 no tentpole films were shooting in California. “We've been regressing and losing so much ground,” he stated. “Now we're losing commercials and platforms and miniseries. We can't have this happen.”


	Policymakers have been racing to address the decline in production work following a series of major disruptions: the COVID-19 pandemic, the dual 2023 strikes in entertainment and the larger contraction in the industry.


	At the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom has attempted to tackle the issue of runaway production from California with a proposal to increase the cap on the state's film and television tax credit program to $750 million from $330 million. Various state senators and State Assembly representatives, meanwhile, have backed two bills that aim to expand the kinds of projects that are eligible and to raise the state's subsidy for productions to 35 percent.


	In 2024, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass created an advisory group of industry leaders and issued an executive directive that called for city departments to meet quarterly with industry stakeholders and review and make recommendations for reforming their processes for permitting.


	Nazarian's contention is that the city needs to do more on its end to help its industry workforce and preserve an iconic L.A. business. “Sacramento's got to do what it's got to do, but we can do what we can do here to make sure that we're protecting the very industry that put Los Angeles on the map,” he said at Tuesday's meeting.

Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. The question facing humanity now is not whether we will confront these pressures, but how we will choose to do so.



When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Climate change is increasingly recognized not merely as an environmental crisis but as a threat multiplier, worsening political and economic tensions worldwide. Two factors — water scarcity and mass migration — are poised to completely reshape global conflict dynamics.

Without coordinated global action, these pressures may induce a vicious circle of interlocking issues: destabilization of livelihoods, unprecedented waves of civil unrest and political violence, mass migration and surging border conflicts.



The world is interconnected. A shift in one location will impact another. Fresh water is a resource we all need to survive, and as it dwindles, conflicts can flare. At the same time, rising sea levels and soaring temperatures will make many cities and huge swathes of land uninhabitable. Put together, these human-induced changes will lead to the widespread movement of people into countries that are hell-bent on protecting their resources.

In response, governments will likely deploy ever-more sophisticated military technology to protect their own citizens, becoming more insular in the process. Once capitalism is at risk of crumbling, social divides increase, and nations, corporations, or even ultra-wealthy individuals may begin to take matters into their own hands — addressing climate change in a way that benefits them, potentially at the expense of others.

Civilizations first emerged along fertile downstream river valleys — the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates and Indus. Nowadays, upstream states increasingly control the water that downstream populations rely upon — and in a warming world, that could fuel explosive conflicts.

Consider Iraq: The once-rich agricultural areas near Basra have become increasingly barren due to upstream Turkish dams and accelerating climate change. This scarcity has heightened tensions between Iraq's diverse regions, including the upstream Kurdistan Regional Government (which has proposed adding 245 dams to the governorate), central Baghdad, and the downstream southern populations near Basra.



Similar conflicts are brewing in the Nile Basin, where Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam has heightened Egypt's anxieties over future water security. While Egypt's recent history of internal unrest has many roots, projected water shortages linked to the dam and increasingly erratic rainfall have amplified fears about food insecurity, unemployment and migration, all of which could compound domestic instability.

As global warming accelerates, it's possible that downstream states may clandestinely carry out or finance acts of ecoterrorism against their upstream neighbors, for instance by destroying dams, as Russia did in Ukraine.

Closer to home, recent tensions between the United States and Mexico over water rights have spilled over into economic policy. President Donald Trump recently threatened sanctions and tariffs against Mexico over disputes related to water treaties involving the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers, which have had dwindling flow in recent years thanks to climate change.

In 2020, conflict began when Mexican government forces sought to release the water in La Boquilla dam in Chihuahua, Mexico, downstream to the United States. They clashed violently with local farmers whose farms would be receiving less water.

As hostilities over water grow, climate-driven migration will also fan the flames of conflict in and between countries. After climate-affected people have exhausted all other options for adapting in place, they may resort first to internal migration and then south-to-north mass migrations that may overwhelm national borders.

Sea-level rise threatens coastal cities worldwide — including Miami, Venice, Lagos, Jakarta and Alexandria — potentially displacing millions of people and intensifying competition over dwindling livable land and resources.

As migration pressures mount, wealthier nations may increasingly militarize their frontiers rather than let in these climate refugees. They are already doing so.

Of course, history reveals the limitations of this approach. Rome's sophisticated border fortifications eventually failed as climate change fueled the in-migration of rival groups like the Huns and Goths. To avoid this fate, modern states are going beyond simply building physical barriers; they are also deploying drones, artificial intelligence surveillance and even autonomous defense systems to keep refugees out.

Border hardening may go hand-in-hand with policy shifts that mean governments only protect the rights of those who can pay. This shift is already underway. The recent proposal for restructuring the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) into the US International Humanitarian Agency explicitly prioritizes American "taxpayers" and companies rather than its citizens, reflecting a broader global trend toward commodifying citizenship.

This trend will worsen inequality, insulating the wealthy from climate change while the poorest suffer.

Effectively addressing these challenges requires strong democratic governance. Democracies that prioritize distributing resources equitably and adapting to climate change are more resilient. Unfortunately, many countries today are backsliding, becoming less democratic and even rolling back climate policies.



The potential collapse of insurance markets due to climate impacts, highlighted recently by Allianz, vividly illustrates what will happen if governments fail to adequately respond to climate change. Günther Thallinger, a member of the insurance giant's board, warned that pretty soon the company won't be able to cover climate risks — an impact that will ricochet through financial services. "The financial sector as we know it ceases to function," he wrote in a LinkedIn post. "And with it, capitalism as we know it ceases to be viable."

When climate risks make large segments of global assets uninsurable — think entire districts or even cities vulnerable to flooding or wildfire — the foundations of capitalism wobble. Without significant political intervention, these pressures will dramatically widen social divides, fueling migration or even revolutionary movements.

The above scenarios could collectively heighten the risk of an often overlooked possibility: one where a single nation or group of nations unilaterally decides to deploy a stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) — a type of geoengineering that, theoretically, reduces the effects of climate change by lowering overall solar radiation entering the atmosphere. However, the effects of such geoengineering strategies on rainfall patterns may inadvertently alter downwind rainfall patterns, or even cause "termination shocks" to temperature when ceased.

—Scientific research is the lifeblood of our economy. Now, a wrecking ball has come.

—The US is squandering the one resource it needs to win the AI race with China — human intelligence

—'It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly': Dismantling USAID leaves the US more exposed to pandemics than ever

Middle-income "buffer zone" countries, like Mexico or Turkey, that may be overwhelmed by a surge of migration, could view an SAI as a way of reducing migration pressure. So, too, might democratic countries whose governments want to take action on climate change but can't find a global policy consensus. Craig Martin, co-director of the International and Comparative Law Center at the Washburn University School of Law, and Scott Moore, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist, have described the SAI scenario as a conceivable cause for war, possibly declared by autocratic or oligarchic nations that are negatively affected, or that are looking for excuses to seize resources or territories.

To prevent this spiraling scenario of violence, economic disruption and political breakdown, we need urgent, proactive international cooperation. In addition to dramatic climate change prevention efforts, we must include legally binding resource-sharing treaties, humane migration frameworks and collaborative adaptation efforts, where richer nations help poorer ones.

Climate change's profound reshaping of conflict dynamics is already underway. The question facing humanity now is not whether we will confront these pressures, but how we will choose to do so: through cooperation and proactive governance or through escalating militarization, inequity and instability. Our collective response today will define the peace and stability of tomorrow's world.

Jacques Vallee, who worked on the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book and was the inspiration for the French scientist in Steven Spielberg's movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, claims there are documented cases of aliens killing people. Vallee is also the first prominent figure to suggest that aliens and UFOs might actually be coming from alternate realities rather than other planets.

“I can tell you that in my files… some of which I contributed to the database of, there are at least half a dozen well-documented cases where the injuries that resulted in death were deliberate,” Vallee said recently.

In 2008, Jacques Vallee worked on a secret UFO study launched by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP). The project was concealed inside a Las Vegas aerospace company.

According to UFO expert and investigative journalist George Knapp, writing for KLAS News, “One focus of the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) was genuinely disturbing: the real-life health consequences for humans who come into contact with UFOs. Hundreds of serious injuries have been documented. AAWSAP investigators traveled to Brazil to obtain government files related to hundreds of Brazilians treated for injuries after being targeted by UFOs. While Vallee won't discuss specific AAWSAP files, except for cases he provided to the database, he said those cases of UFO-related injuries were not accidental.”

Jacques Vallee is an advocate of transparency regarding what is really known about aliens and UFOs, but is concerned that revealing the truth could cause upheaval within world religions and governments.

“If we want to disclose… something as simple as saying, ‘Yes, we acknowledge the phenomenon and it seems to be from space,' we would have to… answer a hundred other questions, that this is not the end of the story,” Vallee wrote in his most recent book, Forbidden Science 6: Scattered Castles. “There are religious questions… there is a religious side to all this.”

As for how we can avoid the potential panic he envisions should the real truth come out? He suggests, “I think… that we should disclose with a structure,” but “the structure hasn't been invented yet.”

One whistleblower has been left fearing for his life after leaking controversial Pentagon documents containing vital UFO and alien-related secrets, yet believes his sacrifice was worth it to report 'the truth'.

Alien hunting has become a favored pastime for many across America, and you can even head to some of the most popular UFO sighting locations if you want to raise the chances of spotting an extraterrestrial creature.

However, what many UFO believers really want is government proof of the existence of alien life, and while astronomers have discovered a planet over 100 light-years away with the potential for life, a recent major leak could indicate that it's reached Earth already.

Former Pentagon officials have already debated and hinted at the existence of UFOs and UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena), but whistleblower Matthew Brown, as reported by the Daily Mail, has now revealed a secret program inside the Pentagon that was supposedly tracking UAPs and other alien-like objects.

He claims in the Immaculate Constellation Field Report that the Executive Branch has been operating and managing UAP programs in secret for several decades, entirely without the oversight of congress.

He says he first came across the information revealed in Immaculate Constellation by accident, as 'clearly misfield' documents were found on a shared server that Brown had access to.

They not only revealed the existence of a program ran by the Executive Brand that congress wasn't aware of, but also former operations which involved 'cloaked' UFOs and global surveillance of UAPs.

Detailing the reason why he decided to breach confidentiality rules and go public as a whistleblower, Brown revealed on Jeremy Corbell's WEAPONIZED podcast:

"Ultimately, my biggest fear is what humanity will do to itself out of fear and greed. We have built a prison around ourselves. It's invisible, but it's not complete, and there is still time to maybe alter our trajectory."

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Corbell added in reference to Brown's decision to release the information: "The time is now... not just to report the truth, but to protect those who will not - or cannot - protect themselves."

Following his whistleblowing actions, Brown has expressed significant concerns surrounding the consequences of his actions, and even has begun to fear for his life - which is part of the reason why he revealed his full identity.

"This is absolutely what I did not want to do," Brown revealed on Corbell's podcast. "I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try and make for a family. My hope is that the stakes are not paid out, but they are life imprisonment and the possibility of execution."

This isn't the first time that national security leaks have seemingly threatened the life of a whistleblower, as the recently released JFK files reveal the strange death of a former CIA agent that had speculated about the president's assassination.

Corbell also detailed the dangers that Brown now faces, adding: "We have had very disturbing personal threats that we take extremely seriously - not just with Matt, but with some of the other whistleblowers who have already recorded with us. This is serious. It's happening."

There are still two additional parts of Brown's testimony to be revealed across the rest of the year, but it's claimed that not enough is being done to protect whistleblowers following the release of information.

STORY: After years of waiting, Amazon has finally launched its Kuiper internet satellites.The tech giant launched its first 27 satellites into low-Earth orbit from Florida on Monday - - kicking off deployment of a broadband-from-space network.It's a big bet that pits it against telecoms providers around the globe as well as Elon Musk's Starlink.These are the first of over 3,200 satellites Amazon plans to launch for Project Kuiper, a $10 billion dollar effort.Like Starlink, Amazon has positioned Kuiper as a boon to rural areas where connectivity is sparse or doesn't exist.The launch of its first satellites, originally planned for early 2024, was delayed by over a year.US regulators want half the satellites launched by the middle of next year, but given delays so far, experts think Amazon might request an extension.Project Kuiper has had a late start in the market for space, which is dominated by Musk's SpaceX.Amazon believes its product and cloud experience will give it an edge over Starlink.Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete, telling Reuters in a January interview, quote:“There's insatiable demand for internet. There's room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well.”Amazon is expected to confirm contact with all the satellites from its Redmond control center within days. The company said it expects to 'begin delivering service to customers later this year' if all goes as planned.

Former Pentagon officials have already debated and hinted at the existence of UFOs and UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena), but whistleblower Matthew Brown, as reported by the Daily Mail, has now revealed a secret program inside the Pentagon that was supposedly tracking UAPs and other alien-like objects.

He claims in the Immaculate Constellation Field Report that the Executive Branch has been operating and managing UAP programs in secret for several decades, entirely without the oversight of congress.

He says he first came across the information revealed in Immaculate Constellation by accident, as 'clearly misfield' documents were found on a shared server that Brown had access to.

They not only revealed the existence of a program ran by the Executive Brand that congress wasn't aware of, but also former operations which involved 'cloaked' UFOs and global surveillance of UAPs.

Detailing the reason why he decided to breach confidentiality rules and go public as a whistleblower, Brown revealed on Jeremy Corbell's WEAPONIZED podcast:

"Ultimately, my biggest fear is what humanity will do to itself out of fear and greed. We have built a prison around ourselves. It's invisible, but it's not complete, and there is still time to maybe alter our trajectory."

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Corbell added in reference to Brown's decision to release the information: "The time is now... not just to report the truth, but to protect those who will not - or cannot - protect themselves."

Following his whistleblowing actions, Brown has expressed significant concerns surrounding the consequences of his actions, and even has begun to fear for his life - which is part of the reason why he revealed his full identity.

"This is absolutely what I did not want to do," Brown revealed on Corbell's podcast. "I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try and make for a family. My hope is that the stakes are not paid out, but they are life imprisonment and the possibility of execution."

This isn't the first time that national security leaks have seemingly threatened the life of a whistleblower, as the recently released JFK files reveal the strange death of a former CIA agent that had speculated about the president's assassination.

Corbell also detailed the dangers that Brown now faces, adding: "We have had very disturbing personal threats that we take extremely seriously - not just with Matt, but with some of the other whistleblowers who have already recorded with us. This is serious. It's happening."

There are still two additional parts of Brown's testimony to be revealed across the rest of the year, but it's claimed that not enough is being done to protect whistleblowers following the release of information.

STORY: After years of waiting, Amazon has finally launched its Kuiper internet satellites.The tech giant launched its first 27 satellites into low-Earth orbit from Florida on Monday - - kicking off deployment of a broadband-from-space network.It's a big bet that pits it against telecoms providers around the globe as well as Elon Musk's Starlink.These are the first of over 3,200 satellites Amazon plans to launch for Project Kuiper, a $10 billion dollar effort.Like Starlink, Amazon has positioned Kuiper as a boon to rural areas where connectivity is sparse or doesn't exist.The launch of its first satellites, originally planned for early 2024, was delayed by over a year.US regulators want half the satellites launched by the middle of next year, but given delays so far, experts think Amazon might request an extension.Project Kuiper has had a late start in the market for space, which is dominated by Musk's SpaceX.Amazon believes its product and cloud experience will give it an edge over Starlink.Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos has voiced confidence that Kuiper can compete, telling Reuters in a January interview, quote:“There's insatiable demand for internet. There's room for lots of winners there. I predict Starlink will continue to be successful, and I predict Kuiper will be successful as well.”Amazon is expected to confirm contact with all the satellites from its Redmond control center within days. The company said it expects to 'begin delivering service to customers later this year' if all goes as planned.

Jensen Ackles shared what we can expect from Showrunner Derek Haas and Prime Video's Countdown and the theme it shares with Supernatural.

Earlier today, we learned that Showrunner Derek Haas (NBC's "Chicago" franchise) and Amazon MGM Studios's Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys)-starring Countdown would unleash its first three episodes on June 25th. When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum, portrayed by Ackles, is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions. Joining Ackles for the series are Eric Dane (Grey's Anatomy, Euphoria), Jessica Camacho (The Flash, Watchmen), Violett Beane (Death and Other Details), Elliot Knight (The Boys), and Uli Latukefu (Young Rock).

 

"There's plenty of action and adventure, but there's also humor and a lot of heart in the show, especially in the way the characters relate to each other," Ackles shared during an interview with Men's Health. "Which feels like it aligns with a lot of the things I've done before. For example, with 'Supernatural,' yes, we were dealing with demons and ghosts, but the heart of the show was the brothers' relationship, that they would die for each other, or for the greater good. I think there's a similar theme here. These are outcast officers that don't necessarily find comfort with their unit; they're renegade mavericks in their departments, and they see themselves within each other. I think the fans will react to that."

"In the wake of 'The Boys,' I signed a deal with Amazon. They wanted to develop something with me in mind, so I had a few meetings with different writers and different kinds of takes for shows," Ackles shared regarding how the series came to be during a previous weekend fan event. "When I met Derek Haas, who created 'Countdown' and has written all 13 scripts, I just clicked with him immediately. He and I actually grew up in the same town; we went to neighboring high schools, so we had a lot in common right off the bat. But he's just a really great storyteller, and he comes from a long line of writing really kind of intense stuff. And so the character that he created, I just felt like I could tell that story in the world that he was also creating. That led to more meetings, and then that led to some outlines. I got to read the first script, and I just really liked where it was going. I liked the kind of world that he was setting it in, and I got excited about it," he added.

Along with being able to connect with the showrunner, the show's universe, and his character, Ackles also appreciated being in on the project at an early stage. "I was fortunate enough to be in a position to do that and be there from the beginning, the genesis of it all, 'cause that's not normal," Ackles explained. "For most actors, everything is kind of already cooked, and then they come in – they get cast in a role that's already happening. I was kind of – not involved creatively, but I was already on the train from the beginning in the station, so that was nice." As for what viewers can expect from Countdown? "There are some twists and turns with this show; there are some big reveals, so to speak. So I'm excited for you guys. I'm excited to get it done – we're about halfway done with the season right now. I think they're shooting for June, probably – release next summer, and I'm excited to see what you guys think and to see it once it's on its feet."
