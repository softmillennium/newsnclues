                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The update should allow for easier controls with your eyes and—for the first time—actual controllers you can port from other headsets, like Sony's PlayStation VR2. It means users no longer have to pinch and drag to look through a web page or PDF. There are additional all-new widgets designed specifically for the Vision Pro. These are designed to be placed against a wall within AR space. Apple is opening up its OS to support more 180- and 360-degree footage from companies like Insta360 and GoPro, which means you may have more access to 3D content than what Apple's willing to share with users. One of the headlining features for the Apple Vision Pro was “Personas,” which were supposed to act as lip-synced 3D avatars for users talking over FaceTime or other supported apps. At launch, these had a waxy, dead-eyed appearance that was equal parts intriguing and off-putting. Currently, the Apple Vision Pro hand-tracking recognizes several gestures for navigating through apps. Most important to daily use has been the pinch, though a bare few apps could also recognize the orientation of your fists as if you were holding onto an invisible steering wheel. This isn't anywhere close to enough for most VR games. This should make it easier to use when you need pinpoint controls, like in drawing apps. Apple suggested this “new class of games” available to AVP will include such heavy hitters as the pickleball simulator Pickle Pro. The introduction of third-party peripheral support could be a big deal—the headset tracks six degrees of freedom (DoF), and with vibration support, it could offer one of the more immersive VR experiences available. It also means we may finally get to experience more ports of other VR games. We can already imagine how nice it would be to get Steam Link working on a Vision Pro to play Half Life: Alyx on the relatively wide field of view with the twin 4K micro-OLED displays. We shouldn't feel too disappointed Apple didn't craft its own first-party controllers; PlayStation's VR2 Sense controllers are a solid option. It's been around for more than a year, and it has improved significantly in the intervening months with every new update for visionOS 2 and onward. Plus, turning your Mac screen into an ultrawide monitor in AR space is both cool and surprisingly useful. Apple has produced numerous short- and long-form content viewable exclusively on the AVP, including a full-length biopic about Bono and small movies like Submerged. But for every bit of passive content that arrives on the platform, there has been a dearth of active content we mostly associate with VR and AR—especially gaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Remains of furniture in the edifice's ten rooms led archaeologists to estimate that it was inhabited from the first to the fourth century CE, and evidence of mosaics and floor heating indicated that the inhabitants were members of a wealthy social class. But it turns out that these spaces were a small part of an even grander dwelling. Archaeologists have revealed that the building excavated almost six decades ago is just a secondary wing of a luxurious 43,056-square-foot villa—one of the largest known Roman villas in modern-day France. The excavation near Auxerre has thus far revealed the complex's residential pars urbana, along with some features that may have belonged to the pars rustica. In a statement by France's National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap), archaeologists suggest the villa was built in two or three stages. Further research will be necessary to determine the building's potential association with ancient Auxerre, known as Autessiodurum, which became a prominent city in the fourth century. By the mid first century BCE, future Roman dictator-for-life Julius Caesar had conquered all of Gaul, a region including most of modern day France and Belgium. Large Roman Gallic villas traditionally had richly developed pars urbana and almost always included private thermal baths. They also usually incorporated fountains, gardens, private sanctuaries, and elaborate interiors featuring marble, frescoes, and mosaics for the enjoyment of their wealthy landowners, who made up the region's political elite. It remains to be seen what further insight the magnificent remains will provide into the lives of Gaul's wealthiest ancient residents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activity on bleach-supporting social media groups is exploding, and influencers are reemerging in an effort to push President Donald Trump's administration to approve bleach as a mainstream treatment. “We are thrilled that RFK Jr. is in charge,” Michelle Herman, who sells a nasal spray containing chlorine dioxide and says she's discussed the topic with Kennedy, tells WIRED. She was pictured, along with other bleach enthusiasts and activists, at the recent Truth Seekers conference held at Trump's Doral resort in Florida. Whatever name it goes by, it has been promoted as a cure for a wide array of ailments since the mid-1990s, and despite prosecutions and warnings from authorities it continues to be popular in many parts of the world. However, in January, during his Senate confirmation hearing, he referenced chlorine dioxide while praising Trump for “looking at all of the different remedies” for Covid, using it as an example of the open-mindedness that Kennedy characterized as a “demonstration of leadership.” Since Kennedy mentioned chlorine dioxide, groups dedicated to chlorine dioxide use on platforms like Telegram and Facebook are filled with new members and increased activity. (Telegram did not respond to a request for comment; Meta said it was reviewing the groups WIRED flagged and would remove any it determines violate the company's policies.) Activists who have spent years fighting to highlight the dangers of chlorine dioxide are now deeply concerned that the Trump administration could seek to approve its use as a cure for a wide variety of ills. “The bleachers are back, making connections with powerful people, reaching RFK and Trump,” says Fiona O'Leary, an Ireland-based activist who has autistic children and has spent years trying to highlight the dangers of toxic bleach solutions being sold as an autism cure. “Bleachers want RFK to approve chlorine dioxide as a treatment for autism, cancer, and other conditions. “Bobby thought they were going to come after him on that,” Kory told the Royce White: Call Me Crazy podcast. “So I basically told Bobby what the real story was on it.” Kory, who has appeared alongside Kennedy multiple times, including at a “Defeat the Mandates” protest in 2022, added that the health secretary “called me his hero; he's my hero.” Kory, who has written about chlorine dioxide repeatedly on his Substack in recent months and is allegedly writing a book entitled War on Chlorine Dioxide, did not respond to a request for comment. Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment about his links to Kory, but the health secretary has praised the doctor on social media, calling him a “brave dissident doctor” and “honest, brave, and sincere.” “I shared that, very similar to the war on ivermectin, the war on chlorine dioxide was the same story … He listened intently, indicated he was not familiar with it, but was nonetheless very intrigued and asked for more information.” Mark Grenon was sentenced to a stint in federal prison in 2023 alongside three of his sons for selling bleach as a cure for Covid. While Grenon initially told a supporter on Facebook that he was “not allowed” to become part of groups promoting chlorine dioxide, he has appeared on numerous podcasts and livestreams in recent months to promote the use of bleach. An individual with the username Mark_Grenon is also now listed as an administrator of Oates' Chlorine Dioxide Testimonies Telegram group, which has more than 30,000 members. In one question-and-answer session hosted on Zoom related to “curing” cancer with chlorine dioxide last week, which was reviewed by WIRED, Grenon told those listening that chlorine dioxide is “growing worldwide.” Grenon hung up on WIRED when contacted last week, saying he doesn't trust any reporters. In a follow-up text message, when asked if he was breaching the conditions of his supervised release, Grenon said his probation officer knew what he was doing, adding, “President Trump has made it very clear that no law enforcement agency can restrict freedom of speech. In the US we are guaranteed that.” (His probation officer did not respond to requests for comment.) Last month, Grenon attended the Truth Seekers conference at Trump's resort, which was filled with bleach enthusiasts and antisemitic conspiracy theorists. Rivera has been living in Mexico in recent years; previously, German authorities investigated accusations that she had caused bodily harm to a child, though no charges were ultimately filed. Andreas Kalcker, another bleach activist, was also at the conference. Kalcker was charged by authorities in Argentina in 2021 following the death of a 5-year-old boy whose parents gave him Kalcker's chlorine dioxide solution with the belief that it would ward off Covid. “While we were both speakers at the same conference in Chicago over a decade ago, I have had no direct relationship or contact with Mr. Kennedy,” Kalcker tells WIRED. For years, a central aim of some chlorine dioxide advocates has been to remove a key warning about chlorine dioxide issued by the US Food and Drug Administration in August 2019, during Trump's first term in office. It was viewed as a significant block to more widespread adoption of the treatment by doctors. “RFK has to rescind that FDA warning against chlorine dioxide,” said Herman during a March livestream on Rumble, an alternative video sharing platform. “News releases on FDA.gov are archived via content lifecycle standards,” Andrew Nixon, director of communications at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), tells WIRED. Nixon tells WIRED that “there is not any new FDA action and the general public health position on [chlorine dioxide] being dangerous has not changed.” Herman did not say whether Kennedy or anyone at HHS had responded to her March email calling for the warning to be removed, and Kennedy did not respond to a WIRED request for comment about the email. “I don't know if it is a website error or if it was purposely removed,” she says of the warning, “but I'll hope for the latter.” “I was genuinely surprised, and as someone from China, I couldn't imagine our own government quietly removing a public warning without any announcement,” Xuewu Liu, who promotes the treatment of cancerous tumors by directly injecting them with chlorine dioxide, tells WIRED. “This quiet removal won't immediately change everything, but it opens a door.” In her livestream interview in March, Herman said she suggested that someone hold a “Make America Healthy Again roundtable” to discuss chlorine dioxide, while getting the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research into chlorine dioxide and setting standards for the toxic solution. More realistically, they will hopefully encourage further evaluations towards such approvals.” “I and other activists, scientists, have been speaking out against this lethal bleach product for more than a decade now,” says O'Leary, the Ireland-based activist. “When chlorine dioxide is ingested, it causes serious, life-threatening illness.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A healthy chunk of corporate America has eagerly embraced AI, betting the tech will bring unrealizable productivity gains. But adoption may be leveling off, according to transaction data from fintech company Ramp. Ramp's AI Index, which estimates the U.S. business adoption rate of AI products by drawing on Ramp's card and bill pay data, leveled off at 41% in May after close to 10 straight months of growth. It only looks at a sample of corporate spend data from around 30,000 companies. Moreover, because the index identifies AI products and services using merchant name and line-item details, it likely misses spend lumped into other cost centers. According to S&P Global, the share of companies abandoning most of their generative AI pilot projects has risen to 42%, up from 17% last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia will utilize different GDDR memory versions on its RTX 50 series graphics cards, just like the Turing generation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Rumors have made it clear that the RTX 5050 might use older GDDR6 memory rather than speedier GDDR7 (or even GDDR6X for that matter). Benchlife.info reports that Nvidia add-in board partners have confirmed the RTX 5050 will use GDDR6 memory from two suppliers, Samsung and SK hynix. Moving to GDDR6 will inevitably improve production costs for the RTX 5050 and improve any potential supply chain issues that might impact GPU production (on the memory side). Having two suppliers (for the RTX 5050) not only boosts the overall number of GDDR6 chips Nvidia can purchase but also helps alleviate any potential supply chain bottlenecks that might occur. Nvidia can bounce between the two manufacturers, relying on one more than the other if one manufacturer can't keep up with orders. GDDR6 has been around for so long that multiple speed bins exist (not even counting GDDR6X), ranging from 12 Gbps, all the way up to 20 Gbps. The entry-level Blackwell GPU will allegedly use a fully enabled GB207 die boasting 2,560 CUDA cores, 20 SMs, and a 128-bit memory interface; if the RTX 5050 were to use 18 Gbps GDDR6, that would translate to 288GB/s of memory bandwidth. Nvidia has created multiple versions of its xx50 class cards in the past, sporting different memory types. The GTX 1650 was one such GPU, which came in a whopping four different trim models during its lifecycle, not even counting the GTX 1650 Super. Nvidia launched the GTX 1650 in 2019 with 8 Gbps GDDR5 memory, then a year later launched an upgraded GTX 1650 with 12 Gbps GDDR6 memory. In addition, the laptop version of the RTX 5050 sports GDDR7 memory, making it even more likely that Nvidia will eventually make a GDDR7 version of its RTX 5050 desktop counterpart. If this happens, we will most likely see a GDDR7 version during Nvidia's RTX 50 series Super refresh, during which the company is rumored to be refreshing at least some of its outgoing Blackwell consumer GPUs with 3GB GDDR7 ICs. If Nvidia extends its Super refresh down to the RTX 5050, the RTX 5050 Super might feature 12GB of 28 Gbps GDDR7. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

He said yes—hence this thread :)If you're a US taxpayer and if you agree that software dev expenses should be deductible like they used to be, please sign this letter to the relevant committee members: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZ....(If you're not a US person, please don't sign the letter, since lawmakers will only listen to feedback from taxpayers and we don't want to dilute the signal. )I'm sure not everyone here agrees with us—HN is a big community, there's no total agreement on anything—but this issue has as close to a community consensus as HN gets, so I think it makes sense to add our voices too.Luther will be around to answer questions and hopefully HN can contribute to getting this done!

If you pay a software engineer, that's not "really" an "expense", regardless of the fact that you paid them.What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case).Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k.So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think "well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation," but in this case software engineers are special and aren't deductible in the same way.In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable.These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. It's a special rule for software engineers.It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules. Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers.

The value of software could be based on something more realistic, like a percentage of actual revenue, but I suppose tech giants would be against that. I'm not sure it's helpful to simplify quite that much, doesn't this usually depend on whether we're talking about operating expenses (typically rent, utilities, salaries, supplies) or capital expenditures (typically buildings, land, intangibles...)? But if you are correct that is supremely dumb, especially in place like US. > (3) Software development> For purposes of this section, any amount paid or incurred in connection with the development of any software shall be treated as a research or experimental expenditure.Strictly speaking every single one of those jobs falls under that role.

So now it's going to be taxed on "profits" of $900K. So it would have to either borrow to pay taxes or raise venture capital, meaning that VC-funded companies would be advantaged over bootstrapped ones!- The letter's goal is to bring things back to how they were (and how they are for all other businesses): let businesses deduct their actual expenses from their actual revenue, and tax that actual profit.I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, this is just my understanding of this issue. - In software businesses, this usually means if you spend $1M in software development to develop a web app, and it makes $1.1M in that year, you'd get taxed on the $100K profits.- However, a few years ago, the IRS stopped allowing the $1M to be deducted in the year it was incurred.

And yes, just because you transform money to something else, then it doesn't mean that you should not be taxed on it.The extreme example is a company that buys gold on the last trading day of the year - now there is no profit! On the first day they sell the gold again and does tax eviction.The core question is to what extend software constitutes an asset or consumption. (Personally, I do not believe that software constitutes an asset in any meaningful way, but a practical tradeoff could be that software is a 10% asset) People running a business can perfectly understand the concept of liquidity.

And it's transferable -- if your company fails, there are companies out there that will buy the rump of your company to realize the unrealized tax refunds.Which is why it's usually fairly straightforward to get a factor loan to pay those $450K in taxes -- it's backed by an asset.Factor loans are usually expensive with a high interest rate.

Or at least should be considered to depreciate rapidly. ), and (3) is valued at the exact cost of all inputs to it, including salaries (uh oh).This is unlike how capital assets are valued for any other industry! And it has the effect that hiring a second lawyer is “cheaper” (for five years anyway) than hiring a second developer. This is unlike how capital assets are valued for any other industry! And it has the effect that hiring a second lawyer is “cheaper” (for five years anyway) than hiring a second developer.

Are any other business processes and elements — e.g. accounting mechanisms, print design, sales funnels — valued this way? An other issue is competitiveness with other jurisdictions that don't have these tax laws, but even if that were normalized there are jurisdictions that are far lower tax in general regardless of the classification. Using salaries as a proxy for value of the asset encourages only the safest shovelware bets, discouraging risk taking lest your asset be taxed at substantially higher than it's worth.Avoiding that risk-adverse dynamic is why Section 174 was written the way it was since the 50s to encourage R&D, and it's paid off in spades.

The same is true for all true R&D, which is why historically the government has tried to provide protections for R&D work to incentivize people to not just churn out the safe bet over and over again. If the goal is to measure retained value, I'd ask how much a competitor would pay to acquire your 5-year-old code (for direct use, not for hacking you) without feeling cheated afterwards. If you start the year with 0$ in your bank. However, because these are software costs, they must be depreciated over 5 years, so only 20% of that $200k software cost can be applied as depreciation cost which is considered an expense. So your net income for this year is $200k revenue - $20k depreciation expense = $180k. Your 15% tax on this is $27k.So you made $200k and spent all of it on software, so your bank account is 0, but you owe $27k in taxes. So you made $200k and spent all of it on software, so your bank account is 0, but you owe $27k in taxes. Appreciate YC and folks like @itsluther pushing this forward. This isn't just a tax issue—it's about keeping innovation and talent thriving in the US. That being said, I do think there's a little sloppiness/dishonesty in what is categorized as "R&D" in the software development. This aspect has always seemed too gray given how much money is at stake in taxes.But again, this complexity is an advantage for larger more established firms with legal departments and the infrastructure in place to document everything in order to handle audits. Which, in my view, is a form of regulatory capture.One potential argument I can see is that maybe this balances out since presumably the more established firms would have less "R&D" as a fraction of expenses to deduct in the first place?

That sounds like a biased explanation, but it's genuinely the truth: it was stuck in the Trump's tax bill to help it evade budget balancing rules, but was designed to be so awful that a future Congress would “surely” repeal it, after the TCJA had passed successfully.

If we need immigrant labor, give them Green Cards instead of precarity. This is counter-intuitive but absolutely the right answer. Giving immigrant employees full bargaining power will murder H1B mills. And no waiting periods in precarious limbo either. If you want an immigrant worker, they automatically get all bargaining power as an American and then you make your decision based on the market forces. This was phrased a bit confusingly, at least to me. Uh oh!> give them Green Cards instead of precarityOh, right, yes! > give them Green Cards instead of precarityOh, right, yes! The Section 174 changes altered the accounting method that software development companies must use for calculating their profit for tax purposes. Starting in 2022 software dev must be treated not as an expense but as an investment in an asset, such that you're now required to amortize the expense over 5 years instead of deducting it from your revenue the year you spent the money.The gigantic problem with this change is that without the ability to expense software development expenses as expenses, a new software startup can very easily be considered profitable in their first year because only 10% of their software development-related expenses get to be counted as expenses.And note that, contrary to what you say, most white-collar work is not treated this way, and software is further singled out from other R&D-type work in that it is the only type of work that is explicitly called out in the section as being required to be marked as R&D. So we're not asking for software to be treated specially, we're asking why it suddenly changed in 2022 to be treated specially in an extremely negative way.

Some examples of white collar work that builds long-lived assets but where the work isn't required to be amortized over long periods of time:- marketing collateral development, unless it is done by engineers- development of standard legal documents like contracts- development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - marketing collateral development, unless it is done by engineers- development of standard legal documents like contracts- development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - development of standard legal documents like contracts- development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance. - developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance.

A new law went into effect that treats software differently. I believe Congress was looking for an easy way to generate extra tax revenue by tapping into the wealth of rich tech giants. Whatever the intent, the workers ended up being the ones who suffer because now hiring people has worse tax consequences than it used to.So all that people want is to undo that, to take away that special rule that applies only to software, and put it back like it was. When you pay people to get work done for a business, that paid work is an expense.You can deduct expenses from your income to calculate your profits.IIRC the problem is that software development is not being classified as an operating expense, now, but rather a "research" capital expense, and the deductions then have to be amortized over a number of years. You can deduct expenses from your income to calculate your profits.IIRC the problem is that software development is not being classified as an operating expense, now, but rather a "research" capital expense, and the deductions then have to be amortized over a number of years. IIRC the problem is that software development is not being classified as an operating expense, now, but rather a "research" capital expense, and the deductions then have to be amortized over a number of years. Company pays staff $Y in compensation to earn that revenue.Company pays other expenses of $Z.Company does not owe tax on $X, but rather on something closer to $X - $Y - $Z. Company pays other expenses of $Z.Company does not owe tax on $X, but rather on something closer to $X - $Y - $Z. If your expenses cover most revenue, you owe little in taxes. With this rule, a particular type of expense (software engineering salaries) is no longer deductible from revenue to calculate taxable income over which taxes are owed. The deduction might carry over to the next few years and eventually (after 6 years) you will reach the same point - assuming your salaries don't go up and your business doesn't grow. I'm not sure why anyone would want the tax code to incentivize a business outcome that all of us would consider failure. The UK eventually put out guidance that business as usual development isn't really "research and development", but afaik there hasn't been a serious crackdown on the practice.It seems kind of absurd to pretend that most work that developers do is pioneering the profession.R&D tax breaks make sense, both to encourage genuine research but also to prevent brain-drain.Not taxing (or tax credits / refunds ) for line-of-business software isn't really excusable.It's bad that the law in the US has been changed in a cliff-edge way though.

The number one problem for startup employees is that the AMT tax makes it impossible to exercise options in a company that is doing well. YC is showing us that they will fight for changes to the tax code when it benefits their bottom line directly, but are silent when it comes to helping startup employees hold onto equity that they have earned.Think carefully before joining a YC startup as an employee. Think carefully before joining a YC startup as an employee. YC was founded more than 20 years ago, and I don't recall any lobbying on the issue of employee tax treatment. Understandably there's an everyone for themselves aspect here, but that makes these kinds of call to actions a bit hollow to me. This tax treatment can increase the cost of a dev by 5-15% which leads to less hiring and a looser job market. Which will impact us even if we're not looking for work because most companies look at market rates when deciding raises. I don't doubt there's an impact here, but it's not because they have a real interest in any other topics that concern me and hiring, H1B and so on. pg used to do this kind of thing on HN from time to time, especially on internet freedom issues, so this is a bit of return-to-roots for the site. SOPA is the one I remember but there were others. That said, here's my perspective on 174 (which should be reverted to full deduction on the year the expense is incurred).You do not have to amortize 100% of your engineering costs. Not even close.Here's the key:  Development costs incurred to remove uncertainty are amortized. In rough strokes, this means discovering all the things you don't know and need to know for this robot arm to become a product. This amount will be amortized over five years under 174.Now, with uncertainty removed, you spend an additional $1.1MM from January until December for engineering implementation. This is 100% deductible that tax year.Analogy: You want to build a new brick wall with specific properties. You do not have to amortize 100% of your engineering costs.

My understanding is that previously, software dev salaries would be counted as a business expense in the year they are paid. Now they are amortized over X years on the tax paperwork. This is especially hard for startups that were “on the edge” of making it. You might be more familiar with the term "salary and benefits".> why should it be tax deductible?Business expenses are tax deductible. Meaning, Trump and friends wanted to suck as much taxes out of software developers as they could before the taxes expired.And the play this time around is the same as last time, only on steroids.If you don't like this policy then the CORRECT thing to do was to not vote for the people that support this policy.Its too late now dummies. If you don't like this policy then the CORRECT thing to do was to not vote for the people that support this policy.Its too late now dummies. I remember he did an anti-SOPA thing on HN which involved some kind of banner at the top of the frontpage. That we happen to call that feedback loop "lobbying", and that the term carries some societal baggage from corporations using/abusing it is unfortunate, but shouldn't be an indictment of what is otherwise a democratic function.Some group FOO with a shared ill should be able to convene about it and petition congress about it. H1B rules around changing jobs means that even if the employee joins at a market-level salary when they come to the US, they tent to stay at the same company much longer and can be exploited. Also, since the tech world tends to use things like stock options / RSUs / monetary bonuses for large parts of compensation package and those do not count towards "salary" you may have a situation where an h1b holder on paper seems to be paid fairly but in practice get only about 40-50% of what their peers get.If they were allowed to change jobs freely they would be able to negotiate their compensation fairly. The companies would be less intensified to hire H1Bs to save money and would also consider local talent for same positions. The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.

So, that said: H-1B shouldn't exist for software. The point of it is to fill jobs that cannot be filled by an American for some reason; a condition that doesn't exist in software development. But find a way to do it that isn't bullshit.</p>

This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged. Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hoping that you'll still be oohing and ahhing over your new Switch 2, Nintendo has a teensy little bit of bad news: the Legend of Zelda movie is being delayed. Taking to Twitter rather than the Nintendo Today app this time, Shigeru Miyamoto released a brief statement confirming that Wes Ball's live-action Zelda movie will now release just over a month later than planned, on May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it… The release date, and now this changed one, is pretty much all we've definitively heard about the Zelda movie since its shock announcement from Nintendo and Sony Pictures back in November 2023. Although recently rumors have begun to swirl about potential casting, so much of just how one of the most beloved gaming series of all time is going to make the leap to live-action (outside of the occasional funky TV ad, that is) remains to be seen. We'll bring you more on Sony and Nintendo's plans for the Zelda movie as and when we learn them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cybersecurity researcher was able to figure out the phone number linked to any Google account, information that is usually not public and is often sensitive, according to the researcher, Google, and 404 Media's own tests. The issue has since been fixed but at the time presented a privacy issue in which even hackers with relatively few resources could have brute forced their way to peoples' personal information. This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. SIM swappers are hackers who take over a target's phone number in order to receive their calls and texts, which in turn can let them break into all manner of accounts. About six hours later, brutecat replied with the correct and full phone number linked to that account. “Essentially, it's bruting the number,” brutecat said of their process. Brute forcing is when a hacker rapidly tries different combinations of digits or characters until finding the ones they're after. Typically that's in the context of finding someone's password, but here brutecat is doing something similar to determine a Google user's phone number. Brutecat said in an email the brute forcing takes around one hour for a U.S. number, or 8 minutes for a UK one. For other countries, it can take less than a minute, they said. Using some custom code, which they detailed in their write up, brutecat then barrages Google with guesses of the phone number until getting a hit. Researcher submissions like this are one of the many ways we're able to quickly find and fix issues for the safety of our users.” Phone numbers are a key piece of information for SIM swappers. But sophisticated SIM swappers have also escalated to targeting massive companies. Some have worked directly with ransomware gangs from Eastern Europe. This could include accounts that store cryptocurrency, or even more damaging, their email, which in turn could grant access to many other accounts. On its website, the FBI recommends people do not publicly advertise their phone number for this reason. Don't advertise your phone number, address, or financial assets, including ownership or investment of cryptocurrency, on social media sites,” the site reads. Initially, Google marked the vulnerability as having a low chance of exploitation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Known for its orange styling and overclocking capabilities, the SOC Force returns with a modern twist When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. First spotted by @unikoshardware on X (Formerly Twitter), the new B850M Force is an M-ATX motherboard with a black PCB splashed with white and orange patterns that expand to the thermal heatsinks and chipset. The B850M Force comes with only two memory DIMM slots, which, in a way, makes sense as one may not get the best stability when installing four RAM sticks instead of two. Speaking of which, Gigabyte lists support for DDR5 memory overclocking up to 9,600MT/s. All three support PCIe Gen 4 speeds, but the topmost slot additionally offers support for PCIe Gen 5 SSD when using the motherboard with a Ryzen 9000 or 7000 series CPU. There are also four SATA ports, if you prefer 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch SSDs/HDDs. 1 x HDMI port, supporting a maximum resolution of 4096x2160@60 Hz - 1 x PCI Express x16 slot, supporting PCIe 4.0 and running at x4 (PCIEX4) Other key features include an X3D Turbo Mode, which is a one-click solution to deliver optimized performance on Ryzen 9000 X3D and non-X3D processors, system debug LEDs, updated BIOS UI with improved features, and an adapter-based Wi-Fi antenna solution if you opt for the Wi-Fi variant of the motherboard. As for the rear I/O, the B850M Force motherboard comes with HDMI and DisplayPort for video out, a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, two USB 2.0/1.1 Type-A ports, an RJ-45 Ethernet jack (2.5G), Wi-Fi antenna connector (Wi-Fi 6E model), and standard 3.5mm audio jacks for audio out, line-in, and microphone input. For some odd reason, Gigabyte has also included a PS/2 port on the motherboard, probably as a throwback to the original SOC Force lineup. Gigabyte is not the only company reviving legacy models, as we recently saw MSI bringing back its Cyclone series of GPUs. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Air fryers are nice, but they take soooooooo long to cook wings. And why can't I bake a pizza? I had precisely zero of these thoughts until last month. That's when the Dome 2 arrived at my doorstep—a king-sized, retro-futuristic air fryer from Silicon Valley kitchen startup Typhur that sorta looks like an alien spaceship as imagined by a little boy in the 1960s. But that shape is maybe fitting: In some ways, this Typhur can feel like the air fryer of the future. I've tested two dozen air fryers in the last six months alone, and the Dome is one of only a couple to offer any particular innovation since Philips rolled out the first air fryers 15 years ago. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I've got a few gripes with the Dome's control panel, granted. It's also a Hoover for counter space, and it costs as much as a cheap laptop. But thanks to an innovative two-burner design and some smart temperature control, the Typhur Dome 2 can cook crispy wings faster than any air fryer I've ever used. And its brushless motor makes it preternaturally quiet, often more hushed than the ambient noise of my house. And a self-clean feature means it's been mostly smoke- and smell-free for the time I've used it. (I still can't decide whether it looks more like a B-movie flying saucer or the head of a cartoon robot.) The 5.6-quart air fryer basket is shallow, but broad enough to lay out a 12-inch pizza or two dozen party wings. This broad basket allows you to spread out food into a single layer across the bottom of the basket, offering even airflow. Which is to say, the Dome leans in hard to exactly what an air fryer does and is, with the main trade-off that it's now very difficult to air-fry a whole chicken. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The temp is also accurate, a rare quality among air fryers. (Instant Pot and Philips also keep accurate temp.) The Dome 2 stays within 10 degrees of target temperature, as measured by a wireless ThermoPro TempSpike Pro ($106) I've found to be accurate for tracking ambient oven temps. The Dome 2's success should maybe be no surprise: Typhur's other main product is a line of wireless thermometers that rank among WIRED's favorites. The fan noise is low enough I don't hear it if I'm standing by the fridge. And smells are likewise shielded: This is now my preferred way to cook bacon, because the grease doesn't smell up the house for hours. Only a few basket fryers have tried out this feature, including a Cosori Dual Blaze ($180) that had a hard time keeping accurate temp during my air fryer testing. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This adds up to two main qualities for the Dome 2: Food cooks fast. Bacon crisps up like the air in Wisconsin. Even truly crappy crinkle fries will do the same. Wings air-fry to done after 14 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, about four minutes faster than other basket fryers. Add two more minutes to fry them “hard,” the way they do it in the wing belt extending from Ohio to the hot wing's birthplace in Buffalo. But especially, the dual burners add versatility. Each of the device's settings now has multiple variables to play with. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Typhur lets you control this the way sophisticated toaster ovens like Breville's do: through settings like “grill” or “broil” that modulate both fan speed and primary heat source. The grill setting combines the crispness of an air fryer with direct heat from the bottom of the basket—meaning I can brown and even lightly grill-char a pair of chicken legs at 450 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to deliciously crispy-fatty skin. This is also how the oven does pizza and pancakes, heating each from below but at a much lower fan setting to avoid drying out the crust or batter. This said, Typhur doesn't make its settings overly easy to parse, except via a recent blog post that still requires a little parsing. But for now, below is a handy chart explaining the various cooking modes. That said, too much fan can dry out the food over time. Fan Speed and Heat Source for Each Cooking Mode on Typhur Dome 2 But you won't get full use out of the Dome 2 unless you pair it to your phone. These range from simple recommendations for bacon, chicken legs, or asparagus to air fryer cakes and cookies, and chicken cordon bleu. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. You'll still have to physically press start on the device, as a safety measure. But many useful functions are app-only, including dehydrate, bake, and roast—plus an added Steak preset. No baking or steaking if the Wi-Fi's down! The basket and griddle grate are coated with PFAS- and PTFE-free ceramic nonstick, and it's pretty easy to wipe clean—but the self-clean, meant for monthly use, is a good backup for the oven interior. Price aside —this Typhur isn't cheap—reliance on the app is one of the main sticking points on an otherwise terrific device. (Though I'd also like more visibility on fan speed and primary burners.)

The T500 was one of the last hurrahs on Gen 4, with read and write transfer speeds that could match and even exceed the performance of popular SSD stalwarts such as Samsung's 990 Pro and Western Digital's SN850X. What makes this T500 deal so good is that it's cheaper than the previously mentioned competition and also comes with an attached heatsink. You can find this deal on the Crucial T500 2TB SSD + Heatsink at Amazon for just $132. If you'd like more information on this SSD, then take a look at our review of the Crucial T500. We put the drive through our suite of benchmarking tests to see how it performs in comparison to the competition. With sequential read/write speeds of 7400/7000 Mbps, the T500 is no slouch and is more than enough for top gaming performance in both PC and PlayStation 5. The popular 2280 M.2 form factor is highly compatible with the majority of motherboards that support an M.2 slot, and thanks to the thin single-sided design, this SSD is also a great fit for devices where space is a premium commodity, such as laptops or the PlayStation 5 console.

The legal battle between Micron and YMTC has taken a new turn as Micron attempts to overturn earlier agreements and court rulings, citing national security concerns. Under those prior rulings, YMTC gained access to 73 pages of Micron's confidential 3D NAND technology documentation, but now Micron wants to reverse that and leave YMTC without such access. While Micron's petition may seem unusual in the digital age, as observed by PatentlyO, there might be a reason behind the move. Micron's arguments claim that the district court ignored key provisions of the protective order and therefore failed to consider national security concerns associated with disclosing sensitive semiconductor information to a Chinese state-supported company that is on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List. In the 2023 case, YMTC alleged that Micron's 3D NAND memory products infringed several of its patents. Discovery proceeded under a jointly agreed-upon protective order that limited access to highly sensitive materials, such as source code, to outside counsel and experts, excluding company employees. "YMTC demanded 10 times more printed pages of source code for Micron's latest-generation chips than it had for earlier-generation chips," a statement by Micron reads. Eventually, YMTC requested 73 printed pages from Micron's '150 Series Traveler Presentation,' containing information about Micron's latest and upcoming 3D NAND devices. Now, while an avid reader of Tom's Hardware is probably fluent with copying via a wide range of means, gaining hardware copies under a protective court order does not mean that one can make copies, at least legally. These are for eyes only — if everyone follows the rules. Under the protective order, only authorized individuals, in this case, YMTC's outside counsel and experts, can handle the originals. In addition, every page is Bates-numbered and tracked; any duplication would be a violation of the protective order and subject to court sanctions, including penalties, adverse rulings, or contempt of court. If YMTC or its legal team were to make unauthorized copies, they would be in serious legal trouble, and there is no evidence they have. Nonetheless, Micron wants this decision to be reversed.
