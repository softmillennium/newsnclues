The US owes Afghans a huge debt, but instead of starting to repair decades of harm, Trump is banning them from the US.

During Donald Trump's first term, the Afghan American community dodged a bullet. This time, we weren't so lucky. The new “Muslim ban 2.0,” the successor to Trump's original Muslim ban, went into effect today, with 12 countries on its list, including Afghanistan.

When President Trump began his second term in office on January 20, he issued an executive order asking for a 60-day review of vetting requirements for certain nationalities. As of 12 a.m. ET on June 9, Afghans are now barred from entering the U.S. This news comes as most of our community celebrates Eid-al-Adha and many Muslims around the world finish the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

While some of this policy is framed as legal language in the name of “national security,” it is clear that this masking was done in an attempt to help the order pass challenges in the courts. Despite its narrow exception for Special Immigrant Visa holders, this policy is clearly a sweeping expression of racism and anti-Muslim prejudice.

Afghanistan isn't merely a Muslim country that happens to be a target of this administration's ire. The U.S.'s role goes back to the 1970s, when the CIA covertly supported and armed the Afghan mujahideen fighting back against the Soviet invasion, part of a Cold War era-proxy war. This was followed by USAID-funded school textbooks in Dari and Pashto produced by the University of Nebraska that taught young Afghan students violence in refugee camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan. Years later, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks and fought a war against elements of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. During this 20-year war, the U.S. funded endemic corruption, backed notorious human rights violators and helped build an aid-reliant government that was essentially a house of cards. The war killed almost 180,000 people and culminated in bringing back a regime in 2021 that has instilled what many now call “gender apartheid.” Afghanistan today is the only country on the planet where women and girls are barred from education past the 6th grade.

This 40-year history means that the U.S. owes Afghans and Afghan Americans a huge debt. Instead of repaying this debt and undoing the harm it has caused over four decades, Muslim ban 2.0 has been yet another deep betrayal and abandonment.

First the U.S. bombed Afghans, then it abandoned Afghans. Now it has barred Afghans.

The decision to ban Afghans will mean that they will be left to fend off a regime that has targeted anyone that has stood alongside the U.S. for 20 years. That is not even to talk about the continued deportations of Afghans by the Pakistani and Iranian governments or the fact that Afghanistan is enduring a humanitarian crisis in which millions of people do not have access to more than one meal a day, a situation caused and exacerbated by U.S. sanctions policy.

According to recent estimates, this ban will impact almost 200,000 Afghans who had a pathway to refuge in the United States as well as 50,000 other Afghans in third countries, where they were encouraged to go by U.S. authorities in 2021 in order to make it to the U.S. This decision also is a de facto partnership with an awful regime that targets, detains, rapes, and extrajudicially kills Afghans, especially ones who are queer, women, or from other marginalized communities like Hazaras.

This ban is not unjust and painful. It is evil, crass, and racist.

This order will deeply impact those who have already arrived since 2021, fleeing the conditions in Afghanistan that made them seek safety here in the first place. Under Operation Allies Welcome, started by the Biden administration, at least 200,000 Afghans have sought safety across the country. They are pillars and leaders of their respective communities, from San Diego to small towns in Vermont. I'd often come across newly arrived Afghan families at major airports, on their anxious new journey to some city somewhere in the U.S. I'd say a quick “salaam,” or “peace be upon you” in Arabic, commonly used by Afghans, and wish them best of luck on their new life here, a journey they were forced to make by U.S. policy and did not choose. While displacement is horrible, there was the beautiful sight of an Afghan speaking my native tongue in random places anywhere I went. Allowing Afghans to seek safety and build a new home, to us, is a form of reparative policy for all the harm the U.S. has caused us over four long decades.

That all now comes to a grinding halt. Families will not be reunited, and people will die. It is guaranteed that others will be targeted, detained, and possibly deported. Afghan women and girls are disproportionately impacted by this new ban, due to the horrid conditions for them in Afghanistan. Some have already been deported under the Trump administration to third countries like Costa Rica or Panama. If an empire like the U.S. — whose power stretches around the world and which brags about being exceptional every day — does not want refugees, why won't it stop waging wars and bombing countries like Afghanistan?

This ban is not unjust and painful. It is evil, crass, and racist. It serves no one, including veterans who've fought to reunite with the Afghans who bled alongside them or the Afghan Americans who are trying to bring back family and other loved ones.

Today is a grim day in U.S. history, and I question if we made the right choice in coming to seek safety in America in the first place. The truth, however, is that the entire world has turned its back on Afghan refugees — and nowhere is safe for us.

Arash Azizzada is an immigrant, Afghan-American filmmaker and community organizer based in Los Angeles, California. He started his activism by leading voter registration campaigns for the Afghan-American community, translating voter guides into Dari and Pashto. While living in Washington, D.C., his work focused on ending the 20-year US-led occupation of Afghanistan and promoting the voices of women and other marginalized groups in Afghanistan as peace talks and reconciliation efforts took shape. Ahead of the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan, he co-founded Afghans for a Better Tomorrow (AFBT), spearheading evacuation and rapid response coordination efforts.

Memo authorising the military to be deployed against anticipated protests is pre-emptive act – a first for the US

LA protests – live updates

The Trump administration's deployment of national guard troops to Los Angeles to intervene in civilian protests in the face of opposition from the Californian governor is a major escalation that risks the politicisation of the US military, armed service veterans are warning.

Former top military figures have told the Guardian that the decision to put up to 2,000 troops under federal control and send them into the streets of LA is a violation of the military's commitment to keep out of domestic politics in all but the most exceptional circumstances. The last time a US president federalised the national guard against the wishes of a state governor was in 1965, when Lyndon Johnson deployed them to protect civil rights marchers in Alabama.

“This is the politicisation of the armed forces,” said Maj Gen Paul Eaton. “It casts the military in a terrible light – it's that man on horseback, who really doesn't want to be there, out in front of American citizens.”

Eaton, who commanded the training of Iraqi troops during the invasion of Iraq, predicted that the LA deployment would lead to the eventual invocation of the Insurrection Act. The 1807 law empowers the president to deploy the full US military against insurrection or armed rebellion.

“We are headed towards the invocation of the Insurrection Act, which will provide a legal basis for inappropriate activity,” he said.

The largely peaceful protests in LA against Trump's deportation efforts have entered their fourth day. National guard troops began arriving in the city on Sunday, with authorisation to protect federal personnel and buildings but not to engage in law enforcement activities.

Trump's move in the absence of a genuine civil emergency has sent alarm through military circles, which have long prided themselves on being above politics. “This deployment was made counter to what the governor wanted, so it seems like a political forcing – a forced use of the military by Trump because he can,” said a retired senior US army officer who requested anonymity in order to preserve their lifelong non-partisanship.

Trump's memo federalising the national guard for deployment in LA is written in sweeping terms, in effect casting it as a nationwide mobilisation. It says that regular military troops, as well as national guard forces, can be employed by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to protect federal functions anywhere in the country where protests are occurring.

Most troublingly, the memo also acts pre-emptively – an action never seen before in the US – authorising the military to be deployed against anticipated protests. It says that troops can be sent to “locations where protest against [federal] functions are occurring, or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments”.

On Sunday, Trump signaled that LA was just the start of a much wider deployment. “We're gonna have troops everywhere,” he said.

Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran who is CEO of Vet Voice Foundation which advocates for veterans and military families participating in American democracy, said that the executive order was an invitation to Hegseth to “mobilise as many troops as he wants anywhere within the US. That's a massive escalation across the country.”

Geoffrey DeWeese, a former US army judge advocate who is now a legal director within the National Institute of Military Justice, expressed concern about how the national guard would be used in LA. Under the memo, they can act as protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, which potentially means that troops could accompany Ice in immigration deportation raids on homes and businesses.

“Ice and the national guard are [both] wearing camouflage, carrying automatic weapons – so how do civilians differentiate them? And what message does it send, when all you see are men and women in uniform, with guns and helmets and goggles and maybe gas masks?”

The military mobilisation that is now unfolding is far from unexpected. Military and constitutional experts who were convened by the law and policy institute the Brennan Center last summer to wargame what Trump might do in a second administration predicted precisely the current train of events.

Trump himself made no attempt to disguise his intentions, repeatedly telling his supporters during last year's election campaign that if re-elected he would use the military against “the enemy within”.

Concerns about the deployment have been heightened by Trump's previous actions which already pointed towards a politicisation of the armed services. In February he fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and several other top brass without giving just cause.

Retired lieutenant general Jeffrey Buchanan, the former commander of the US Army North, said the dismissals also had a politicising effect. “It will lead to Biden's generals, and Trump's generals – or generals who are ‘my guys' and generals who are ‘not my guys'. That erodes confidence in the military, because the people will think that the military are now politicians.”

Buchanan added: “The military's ultimate loyalty is to our constitution, not to a particular leader. We've had plenty of tensions between military leaders and presidents in our history, but we've always maintained this tradition.”

There are also worries about Trump's upcoming military parade to be staged in Washington DC on 14 June to mark the 250th anniversary of the US army. The date happens to coincide with the president's 79th birthday.

“Tanks are rolling into DC, $40m is about to be spent, in a giant function to celebrate one man. That's deeply unAmerican,” said Vet Voice's Goldbeck.

She added that while the military celebrated its birthdays, street parades were avoided “because that is the action of a dictator. This is all in line with how Trump views the military as a tool at his personal disposal, not as a professional fighting force made up of men and women whose oath is to the constitution.”

NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety.”

Hundreds of workers at the National Institutes of Health on Monday openly protested the Trump administration's cuts to the agency and consequences for human lives, writing in a sharply worded letter that its actions are causing “a dramatic reduction in life-saving research.”

In a June 9 letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.”

“For staff across the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we dissent to Administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe,” they said.

The letter is an extraordinary rebuke of the Trump administration's actions against the NIH, which include: terminating hundreds of grants funding scientific and biomedical research; firing more than 1,000 employees this year; and moving to end billions in funds to partner institutions overseas, a move current and former NIH workers say will harm research on rare cancers and infectious diseases, as well as research that aims to minimize tobacco use and related chronic illnesses, among other areas.

Some NIH workers signed their names publicly, openly daring to challenge a president who has sought to purge the government of employees he views as disloyal to him. Others signed anonymously.

“It's about the harm that these policies are having on research participants and American public health, and global public health,” said Jenna Norton, who works at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, one of NIH's 27 institutes. “There are research participants who generously decide to donate their time and literal pieces of their body, with the understanding that that service is going to help advance research for diseases that they are living with and help the next person who comes along with that disease.”

“These policies are preventing us from delivering on the promise we made to them and honoring the commitment that they made, and putting them at risk,” she said.

The workers wrote that they hope Bhattacharya welcomes their criticisms given his vows to prioritize “academic freedom” and to respect dissenting views as leader of the NIH, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Its authors called it the “Bethesda Declaration” — a play on the controversial “Great Barrington Declaration” that Bhattacharya co-authored during the covid-19 pandemic.

Bhattacharya's declaration advocated against lockdown measures and proposed that widespread immunity against covid could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected with the virus and instituting protective measures only for medically vulnerable people. It was criticized at the time by Francis Collins, then-director of the NIH, who called Bhattacharya and his co-authors “fringe epidemiologists,” according to emails the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

In their letter, NIH workers demanded that Bhattacharya restore grants that were “delayed or terminated for political reasons.” Those grants funded a range of projects, including those addressing Alzheimer's disease, ways to boost vaccination rates, and efforts to combat health disparities or health misinformation.

“Academic freedom should not be applied selectively based on political ideology. To achieve political aims, NIH has targeted multiple universities with indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,” the NIH workers wrote.

The funding terminations, they said, “throw away years of hard work and millions of dollars,” “risk participant health,” and “damage hard-earned public trust, counter to your stated goal to improve trust in NIH.”

In an emailed comment, Bhattacharya said, “The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.”

The NIH's nearly $48 billion budget makes it the world's largest public funder of scientific research. Its work has led to countless scientific discoveries that have helped improve health and save lives around the globe. But it hasn't been without controversies, including instances of research misconduct and not effectively monitoring grant awards and the related research.

Researchers and some states have sued NIH and HHS over the grant cuts. An April 3 deposition by NIH official Michelle Bulls said Rachel Riley, a senior adviser at HHS who is part of the Department of Government Efficiency created by executive order, provided NIH officials lists of grants to terminate and language for termination notices. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, led DOGE through May.

Norton has worked at the NIH as a federal employee or contractor for about a decade. She said the current administration's policies are “definitely unethical and very likely illegal,” listing a string of developments  in recent months. They include terminating studies early and putting participating patients at risk because they have had to abruptly stop taking medications, and holding up research that would predominantly or exclusively recruit participants from minority races and ethnicities, who have historically been underrepresented in medical research.

“They're saying that doing studies exclusively on Black Americans to try to develop interventions that work for that population, or interventions that are culturally tailored to Hispanic-Latino populations — that that kind of research can't go forward is extremely problematic,” Norton said. “And, as a matter of fact, studies that over-recruit from white people have been allowed to go forward.”

The NIH workers also demanded that Bhattacharya reinstate workers who were dismissed under recent mass firings and allow research that is done in partnership with institutions in foreign countries “to continue without disruption.” The NIH works with organizations around the globe to combat major public health issues, including types of cancer, tobacco-related illnesses, and HIV.

In addition to the firing of probationary workers, NIH fired 1,200 civil servants as part of a rapid “reduction in force” at federal health agencies. During a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff, a recording of which was obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the decisions about RIFs “happened before I got here. I actually don't have any transparency into how those decisions were made.”

He started at NIH on April 1, the day many workers at NIH and other agencies were told they were fired. Other workers have been fired since Bhattacharya took the helm — nearly all the National Cancer Institute's communications staff were fired in early May, three former employees told KFF Health News.

The letter is the latest salvo in a growing movement by scientists and others against the Trump administration's actions. In addition to in-person protests outside HHS headquarters and elsewhere, some former employees are organizing patients to get involved.

Peter Garrett, who led the National Cancer Institute's communications work, has created an advocacy nonprofit called Patient Action for Cancer Research. The aim is to engage patients “in the conversation and federal funding and science policymaking,” he said in an interview.

His group aims to get patients and their relatives to speak out about how federal cancer research affects them directly, he said — a “guerrilla lobbying” effort to put the issue squarely before members of Congress. Garrett said he retired early from the cancer institute because of concerns about political interference.

Career officials routinely work under both Republican and Democratic presidents. It is par for the course for their priorities and assignments to evolve when a new president, Cabinet secretaries, and other political appointees take over. Usually, those changes occur without much protest.

This time, workers said the upheaval and harm done to the NIH is so extensive that they felt they had no choice but to protest.

In 11 years at NIH, Norton said, “I've never seen anything that comes anywhere near this.”

In the June 9 letter, the workers said, “Many have raised these concerns to NIH leadership, yet we remain pressured to implement harmful measures.”

“It's not about our jobs,” said one NIH worker who signed the letter anonymously. “It is about humanity. It is about the future.”

Israeli forces commandeered the humanitarian aid boat and arrested its 12 passengers.

After a week in Mediterranean waters, Israeli forces put an end to the journey of the Madleen to Gaza, intercepting the aid boat in international waters and arresting its 12 passengers, including the crew and Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg.

The boat, named after Madleen Kullab, a Palestinian fisherwoman from Gaza, had left the port of Catania in eastern Sicily in early June and set sail toward Gaza carrying food and medical supplies in an attempt to break the Israeli siege on the Strip. The mission was organized by the Freedom Flotilla, an international alliance of activist groups that has been organizing similar missions to Gaza since 2008.

In addition to Thunberg, the Madleen's mission included French journalist and filmmaker Yanis Mhamdi, Brazilian activist and Freedom Flotilla member Thiago Avila, Turkish activist Suyab Ordu, Spanish activist Sergio Toribio, French activist Reva Viard, French activist and Freedom Flotilla veteran Pascal Maurieras, French journalist Omar Faiad, Dutch activist and member of the Freedom Flotilla Marco van Rennes, French activist and doctor Baptiste Andre, German activist Yasemin Acar, French-Palestinian member of the European parliament Rima Hassan.

At around 1:30 in the morning local time, only a few dozen miles from Palestinian shores, activists on board the Madleen reported being surrounded by three Israeli military boats, which sounded their sirens at the Madleen. Activists also reported that Israeli drones were dropping an unknown white liquid substance on the boat as they were preparing to encounter an Israeli takeover. At around 2:00 a.m., Israeli troops boarded the boat after surrounding it, taking control of the vessel as activists onboard raised their hands up in the air, shortly before the Madleen lost contact.

Activists had previously recorded video messages calling on people to act and pressure their governments to demand their release in case they were arrested by Israeli forces. The footage was posted online shortly after the interception of the boat.

The Madleen's voyage marks the second attempt in the last month to break Israel's siege of Gaza by sea. In early May, the Freedom Flotilla's boat, the Conscience, was attacked by drones shortly before setting sail from Malta. Organizers said that they suspect Israel was behind the drone attack.

Last week, as the Madleen sailed toward Gaza, activists on board repeatedly warned that they suspected an Israeli attack on the boat. In 2010, Israeli forces assaulted another aid ship, the Mavi Marmara, on a mission to Gaza. The attack resulted in the killing of nine Turkish activists by Israeli forces.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated on Sunday that he had instructed the Israeli army to prevent the Madleen “hate flotilla” from reaching Gaza's shores as the boat sailed near Egyptian waters, and to “take whatever measures are necessary to that end.” Katz directly addressed 22-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg: “To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propaganda spokespeople, I say clearly: you should turn back because you will not reach Gaza.”

In Gaza, Palestinians awaited the arrival of the Madleen, with “little hope that it will be allowed to arrive,” according to Eyad ِAbu Mousa, an engineer at the Gaza Relief Committee, who coordinates efforts between different international aid organizations and was in contact with the passengers of the Madleen until it was commandeered.

“In Gaza, we followed the news of the Madleen every hour, hoping to receive them, but we know too well how the Israeli occupation deals with any attempt to break the siege,” Abu Mousa told Mondoweiss. “In fact, we were concerned about their safety because of previous experiences, like the Mavi Marmara, but the Madleen team told us constantly that they are fully aware of the risk, and that they are prepared to face any scenario,” he pointed out.

“Speaking to them every day, the passengers of the Madleen expressed a very high human sense of responsibility, which we in Gaza admire and appreciate very much,” Abu Mousa continued. “Especially at a time when we feel that the entire world has turned its back on us and accepted the genocide. To know that there are those out there who are not only speaking out for us, but willing to take a risk to break the siege, is beyond words.”

“What we learned from the Madleen crew is that most of the humanitarian aid they had on board is children's formula, in addition to other food items and medical supplies, all of which are desperately needed in Gaza,” Abu Mousa said. “Had they been allowed to reach Gaza, the cargo would have been unloaded and distributed immediately, because the need is so great that people would have already been at the port waiting for the aid, but the quantity is also small and almost symbolic compared to the actual need.” 

“If there were more missions like the Madleen taking place, then maybe some of them could reach Gaza, and the impact would be much greater,” he went on.Early on Monday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Israeli forces had redirected the Madleen to the port of Ashdod and that its passengers would be deported to their countries of origin. As of the time of writing, no news as to the whereabouts of the Madleen has been reported.

Israel has imposed a full siege on Gaza since breaking its ceasefire with Hamas in mid-March and resumed bombing the territory. For the past two weeks, Israel has tasked the shadowy American-run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) with distributing limited amounts of food to Palestinians at specific distribution points, where many aid massacres against starving civilians have taken place. Just last week, 30 Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces opened fire on crowds rushing to obtain food rations, after being forced to walk long distances to reach these remote distribution points.

“The distribution method implemented by the U.S. and Israel is humiliating, inefficient, and clearly is meant to provoke engineered chaos,” Abu Mousa said. “It is aimed at bringing about the collapse of social cohesion among people as they rush to obtain limited daily rations that aren't enough for everybody.”

“It is a death sentence, because Israeli forces always shoot, supposedly to maintain order at the distribution points, and if you don't get shot today while trying to get food for your family, you might get shot tomorrow,” he continued. “It is illogical to continue with this method when we have 400 distribution centers, where UNRWA staff ran the operations efficiently all across the Strip. Never in decades did the chaos that we see now happen.”

“This is why the message of the Madleen activists and all those calling for humanitarian aid to access Gaza freely is so important, and this is why it has to continue,” he stressed.

Move comes ahead of Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where support for Israel has become key issue

Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, signed an executive order this week adopting a controversial definition of antisemitism, as Israel's invasion of Gaza and alleged antisemitism continued to dominate the city's mayoral election.

The mayor signed the order, which requires city agencies to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's description of antisemitism, at a synagogue in Manhattan on Sunday. Adams described antisemitism as “a vile disease that's been spreading across our nation and our city”.

Critics of the definition say it is designed to protect Israel by punishing legitimate criticism. Examples of antisemitism that accompany the formal definition include “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor” and “applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”. The lead author of the definition has spoken out against its use to suppress free speech.

The move comes two weeks ahead of the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where a number of high profile candidates are running against Adams. Support for Israel and the city's Jewish population has become a key issue, with the frontrunners holding starkly different views on Israel's war on Gaza.

Adams, a deeply unpopular first-term mayor whose time in office has been blighted by accusations of accepting bribes, has positioned himself as a staunch defender of Israel as he seeks to win election. He referenced the recent murder of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington and the attack on a crowd of people in Colorado who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza before signing the order.

“Since Hamas' terror attacks on October 7 2023, we have seen this hateful rhetoric become normalized on our campuses, in our communities, and online as antisemitic propaganda far too often masquerades as ‘activism'. When Jewish New Yorkers make up 11% of the population but more than half of all hate crimes, we know this moment demands bold, decisive action to crack down on anti-Jewish hatred,” Adams said.

Antisemitic and Islamophobic violence have risen since the Hamas attack and Israel's response, and Adams has criticized pro-Palestinian demonstrations which have taken place on university campuses and around the city.

Adams was elected as a Democrat, but is running as an independent candidate in this year's election. His main rivals are Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned in 2021 amid accusations of sexual harassment, and Zohran Mamdani, a New York state representative.

In 2021, Orthodox Jewish support helped Adams win the Democratic primary, but with Cuomo, Adams is up against a fellow staunch supporter of Israel. Last year, Cuomo joined Benjamin Netanyahu's legal defense team after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister for alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has long been outspoken on Palestinian rights, has described the situation in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 50,000 people, as “genocide” and said he would have Netanyahu arrested if he came to the city.

Adams signed the executive order at a synagogue in Manhattan on Sunday. He then sat for a discussion with Phil McGraw, a television personality and Trump supporter, about the threat of antisemitism, in which he criticized anti-Israel demonstrations at universities.

Nearly three-quarters of Americans worry that cuts to Medicaid will lead to more adults and children becoming uninsured.

New polling demonstrates that a majority of Americans are concerned about the cuts to Medicaid and other social health programs in President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill, with most believing that the cuts will likely increase their family's health costs.

The KFF poll, published last week, comes shortly after a new analysis by health experts shows that millions will lose their health insurance should the legislative package — which Trump has dubbed a “big, beautiful bill” — become law.

According to the survey, 54 percent of Americans say they are worried that federal spending cuts on Medicaid would negatively impact their family's ability to pay for or obtain health care. A higher proportion of respondents, 72 percent, said they were worried that the proposed spending cuts would lead to more adults and children in the U.S. becoming uninsured, with only 28 percent saying they didn't have those concerns.

Across party lines, Democrats were more likely to express worries about the bill's impact on Americans' access to health care, with 94 percent saying they worried that the spending cuts would lead to more in the country becoming uninsured and only 44 percent of Republicans expressing the same view. However, within those crosstabs of the poll, even 4 in 10 self-identified “MAGA” Republicans expressed those concerns, signaling that a significant segment of Trump's base is concerned about the cuts to Medicaid.

The administration has continuously attempted to alleviate these fears through misleading press releases and public statements. But in a letter sent to a group of senators earlier this month analyzing the impacts of the GOP's reconciliation bill, health experts from Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the legislation would lead to an additional 51,000 deaths in the U.S. each year for the next decade.

That analysis noted that 10.9 million people would lose their health insurance due to the bill's cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The experts also found that an additional 5.1 million people would lose their insurance status due to the bill failing to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans and the Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS) proposed rules to limit the program's enrollment periods, bringing the total of people who could lose their health care due to the bill and other actions by the administration up to 16 million.

Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was among the lawmakers who had requested the independent analysis, decried the administration for pushing a bill that would lead to millions losing their health coverage.

“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said in a statement.

Scores of National Institutes of Health researchers and staffers sign letter criticizing agency policies: ‘We dissent'

In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. “Dissent,” he said, “is the very essence of science.”

That commitment is being put to the test.

On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, a frontal challenge to “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe”.

It says: “We dissent.”

In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, more than 90 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter – and their careers on the line.

They went public in the face of a “culture of fear and suppression” they say Donald Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says.

Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world's premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.

It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12bn and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.

In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.

In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. “Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,” it says, “it wastes $4 million.”

The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya but also sent to the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr and members of Congress who oversee the NIH, was endorsed by 250 anonymous employees of the agency besides the 92 who signed.

Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Senator Angela Alsobrooks to talk about what is happening at the NIH.

At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.

“I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,” Norton told the Associated Press.

The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

His declaration drew together like-minded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive Covid-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.

“He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,” said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.

As chief of the health systems and interventions research branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who have been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. “So much of it is gone – my work,” she said.

The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because “I don't want to be a collaborator” in the political manipulation of biomedical science.

Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. “You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.

“We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,” he added. But that will not happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants.

The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes or the NIH.

Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.

The letter asserts that “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health”.

The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.

This has forced “indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science”, the declaration says.

Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.

A Signal group became the place for participants to sort through NIH chatter on Reddit, discern rumor from reality and offer mutual support. The declaration took shape in that group and as word spread neighbor to neighbor in NIH offices.

The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a linchpin in science.

With that in place, he said in a statement in April: “NIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.”

Now it will be seen whether that is enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.

“There's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,” said Norton, who has three young children. “I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.

“Maybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,” she added. “And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.”

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

A Ukrainian drone attack struck the JSC VNIIR-Progress facility in the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic, causing explosions and massive fires, Russian Telegram news channels reported in the early hours of June 9. 

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed the strike, saying Ukrainian drone units, in coordination with other units, targeted VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro in Cheboksary overnight as part of efforts to degrade Russia's capacity to produce air attack systems.

The targeted facilities are part of Russia's military-industrial complex and produce adaptive Kometa antennas, used in Shahed-type attack drones, planning and correction modules for guided aerial bombs (KAB), and other precision-guided weapons, the General Staff said.

The Ukrainian military confirmed that at least two drones struck the site, causing a large fire. The results of the strike are still being assessed.

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute that specializes in developing electronic warfare (EW) systems, including the Kometa antenna, used to jam satellite, radio, and radar signals. The facility has been sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU.

Oleg Nikolayev, the head of the Chuvashia Republic, claimed that two drones "fell" on the premises of the VNIIR-Progress facility on June 9.

The "responsible decision was made to temporarily suspend production to ensure the safety of employees," he said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. 

In video footage from local residents purporting to show the attack on the facility, smoke and flames can be seen rising over the city of Cheboksary. One video, published by the Russian independent news outlet Astra, shows a drone approaching the target and making impact, causing another explosion. 

VNIIR-Progress is a major research and development institute for Russian EW systems. It produces the Kometa antenna, which Russia uses to make its bombs more accurate and less vulnerable to Ukrainian interference. 

The strike marks the second reported Ukrainian drone attack against Russia's Chuvashia Repbulic. 

Ukraine reportedly attacked the Burevestnik oil refinery in Cheboksary on March 9, in its first reported drone strike in the region. The refinery lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. 

In recent days, Ukraine has launched a number of strikes against military facilities in Russia, including missile bases and airfields. The most audacious and high-profile attack came on June 1, when Ukraine carried out Operation Spiderweb — a mass drone strike that simultaneously targeted four major Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 planes. 

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on June 9 that air defense units had intercepted 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the country. 

Overnight drone strikes reportedly triggered flight restrictions at airports in Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov, and Tambov.

In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. “Dissent,” he said, “is the very essence of science.”

That commitment is being put to the test.

On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, a frontal challenge to “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.”

It says: “We dissent.”

In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter – and their careers on the line. Another 250 of their colleagues across the agency also endorsed the declaration, without using their names.

Opinion: The chaos in America's scientific community could be Canada's gain

The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. 

The White House defended its approach to federal research. “In recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized health care and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,” spokesman Kush Desai said. “The Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science – not ideological activism – as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.”

The signers went public in the face of a “culture of fear and suppression” they say President Donald Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says.

Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world's premier public-health research institution over the course of mere months.

It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.

In one case, an NIH-supported study of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.

In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. “Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,” it says, “it wastes $4 million.”

Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.

At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.

“I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,” Norton told the Associated Press.

The signers said they modelled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October, 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

His declaration drew together like-minded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.

“He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,” said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.

As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. “So much of it is gone – my work,” she said.

The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because “I don't want to be a collaborator” in the political manipulation of biomedical science.

Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. “You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.

“We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,” he added. But that won't happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants.

The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes or the NIH.

Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centres gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.

The letter asserts that “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.”

            President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the US by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.
    


            The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the US and don't hold a valid visa.
    


            The ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all US diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the US even after the ban takes effect.
    


What exactly is Trump's new travel ban about? Not national security



            During Trump's first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy.
    


            No such disruption was immediately discernible at Los Angeles International Airport in the hours after the new ban took effect.
    


            Haitian-American Elvanise Louis-Juste, who was at the airport earlier Sunday in Newark, New Jersey, awaiting a flight to her home state of Florida, said many Haitians wanting to come to the US are simply seeking to escape violence and unrest.
    


            “I have family in Haiti, so it's pretty upsetting to see and hear,” Louis-Juste, 23, said of the travel ban. “I don't think it's a good thing. I think it's very upsetting.”
    


            Many immigration experts say the new ban is more carefully crafted and appears designed to beat court challenges that hampered the first by focusing on the visa application process.

            Trump said this time that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. He relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the US after their visas expired.
    


            Measuring overstay rates has challenged experts for decades, but the government has made a limited attempt annually since 2016. Trump's proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries.
    


            Trump also tied the new ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. US officials say the man charged in the attack overstayed a tourist visa. He is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump's restricted list.
    


            The ban was quickly denounced by groups that provide aid and resettlement help to refugees.
    


            “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a nonprofit international relief organization.
    


            The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban does make exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.
    


            Afghanistan had been one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement his first day in office.

From his so-called ‘Muslim ban' to slashing DEI measures, the US president has turned taboo behaviour into norms

This month marks exactly 10 years since Donald Trump coasted down an escalator at Trump Tower, declared his run for US president and accused Mexico of sending drugs, criminals and rapists into the homeland. The past decade has been exercise in normalising.

When Trump threatened to terminate Elon Musk's government contracts, and Musk linked Trump to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, all because of a petty clash of egos, people were riveted but unsurprised. Likewise, when Trump ordered a travel ban on a dozen countries, many reacted with a collective shrug: well, of course he did.

There was little sign of the collective uprising and airport protests that greeted Trump's so-called “Muslim ban” – an executive order that barred travel to the US for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries – in January 2017. The president's spectacular blow-up with Musk ensured the attention cycle quickly moved on.

Yet travel ban 2.0 is no less pernicious. The proclamation signed by Trump last Wednesday bans the citizens from many of the world's poorest nations, supposedly to protect the US against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.

The countries affected are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The entry of people from seven other countries – Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela – will be partially restricted.

“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,” Trump said.

He cited the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a man tossed a gasoline bomb into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators as an example of why the new curbs are needed.

An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Yet Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits, nor is Syria, whose Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by Trump as a “young, attractive guy” after their recent meeting.

Alex Berrios, a co-founder of Mi Vecino, a community empowerment organisation, and the son of a Cuban immigrant, said: “Trump targeted countries with Black, Brown and Muslim populations. There is no clear national security basis for the ban, but there is a clear pattern of targeting people of color. Latino and immigrant communities recognize this as a racist policy, plain and simple.”

Indeed, the list points to a 78-year-old president who continues to view large swaths of the world as drug-dealers, criminals and rapists, who finds new and ingenious ways to play white identity politics, whose “Make America great again” mantra is coded nostalgia for an era of American apartheid.

In 1973, Trump and his father, Fred, were sued for discriminating against Black applicants by refusing to rent apartments to them in predominantly white buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. The case was settled with no admission of guilt but a requirement that the Trumps change their practices.

In 1989, after five Black and Latino teenagers were accused of assaulting and raping a white jogger in New York's Central Park, Trump took out full-page ads in several newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. The Central Park Five were convicted and later exonerated but even last year Trump continued to assert they were responsible for the crime.

From 2011 to 2016, Trump was a leading proponent of the debunked “birther” theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore was ineligible to be president. After Obama released his birth certificate, Trump admitted the truth but never apologised and continued to refer to Barack “Hussein” Obama.

After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counter-protester was killed, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” and blamed “many sides” for the violence. He later tweeted: “I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!”

In a 2018 White House meeting on immigration, Trump reportedly asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”, referring to Haiti and African nations, and suggested more immigrants from places such as Norway.

During 2020 protests over George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis, Trump sent national guard troops to Washington and deployed federal officers to Portland, Oregon, leading to injuries. He also called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”, linked by critics to a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes.

At last year's National Association of Black Journalists convention, he falsely claimed that Kamala Harris “turned Black” for political gain, questioning the vice-president's heritage. And on the campaign trail, Trump said immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has issued executive orders that aim to restrict or eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He even baselessly blamed DEI for undermining air safety after an army helicopter pilot was involved in a deadly midair collision with a commercial airliner.

With the help of Musk's unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Trump has slashed foreign aid and gutted the development agency USAID, causing death and devastation for people in Africa and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the immigration crackdown has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students and deport others.

The US granted refugee status to around 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”. Trump ambushed South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is Black, with a video that falsely portrayed “burial sites” and articles that included an image of body bags from the Congolese city of Goma.

He has also repeatedly singled out “Congo” in Africa for emptying its prisons and sending criminals to the US. During a meeting last month with Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, he said: “Many, many people come from the Congo. I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo.”

Factcheckers have found no evidence to support this claim. Trump's travel ban includes the Republic of Congo but not the much bigger Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is currently negotiating a minerals deal with Washington. The Republic of Congo said the country's inclusion was a “misunderstanding”.

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, says: “This is just another page from the catalogue of racism, bigotry, hate and white supremacy that Trump flips to and uses as his guide so often.

“He needs to keep putting coins in the rightwing machine because that is what keeps them going. In many ways he has to do this in order to stay true to who he is and his candidacy and Trumpism, because one of the key ingredients of Trumpism is racism, and we've seen that confirmed over and over again.”

After a decade of Trump dominance, none of it comes as a surprise any more. What was once outrageous and taboo is now routine. And that numbness, shifting of the Overton Window and reordering of US political culture may be his most dangerous legacy of all.

H.A. Massey and Company manufactured farm equipment and tools in Ontario factories, before shipping them overseas. The U.S. is the one market it avoided.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

John Turley-Ewart is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail, a regulatory compliance consultant and a Canadian banking historian.

The need to diversify Canadian trade continues. American tariffs on Canadian goods spotlight concentration risk: 75 per cent of this country's exports go to the U.S. That risk's sharp point cut through recent Statistics Canada data showing that “Canadian exports cratered in April and the trade deficit soared to a record high.” 

The numbers are stark: April exports to the U.S. dropped by 15.7 per cent, and our trade deficit surpassed $7-billion. We are buying far more abroad than we are selling. 

Betting on a renewed U.S. trade deal isn't a sure win. Mounting U.S. national debt (US$36.2-trillion) that President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will exacerbate is causing bond markets to flash red. An American fiscal crisis will weaken U.S. demand for Canadian imports down the road. 

During the Canadian federal election campaign, Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals had proposals to help businesses “diversify away from the U.S.” and soften the ebbs in trade flows caused by American political and economic instability. Easy said, harder done. 

Barbecue maker Napoleon has always been proud to be made-in-Canada. But a closer look shows the harsh reality of manufacturing at home

What does success look like? A lot like a business case study that documents the rise of one of this country's earliest industrial triumphs that put “Made in Canada” on the world's manufacturing map. 

In the lead-up to Canadian Confederation in 1867, the U.S. had abrogated a free-trade deal and imposed new tariffs. Canadian businesses and farmers were compelled to figure out how to manage increased costs while seeking new markets, both internal and external. One of those businesses was family-run H.A. Massey and Company, based in Newcastle, Ont.

The Masseys immigrated to Cobourg, Ont., from the U.S. in 1802 and took up farming as their chance at fortune. They soon realized that the farming tools their prosperity depended on – equipment used to clear land, prepare soil, plant crops and harvest them – were, as one family member told a reporter at the time, “the same as those used in the days of the Pharaohs.”

Thus began a quest to find, build and innovate new technologies that would transform farming from an arduous, subsistence exercise to one that generated prosperity and nation-building growth. 

The Masseys tinkered with their own farm implements in their work shed and foundry. Yet they also long spent time and money exploring the innovations emerging across Lake Ontario in places such as New York state, where a much larger and wealthier market fostered technological successes and failures at a rapid pace. 

The made-in-Canada tools that are helping make ‘buy Canadian' more convenient

They bought farm implements and tools from the U.S., reverse engineered them and then licensed the best ones for use in Canada, which they would then produce, honing their manufacturing capacity in the process. At the same time, they learned to market and took advantage of new railway building in Canada to expand their customer base.

The company won critical acclaim for its harvesting equipment at home and soon found itself representing Canada at the 1867 International Exhibition in France. There, it walked away with two gold medals: one in marketing for its display and the other, importantly, in recognition of the superior performance of Massey harvesters.

From gold medals to foreign sales, Massey reapers and mowers found markets. Twenty were sold to buyers in Germany after the exhibition in France. Twenty years later, Massey equipment was being sold in Europe, Britain, Turkey, Russia, South America, Jamaica and most British colonies.

Massey farm machinery and tools were made in factories in Ontario and shipped overseas using steam-powered ships with corkscrew propellers that opened global markets. But the one market Massey avoided was the American one to the south. 

What the Masseys had accomplished is what business schools today call the multiplier effect. Through market diversification, the company built economies of scale, mitigated the seasonality associated with selling only in Canada, widened its field of learning to global customers and suppliers, and refined its ability to win business in the face of strong competition that further supported research and development of their own products at home.

The take-away for diversifying away from the U.S.? Rather than compete against their American counterparts in the U.S., the Masseys made the critical decision to learn as much as they could from American enterprise and know-how, add their own innovations and expertise, and use the outcome to beat brash U.S. competitors at their own game on the global stage and in Canada itself. Only after that, in 1910, did they enter the U.S. market.

“Made in Canada” became a market differentiator in the 19th century. Today, it still can be.

This year, the forum will be held under the theme, "Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World," Putin stated. " "Russia consistently upholds the principles of sovereign development and respect for the cultural and civilizational identity of nations and peoples," the Russian leader noted.

Riots in Los Angeles over ICE deportations have continued as tensions escalate and state authorities push back against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in the sanctuary city that involved deploying 2,000 National Guard troops, with more on standby.

Many people have already been arrested in connection with crimes committed during the riots, which have largely been centered in a few blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Errol Musk, the father of U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, has arrived in Moscow to attend the Forum of the Future 2050, a pro-Kremlin event scheduled for June 9-10,  the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on June 8. 

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.

The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. 

"I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.

Among the forum's panels are sessions titled "Russian Space: The Race for Mars" and "The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia." 

According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.

Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia.  

Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.

SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.

Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. 

He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder."

Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.

Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

LOS ANGELES—Several hundred protesters waving Mexican flags demonstrated against Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement (ICE) raids at a federal building in downtown Los Angeles on June 8 for the third day in a row.

Against a backdrop of anti-ICE graffiti lining the walls of the Edward R. Roybal federal building, which houses the Department of Homeland Security and various other federal agencies on Alameda Street, dozens of federal officers, including the California National Guard, formed a defensive perimeter around the facility where protesters gathered within yards of the entrance.

White British children are currently a minority in one in four schools across England, The Telegraph has reported, citing government records.

The report, published on Saturday, was based on the results of school census data collected from more than 21,500 educational institutions across the country in early 2025.

According to the figures, in 72 English schools there are no white children at all, while in 454 schools they make up less than 2% of the pupils.

At Rockwood Academy in Birmingham, none of the 1,084 students were recorded in the census as “white British,” while there were only 12 out of 2,779 attending Loxford School in the London borough of Redbridge, The Telegraph reported.

The “demographic shift” is most visible in cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford, and Leicester, the paper said.

In the capital, white British children are a minority in schools in all 32 boroughs, with the exception of Bromley, where they make up 50.3%. In Newham and Harrow, there are only 5% and 7% of white children, respectively, the report said.

“The school census data demonstrates that the white British share of the young population is in decline in many areas,” The Telegraph noted.

Last week, a report came out forecasting that white British people will become a minority in the UK population in the early 2060s.

According to the paper, which was based on analysis of migration, birth and death rates data, by the end of the century their share will drop from the current 73% to around 33.7%.

The author of the study, Buckingham University Professor Matt Goodwin, said that his predictions raise “profound questions about the capacity of the UK state to both absorb and manage this scale of demographic change.”

Goodwin stressed that they are certain to provoke a “considerable degree of anxiety, concern and political opposition” among many voters, which “need to be… addressed if the UK is to avoid considerable political turbulence and polarization in the years and decades ahead.”

            Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza.
    


            As of Sunday evening, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
    


            “We know that it's a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.”
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated that the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, would not make it to the besieged enclave.
    


            “I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the ‘Madleen' flotilla does not reach Gaza,” said Katz in a statement, referring to the name of the ship.
    


            Katz warned the ship that “you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.”
    


            Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “We are still on our way to Gaza. There's no turning back, and we're hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said.
    


            The coalition campaigns to end Israel's blockade of Gaza and has tried to reach the enclave several times in the past

            After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again.
    


            But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine.
    


            Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said on social media that the flotilla carries more than food.
    


            “It is not only the aid, it is the HUMANITY THEY CARRY. For all of us,” she said.
    


            The crew, which has publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military.
    


            Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, is also onboard the Madleen.
    


            “From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement.
    


            “The people of Gaza, under siege, starving, and facing the threat of annihilation, have the legal right to decide who enters their territories.”
    


            Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
    


            The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said.
    


            The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta.
    


  An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated Irish actor Liam Cunningham was onboard the Madleen. The FFC has confirmed he is not onboard.

ATAMI, Shizuoka — Princess Akiko of Mikasa stressed the importance of cultivating fertile soil for traditional Japanese culture to live on without the need for protection, during a recent event that kicked off the World Forum on Japanese Culture.

The forum, which was established to convey to the world the distinctive characteristics of Japanese culture, held its inaugural sessions at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, on May 31, with about 500 people in attendance.

In the first session, Princess Akiko delivered a speech titled “Japanese Art: Untold Stories,” in which she said that traditional Japanese culture will become “a thing of the past” unless it is incorporated into modern society and people make use of it.

“Culture should come alive in our everyday lives,” she said. “Japanese culture is supposed to be closely connected to our everyday lives, not something merely appreciated.”

The princess said she realized how little she knew about Japanese culture when people often asked her about it while she was studying at the University of Oxford. That realization led her to study Japanese art and eventually launch “Shinyusha,” an initiative that provides children with opportunities to experience authentic Japanese culture through workshops. Topics include making Japanese tea in a traditional manner and wearing kimono — practices that are no longer common in everyday Japanese life.

The princess said that the goal of the initiative is to plant “seeds of memories.” She hopes that the children will have pleasant memories of the workshops and that they will recall those memories in the future, thereby building a feeling of affinity toward traditional culture.

She called for a “bottom-up style” of cultural preservation, in which each person naturally strives to protect their culture, rather than a “top-down style,” in which authorities choose what to keep and protect.

“If you don't know why something is important, you don't care to protect it,” she said. “What we can do now is use our own efforts to build a future for preserving our precious Japanese culture.”

In the second session held on the same day, Masatomo Kawai, a professor emeritus at Keio University, gave a keynote lecture on the uniqueness of Japanese culture. He said Japanese culture has been nurtured through finding harmony between nature and people, while in the West, culture and science have developed through efforts to overcome nature.

A similar point was addressed in the discussion that followed involving four experts: Kawai; Kazumi Murose, a lacquer artist designated as a living national treasure; Harvard University Prof. Yukio Lippit; and Tokugo Uchida, director of the MOA museum.

During the discussion, they affirmed the importance of seeking “coexistence between nature and society” in the 21st century amid global challenges such as division, conflict and environmental issues. Murose said that Japan, through its long history, has incorporated aspects of overseas cultures into its own to create new values and traditions to pass on to the next generation.

Lippit said culture is not something each country should discuss independently, and that common values are important for getting even people overseas to feel like they want to carry on Japanese cultural heritage.

World Forum on Japanese Culture

Organized by Harvard University′s department of History of Art + Architecture, the MOA Museum of Art, the Japan Arts Council and the Cultural Affairs Agency, the forum aims to elevate the appreciation of Japanese cultural values globally. Leading figures in traditional arts, traditional crafts, science and other fields are invited to speak, providing various perspectives on Japanese culture.

Recordings of the forum's lectures and discussions will be made open to the public in multiple languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese and Thai. The recordings are planned to be made available online through about 20 institutions in 10 countries, such as the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University.

The third session is scheduled to be held in August and will feature Ryoji Noyori, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, and Seiichi Kondo, a former director general of the Cultural Affairs Agency, as speakers.

 Emily Kilcrease and Geoffrey Gertz

On April 2, a day he dubbed “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced a sweeping new program of tariffs intended to rebalance U.S. trade. Trump's tariff rates were shockingly high, triggering a stock market selloff and a flight away from U.S. assets, rare rebukes from some Republicans in Congress, and diplomatic outrage around the world. After a week of mounting backlash, the president announced a 90-day pause on most of the country-specific tariffs, leading foreign counterparts to scramble for deals that would allow them to escape the levies before the clock ran out. U.S. court rulings questioning the legality of the president's tariffs have added further uncertainty.

The Trump administration's trade policy chaos has already caused harm, slowing growth, raising prices, and sparking dire predictions about the fate of the world economy. Yet there is a kernel of truth in the president's insistence that the international trade system needs a reset. Distrust of free trade has been rising in both political parties in the United States. Governments around the world are more and more willing to intervene in their economies to safeguard national interests. The U.S.-led global trading order, constructed over eight decades following World War II, has frayed.

What comes next is uncertain. But there is no going back to a time when the United States championed ever freer trade. Although many of the targets of Trump's tariffs, including businesses and foreign states, may pine for such a world, structural geopolitical changes have made it untenable. Instead of trying to turn back time, these actors should push the administration to usher in the needed transformation of the global trading order.

Disruptive tariffs, then, can create an opportunity. And despite the president's erratic behavior, the United States retains deep-rooted structural advantages that give it the power to lead a new trade effort. Many countries are dependent on the U.S. market, and few see China as a viable alternative. Most major economies will seek accommodation with the United States, even after being beaten up by heavy U.S. tariffs. Washington can therefore leverage its trade wars to achieve a productive restructuring of the international economic system.

To do so, however, the Trump administration must look beyond securing simple, short-term wins—such as one-off purchase agreements of U.S. commodities or temporary tariff truces—and cease bullying the United States' trade partners. It must instead build a new set of rules and norms that facilitate integration among like-minded states and that disentangle them from adversarial ones, especially China. A better path is possible, one that leads to gains for the United States and its allies. But they need to leverage the current chaos, rather than letting it consume them.

In the aftermath of World War II, the United States led a process to create a set of economic rules that promoted an open, multilateral trading order. The country struck bilateral and multilateral free trade and investment deals. It set up institutions to help govern commerce, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, later, the World Trade Organization. These bodies and rules provided economic and political stability, encouraged trade and investment flows, and offered trading partners reliable, peaceful, legal mechanisms to resolve their disputes. The resulting system, which favored openness and integration, was well suited to a geopolitical era marked by American hegemony. Washington viewed the rules-based economic order as vital to its own prosperity and strategic interests, and it had every reason to uphold it.

But the United States is no longer the sole superpower. As of last year, China is the world's largest trading nation in terms of goods, having clawed its way up by diverging from market principles and creating enormous friction in the global economic order. Many countries, including the United States, practice industrial policy, but China's systemic abuse of the open trading system is in a category by itself. And Beijing has used its economic growth to enhance its military power and expand its territorial ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, raising concerns in Washington and other governments. Meanwhile, new shocks and crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted vulnerabilities associated with deep economic interdependence. Rather than a unipolar order premised on U.S. leadership, the global economic landscape is now characterized by emerging alternative power centers and, for many countries, a privileging of security concerns over economic efficiencies. If a rules-based economic order is to persist, governments will need to adapt the rules to meet today's strategic interests.

At its core, the current trading system prioritizes nondiscrimination and the “most favored nation” principle that trading partners should treat each other alike. But economic and national security concerns differ by trading partner: trade with close allies can strengthen a country's security, while trade with adversaries can make it more vulnerable. It thus makes little sense to require countries to treat all trade partners as “most favored.” The trading system allows members to break with this universalist ethos on national security grounds, but it provides little guidance on what conditions must be met to take advantage of this exception. In the past, this mattered little as states acted with a presumption of openness and minimal restrictions. But over the last decade, increasing geopolitical competition has compelled more and more countries to impose export controls, sanctions, and other economic restrictions on trading partners. Such recurring deviations from the rules, even when justified, have bred disorder and uncertainty.

Against this backdrop, Trump has turned the United States into a revisionist power seeking to shatter what remains of the economic order. Thus far, his approach has been needlessly chaotic. But there is still an opportunity to wrest a positive outcome from the current tumult. The president's willingness to take bold action has set in motion ambitious trade negotiations, which normally proceed at a snail's pace. And there is reason to think they could yield favorable results for the United States and its allies.



In March, the Center for a New American Security ran a simulation of a trade war to examine how foreign governments might respond to sharply increased U.S. tariffs. Participants included experienced trade negotiators from the United States and several foreign capitals, as well as regional experts and security analysts. In the trade war simulation, the team representing the United States introduced expansive levies on all major trading partners but remained open to negotiating alternative arrangements. Teams playing the roles of foreign governments had to choose to negotiate with or retaliate against the United States. The simulation was designed to create complex and hostile negotiating conditions, including U.S. provocations on nontrade issues, such as the status of Greenland and the sovereignty of Canada. But by the end of the game, the U.S. team had unexpectedly succeeded in laying the foundation for a highly integrated democratic trading bloc that shut out China.

This process was hardly seamless. Teams representing traditional U.S. trade partners such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe bristled at Washington's bullying. But even as they recognized that the United States might not be a reliable partner, they concluded that they needed to work with American officials to mitigate the tariffs' damage. A trade war version of the classic prisoner's dilemma played out: country teams recognized the value of coordinating to form a coalition to counter the United States, but each still prioritized its own access to the American market. Most country teams tried to sprint to the front of the line to negotiate with Washington.

In the game, the Chinese team's attempted charm offensive mostly fell flat. As long as the U.S. team signaled an openness to dealmaking, the players representing major advanced economies did not view deepening economic integration with China as a sensible option. In fact, many agreed to align with the U.S. team on counter-China measures. In the real world, Beijing is working hard to take advantage of Washington's plunging global standing, courting foreign governments with a message that China, not the United States, is the reliable partner committed to the rules-based trading system. But to date, that message hasn't stuck. Rather than pursuing deeper integration with China, many countries are scrambling to ensure that the incipient trade war does not bring a flood of cheap Chinese exports into their markets.

The insights from the trade war simulation show how American policymakers might salvage Trump's tariff chaos. But real-life success is far from guaranteed. Multiple contingencies could propel the world trading system in a different direction. Foreign governments, for example, might face intense domestic political pressure to push back against the United States. Even in the absence of popular outrage, U.S. provocations on nontrade issues could tank any talks. To achieve a positive outcome, Trump will have to prioritize good-faith trade negotiations and tamp down the more chaotic aspects of his trade policy, such as imposing tariffs so extreme that he is forced to roll them back once it becomes painfully obvious that they are unsustainable.

If the Trump administration hopes to salvage a victory from its trade wars, Washington must use tariffs as leverage in pursuit of clear and achievable trade objectives rather than as a blunt tool wielded in pursuit of myriad and mutually incompatible ones. The administration has offered an array of rationales for the tariffs: that they will reindustrialize the United States, raise revenue for the U.S. government, lower trade deficits, and induce other countries to take actions that benefit the United States. Targeted tariffs could help the administration realize some of these objectives, but not all of them, and certainly not all of them at once. The administration was always going to have to prioritize its aims; the sooner it does so, the better.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for the administration is to establish credibility that it will honor any future commitments. After all the chaos Trump has unleashed, foreign governments rightfully worry that a U.S. promise to lift tariffs today will not protect them tomorrow. Trump's trade wars with Canada and Mexico highlight this point acutely, as the president's tariffs violate the rules that he himself negotiated in his first term under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-­Canada Agreement.

There is no simple solution to the credibility problem. The Trump administration came to power determined to demonstrate that it would be a disruptive force not bound by existing norms, and it has done just that. The president's early moves to impose tariffs primarily relied on emergency powers, since these allow for speedy action unencumbered by routine democratic processes (such as soliciting public comment on the potential impact of his policies). This erratic approach has already led to outcomes that are plainly ridiculous, such as the administration's punitive tariffs on the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited largely by penguins. Actions that were meant to seem aggressive have instead come off as uninformed and unsustainable.



But the Trump administration can still improve U.S. credibility, if not rescue it entirely, by bringing more order and predictability into the trade policymaking process. Trade policy, after all, does not need to be this chaotic. The president has a variety of legal avenues to pursue his objectives. The administration could use instruments such as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which addresses unfair trade practices, and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the United States to impose tariffs or take other remedial actions on national security grounds. These mechanisms require fact-based investigations by the administration and input from the public, which are at odds with Trump's unilateral style. But they give the government a chance to uncover and address unintended consequences. The slow and steady pace of these trade tools also affords the private sector time to prepare and adjust rather than throw their supply chains into disarray overnight.

Washington must also clarify what it expects of allies. At present, the United States' trading partners don't even know what they can do to secure tariff relief. Foreign governments leave meetings with the Trump administration confused about the American president's endgame. Trump may believe that keeping trade partners on their toes is a smart negotiating strategy. But in reality, the administration's opacity stands in its own way. A durable reset of the trading system is possible, but only if the administration views allies as part of the solution rather than part of the problem.

Trump has demonstrated little interest in adopting a more deliberate, methodical approach to negotiations or to recalibrating his means to meet more achievable ends. But the chaos unleashed by his trade policies is already bumping up against external constraints. Such backlash could nudge the administration toward a more moderate path. The U.S. courts, for example, are weighing in on the administration's actions. Congress, too, may opt to rein in some of the executive's tariff authorities. American consumers are souring on the president's tariff obsession and anticipating higher inflation. And if government bond holders panic again, as they did in April, Trump may once more be forced to announce a tariff pause.

The Trump administration would be wise to get ahead of these mounting external pressures by adopting a more predictable approach. Continually rejiggering the tariffs signals incoherence, perhaps even weakness, to allies and adversaries alike. Meanwhile, many trade partners, having witnessed the whims of Trump's on-again-off-again approach, may now believe they should simply wait out the president rather than come to the table with substantive offers.

Even if Trump could be convinced to implement a more deliberate strategy in the trade wars, the question remains—to what end? At present, the administration appears focused on negotiating shallow “framework agreements,” which provide some partial relief from tariffs in return for modest trade concessions and purchase agreements but gesture only vaguely at possible future cooperation. If the trade wars end in a series of such deals, the United States will merely paper over the flaws in the existing trading system while burning valuable leverage.

There is an alternative, even more worrisome path the trade wars could take. After tearing up the existing global trade rules, the United States could advance a more nakedly transactional approach in its international economic relations, eschewing any rules or shared norms that might constrain U.S. action. As the world's largest economy turns inward and adopts beggar-thy-neighbor policies, other countries would respond in kind, adopting regressive protectionist policies, as happened during the Great Depression. In such a scenario, disorder would prevail.

Yet a third path is also possible. Having used tariffs to shake trading partners out of their complacency, the United States can work with these countries to negotiate a reset of the trading system—one that preserves many of the advantages of the old system while rectifying its shortcomings. The starting point should be relaxing the principle of nondiscrimination and accepting that trade policy will differentiate among trade partners and allow democracies to favor one another. Indeed, this would simply reflect the fact that the United States already treats China, its principal geopolitical adversary, differently from other trading partners.

The United States should continue to trade with China in low-end manufacturing, agriculture, and a handful of other areas. But in more strategic sectors, such as chips and pharmaceuticals, Trump should prioritize “de-risking” from China, as he did in his first term. The administration should maintain targeted tariffs that would allow the United States to build capacity in these critical industries. Additionally, Washington should make significant investments in domestic manufacturing and research and design, coordinating with other major economies wherever possible.



Should China and the United States partially decouple, Americans could feel some economic pain. To offset the loss in trade, Washington will have to deepen economic integration with like-minded partners and allies. Doing so will help the United States and its partners replace what has been lost and scale up production in sectors essential to a strong defense, technology, and innovation base—which will be required for long-term competition with China. To that end, they should coordinate their use of export controls, investment screening, and data security measures. They will also need to address China's overcapacity and unfair trade practices in key industries, such as steel and aluminum. These steps will help build shared expectations about when trade and investment restrictions are legitimate for national security concerns, fostering predictability and stability in the new economic security order.

Ultimately, Trump should aim for a future order made up of the following concentric circles: deep economic and security integration for close allies and partners; predictable, rules-based exchange among most countries; and careful de-risking from competitors. Such an order would provide a more stable framework for the world as it is. To realize that order, Washington should seek to establish legally binding commitments with its close partners that provide the clarity, consistency, and credibility that businesses and governments require. The 90-day framework agreements the Trump administration has been negotiating should be exactly that: frameworks for more concrete rules to be hammered out in the months ahead. If the framework agreements are instead treated as ends in themselves, without any ambitious follow-through, the tariff pain will not be worth the very modest resulting benefits.

The United States' trading partners correctly fear that Trump is breaking an economic order that cannot be rebuilt, and their near-term objective is tariff relief. But they must also look further ahead. They must see this as an opportunity to work alongside the United States in building a new architecture that addresses their shared challenges. Whether they like it or not, geopolitics has shifted in ways that make the previous rules-based order unsustainable. Trump's shock to the system may not be pretty. But it could open the way for a much better system.

In January and February of this year, parents searching for their missing children secretly visited a ranch outside the small town of Teuchitlán, in the western Mexican state of Jalisco. They suspected that it had been a cartel training camp and might hold clues about the fates of their children, whom many believed to have been kidnapped or forcibly recruited by the cartels. But once they arrived, they discovered something far worse: what appeared to be three crematoriums littered with bone fragments and hundreds of pairs of shoes, some of them identical to the ones their children had been wearing when they went missing. The ranch had been a cartel extermination camp. It wasn't the first one discovered in Mexico in recent years. It wasn't even the biggest.

Equally disturbing is what followed. In March, after news of the discovery spread, Mexico's attorney general's office organized an official visit for reporters and parent collectives. But according to those who returned to the site, much of the evidence had disappeared; the pits where the bone fragments had been found were smoothed over. Even worse, authorities may have known about the ranch before they intervened in September 2024. According to the newspaper El País, Virgina Garay, whom I met while she was searching for her missing son, had alerted authorities to the suspicious site in 2021 after receiving an anonymous tip and visiting the area. But nothing was done.

After authorities finally shut down the camp, the attorney general declined to investigate the case. So it fell to Jalisco state prosecutors, who failed to collect fingerprints or to properly safeguard vehicles held as evidence, two of which were later stolen. In mid-May, a different group of mothers found an even larger extermination camp in neighboring Colima State that the federal authorities had also known about for years before shutting it down in 2023, having arrested an alleged drug trafficker there in 2018.

These are not isolated events; they happen because state officials in Mexico protect organized crime—not occasionally but routinely, at various levels of government. Often, officials face a simple calculus: they are more likely to profit than be punished for colluding with cartels.

The defining dilemma of Claudia Sheinbaum's presidency may be whether she is willing to alter this status quo, raise the costs of collusion, and protect those who stand up to the cartels, instead. Since taking office in October 2024, Sheinbaum has taken a harder line on organized crime, increasing seizures of drugs and guns and arrests of suspected cartel operators. In February, when the Trump administration threatened tariffs on Mexico if it didn't stop the flow of fentanyl across the border, Sheinbaum doubled down on her efforts, and the number of seizures and arrests has since grown substantially. But with their political and judicial protection networks still intact, any criminal groups that are weakened by the president's current strategy may simply be replaced by new ones. Criminal-political networks will continue dividing the country into private fiefdoms, with politics, justice, and the legal economy reduced to arenas of lawless competition. Deadly drugs and insecurity will continue flowing north.

To truly reduce the cartels' corrosive power, Sheinbaum should pursue their protectors. Although fully dismantling the judicial and political protection networks that have underpinned Mexican organized crime for decades in just six years is likely impossible—they are too vast and numerous for any president to eliminate in one term—she has it in her power to make an example of the worst offenders and at least deter collusion. This will be a risky project. Under Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as AMLO, the cartels' power and protection networks grew. If Sheinbaum begins holding public officials accountable, she may alienate powerful members of her party, the National Regeneration Movement, known as Morena, some of whom allegedly benefit from these relationships.

The Trump administration, however, can offer Sheinbaum valuable political cover—and incentives to act. It has referred to an “alliance” between the Mexican state and cartels and clearly grasps that the Mexican authorities are not dismantling these pacts on their own. Although tactics such as U.S. drone strikes will do little to weaken the cartels, U.S. pressure could help generate the political will in Mexico to finally begin punishing collusion. The challenge for the United States, then, is figuring out how to incentivize Sheinbaum to do so without causing her to fracture her party or lose governability in the process. If it succeeds in striking this balance, Sheinbaum could begin meaningfully and durably weakening the cartels—not just temporarily disrupting their operations. After a nearly two-decade period in which 275,000 Mexicans have been killed by organized crime and one million Americans have died from drug overdoses, it's time.

Although Sheinbaum won the election as an AMLO disciple, she quickly broke with the former president's hands-off security strategy, known as “hugs not bullets.” This was a significant shift for Morena, which, despite its popularity has always been weak on security. When López Obrador was running for president in 2018, he promised to curb impunity for organized crime, but once elected, he instead prioritized the growth of Morena—the party he founded—above all else. He recruited and defended politicians with alleged criminal ties, and he even pressed the first Trump administration to return a top Mexican army general who had been arrested in the United States on drug smuggling charges. Trump complied, and Mexico's attorney general dropped all charges on his return to the country. AMLO also spent big on cash transfers that boosted Morena's support while cutting funding for state and local police forces. And he spoke as if belonging to the party was in itself a guarantee that politicians would not collude with criminals.

The result was that Morena became hegemonic—a genuinely popular big-tent party that oversaw rising wages and the exit of five million Mexicans from poverty. But organized crime's power also grew. Although homicides declined slightly in López Obrador's final years in office, his term was overall the deadliest in modern Mexican history. Rising incidents of extortion and forced disappearances signaled the consolidation of criminal territorial control. Even in Morena bastions such as AMLO's southern home state of Tabasco, voters I spoke with expressed frustration with their Morena governor for overseeing rising cartel violence. In the last election, Mexicans wanted continuity on many issues—but not on security.



This helps explain why Sheinbaum, despite loyally carrying forward other AMLO initiatives such as judicial reform, immediately pivoted on security. Six more years of nonconfrontation with the cartels would have imperiled both her and AMLO's political project and the country itself. In addition to expanding gun and drug seizures, Sheinbaum has overseen a steep increase in arrests of criminal groups' midlevel management. And in an unprecedented move for Mexico, the government sent 29 long-sought drug bosses to the United States in February, sidestepping the country's normal extradition rules.

Sheinbaum's government claims these tactics are already pacifying the country, with homicides officially down almost 25 percent since September. Journalists, however, have pointed out that disappearances have increased, which suggests that criminal groups may simply be hiding their violence more effectively. The share of Mexicans who report feeling unsafe, at 62 percent, has barely budged in the last year, and just under a third of Mexicans expect their cities to get safer this year.

Still, nearly half of Mexicans approve of the government's new security policy, close to double the percentage who felt that way when Sheinbaum started. She has a mandate to keep going, and, fortunately, her plans go beyond increased arrests and drug busts.

As mayor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023, Sheinbaum and her public security secretary, Omar García Harfuch, achieved a steep drop in crime by increasing the use of intelligence and promoting closer cooperation among security policymakers, prosecutors, and the Mexico City police. Other cities that have adopted the same coordination, such as the northern city of Torreón, have also seen crime plummet. Still, in Mexico's decentralized federalist system, the norm is for different levels of government to clash, agencies to compete, and intelligence to be scattered among separate authorities rather than shared and jointly analyzed. This has been a major hindrance to fighting cartels.

Now Sheinbaum and Harfuch are attempting to fix this disjointed system. They are passing laws to centralize intelligence collection and analysis and are consolidating the power of the federal public security ministry, which Harfuch leads, to coordinate policy across agencies. In November, a constitutional amendment gave Harfuch's ministry the power to conduct police investigations. Proposed secondary laws would give the federal security minister access to nationwide data on prison inmates, arrests, vehicles, fingerprints, criminal records, and cellphone accounts linked to users' biometric data, and require municipalities and states to share this information upward.



The problem, of course, is that if Sheinbaum and Harfuch succeed in these reforms, several other institutions are bound to lose authority, resources, and control. As a result, they are facing pushback. The chief obstacle seems to be the military, whose personnel gained sweeping control over intelligence collection under AMLO. According to reporting by El País, General Ricardo Trevilla, Mexico's national defense secretary, is lobbying Morena lawmakers not to pass the remaining legislation when it comes up for a vote in mid-June or July.

Even if these reforms succeed, others threaten to limit the scope of any anti-impunity efforts—none more so than Mexico's recently implemented judicial reform. On June 1, Mexico held the first of two rounds of elections to replace all of the country's judges. Several candidates with alleged ties to organized crime, including one who spent time in U.S. prison for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Texas, made it past candidate screening commissions, which were dominated by Morena, and onto the ballot. Now that judges are vulnerable to electoral pressures, many fear that they will be less likely to sentence powerful crime bosses and their protectors.

Then there are Sheinbaum's budget constraints. Mexico's 2025 budget reduced security spending by 36 percent—even though state police in half of Mexican states make less than minimum wage. The slimmed-down budget compensated for electorally motivated last-minute spending by AMLO that pushed Mexico's fiscal deficit to a record 5.7 percent of GDP in late 2024. Generating more revenue is likely crucial to transform Mexico's security situation. But the country's tax revenue as a share of GDP is among the lowest in Latin America, and Sheinbaum has for now ruled out higher taxes, forcing her to reconcile social programs and other spending with Mexico's security needs.

These obstacles are significant. But Sheinbaum's biggest challenge of all remains finding the political will to address corruption inside Morena.

This is where Sheinbaum's commitments get blurrier. On the one hand, on Sheinbaum's watch, the attorney general has begun investigating a former Morena governor and a handful of Morena local officials for alleged criminal wrongdoing. These probes center on relatively minor figures, but they are nevertheless a marked change from the all-too-permissive tone set by AMLO.

Sheinbaum also addressed a letter to Morena members in which she insisted that “there cannot be any collusion with crime—whether organized or white-collar.” She also secured passage of a law against nepotism in politics, which may weaken some existing corruption networks. On the other hand, Sheinbaum told a reporter, “There are no ties between Morena and crime.” And although she called for a thorough investigation into whether state prosecutors in Jalisco mismanaged the Teuchitlán case, she also defensively insisted that “there is no forced disappearance by the state” in Mexico—this despite the United Nations calling disappearances “generalized and systematic.”

The reason for Sheinbaum's caution is likely twofold: the damage that public exposure of criminal collusion could do to Morena's image, and her fear that she could lose control over her party to internal rivals. It is becoming increasingly clear that Sheinbaum lacks AMLO's capacity to unify and control Morena's many competing currents and personalities. She has faced pushback from her own party over the anti-nepotism law and her choice for welfare secretary. If Sheinbaum truly aspires to “zero impunity,” she will have to figure out how to advance her goals without inciting a rebellion by top legislative power brokers.

Given the pushback Sheinbaum may face from party heavyweights, the army, prosecutors, and even AMLO himself, she may decide that none of this is worth it—that disrupting the status quo of widespread impunity is too risky. There is, however, one external factor that could increase her resolve to act: the United States.

The United States has more leverage over Mexico now than at any time in recent years. With a major reduction of migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border in recent months, Washington is not as beholden to the Mexican president in stemming migrant flows across the border as in the recent past, affording it greater leverage over Mexico City. Moreover, Mexico's economic slowdown means that Sheinbaum must take Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement seriously.

The Trump administration must resist the temptation to focus on showy public-facing policies, such as unilateral drone strikes, which would practically force Sheinbaum to reduce cooperation in defense of Mexican sovereignty. Instead, the administration should focus its attention and leverage on the narco-corruption half of the equation, which could create a much-needed sense of urgency within Morena. Understandably, the Trump administration may wish to avoid anything that sounds like futile justice sector reform. The United States spent over $400 million supporting a decadelong transition to a new criminal justice system in Mexico, as part of the Mérida Initiative, only for Morena to clear large parts of that system away in its recent judicial reform. The administration does not need to try to rebuild Mexican institutions that support the rule of law, but it can and should raise the costs of colluding with crime in more targeted ways.

For instance, the administration has already revoked visas of Mexican politicians allegedly linked to crime, and according to an unnamed U.S. official interviewed by ProPublica, Washington is currently developing a longer list of such politicians eligible for sanctions. Many cartel leaders are also now in U.S. federal custody and facing charges; they presumably have knowledge of official corruption that they will share with U.S. federal prosecutors to strike plea deals. As the United States gathers more information about how the state-crime pacts really operate and makes some of this information public, it will strengthen Sheinbaum's incentive to act.

The Trump administration, however, should not overestimate Sheinbaum's control over Morena. It's unlikely she will move as quickly and aggressively against politicians and state officials with crime ties as Washington might like. Curbing impunity for colluding with crime will be a long, incremental process, extending beyond any one six-year term. If Trump and Sheinbaum miss this opportunity, and the penalties for official collusion with crime remain as low as they are today, the outcome is all but certain: more drug overdose deaths in the United States, and more tragic cases like Teuchitlán in Mexico.

TOKYO (AP) — An explosion at a storage site for unexploded ordnance at a U.S. military base on Japan's southern island of Okinawa injured four Japan's Self-Defense Forces soldiers, though the injuries are not life-threatening, officials said Monday.

The four soldiers sustained finger injuries while working at a facility that belongs to Okinawa prefecture and temporarily stores unexploded ordnance, mostly from wartime and found on the island, local officials said. One of the harshest battles of World War II was fought on Okinawa.

Prefectural officials said the injuries were not life-threatening, but no other details were immediately known.

The U.S. Air Force said in a statement that the explosion occurred at the facility managed by the Okinawa prefectural government at Kadena Air Base's munitions storage area. It said no U.S. servicemembers were involved in the incident.

The Self Defense Force's joint staff said one of the devices suddenly exploded when the soldiers were inspecting it at the facility. The blast occurred when the soldiers were trying to remove rust, NHK television reported.

The SDF said they are trying to confirm what caused the accident.

Monday's accident was believed to be the first ever since the 1974 launch of the Japanese army's unexploded ordnance disposal unit.

Hundreds of tons of unexploded wartime bombs, many of them dropped by the U.S. military, remain buried around Japan and are sometimes dug up at construction sites and elsewhere. Many of them are still found on Okinawa, where about 1,856 tons of unexploded U.S. bombs are believed to remain.

In October, an unexploded wartime U.S. bomb exploded at a commercial airport in southern Japan, causing a large crater and suspending dozens of flights.

WASHINGTON, June 9. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio stumbled while ascending the ramp before departing from the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, according to a Fox News broadcast.

The president stepped off the plane and stumbled about halfway up the ramp but quickly regained his balance. Before boarding the aircraft, he turned and waved to journalists.

Rubio, who followed Trump up the ramp, also stumbled.

Trump had spent the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and is now at his country residence in Camp David, Maryland, according to journalists from his press pool.

Trump has repeatedly drawn attention to similar stumbles by his predecessor, Joe Biden, citing them as evidence of Biden's deteriorating condition and inability to lead the country.

Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.

President Donald Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they're not gonna get away with it.”

National Guard troops were seen in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — California will file a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles to confront immigration protesters who took to the streets, the attorney general said, arguing that the president had “trampled” the state's sovereignty.

“We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops” state Attorney General Rob Bonta told reporters. He planned to seek a court order declaring that Trump's use of the Guard was unlawful and ask for a restraining order to halt the deployment.

The streets of the sprawling city of 4 million people were quiet Monday morning, but the smell of smoke hung in the air downtown, one day after crowds blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.

Bonta accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger with his announcement of the deployment, which was followed Sunday by clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. “This was not inevitable,” he said.

While much of the city was spared from any violence, clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places. It could take days to clear the debris from burned cars and to clean off or paint over graffiti sprayed on City Hall and other buildings near the detention facility. Sunday was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of the first 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.




Trump said Monday that the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.

Later, at a White House event, he added that state leaders “were afraid to do anything.”

U.S. officials said about 1,000 National Guard members were in the city under federal orders by midday Monday. The full 2,000 members authorized by the president were expected to be on the ground by the end of the day. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the details of military operations.




Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier. Others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover at one point.

Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, the president accused Newsom and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, of lying by saying Guard troops were not necessary.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote.

Newsom called on Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”

The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.

“Trump wants chaos and he's instigated violence,” he said. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for.”

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

McDonnell pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. He said his department responded as quickly as it could and had not been notified in advance of the raids.

Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and he told MSNBC that Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called Trump a “stone cold liar.”

The admonishments did not deter the administration.

“It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder Sunday morning in LA, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some demonstrators closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently. By evening, police had shut down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash-bang grenades echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.

The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” 

In San Francisco, officers arrested and later released about 155 people for refusing orders to disperse, said officer Paulina Henderson with the city's police department.

Officers monitoring one protest declared an unlawful assembly when people in the group became violent, the San Francisco Police Department said. Many protesters left the scene, but some remained while others moved to another area where they vandalized buildings and a police vehicle.

Fox News' Jonathan Hunt reports the latest on the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles. Correspondent Rich Edson details Dems' response to Trump deploying the National Guard and 'Outnumbered' co-host Kayleigh McEnany weighs in on the escalation. 

Dozens of protesters have been arrested following a weekend of violence across Los Angeles as tensions hit a boiling point over immigration raids throughout the city. 

On Sunday, law enforcement officials from multiple agencies arrested 41 protesters as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations spiraled out of control. 

Of the nearly four-dozen arrests, 21 were made by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), 19 by California Highway Patrol and one by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

The charges include failure to disperse, assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, looting and arson, an LAPD spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

Of the most violent alleged offenses, one individual was arrested for attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail, Fox News Digital has learned. 

On Saturday, the LAPD arrested 10 individuals for failing to disperse. The agency did not make any arrests Friday, according to officials.

The LAPD declined Fox News Digital's request to identify the arrestees. 

The arrests come as the sanctuary city is bracing for the possibility of more violence as anti-ICE protesters clash with local, state and federal law enforcement. 

The protests kicked off on Friday after federal agents swept through the city's garment district in search of undocumented immigrants, sparking outrage throughout the community.

In response to the unrest, President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 California National Guard troops to the area, with 300 troops arriving over the weekend. 

"We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California," Trump wrote on Truth Social Monday morning. "If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated." 

Tensions escalated on the third day of protests as agitators moved throughout the city, setting self-driving cars on fire and blocking off major highways.

National Guard troops took to the streets Sunday morning to guard the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. As the protesters approached the guard members, additional uniformed officers began shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street. 

The LAPD began firing off rounds of crowd-control munitions in an effort to disperse the protesters, who then advanced onto the 101 Freeway and proceeded to block traffic until state police cleared the roadway by late afternoon.

Additionally, demonstrators set at least four self-driving electric vehicles on fire, resulting in large explosions being heard throughout the chaos along with intermittent flash bangs going off periodically. By Sunday night, local police had issued an unlawful assembly order, effectively shutting down the area throughout downtown Los Angeles.

"Demonstrators have marched to the LA Live area and are blocking all lanes of traffic on Figueroa and 11th St," the LAPD posted to X. "An UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY has been declared for the Downtown Los Angeles area. You are to leave the area immediately."

Trump's move to send in the U.S. military has drawn criticism from local and national politicians, with Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom renouncing the move while vowing to sue the administration. 

"This is about authoritarian tendencies," Newsom said in a statement. "This is about command and control. This is about power. This is about ego. This is a consistent pattern. This guy has abandoned the core principles of this great democracy. He's threatening to go after judges he disagrees with, cut off funding to institutions of higher learning, he's rewriting history and censoring historical facts."

Newsom arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday evening to meet with state officials and oversee the response to the anti-ICE demonstrations.

ICE said in a Saturday post on X that the agency had arrested 118 illegal immigrants throughout Los Angeles, including five alleged gang members.

"Why do Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass care more about violent murderers and sex offenders than they do about protecting their own citizens?" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security's public affairs, said in a statement. "These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer."

Representatives for Bass' administration did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Border czar Tom Homan joins 'Fox & Friends' to respond to California Democrats' pushback on President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard.

California will sue the Trump administration over its decision to activate National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles County over the weekend, the state's Democratic leaders announced on Monday.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta claimed in a statement that President Donald Trump abused his authority by invoking a provision of Title 10 that allows the president to mobilize the National Guard if an invasion or rebellion is underway.

"President Trump's order calling federalized National Guard troops into Los Angeles – over the objections of the governor and local law enforcement – is unnecessary and counterproductive," Bonta said.

Bonta added that there was "no invasion" and "no rebellion" in California, a claim that comes as protests against immigration raids devolved into riots in parts of sprawling Los Angeles County over the weekend.

"The president is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends," Bonta said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When children of wealthy families reach adulthood, they often benefit from the largesse of parents in the form of a trust fund. It's another way they get a leg up on less affluent peers, who may receive nothing at all — or even be expected to support their families.

But what if all children — regardless of their family's circumstances — could get a financial boost when they turn 18?

That's the idea behind a House GOP proposal backed by President Donald Trump. It would create accounts for all babies born in the U.S. over the next four years with $1,000 that would accrue interest until the children reach adulthood. At age 18, they could withdraw the money to put toward a down payment for a home, education or to start a small business. If the money is used for other purposes, it'll be taxed at a higher rate. 

It builds on the concept of “ baby bonds,” which two states — California and Connecticut — and the District of Columbia have introduced as a way to reduce gaps between wealthy people and poor people. 

Rep. Blake Moore, a Republican from Utah, spearheaded the effort to get the initiative into a massive House spending bill. In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, he said wealth inequality has soured many people on capitalism. “Trump Accounts,” as the proposal calls them, could be the antidote, he said.

“We know that America's economic engine is working, but not everyone feels connected to its value and the ways it can benefit them,” Moore wrote. “If we can demonstrate to our next generation the benefits of investing and financial health, we can put them on a path toward prosperity.”




The bill calls for the money to be handled by investment firms. 

The bill would require at least one parent to produce a Social Security number with work authorizations, meaning the U.S. citizen children born to some categories of immigrants would be excluded from the benefit. But unlike other baby bond programs, which generally target disadvantaged groups, this one would be available to families of all incomes. 

“When little baby is born they're gonna start off with a thousand dollars and if we do a good job of investing their money — we're going to go with one of the investing guidelines, who the hell knows if they're any good — but they have a chance to be very rich,” Trump said at a rally last week in Pittsburgh. “It's going to be very cute to see.”

Economist Darrick Hamilton of The New School, who first pitched the idea of baby bonds a quarter-century ago, said the GOP proposal would exacerbate rather than reduce wealth gaps. He envisioned a program that would be universal but would give children from poor families a larger endowment than their wealthier peers, in an attempt to level the playing field. The money would be handled by the government, not by private firms on Wall Street.

“It is upside down,” Hamilton said. “It's going to enhance inequality.”

Hamilton added that $1,000 — even with interest — would not be enough to make a significant difference for a child living in poverty.

A Silicon Valley investor who created the blueprint for the proposal, Brad Gerstner, said in an interview with CNBC last year that the accounts could help address the wealth gap and the loss of faith in capitalism that represent an existential crisis for the U.S. 

“The rise and fall of nations occurs when you have a wealth gap that grows, when you have people who lose faith in the system,” Gerstner said. “We're not agentless. We can do something.”

The proposal comes as Congressional Republicans and Trump face backlash for proposed cuts to programs that poor families with children rely on, including food assistance and Medicaid. 

Even some who back the idea of baby bonds are skeptical, noting Trump wants to cut higher education grants and programs that aid young people on the cusp of adulthood — the same age group Trump Accounts are supposed to help. Pending federal legislation would slash Medicaid and food and housing assistance that many families with children rely on.

Young adults who grew up in poverty often struggle with covering basics like rent and transportation — expenses that Trump Accounts could not be tapped to cover, said Eve Valdez, an advocate for youth in foster care in southern California. 

Accounts for newborn children that cannot be accessed for 18 years mean little to families struggling to meet basic needs today, said Shimica Gaskins of End Child Poverty California.

“Having children have health care, having their families have access to SNAP and food are what we really need ... the country focused on,” Gaskins said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return.

The Trump administration on Friday announced it had returned Kilmar Abrego Garcia – a Salvadoran migrant and alleged MS-13 member – to the U.S., months after he was deported to El Salvador in what officials later acknowledged was an administrative error.

It is unclear whether Abrego Garcia's return signals a shift in policy or is merely a one-off. The administration paired the announcement with news of a new federal indictment charging him with crimes related to transporting undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

Still, the case has sparked fresh questions about the administration's willingness to comply with other court orders requiring the return of deported migrants – whether individuals or entire classes – or mandating that certain individuals remain in U.S. custody long enough to challenge their removals to so-called "third countries." 

It also undercut the Trump administration's assertion earlier this year that it is powerless to order El Salvador to return a prisoner or facilitate the return of migrants sent to El Salvador – something judges have attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to square in various court proceedings this year.  

Here is what to know about those cases so far.

Daniel Lozano-Camargo, previously referred to in court documents as "Cristian," is a 20-year-old Venezuelan immigrant deported in March under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law invoked by Trump to quickly remove hundreds of immigrants and send them to El Salvador to be detained in the country's maximum-security CECOT prison. 

U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled in April that his deportation violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stuck last year with a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo, who had entered the country as an unaccompanied child and later sought asylum.

Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the immigrants until their asylum cases were fully adjudicated in court, which she said had not happened in Lozano-Camargo's case prior to his removal. 

Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled that his deportation was a breach of contract. In ordering his return to the U.S., she stressed that her ruling had nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request in question – a nod to the two apparent low-level drug offenses he had racked up prior to his removal – but simply his ability to have his asylum request adjudicated in court under the agreement with DHS.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld that decision late last month, clearing the way for Gallagher to set a formal timeline for the government to comply with facilitating the return. DHS officials told the court last week in a status update that Lozano-Camargo remains held at CECOT.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW EL SALVADOR DEPORTATION FLIGHT CASE

The Trump administration returned a mistakenly deported Guatemalan native to U.S. soil last week, marking the first known instance of the Trump administration complying with a judge's orders to return an individual removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information.

The immigrant, referred to in court documents only as "O.C.G.," was deported to Mexico in March without due process and despite his stated fears of persecution in the country, according to U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, who ordered his return. 

Murphy noted that O.C.G. had previously been held for ransom and raped in Mexico but was not afforded the chance to assert those fears prior to his removal – a right afforded to him by U.S. and international law.

ICE officials told the court earlier this month that they were working to secure his return. Last week, attorneys for O.C.G. told Fox News he had been returned to the U.S. on Wednesday via commercial flight.

Unlike the individuals deported to CECOT, however, O.C.G. had not been detained in Mexico after he was deported, which could have eased some of the hurdles for the administration in returning him.

Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of six immigrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or notice until they have the opportunity to conduct so-called "reasonable fear interviews," or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody. 

Currently, all six individuals remain detained at a U.S. military base in Djibouti – the only U.S. military base currently operational in all of Africa – and where ICE officials tasked with keeping them in custody cited recent health risks, including from malaria exposure, searing heat, nearby burn pits as well as the "imminent danger" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. 

In response, Murphy reiterated earlier this month that the individuals need not remain in South Sudan and that the U.S. is free to move them to another location, including back to the U.S., to more safely carry out these proceedings. It is unclear whether the government has plans to relocate the group. 

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg last week ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court and challenge their alleged gang status – the latest in a heated fight centered on Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants.

Boasberg reiterated in the 69-page ruling that due process includes providing migrants deported to CECOT prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court. He gave the Trump administration until Wednesday to submit to the court plans for how it will go about providing the habeas relief to plaintiffs held at CECOT.

"Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition," Boasberg said in his order.

The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier rulings and the temporary restraining order handed down in March. Boasberg later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of court, citing the government's "willful disregard" for his March 15 emergency order, which ordered the administration to halt its deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and immediately return all planes to the U.S., which did not happen.

President Donald Trump told reporters Monday he would support Border Czar Tom Homan arresting California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

President Donald Trump suggested he would be willing to arrest California Gov. Gavin Newsom if his administration obstructs ICE operations amid riots in Los Angeles on Monday.

Trump made the statement in a brief exchange with reporters after disembarking from Marine One outside the White House. Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Trump whether he though Border Czar Tom Homan should take up Newsom on his dare to come arrest him.

"He's daring Tom Homan to come and arrest him. Should he do it?" Doocy asked.

"I would do it I were Tom," Trump responded. "I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity. But I do think it would be a great thing.  He's done a terrible job. I like Gavin Newsom. He's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent. Everybody knows."

Trump went on to state his belief that many of the rioters and protesters in Los Angeles are professional agitators rather than real protesters.

"The people that are causing the problem are professional agitators. They're insurrectionists. They're bad people. They should be in jail," Trump said.

Newsom swiftly responded to Trump's comments in a post on social media.

"The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor," Newsom wrote. "This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism."

Homan told "Fox & Friends" earlier on Monday that he had told an NBC reporter that "no one's above the law," but there was no discussion about arresting Newsom at that time.

"What we discussed was for those protesters that crossed the line… you can protest, you get your First Amendment rights… But when you cross that line, you put hands on an ICE officer, or you destroy property, or I'd say that you impede law enforcement, or you're knowingly harboring and concealing an illegal alien… that's a crime, and the Trump administration is not going to tolerate it," he said.

"Then the reporter asked me, well, could Governor Newsom or Mayor Bass be arrested? I said, 'Well, no one's above the law. If they cross the line and commit a crime, absolutely they can,' so there was no discussion about arresting Newsom."

Homan lambasted the blue state's response to riots against the Trump administration's immigration raids that rocked Los Angeles over the weekend, with some protesters throwing projectiles at law enforcement and torching American flags and cars.

Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to the city in an effort to quell some of the unrest, much to the dismay of Democratic officials.

The new proclamation, which Trump signed on Wednesday, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa. It does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list.

President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.

The California governor and the White House have been feuding over how to handle protests in Los Angeles.

It started when Tom Homan, the border czar, warned that anyone, including public officials, would be arrested if they obstructed federal immigration enforcement.

“No one's above the law,” he said on Fox & Friends, although he added that “there was no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

The California governor responded in an interview with MSNBC. “Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy,” Newsom said.

Trump grinned when asked about the exchange after landing at the White House. 

“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump said. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job.”

After inspecting the site for a future flagpole, Trump spoke to reporters about the protests in California.

“I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent,” the president said, complaining about “the little railroad he's building” that is “100 times over budget.” 

It's a reference to the much-delayed high-speed rail project, which predates Newsom's tenure. Trump also criticized the protesters.

“The people that are causing these problems are professional agitators, they're insurrectionists, they're bad people. They should be in jail.”






In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise.

Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places.

Trump wrote that Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary.

The president isn't just remaking the Rose Garden. He wants to install two large flag poles, one on either side of the White House. When he stepped off Marine One, he walked to a bulldozer that was positioned on the South Lawn to dig a foundation for the pole. Trump posed for a photo with workers.

The project is expected to be completed in about two months, or during the first half of August, a White House official said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly about intended changes to the property.

The Senate minority leader issued the following statement Monday:








The lawsuit, which is also over plans to return seized devices, was announced Monday.

The states argue that returning the triggers, which make semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly, would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. The administration announced the deal last month.

It resolves a series of cases over the aftermarket trigger the government had previously argued qualify as machine guns under federal law, saying they're essentially illegal machine gun conversion devices because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing essentially like an automatic weapon.

“I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. She posted the message on X over the weekend. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.”

Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.”

However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

As President Trump builds a crypto empire — including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club — Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.

But the Democratic Party's own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.

Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.

“I'm all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “But at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don't think you can close your eyes to that when you're legislating.”

A senior White House official says he expects a “short meeting with a big, strong handshake” on the export of rare earth minerals from China.

Appearing on CNBC this morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said it was a “very significant, sticking point” because China, which controls the processing of critical minerals, has been “slow rolling” in sending the materials to U.S. over licensing requirements.

“It could potentially disrupt production for, you know, some U.S. companies that rely on those things,” Hassett said. High-level U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting today in London for their latest round of trade talks.

Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC he plans to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

But Newsom said he believed the president was required to coordinate with the state's governor before ordering such a deployment.

“We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday night.

Security precautions are already being put in place ahead of this Saturday's military parade. Workers were assembling black metal barriers near the White House on Monday morning.

More information on preparations will be announced in the afternoon during a briefing with local and federal officials.

The American and Israeli leaders plan to speak Monday morning, according to a White House official. The official requested anonymity before a public announcement.

Trump has been pushing for a nuclear agreement with Iran, while Netanyahu is wary of the diplomatic effort.

ABC News has suspended correspondent Terry Moran for calling Trump administration deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller a “world class hater” in a since-deleted social media post.

Moran's post was swiftly condemned by administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance. ABC News, in a statement, said it “stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.”

The network said Moran was suspended pending further evaluation.

Moran, in his post on X at 12:06 a.m. on Sunday, said President Trump was a hater, too. But he wrote that for Trump, his hatred is a means to an end, “and that end is his own glorification.” For Miller, “his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.”

This morning, Trump is traveling back to the White House from Camp David. Later today, at 2 p.m., he'll participate in an “Invest America Roundtable” event at the White House.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote on Truth Social at 12:16 a.m. ET.

Trump has already deployed 300 members of the National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The military said 500 Marines were on standby.

“ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m.

Trump cited Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell's recent comments to defend his response to the protests.

“Don't let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump wrote at 12:14 a.m.

“This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday.

“We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.”

Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Trump has deployed 2,000 members of the national guard. He has so far deployed 300.

High-level delegations from the U.S. and China are meeting in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that's roiled the global economy.

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng was due to hold talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at a U.K. government building.

The talks, which are expected to last at least a day, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war.

The two countries announced May 12 they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

Scores of National Institutes of Health scientists have gone public to assail deep program cuts and upheaval at their agency under the Trump administration.

On Monday, more than 90 current employees sent their leader a letter entitled the Bethesda Declaration. It's a frontal challenge to policies it says “undermine the NIH mission, waste our public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.”

By signing their names, the NIH employees gave up the veil of anonymity common in Washington — and put their jobs at risk. Their declaration was endorsed anonymously by 250 other NIH researchers and staff. Altogether, employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers registered their dismay with the agency's direction.

Trump is not backing off his battle with Elon Musk, saying Saturday that he has no desire to repair their relationship and warning that his former ally and campaign benefactor could face “serious consequences” if he tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.

Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he has no plans to make up with Musk. Asked specifically if he thought his relationship with the mega-billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is over, Trump responded, “I would assume so, yeah.”

“I'm too busy doing other things,” Trump said. 

The president also issued a warning amid chatter that Musk could back Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the 2026 midterm elections.

“If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump told NBC, though he declined to share what those consequences would be. Musk's businesses have many lucrative federal contracts.

Johnson took clear sides Sunday in Trump's breakup with mega-billionaire Elon Musk, saying Musk's criticism of the GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure, and he downplayed Musk's influence over the GOP-controlled Congress.

“I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,” Johnson said on ABC's “This Week.”

Johnson said he has exchanged text messages with Musk since he came out against the GOP bill.

Musk called it an “abomination” that would add to U.S. debts and threaten economic stability. He urged voters to flood Capitol Hill with calls to vote against the measure, which is pending in the Senate after clearing the House. His criticism sparked an angry social media back-and-forth with Trump, who told reporters over the weekend that he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk.

The speaker was dismissive of Musk's threats to finance opponents — even Democrats — of Republican members who back Trump's bill.

Early in Trump's first term, he issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty, as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.

The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

That ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.






Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched a campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.

The travel ban stems from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S.

The aim is to “protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” the administration said.

In a video posted on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terrorist attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The man charged in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump's restricted list. U.S. officials say he overstayed a tourist visa.

Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.

The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa.

The new ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the U.S. even after the ban takes effect.

            A judge on Monday dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, a major development in the ongoing civil litigation between former co-stars Lively and Baldoni.
    


            In January, Baldoni sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging that the Hollywood couple sought to “destroy” him and his career, after hijacking his film, “It Ends With Us.”
    


            Baldoni's complaint escalated the ongoing legal battle stemming from the film that Baldoni directed and co-starred in with Lively.
    


            In a statement, Lively's lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb called the ruling “a total victory and a complete vindication.”
    


            “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,” the statement added.
    


            Motions to dismiss Baldoni's claims by Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, were all granted. The judge also granted a motion to dismiss by the New York Times. Baldoni had sued the publication for $250 million for libel, claiming that the newspaper published an article “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” that relied on Lively's “self-serving narrative.”
    


            The judge ruled that Baldoni can file an amended complaint on the allegations of tortious interference with contract, relating to Reynolds and Lively, and breach of implied covenant, relating to Lively, by June 23, if they choose to do so.
    


            CNN has reached out to representatives for Baldoni and the New York Times for comment.
    


            The ongoing saga between Lively and Baldoni erupted in December 2024, when Lively first filed a civil rights complaint, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni during production of the film and then was retaliated against for speaking up about her alleged mistreatment. Baldoni immediately denied Lively's claims.
    


            Lively eventually escalated her civil rights complaint, officially filing a lawsuit against Baldoni.
    


            She alleged that after being sexually harassed with inappropriate comments and behavior on set, Baldoni's team then orchestrated a smear campaign against her to ruin her reputation in the public sphere. Lively's complaint contained hundreds of text messages between Baldoni and his crisis PR team, including one text that read they could “bury” her.
    


            The New York Times was the first to report – in an article titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” – that Lively had filed a complaint with Civil Rights Department about Baldoni's alleged conduct on set of “It End With Us” and after production. Those complaints are typically confidential.
    


            Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath, Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, and members from Baldoni's PR and crisis management team were all cited as plaintiffs on the suit against the Times.
    


            The judge's ruling did not address the merits of Baldoni's complaint but rather held that Lively's sexual harassment claims in her complaint were protected by law and could not form the basis of a defamation claim. He cited a piece of California legislation that came in response to the #MeToo movement.
    


            He also wrote in his decision that the act of providing Lively's complaint to the New York Times was not sufficient to constitute defamation “because the complaint is protected by the fair report privilege.”
    


            As their legal fight unfolded, Baldoni's team published a website containing texts and an alleged timeline relating to Lively's claims. The website, a separate leaked voice note that Baldoni sent to Lively and several public statements made by Baldoni's lawyer were the subject of several court hearings in recent months.
    


            “It Ends With Us” starred Lively and Baldoni as an on-screen couple and featured instances of domestic violence.
    


            Rumors of their fractured professional relationship began percolating during the film's 2024 press tour.

The rules don't apply to Trump on the Court's “shadow docket.”

by  Ian Millhiser

On Friday, the Supreme Court handed down a brief order permitting the Department of Government Efficiency, the enigmatic White House entity that billionaire Elon Musk previously ran, to access a wide range of sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration — including many individuals' bank account numbers and medical records. All three of the Court's Democrats dissented from the Court's order in Social Security Administration v. AFSCME.

Realistically, it was always likely that the Trump administration would eventually prevail in this case. As Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues in the administration's brief, the plaintiffs in AFSCME “do not contend that their information has been shared with parties outside the government.” Rather, this case boils down to whether the courts can second-guess the executive branch's decisions about which government employees may see data that is already held by the government. These sorts of internal management decisions typically are not subject to judicial review.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Yet, while the result in AFSCME isn't surprising, the case reveals a schism within the Court — and it highlights how the Trump administration has managed to successfully circumvent normal court procedures to quickly get their grievances before a largely sympathetic Supreme Court.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissenting opinion primarily focuses on her concerns over the rapidity with which the Court hears Trump cases, and she argues that her Republican colleagues appear to have abandoned an important limit on the Court's authority (or, at least, that they've done so when the Trump administration asks them to prematurely get involved with a case).

The AFSCME case arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the Court decides on an unusually tight schedule, without full briefing or oral argument. Prior to the first Trump administration, the Court rarely granted requests for shadow docket relief — indeed, lawyers were so discouraged from seeking shadow docket decisions that both the Bush and Obama administrations only requested it about once every other year.

That changed once President Donald Trump took office. Now, Trump's lawyers routinely approach the justices after a lower court issues a decision constraining its actions, and the justices frequently grant Trump's administration the relief it seeks — often over the dissent of the Court's Democratic minority.

But there are supposed to be rules governing when the Supreme Court may allow a litigant to bypass the normal appeals process and seek an immediate decision blocking a lower court's order. Among other things, as Jackson writes in her dissent, the government is supposed to show “that it will actually suffer concrete or irreparable harm from having to comply with the District Court's order” before it can obtain a Supreme Court decision blocking that order.

Jackson is becoming increasingly vocal about her belief that the Court should return to its prior shadow docket policy. She argues, in both her AFSCME dissent and in a similar dissent she handed down a week earlier, that her Republican colleagues have abandoned this “irreparable harm” requirement. Moreover, as she lays out in her previous dissenting opinion in Noem v. Doe, the Court took a much narrower view of its authority under the shadow docket when the Biden administration sought relief.

Moreover, the evidence laid out in Jackson's opinions suggests that her Court is applying one set of shadow docket rules to Democratic administrations and another, more favorable set of rules, to Republicans.

Prior to the first Trump administration, when a lower court ruled against someone, its order would typically remain in effect while the case was being appealed. It was possible to persuade an appeals court to suspend this order while the appeals proceeded, but appeals courts were not supposed to do so except in rare circumstances.

As the Supreme Court explained in Nken v. Holder (2009), it is not enough for a party that lost in a lower court to show that it is likely to prevail on appeal when it asks a higher court to temporarily block that lower court's decision. That party must also show that it “will be irreparably injured absent a stay.” Additionally, Nken instructs higher courts to consider whether temporarily blocking the lower court order will “substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding” or harm “the public interest.”

One reason for this “irreparably injured” requirement is that appeals courts are typically far less familiar with the details of a case than the trial court that initially decided it, especially when a party seeks emergency relief on something like the Supreme Court's shadow docket. So, if appeals courts are too eager to block lower court decisions before they fully consider the case on appeal, they are likely to hand down many wrongly decided orders.

That said, Nken recognized that it is unfair to make a litigant wait for a higher court to step in if they need immediate, time-sensitive relief to prevent them from being injured in a way that cannot be fixed by a later court decision. As Jackson writes in her Doe dissent, appeals courts are supposed to ask “whether the applicant can be made to wait until the conclusion of the litigation to vindicate their purported legal rights, or whether irreparable harm will befall the applicant in the interim such that the court must act early to stave off that damage.”

But the Supreme Court's shadow docket orders rarely even mention this irreparable harm requirement, and even when they do mention it, they typically don't explain how the Court analyzed this question. The Court's decision in Doe, which allowed Trump to strip half-a-million immigrants of their ability to live in the United States, does not mention Nken at all. The order in AFSCME quotes the Nken standard, but it does not explain why the Republican justices who joined that order believe that this standard was met.

In both cases, Jackson argues — without any rebuttal from the majority — that the Trump administration failed to show irreparable harm. In the Doe case, she points out that the administration “does not identify any specific national-security threat or foreign-policy problem that will result” if the immigrants targeted by Trump are allowed to remain in the country for a few months longer while appeals courts fully consider the issues in that case.

In the AFSCME case, it is even clearer that there is no irreparable harm. The trial court in this case found that the government “never made clear why … the DOGE Team requires unbridled access to the [personally identifiable information] of countless Americans in order to effectuate [its] responsibilities.” And when the judge asked the Trump administration to explain why DOGE needed this information right away, the government chose instead to “stand on the record in its current form.”

The Trump administration's brief to the justices in the AFSCME case devotes only a single paragraph to the question of irreparable harm, and that paragraph also doesn't explain what harm will result if the lower court's decision is not stayed. Instead, it complains that the lower court's order “impinges on the President's broad authority to direct the federal workforce, to oversee government information systems, and to require agencies to identify fraud, waste, and abuse.”

So the Trump administration, for whatever reason, chose not to even make an argument that there is irreparable harm when it brought the AFSCME case to the justices. Nevertheless, at least five of the Court's Republicans voted to block the lower court's order. (In shadow docket cases, the Court typically does not name which justices voted with the majority. So it is possible that one of the Court's six Republicans disagreed with the Court's order but chose not to make that disagreement public.)

Some justices have implicitly argued that Nken should be overruled — or, at least, that it should be modified to permit shadow docket relief in some cases where there is no irreparable harm. Concurring in Labrador v. Poe (2024), Justice Brett Kavanaugh claimed that, in many shadow docket cases, “this Court has little choice but to decide the emergency application by assessing likelihood of success on the merits.” Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined that opinion.

So Kavanaugh and Barrett, at least, have explicitly stated that there are some cases where shadow docket relief will be granted solely based on which party is likely to prevail once the case is fully litigated.

But, if you look at the Court's past behavior, it seems that the main factor determining whether Nken should be abandoned is whether the party seeking shadow docket relief is a Democrat or a Republican. In her Doe dissent, Jackson flags several cases where her Court “denied similar stay requests from federal agencies.” The primary difference between these cases and the Doe and AFSCME cases appears to be that Joe Biden was president when the Court denied these stays.

In Biden v. Texas (2022), for example, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that a Trump-appointed district judge was wrong when he ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump immigration policy that required many asylum-seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border while awaiting a hearing. But it did so after leaving that Trump judge's order in place for more than 10 months.

Similarly, in United States v. Texas (2023) the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that a Trump judge didn't even have jurisdiction to hear a case, where the judge cut off the Biden administration's authority to set enforcement priorities for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But the Court left that judge's order in place for nearly an entire year while the case was pending on appeal.

Maybe there is a nonpartisan explanation for why the Court treated Biden differently than Trump. Perhaps there were legally sound, politically neutral arguments for why Nken shouldn't apply in Doe or AFSCME. Or maybe the Republican justices have a good argument for why irreparable harm does exist in those cases — even though the Trump administration didn't even bother to argue that it exists in the AFSCME case.

But, if such an explanation exists, the Republican justices did not explain what it is. Instead, they've chosen to sit silently while Jackson levies some very serious charges against them — all while presenting evidence that strongly suggests her colleagues are rooting their shadow docket decisions in partisanship and not the law.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on the two fugitive sons of incarcerated Mexican Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman and announced a reward offer of up to $10 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the men.

The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on Archivaldo Ivan Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar who are believed to be currently located in Mexico.

Guzman's other sons — Joaquin Guzman Lopez and Ovidio Guzman Lopez — are currently incarcerated in the United States. In May, federal prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty for Joaquin Guzman Lopez if he's convicted of multiple charges in Chicago.

Sanctions were also imposed on a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the “Chapitos,” or little Chapos, which has been identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. as well as a regional network of Chapitos associates and businesses based in Mazatlan, Mexico, that allegedly engage in drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. 

According to federal prosecutors, El Chapo smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years. He was convicted in 2019 on multiple conspiracy counts and sentenced to life in a U.S. prison.

“At the Department of the Treasury, we are executing on President Trump's mandate to completely eliminate drug cartels and take on violent leaders like ‘El Chapo's' children,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.




Mexico's foreign relations office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

David Saucedo, a Mexican security analyst, said that offering financial rewards and to protect witnesses has been an important tool employed by the U.S. government in recent years. In some key cases against cartel leaders, up to 20% of the U.S. law enforcement have obtained has been through such payouts, Saucedo said.

“People inside the criminal organization betray their leaders and turn into informants,” Saucedo said. “It's this money, this ambition that authorities in the United States are using to break apart narcotrafficking organizations in Mexico.”

It's a strategy that was employed by the Biden administration and now is being used under Trump as authorities attempt to crack down on Mexican cartels.

The Sinaloa Cartel, through various incarnations, is Mexico's oldest criminal group, dating to the 1970s. One of their most lucrative businesses in recent years has been the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S. The Trump administration in February labeled the Sinaloa cartel a foreign terrorist organizations.

Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.

President Donald Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they're not gonna get away with it.”

National Guard troops were seen in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he planned to file a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump in response to the administration's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard to confront immigration protesters who took to the streets in Los Angeles.

“Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the governor of that state is illegal and immoral,” Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC on Sunday.




The streets of the sprawling city of 4 million people were quiet Monday morning, but the smell of smoke hung in the air downtown, one day after crowds blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.

While much of the city was spared from any violence, clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places. It could take days to clear the debris from burned cars and to paint over the graffitti. Sunday was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier. Others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover at one point.




Trump said Monday that the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.

Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, the president accused Newsom and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, of lying by saying Guard troops were not necessary.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote.

Newsom called on Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”

The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.

“Trump wants chaos and he's instigated violence,” he said. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for.”

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

McDonnell pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. He said his department responded as quickly as it could and had not been notified in advance of the raids.

Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and he told MSNBC that Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called Trump a “stone cold liar.”

The admonishments did not deter the administration.

“It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder Sunday morning in LA, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some demonstrators closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently. By evening, police had shut down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash-bang grenades echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.

The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” 

He said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.

Trump told reporters Sunday as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they're not going to get away with it.” 

In San Francisco, officers arrested dozens of protesters Sunday night after a group refused to disperse, police said in a statement on social media.

Officers monitoring one protest declared an unlawful assembly when people in the group became violent, the San Francisco Police Department said. Many protesters left the scene, but some remained while others moved to another area where they vandalized buildings and a police vehicle.

Border czar Tom Homan joins 'Fox & Friends' to respond to California Democrats' pushback on President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard.

President Donald Trump's decision to activate the National Guard to quell protests and riots in California over the weekend was met with objections from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the move illegal and vowed to sue the president over it.

Trump said in a proclamation that mobilizing the National Guard troops was necessary to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, who he said were being hindered from arresting illegal immigrants.

Attorney Brad Moss, who specializes in national security, told Fox News Digital the law Trump relied on to deploy the National Guard, found under Title 10, is designed to address rebellions.

"The President invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406, which affords him the authority to federalize the National Guard in response to a state of rebellion within the United States," Moss said.

The National Guard is a military force based in each state and under the dual control of governors and presidents. Governors typically have authority over their respective National Guard units, but presidents can call them into federal service in certain situations.

Moss noted that Trump left his National Guard proclamation "sufficiently vague and nondescript," including by not mentioning California or Los Angeles County in it.

Trump said he was moving 2,000 National Guard soldiers under his purview and delegating the remaining logistics to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

From there, U.S. Northern Command issued a statement saying 300 soldiers from the California Army National Guard were deployed to parts of Los Angeles County "to support the protection of federal personnel and federal property."

While presidents have looked to the National Guard as a reinforcement to protect federal personnel and property before, Trump's move was unusual because it lacked the support of the governor.

Moss said presidents can "technically" tap the National Guard without the governor's consent but that there are limitations on what the National Guard can be used for. "It is unclear how the court would resolve legal challenges here," he said.

All Democratic governors opposed Trump's move, calling it an "alarming abuse of power" in a joint statement.

Newsom took matters a step further, blaming Trump for exacerbating riots. The Democratic governor said local and state police had conditions under control but that they worsened because Trump called in the military.

"He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard. The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing," Newsom wrote on social media.

Over the weekend, Los Angeles police reported incidents of unlawful assembly outside an immigrant detention center and incidents of protesters throwing concrete bottles and other objects. Later, rioters set fire to and vandalized several self-driving cars and video showed shops being looted.

            United Natural Foods, Inc., one America's largest publicly traded health food wholesalers and the primary food distributor for Whole Foods, has taken some of its systems offline after a massive cyberattack.
    


            “We have identified unauthorized activity in our systems and have proactively taken some systems offline while we investigate,” the company said in a statement to CNN. UNFI has also contacted law enforcement for assistance and it's “assessing the unauthorized activity” and is working to its restore systems following the cyberattack.
    


            In a regulatory filing Monday, UNFI said it became aware of an incident in its information technology systems on June 5, which is causing “temporary disruptions to the company's business operations.”
    


            The company makes private label, fresh and its own branded products and ships them to more than 30,000 grocery stores, including Whole Foods. The Amazon-owned company didn't immediately respond to comment about how it's being affected.
    


            On social media, some Whole Foods customers reported they saw empty shelves. A post on Reddit shows an empty refrigerator with a sign reading the store is “experiencing a temporary out of stock issue for some products.” Another post shows smaller-than-usual deliveries to stores.
    


            UNFI signed a new distribution agreement with Whole Foods last year, extending the partnership through 2032.
    


            UNFI (UNFI) said that it's “working closely” with its suppliers and clients to to “minimize disruption as much as possible.” Shares fell more than 9% in early trading.

LONDON (AP) — High-level delegations from the United States and China met in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that has roiled the global economy,

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at Lancaster House, an ornate 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.

Wang Wentao, China's commerce minister, also was part of Beijing's delegation.

The talks, which may continue Tuesday, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war. 

The two countries announced May 12 they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

The U.S. and China are the world's biggest and second-biggest economies. Chinese trade data shows that exports to the United States fell 35% in May from a year earlier.

Since the Geneva talks, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, visas for Chinese students at American universities and " rare earth ” minerals that are vital to carmakers and other industries.

President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the following day that the trade talks would resume in London.

Rare earths were expected to be a focus of the talks. The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.




Beijing indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well as U.S. firms.

Kevin Hassett, a U.S. economic adviser, told CNBC on Monday that he expected a short meeting with “a big, strong handshake” on rare earths.

The U.K. government says it is providing the venue and logistics but is not involved in the talks, though British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves met with both Bessent and He on Sunday, and U.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds was due to meet Wang.

“We are a nation that champions free trade and have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody's interests, so we welcome these talks,” the British government said in a statement.

Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he plans to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the National Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” 

Roughly 300 National Guard members arrived in the city over the weekend, and Trump said he had authorized 2,000 members to deploy if needed.

Travel ban: As tensions continue to rise over Trump's immigration enforcement, his new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries is taking effect Monday.

The California governor and the White House have been feuding over how to handle protests in Los Angeles.

It started when Tom Homan, the border czar, warned that anyone, including public officials, would be arrested if they obstructed federal immigration enforcement.

“No one's above the law,” he said on Fox & Friends, although he added that “there was no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

The California governor responded in an interview with MSNBC.

“Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy,” Newsom said.

Trump grinned when asked about the exchange after landing at the White House.

“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump said. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job.”

Robotaxi company Waymo has suspended service in downtown Los Angeles after several of its self-driving cars were set ablaze during weekend protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids.

Waymo confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that five of its robotaxis were impacted and removed from downtown Los Angeles. The company added that it would not be operating in this area of the city for the time being — citing guidance from local law enforcement.

Waymo's services in other parts of Los Angeles county remain available. The city's protests are centered to several blocks of its downtown area.

Footage from Sunday's demonstrations showed spray-painted messages protesting ICE on these Waymo vehicles, which brought large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploded intermittently as they burned. Some demonstrators were also seen smashing windows of the robotaxis.

Waymo began offering driverless rides in Los Angeles last year. 

Federal prosecutors have charged California union leader David Jose Huerta with conspiring to impede an officer.

The 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California is currently detained and expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles Monday afternoon for a bond hearing.

In a court affidavit, a homeland security agent wrote that law enforcement officers were executing a federal search warrant Friday at a Los Angeles business suspected of hiring illegal immigrants and falsifying employment records when Huerta and others appeared to try to disrupt the operation.

A law enforcement officer approached Huerta and told him to leave, then put his hands on Huerta to move him out of the way of a vehicle, the agent wrote. The agent said Huerta pushed back and the officer pushed Huerta to the ground and arrested him.

The SEIU has planned a rally in Los Angeles for Monday.

“We demand David Huerta's immediate release and an end to these abusive workplace raids,” April Verrett, SEIU's international president, said in a statement.

Messages seeking comment were left for Huerta's attorney, Marilyn Bednarski.

After inspecting a site on the White House lawn for a future flagpole, Trump spoke to reporters about the protests in California.

“I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent,” the president said, complaining about “the little railroad he's building” that is “100 times over budget.” It's a reference to the much-delayed high-speed rail project, which predates Newsom's tenure. Trump also criticized the protestors. “The people that are causing these problems are professional agitators, they're insurrectionists, they're bad people. They should be in jail.” 

In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise.

Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places.

Trump wrote that Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary.

Perla Rios, an indigenous community leader in Los Angeles, urged legal representation and due process for the dozens of workers who were detained in the city by ICE on Friday.

Rios spoke at a conference Monday morning in Los Angeles outside of Ambiance Apparel, where ICE raids set off days of tense protests in the city. Behind her stood family members of workers detained, holding up signs saying “Immigrants make America Great,” “Liberate them all” and “We want justice” next to photos of their loved ones.

“What our families are experiencing is simply a nightmare ,” Rios said.

Tom Holman defended the ICE arrests that preceded the protests and Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blaming the California governor for stoking anti-ICE sentiments and waiting two days to declare an unlawful assembly in LA.

“He's failed that state,” Holman told Fox News on Monday morning.

Newsom dared federal officials to arrest him in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, stating, “Come after me, arrest me, let's just get it over with, tough guy.”

On Fox, Holman said there was “no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

“Donald Trump—in the midst of a war with Elon Musk and his ugly tax bill that would rip healthcare from 17 million people— is in desperate need of a diversion,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday. 

“His order to deploy the National Guard in California is unnecessary, inflammatory, and provocative. Trump should immediately revoke his command to use the National Guard, and leave the law enforcement to the governor and the mayor, who are more than capable of handling the situation.”

“Americans do not need or deserve this unnecessary and provocative chaos.”

The smell of fire hung in the air of downtown Los Angeles Monday morning. A series of ash piles littered Los Angeles Street with the charred remnants of cars set afire during protests over immigration.

The quiet in the streets was in marked contrast to several days of escalating protests over President Trump's immigration crackdown. The demonstrations intensified Sunday in the country's second-most-populous city after Trump deployed the National Guard.

Police cars from a smattering of Southern California cities were blocking streets in the downtown.

Workers swept up debris from the streets including tear gas canisters. Crews painted over graffiti that covered downtown buildings.

More demonstrations were expected in Los Angeles Monday.

“I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. 

She posted the message on X over the weekend. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.”

Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.”

However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

No president has done so since Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Johnson, unlike Trump, invoked the Insurrection Act, an 18th-century wartime law that allows presidents to deploy military forces during times of rebellion or unrest.

Trump instead relied on a similar federal law that places National Guard troops under federal command under circumstances that include the threat of rebellion.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States” — making it unclear whether the president can activate the Guard without the order of that state's governor.

Union leaders are planning a rally for downtown Los Angeles Monday to support a labor leader arrested during immigration protests.

The Service Employees International Union said Monday that the rally at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles is in support of its California president David Huerta.

Huerta was arrested Friday and expected to appear in court Monday afternoon.

The SEIU represents thousands of janitors, security officers and other workers in California. The group is also planning rallies in at least a dozen other cities spanning from Denver to New York.

Los Angeles has seen three days of protests over immigration arrests. Protests intensified after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard.

In Chicago, dozens of labor leaders, immigrant rights activists and elected officials rallied in a downtown plaza Monday in support of David Huerta, a regional president of the Service Employees International Union, who was arrested in California last week. The crowd called for Huerta's immediate release, ending speeches with chants of “Free David!”

“He was wrongfully detained,” said Genie Kastrup, president of a Chicago-based SEIU chapter. What happened to Huerta “is about more than a single leader. It is a direct assault on all of us.”

The group also called out the Trump administration's aggressive tactics on immigration enforcement, including a travel ban and arrests last week at a Chicago office used for Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins.

“We're not going anywhere. This isn't about safety. This is about control,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, who was born in Mexico. “Fear is the tactic, silence is the goal. This is not about immigration. This is about domination of all of our communities.”

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

On Sunday, protesters clashed with the National Guard in downtown LA, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire.






Confrontations began when dozens of protesters gathered outside a federal detention center demanding the release of 44 people arrested by federal immigration authorities across Los Angeles Friday, as part of Trump's mass deportation campaign.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is averaging about 1,600 arrests per day, according to the agency's head, Todd Lyons, who defended the tactics on June 2.

Mexican Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente said Monday that 42 Mexicans had been detained in raids in Los Angeles and that four had already returned to Mexico – two voluntarily and two via deportation.

“The Mexican government reiterates its unwavering commitment to the protection and defense of the human rights of Mexicans living overseas, regardless of their immigration status. In this sense, we make a respectful but firm call to United States authorities for all immigration procedures to be carried out with adherence to due process, within a framework of respect for human dignity and the rule of law.”

“We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest. Burning police cars appears to be more an act of provocation than of resistance. We condemn violence, no matter where it comes from. We call on the Mexican community to act pacifically and not allow itself to be provoked.”

“The Mexican government will continue using all diplomatic and legal channels available to express its disagreement through its consular network with practices that criminalize immigration and put at risk the safety and wellbeing of our communities in the United States.”

Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he planned to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

But Newsom said he believed the president was required to coordinate with the state's governor before ordering such a deployment.

“We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday.

The city in California is cancelling a contract that allowed federal immigration authorities to house detainees within its local jail, citing fears of undermining community trust.

In a statement Sunday night, Glendale officials said the city would formally terminate its agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“[T]he City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement noted.

Federal immigration authorities often enter into agreements with local police departments to house immigrant detainees. ICE's agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, officials said.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote on Truth Social at 12:16 a.m. ET.

Trump has already deployed 300 members of the National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The military said that 500 Marines were on standby.

“ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m.Trump cited Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell's recent comments to defend his response to the protests.

“Don't let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump wrote at 12:14 a.m.

“This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday.

“We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.”

Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Trump has deployed 2,000 members of the National Guard. He has so far deployed 300.

An Australian television journalist was hit in the leg by a nonlethal round Sunday while reporting live from downtown Los Angeles.

Video of the incident released by 9News shows correspondent Lauren Tomasi reporting live when an officer behind her suddenly raises their firearm and fires a nonlethal round at close range. Tomasi, who doesn't appear to be wearing personal protective equipment, cries out in pain and clutches her lower leg as she and her cameraman quickly move away from the police line.

“You just (expletive) shot the reporter,” a voice off-camera can be heard shouting.

The shooting came after a tense afternoon in which Tomasi and her crew were caught between riot police and protesters. At one point, she struggled to speak over the sound of clashes, while a protester grabbed the camera mid-broadcast.

“They've told people to get out of this area, and protesters have been refusing,” she reported. “We are safe here. It's just noisy. But you can see the volatility.”

Speaking later Monday to 9News, Tomasi confirmed she was safe and unharmed.

Starting Sunday morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

Sunday's protests in Los Angeles were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and making arrests of people who don't leave. Some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend of protest. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police, and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

President Donald Trump has deployed California National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to immigration protests, over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state's sovereignty was “trampled” by President Donald Trump when he ordered National Guard troops to the immigration protests in Los Angeles.

Bonta announced plans Monday to sue the Trump administration. He said the lawsuit would ask the court “to set aside the president's unlawful action federalizing the California National Guard.”

What to know:

Other protests: The Service Employees International Union says rallies are expected to take place Monday in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Denver, Harrisburg, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, OR., Raleigh-Durham, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington D.C., in addition to Los Angeles.

David Jose Huerta, the 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California, was charged with conspiring to impede an officer by federal prosecutors. Protesters gathered with signs reading “Free David Huerta.”

The president is holding an event to talk about investment accounts for newborn children, but he started by talking about the protests in Los Angeles.

“Thank goodness we sent out some wonderful National Guard,” he said.

Trump criticized California leaders by saying “they were afraid of doing anything.”

“We sent out the troops, and they've done a fantastic job.”

The photojournalist Nick Stern was covering a protest in Paramount on Saturday night when he felt a sharp pain in his right thigh — the result, he later realized, of a non-lethal round fired by officers into the crowd.

“I thought it was a live round because of the sheer intensity of the pain,” Stern told the AP. “Then I passed out from the pain.”

The projectile left a golf ball-sized wound in his thigh, requiring emergency surgery Sunday. He remained hospitalized as of Monday.

It wasn't clear which law enforcement agency fired the shot. Stern described the scene at the time as chaotic, but said there was no violence in his immediate vicinity.

“There were just a few people standing there doing nothing more than waving Mexican flags,” he said.

Hundreds of people gathered in Boston's City Hall Plaza to protest the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and the detainment of union leader David Huerta.

Protesters shouted “Come for one, come for all” and “Free David, free them all.”

People held signs reading “Massachusetts stands with our neighbors in Los Angeles” and “protect our immigrant neighbors.”

“An immigrant doesn't stand between an American worker and a good job, a billionaire does,” said Chrissy Lynch, President of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO.

She called on President Trump to call off any plans to deploy the service members to quell protests.

U.S. officials told The Associated Press there are currently about 1,000 National Guard members in L.A. under federal orders and more are flowing in all day.

Officials said that they believe that the full 2,000 that the president has put on federal Title 10 orders will be on the ground there by the end of the day. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations details. 

The Guard troops are part of the new Task Force 51, under the control of Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who is the deputy commander of U.S. Army North.

The California governor and the White House have been feuding over how to handle protests in Los Angeles.

It started when Tom Homan, the border czar, warned that anyone, including public officials, would be arrested if they obstructed federal immigration enforcement.

“No one's above the law,” he said on Fox & Friends, although he added that “there was no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

The California governor responded in an interview with MSNBC.

“Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy,” Newsom said.

Trump grinned when asked about the exchange after landing at the White House.

“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump said. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job.”

Robotaxi company Waymo has suspended service in downtown Los Angeles after several of its self-driving cars were set ablaze during weekend protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in its report that last month a driverless Waymo vehicle hit a wooden utility pole in Phoenix while it was in an alleyway and trying to perform a low-speed pullover maneuver. There were no passengers, other road users, or injuries associated with the event, the report said. (AP Photo/Matt York, File)



Waymo confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that five of its robotaxis were impacted and removed from downtown Los Angeles. The company added that it would not be operating in this area of the city for the time being — citing guidance from local law enforcement.

Waymo's services in other parts of Los Angeles county remain available. The city's protests are centered to several blocks of its downtown area.

Footage from Sunday's demonstrations showed spray-painted messages protesting ICE on these Waymo vehicles, which brought large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploded intermittently as they burned. Some demonstrators were also seen smashing windows of the robotaxis.

Waymo began offering driverless rides in Los Angeles last year. 

Federal prosecutors have charged California union leader David Jose Huerta with conspiring to impede an officer.

The 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California is currently detained and expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles Monday afternoon for a bond hearing.

In a court affidavit, a homeland security agent wrote that law enforcement officers were executing a federal search warrant Friday at a Los Angeles business suspected of hiring illegal immigrants and falsifying employment records when Huerta and others appeared to try to disrupt the operation.

A law enforcement officer approached Huerta and told him to leave, then put his hands on Huerta to move him out of the way of a vehicle, the agent wrote. The agent said Huerta pushed back and the officer pushed Huerta to the ground and arrested him.

The SEIU has planned a rally in Los Angeles for Monday.

“We demand David Huerta's immediate release and an end to these abusive workplace raids,” April Verrett, SEIU's international president, said in a statement.

Messages seeking comment were left for Huerta's attorney, Marilyn Bednarski.

After inspecting a site on the White House lawn for a future flagpole, Trump spoke to reporters about the protests in California.

“I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent,” the president said, complaining about “the little railroad he's building” that is “100 times over budget.” It's a reference to the much-delayed high-speed rail project, which predates Newsom's tenure. Trump also criticized the protestors. “The people that are causing these problems are professional agitators, they're insurrectionists, they're bad people. They should be in jail.” 

In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise.

Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places.

Trump wrote that Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary.

Perla Rios, an indigenous community leader in Los Angeles, urged legal representation and due process for the dozens of workers who were detained in the city by ICE on Friday.

Rios spoke at a conference Monday morning in Los Angeles outside of Ambiance Apparel, where ICE raids set off days of tense protests in the city. Behind her stood family members of workers detained, holding up signs saying “Immigrants make America Great,” “Liberate them all” and “We want justice” next to photos of their loved ones.

“What our families are experiencing is simply a nightmare ,” Rios said.

Tom Holman defended the ICE arrests that preceded the protests and Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blaming the California governor for stoking anti-ICE sentiments and waiting two days to declare an unlawful assembly in LA.

“He's failed that state,” Holman told Fox News on Monday morning.

Newsom dared federal officials to arrest him in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, stating, “Come after me, arrest me, let's just get it over with, tough guy.”

On Fox, Holman said there was “no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

“Donald Trump—in the midst of a war with Elon Musk and his ugly tax bill that would rip healthcare from 17 million people— is in desperate need of a diversion,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday. 

“His order to deploy the National Guard in California is unnecessary, inflammatory, and provocative. Trump should immediately revoke his command to use the National Guard, and leave the law enforcement to the governor and the mayor, who are more than capable of handling the situation.”

“Americans do not need or deserve this unnecessary and provocative chaos.”

The smell of fire hung in the air of downtown Los Angeles Monday morning. A series of ash piles littered Los Angeles Street with the charred remnants of cars set afire during protests over immigration.

The quiet in the streets was in marked contrast to several days of escalating protests over President Trump's immigration crackdown. The demonstrations intensified Sunday in the country's second-most-populous city after Trump deployed the National Guard.

Police cars from a smattering of Southern California cities were blocking streets in the downtown.

Workers swept up debris from the streets including tear gas canisters. Crews painted over graffiti that covered downtown buildings.

More demonstrations were expected in Los Angeles Monday.

“I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. 

She posted the message on X over the weekend. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.”

Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.”

However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

No president has done so since Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Johnson, unlike Trump, invoked the Insurrection Act, an 18th-century wartime law that allows presidents to deploy military forces during times of rebellion or unrest.

Trump instead relied on a similar federal law that places National Guard troops under federal command under circumstances that include the threat of rebellion.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States” — making it unclear whether the president can activate the Guard without the order of that state's governor.

Union leaders are planning a rally for downtown Los Angeles Monday to support a labor leader arrested during immigration protests.

The Service Employees International Union said Monday that the rally at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles is in support of its California president David Huerta.

Huerta was arrested Friday and expected to appear in court Monday afternoon.

The SEIU represents thousands of janitors, security officers and other workers in California. The group is also planning rallies in at least a dozen other cities spanning from Denver to New York.

Los Angeles has seen three days of protests over immigration arrests. Protests intensified after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard.

In Chicago, dozens of labor leaders, immigrant rights activists and elected officials rallied in a downtown plaza Monday in support of David Huerta, a regional president of the Service Employees International Union, who was arrested in California last week. The crowd called for Huerta's immediate release, ending speeches with chants of “Free David!”

“He was wrongfully detained,” said Genie Kastrup, president of a Chicago-based SEIU chapter. What happened to Huerta “is about more than a single leader. It is a direct assault on all of us.”

The group also called out the Trump administration's aggressive tactics on immigration enforcement, including a travel ban and arrests last week at a Chicago office used for Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins.

“We're not going anywhere. This isn't about safety. This is about control,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, who was born in Mexico. “Fear is the tactic, silence is the goal. This is not about immigration. This is about domination of all of our communities.”

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

On Sunday, protesters clashed with the National Guard in downtown LA, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire.






Confrontations began when dozens of protesters gathered outside a federal detention center demanding the release of 44 people arrested by federal immigration authorities across Los Angeles Friday, as part of Trump's mass deportation campaign.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is averaging about 1,600 arrests per day, according to the agency's head, Todd Lyons, who defended the tactics on June 2.

Mexican Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente said Monday that 42 Mexicans had been detained in raids in Los Angeles and that four had already returned to Mexico – two voluntarily and two via deportation.

“The Mexican government reiterates its unwavering commitment to the protection and defense of the human rights of Mexicans living overseas, regardless of their immigration status. In this sense, we make a respectful but firm call to United States authorities for all immigration procedures to be carried out with adherence to due process, within a framework of respect for human dignity and the rule of law.”

“We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest. Burning police cars appears to be more an act of provocation than of resistance. We condemn violence, no matter where it comes from. We call on the Mexican community to act pacifically and not allow itself to be provoked.”

“The Mexican government will continue using all diplomatic and legal channels available to express its disagreement through its consular network with practices that criminalize immigration and put at risk the safety and wellbeing of our communities in the United States.”

Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he planned to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

But Newsom said he believed the president was required to coordinate with the state's governor before ordering such a deployment.

“We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday.

The city in California is cancelling a contract that allowed federal immigration authorities to house detainees within its local jail, citing fears of undermining community trust.

In a statement Sunday night, Glendale officials said the city would formally terminate its agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“[T]he City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement noted.

Federal immigration authorities often enter into agreements with local police departments to house immigrant detainees. ICE's agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, officials said.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote on Truth Social at 12:16 a.m. ET.

Trump has already deployed 300 members of the National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The military said that 500 Marines were on standby.

“ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m.Trump cited Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell's recent comments to defend his response to the protests.

“Don't let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump wrote at 12:14 a.m.

“This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday.

“We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.”

Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Trump has deployed 2,000 members of the National Guard. He has so far deployed 300.

An Australian television journalist was hit in the leg by a nonlethal round Sunday while reporting live from downtown Los Angeles.

Video of the incident released by 9News shows correspondent Lauren Tomasi reporting live when an officer behind her suddenly raises their firearm and fires a nonlethal round at close range. Tomasi, who doesn't appear to be wearing personal protective equipment, cries out in pain and clutches her lower leg as she and her cameraman quickly move away from the police line.

“You just (expletive) shot the reporter,” a voice off-camera can be heard shouting.

The shooting came after a tense afternoon in which Tomasi and her crew were caught between riot police and protesters. At one point, she struggled to speak over the sound of clashes, while a protester grabbed the camera mid-broadcast.

“They've told people to get out of this area, and protesters have been refusing,” she reported. “We are safe here. It's just noisy. But you can see the volatility.”

Speaking later Monday to 9News, Tomasi confirmed she was safe and unharmed.

Starting Sunday morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

Sunday's protests in Los Angeles were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and making arrests of people who don't leave. Some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend of protest. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police, and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

Criminology professor Dr. Adam Lankford and former FBI special agent Nicole Parker break down the details of Travis Decker allegedly killing his three daughters on 'Sunday Night in America.'

New photos of the Washington state survivalist accused of killing his own daughters have been released as federal authorities warn he could be trying to flee to Canada following a two-week-long manhunt. 

Officials are still searching for Travis Decker, 32, nearly two weeks after his three daughters, Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5, were first reported missing and days after their bodies were discovered.

On June 7, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office released an updated wanted poster with new photos of Decker, highlighting his tattoos, haircut and wardrobe, as authorities continue to comb through large swaths of wilderness in search of the father.

Decker was last seen wearing a green or tan shirt, which he was previously photographed in, and dark shorts, according to authorities. He is described as "dangerous" with police warning he "may be armed." 

Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been combing through nearby wooded areas and structures, with the state's National Guard deploying late Friday as the search for Decker continues. 

"Law enforcement members have conducted thorough searches of the forested areas, the river, and many structures in the area that Mr. Decker was last known to be in," the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. "We continue these search efforts, acting upon gathered information and tips from the public, and leads developed through even more search warrants."

The Chelan County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Officials are also looking into the possibility that Decker, an experienced survivalist who previously spent time in the military, is attempting to flee to Canada, according to a U.S. Marshals Service affidavit obtained by Fox 13 Seattle. 

According to the affidavit, a search of Decker's Google account revealed queries such as "how does a person move to Canada," "how to relocate to Canada" and "jobs Canada." 

The U.S. Marshals with the Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

WASHINGTON STATE FATHER WANTED FOR MURDER AFTER 3 DAUGHTERS FOUND DEAD

Additionally, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson has pledged to provide helicopter transportation for officers searching in remote areas. 

"As a parent, my heart goes out to Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia's mom, Whitney, and all those who love them," Ferguson wrote on X. "The brutal murder of these young children has shocked our state. I'm committed to supporting law enforcement as they seek justice for Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia."

The girls were discovered with plastic bags over their heads and bound wrists at a Chelan County campground last week and are believed to have died from asphyxiation. Additionally, deputies found two bloody handprints on the tailgate of Decker's vehicle.

Decker's ex-wife, Whitney Decker, 35, told police that the girls had not returned from a court-ordered visit three days after a visit with their father, according to court documents. 

Decker was permitted to visit the girls every other weekend – but not overnight – according to a court-ordered parenting plan that he did not sign. When he failed to drop the girls off with their mother by the 8 p.m. curfew on Friday, May 30, his ex tried calling – but was unable to reach him, according to a Chelan County police affidavit.

The children's mother told police Decker has mental health issues – including borderline personality disorder – but had never missed a deadline to return their children following a visit. He is homeless and lives in motels and campgrounds, according to the affidavit. 

Local, state and federal officials continue to search for Decker, who is described as standing approximately 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing about 190 pounds. Authorities are unsure if Decker is armed, but insist he is considered dangerous.

Decker is charged with three counts each of aggravated first-degree murder and kidnapping. If convicted, he faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Rioters smashed windows of the Los Angeles Police Department's (LAPD's) headquarters on West 1st Street and faced tear gas that officials deployed downtown as agitators clashed with authorities in the city.

Rioters were seen targeting the LAPD headquarters on Sunday night as violent demonstrations spread through LA over the weekend in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids.

President Donald Trump sent 2,000 National Guard troops to the area on Friday.

"California politicians must call off their rioting mob," the Department of Homeland Security said in a Monday morning post on X, along with video footage from the riots. "Federal law enforcement are working to protect and safeguard American citizens from criminal illegal aliens. Why is California's governor siding with foreign criminals?"

The LAPD declared an "unlawful assembly" Sunday evening as protesters failed to disperse in the downtown area.

"Agitators have splintered into and through out [sic] the Downtown Area," the LAPD's Central Division wrote on X. "Residents, businesses and visitors to the Downtown Area should be alert and report any criminal activity. Officers are responding to several different locations to disperse crowds."

The demonstrations have drawn different responses from local and national politicians, with Democrats supporting Americans' right to protest and Republicans calling for law and order.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, said Trump had overstepped his boundaries when he deployed the National Guard to help with the anti-ICE riots, claiming "local law enforcement didn't need help."

"Let's get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn't need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway — to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded. 4) Now things are destabilized, and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump's mess," Newsom wrote in a separate post on X.

Newsom arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday evening to oversee the response to the anti-ICE riots and meet with state emergency officials.

"We're here to keep the peace — not play into Trump's political games," Newsom wrote.

Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker suggested the riots have been "peaceful" on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. He accused Trump of "sowing chaos" with his nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and called the president's move to send in troops "hypocritical at best" due to his pardoning of the January 6 Capitol rioters.

"The reality is, we see peaceful protests launching in Los Angeles," the New Jersey senator said. "A lot of these peaceful protests are being generated because the president of the United States is sowing chaos and confusion by arresting people who are showing up for their immigration hearings."

Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to "Fox News Live" on Sunday and called the move to send in the National Guard "common sense" and "basic law enforcement."

The administration is "bringing in folks to provide support so that we can do the fundamental duty of the government, which is to protect its law enforcement and its people from these violent assaults," Pompeo said.

"We do all remember the summer of ‘20 when this got out of hand and the local law enforcement and governments just let the flames burn. This can't happen this time, and you see President Trump and his team taking the actions that are both appropriate and necessary to protect people," the former Secretary of State said.

Jay Bhattacharya, the the agency's director, has made a point of welcoming dissent. A letter from his officials will test that.

Updated at 10:26 a.m. on June 9, 2025  Since winning President Donald Trump's nomination to serve as the director of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya—a health economist and prominent COVID contrarian who advocated for reopening society in the early months of the pandemic—has pledged himself to a culture of dissent. “Dissent is the very essence of science,” Bhattacharya said at his confirmation hearing in March. “I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives and create an environment where scientists, including early-career scientists and scientists that disagree with me, can express disagreement, respectfully.”



Two months into his tenure at the agency, hundreds of NIH officials are taking Bhattacharya at his word.



More than 300 officials, from across all of the NIH's 27 institutes and centers, have signed and sent a letter to Bhattacharya that condemns the changes that have thrown the agency into chaos in recent months—and calls on their director to reverse some of the most damaging shifts. Since January, the agency has been forced by Trump officials to fire thousands of its workers and rescind or withhold funding from thousands of research projects. Tomorrow, Bhattacharya is set to appear before a Senate appropriations subcommittee to discuss a proposed $18 billion slash to the NIH budget—about 40 percent of the agency's current allocation.



The letter, titled the Bethesda Declaration (a reference to the NIH's location in Bethesda, Maryland), is modeled after the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter published by Bhattacharya and two of his colleagues in October 2020 that criticized “the prevailing COVID-19 policies” and argued that it was safe—even beneficial—for most people to resume life as normal. The approach that the Great Barrington Declaration laid out was, at the time, widely denounced by public-health experts, including the World Health Organization and then–NIH director Francis Collins, as dangerous and scientifically unsound. The allusion in the NIH letter, officials told me, isn't meant glibly: “We hoped he might see himself in us as we were putting those concerns forward,” Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and one of the letter's organizers, told me.



None of the NIH officials I spoke with for this story could recall another time in their agency's history when staff have spoken out so publicly against a director. But none of them could recall, either, ever seeing the NIH so aggressively jolted away from its core mission. “It was time enough for us to speak out,” Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the National Cancer Institute, who has signed her name to the letter, told me. To preserve American research, government scientists—typically focused on scrutinizing and funding the projects most likely to advance the public's health—are now instead trying to persuade their agency's director to help them win a political fight with the White House.



In an emailed statement, Bhattacharya said, “The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.” A spokesperson for HHS also defended the policies the letter critiqued, arguing that the NIH is “working to remove ideological influence from the scientific process” and “enhancing the transparency, rigor, and reproducibility of NIH-funded research.”

The agency spends most of its nearly $48 billion budget powering science: It is the world's single-largest public funder of biomedical research. But since January, the NIH has canceled thousands of grants—originally awarded on the basis of merit—for political reasons: supporting DEI programming, having ties to universities that the administration has accused of anti-Semitism, sending resources to research initiatives in other countries, advancing scientific fields that Trump officials have deemed wasteful.



Prior to 2025, grant cancellations were virtually unheard-of. But one official at the agency, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional repercussions, told me that staff there now spend nearly as much time terminating grants as awarding them. And the few prominent projects that the agency has since been directed to fund appear either to be geared toward confirming the administration's biases on specific health conditions, or to benefit NIH leaders. “We're just becoming a weapon of the state,” another official, who signed their name anonymously to the letter, told me. “They're using grants as a lever to punish institutions and academia, and to censor and stifle science.”



NIH officials have tried to voice their concerns in other ways. At internal meetings, leaders of the agency's institutes and centers have questioned major grant-making policy shifts. Some prominent officials have resigned. Current and former NIH staffers have been holding weekly vigils in Bethesda, commemorating, in the words of the organizers, “the lives and knowledge lost through NIH cuts.” (Attendees are encouraged to wear black.)



But these efforts have done little to slow the torrent of changes at the agency. Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the NIH and one of the letter's signers, told me that the NIH fellows union, which he is part of, has sent Bhattacharya repeated requests to engage in discussion since his first week at the NIH. “All of those have been ignored,” Morgan said. By formalizing their objections and signing their names to them, officials told me, they hope that Bhattacharya will finally feel compelled to respond. (To add to the public pressure, Jeremy Berg, who led the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences until 2011, is also organizing a public letter of support for the Bethesda Declaration, in partnership with Stand Up for Science, which has organized rallies in support of research.)



Scientists elsewhere at HHS, which oversees the NIH, have become unusually public in defying political leadership, too. Last month, after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—in a bizarre departure from precedent—announced on social media that he was sidestepping his own agency, the CDC, and purging COVID shots from the childhood-immunization schedule, CDC officials chose to retain the vaccines in their recommendations, under the condition of shared decision making with a health-care provider.



Many signers of the Bethesda letter are hopeful that Bhattacharya, “as a scientist, has some of the same values as us,” Benjamin Feldman, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told me. Perhaps, with his academic credentials and commitment to evidence, he'll be willing to aid in the pushback against the administration's overall attacks on science, and defend the agency's ability to power research.



But other officials I spoke with weren't so optimistic. Many at the NIH now feel they work in a “culture of fear,” Norton said. Since January, NIH officials have told me that they have been screamed at and bullied by HHS personnel pushing for policy changes; some of the NIH leaders who have been most outspoken against leadership have also been forcibly reassigned to irrelevant positions. At one point, Norton said, after she fought for a program focused on researcher diversity, some members of NIH leadership came to her office and cautioned her that they didn't want to see her on the next list of mass firings. (In conversations with me, all of the named officials I spoke with emphasized that they were speaking in their personal capacity, and not for the NIH.)



Bhattacharya, who took over only two months ago, hasn't been the Trump appointee driving most of the decisions affecting the NIH—and therefore might not have the power to reverse or overrule them. HHS officials have pressured agency leadership to defy court orders, as I've reported; mass cullings of grants have been overseen by DOGE. And as much as Bhattacharya might welcome dissent, he so far seems unmoved by it.



In early May, Berg emailed Bhattacharya to express alarm over the NIH's severe slowdown in grant making, and to remind him of his responsibilities as director to responsibly shepherd the funds Congress had appropriated to the agency. The next morning, according to the exchange shared with me by Berg, Bhattacharya replied saying that, “contrary to the assertion you make in the letter,” his job was to ensure that the NIH's money would be spent on projects that advance American health, rather than “on ideological boondoggles and on dangerous research.” And at a recent NIH town hall, Bhattacharya dismissed one staffer's concerns that the Trump administration was purging the identifying variable of gender from scientific research. (Years of evidence back its use.) He echoed, instead, the Trump talking point that “sex is a very cleanly defined variable,” and argued that gender shouldn't be included as “a routine question in order to make an ideological point.”

 The officials I spoke with had few clear plans for what to do if their letter goes unheeded by leadership. Inside the agency, most see few levers left to pull. At the town hall, Bhattacharya also endorsed the highly contentious notion that human research started the pandemic—and noted that NIH-funded science, specifically, might have been to blame. When dozens of staffers stood and left the auditorium in protest, prompting applause that interrupted Bhattacharya, he simply smiled. “It's nice to have free speech,” he said, before carrying right on.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump implementing a travel ban on several countries and signing a proclamation restricting foreign students at Harvard. 

President Donald Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 African, Middle Eastern and South American countries went into effect on Monday.

The ban, signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa.

The order does not cancel visas that have already been issued to citizens of the countries, and those who possess them will remain free to travel to the U.S.

The president said on X the travel ban was being introduced after a terror attack against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, last weekend, allegedly by an Egyptian man who had overstayed his visa.

In a White House fact sheet, Trump said, "We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country."

This point was backed by the State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott. In a briefing last week, Pigott said, "This is a national security imperative."

"We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States," Trump said before signing the ban.

"That is why today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya and numerous others," he concluded. "We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm, and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe."

A major Los Angeles suburb revoked its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to public backlash to federal agents seeking to carry out the Trump administration's deportation agenda by detaining illegal immigrants.

Officials in Glendale, California, announced the decision to abruptly cancel its ICE detainee holding contract late Sunday evening as riots over ICE activity rocked Los Angeles, leading President Donald Trump to send in the National Guard.

City officials said they were canceling the contract, which allows federal authorities to hold suspected illegal immigrants in local jails, after it had been in place for nearly 20 years.

“The City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” local officials wrote in a press release. “And while opinions on this issue may vary—the decision to terminate this contract is not politically driven. It is rooted in what this City stands for—public safety, local accountability, and trust.”

“It is also our duty to ensure that Glendale's residents and businesses do not suffer the consequences of the unruly and unlawful behavior of others,” the announcement continues. “Moving forward, the facility will continue to serve local law enforcement needs without participation in federal detention efforts.”

Glendale City Manager Roubik Golanian made the decision due to “evaluation of legal, operational, and community considerations,” per the press release.

Some families may face greater difficulty visiting family members held by ICE, and access to legal counsel for detainees may be more limited, the city, which is the fourth-largest in Los Angeles County, said.

Since roughly the start of the Trump administration, 82 people have been detained by ICE and housed in the Glendale City Jail, according to NBC Los Angeles.

Violent protests broke out in Los Angeles over the weekend as ICE worked to remove illegal immigrants in the area.

Democrats have decried ICE's activity in the Golden State, while condemning the Trump administration's efforts this weekend to target demonstrators as unduly harsh. 

Top California officials, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have blamed Trump for the protests. Rep. Norma Torres (D-CA) accused ICE of inciting the violence in the area, telling federal agents on Friday evening to “get the f*** out of LA so that order can be restored.” 

Republicans have denied that ICE is to blame and rejected claims that the Trump administration's response to the riots has been unnecessarily heavy-handed. 

Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) compared the unrest to the nationwide riots following the death of George Floyd in 2020.

“We watched this kind of scene five, six years ago, when there was a takeover in the northwest, around Seattle and Portland, when we watched all that happen, and local law enforcement was being challenged over and over again,” Lankford said. “It finally took a National Guard presence to be able to bring it down after weeks. What President Trump is trying to do is say, ‘This is not going to take weeks this time.'”

“We're not going to allow this to be able to spiral out of control,” Lankford added. “This is an American city, and to be able to have an American city where we have people literally flying Mexican flags and saying, ‘You cannot arrest us,' cannot be allowed. If someone violates the law, no matter what state that they're in, they're in violation of a federal law. They should face consequences for that.”

            The US Department of Education is paying more than $7 million a month to employees it has forced to go on leave, according to analysis from the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, the union that represents department employees.
    


            The payments could continue for years amid a long court battle over cuts instituted by the Trump administration.
    


            The department has already paid more than $21 million to idle employees over the last three months, AFGE has calculated, after they were terminated in March when the agency cut nearly half of its workforce. Roughly 1,300 people were laid off and hundreds more took voluntary “buyouts.”
    


            The firings were part of President Donald Trump's larger plan to dismantle the Department of Education and promise to deliver efficiencies through cuts across government. Dozens of other agencies have faced cuts in recent months, with workers in those departments facing similar situations.
    


            Under the terms of the layoffs, affected Department of Education workers were to be paid their salaries until June 9, their last day of employment.

            However, following a May federal court decision blocking White House plans to shut down the agency, the workers were reinstated and placed on “administrative leave” — meaning they are employed but not allowed to work — as lawsuits continue.
    


            This means salary payments will now continue past Monday, while employees remain in what many describe as “administrative purgatory,” racking up further costs for the department.
    


            According to AFGE Local 252, which analyzed over 900 salaries of affected employees, the true cost to the Department of Education is well over $7 million a month as the figure does not include employee benefits or managers' pay.
    


            The cuts were billed as a drive for government savings. When announcing the layoffs in March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said they reflected the agency's “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.”
    


            Critics point out that it has instead generated wasteful costs with no returns when employees continue getting paid for not working.
    


            Meanwhile, numerous employees on administrative leave who are members of Local 252 told CNN they feel embarrassed collecting a paycheck.
    


            After her termination in March, Ariel Shepetovskiy, a Department of Education lawyer, lost access to computer systems and email accounts needed to do her work.
    


            Now on administrative leave, “it feels like garbage to receive pay in exchange for doing nothing,” Shepetovskiy said. “I also feel shame because on some level I feel like a parasite for American taxpayers.”
    


            But, she said, “If I leave my position then there's no chance of me ever being able to do my job again.”
    


            She is holding on despite the uncertainties because she has hope that employees could be brought back, she said.
    


            “I'm trying to do my best to be productive, but I am also sad. I am frustrated and upset every day.”
    


            Robert Jason Cottrell, a data coordinator with the department, also expressed frustration — wanting, but unable — to work. “I feel like I am on welfare,” he said. “I almost feel like a leech on the system. I am able-bodied and able to go into work to help the nation's mission to educate our future generations. And I'm not doing that right now.”
    


            CNN has asked the Department of Education for comment.

            In an email to staff reviewed by CNN, the agency told workers Friday that they would continue to be employed, and that it was assessing how to “reintegrate you back to the office in the most seamless way possible.”
    


            “This includes evaluating necessary updates to security access, technology, and workspaces to ensure full operability,” the email said.
    


            Dozens of government agencies are involved in lawsuits challenging White House directives cutting their workforce, with workers similarly placed on administrative leave and unable to work across Washington.



            As lawsuits drag on, agencies have offered buyouts or settlements to encourage workers to leave.
    


            In recent weeks, some Department of Education employees say they were offered settlements in exchange for resigning their positions. Several employees given the offer told CNN they had cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board, or MSPB, a government office that civil servants can use to appeal personnel disputes.
    


            Settlement offers reviewed by CNN would pay for these employees through September if they drop their cases and quit.
    


            Some who received the offers described them as feeling “scammy” and like being plied with “sweet talk” upon receiving them.
    


            Sheria Smith, president of AFGE Local 252 in Dallas, felt the deals amounted to attempts to “intimidate great public servants to leave their jobs.”
    


            Smith, who was laid off in March, said she has heard from over a dozen employees who were approached with these offers in the past two weeks.
    


            Victoria DeLano, who is on administrative leave, said the settlement would mean giving up the option to be reinstated. “I am not giving up that option,” she said. “So many of us are just holding on because we know how important this work is.”

What is “coercive control”?

by  Aja Romano

Among all the lurid details and allegations that have surfaced in Sean “Diddy” Combs's trial on federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, one potential aspect of the music mogul's relationships has flown under the radar. 

What we haven't heard on the witness stand is a concept crucial to understanding intimate partner violence and how individual incidents can form a pattern of abuse over time. That pattern, described by sociologists as “coercive control,” may have played a major role in Diddy's relationships — but it won't play a major role in the trial. 

Generally speaking, “coercive control” is a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse over time. It is criminalized in the UK, and seven states have passed laws that say coercive control is a form of domestic violence, though how they're applied varies by state. US courts have been slow to adopt the concept, and Judge Arun Subramanian, overseeing Combs's trial in New York City's federal district court, blocked the prosecution's expert on domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV), from testifying specifically about coercive control. 

That leaves the prosecution and all witnesses walking a very interesting line in their presentation of the evidence against Combs, who has pleaded not guilty. While “coercive control” isn't a widely recognized legal concept in the US, “coercion” as an individual act is. Typically described in the US legal code as being compelled, forced, or threatened to act in a specific way, it's a crucial pillar of several of the legal charges being brought against Combs. 

Additionally, if the jury can't hear testimony about the impact of long-term abuse and toxic environments on survivors over time, will they be able to understand why so many of the people testifying against Combs now spent years, even decades, working for him and/or entertaining positive relationships with him?

The case serves as a reminder that, despite having been known to IPV prevention researchers for decades, “coercive control” is still a little-known term to the public. While it's an important concept for expanding how we think about intimate partner abuse beyond acts of physical violence, some experts say its highly murky legal status is warranted. 

That ambiguity, however, makes it hard to talk about ways an alleged abuser might exert control over survivors that aren't always obvious. Many of those methods have surfaced in the Combs trial. That gives us a major opportunity to understand what coercive control is — and the ways in which it's being tried and tested in court.

The term “coercive control,” reportedly first coined and promoted by the late social worker Susan Schechter, has existed in the fields of domestic violence prevention and feminist circles since the '80s. “There is no single word to describe the full range of controlling behavior,” Schechter and her co-author Ann Jones wrote in their 1993 book When Love Goes Wrong in a section indexed as “coercive control.” 

They write that many controlling abusers “never use force” and note controlling behaviors, such as “deliberately throwing a partner into mental confusion and anxiety, and tearing a partner down emotionally.”

If you or anyone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence (IPV), there are people who want to help.

Since the late 20th century, the phrase “battered woman syndrome” has been used in court to describe the psychological effects of IPV on women, which can include trauma and cognitive defects. While still in wide use in courtrooms as a legal defense, the concept has long been a source of debate, with many experts framing it as part of general PTSD or using the gender-neutral phrase “battering and its effects” instead. Legal advocates have argued for decades for a better descriptor, one that emphasizes nonphysical forms of abuse as well as physical abuse. 

Enter “coercive control.” Experts like Schechter and the late Evan Stark have helped mainstream the phrase as an alternative concept, one that more clearly acknowledges the ways abusive partners often use nonviolent abusive tactics, such as emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, threats, and unpredictable behavior, to influence and control their situations. Research has shown that coercive control is present in up to 58 percent of relationships where IPV occurs, and even nonviolent coercive control engenders PTSD, depression, and ongoing fear in survivors.

Understanding that such patterns exist helps us understand intimate partner violence, especially in answering questions like “why didn't the victim just leave?” when “just leaving” is not so simple. But because coercive control is coercive, and coercion is often hard to pin down, it's also a somewhat slippery legal concept. There's not much precedent in the US court system for a discussion of coercive control as an ongoing pattern of abuse. There's also debate among experts about whether trying to codify it is ultimately helpful or harmful — manipulation and gaslighting can be harder to identify than physical abuse or explicit threats as well as easier for abusers to turn around and use to accuse their victims. 

The charges against Combs are a bit tricky, which isn't unusual for a racketeering case. Combs is charged with two counts of sex trafficking, two counts of transporting people across state lines for sex work, and one count of “racketeering conspiracy,” which is a broader charge than racketeering itself and merely requires the guilty party to have agreed to participate in any of a litany of crimes that fall under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization ACT, commonly known as RICO laws. 

In this case, those alleged crimes include forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, sex trafficking, and obstruction of justice — all acts that witnesses have testified to having seen Diddy commit or experienced themselves while with him. 

In all three charges, the legal concept of coercion plays a major role. It's part of the criteria that must be met to prove illegal sex trafficking: Per the federal statute under which Combs is charged, any use of “force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion” to induce people to engage in sex work violates the law. Similar wording and logic apply to the transportation charge. If Combs used coercion to get people to travel across state lines for the purposes of sex work, he could be guilty. 

But an understanding of coercion can be very different based on different contexts. In the case of this trial, Judge Subramanian seems to be allowing discussion related to alleged individual moments of actual physical coercion, violent coercion, or the implied threat of physical harm to a target or others close to them. 

The prosecution's domestic violence expert, clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes, was able to discuss elements of IPV on the witness stand, such as trauma bonding and reasons why survivors stay with their abusers — but she was prohibited from discussing how long-term coercive control can impact them and their reasoning.

“There's so much physical violence in this case, and I think it's easy to extrapolate how fear of physical violence could coerce somebody into making choices,” Courtney Cross, who runs a law clinic for abuse and IPV survivors at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, told me. “But coercive control itself as a dynamic is way less about the physical violence and so much more about that web of nonphysical tactics of abuse.” 

Since testimony in the case kicked off May 12, we've already heard plenty of evidence pointing to physical coercion or the threat of it. Combs's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, played an inadvertent role in jump-starting the federal investigation into Combs when 2016 surveillance footage surfaced in 2023 showing Combs violently beating her in a hotel hallway. 

Ventura testified over several days on the witness stand that during their 11-year relationship, Combs frequently physically assaulted her, threatened her with violence, and dangled the possibility of leaking filmed sex footage of her to the public (which might be considered “revenge porn” or a form of image-based abuse). Multiple witnesses have corroborated Ventura's testimony with their own accounts of having seen or heard Combs abuse Ventura. Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura's, testified that Combs once threatened her in Ventura's 17th-story apartment by hoisting her to the balcony ledge. After yelling at her, he allegedly threw her into the balcony furniture, causing wounds and bruises to her legs.

What's perhaps even more striking, however, is the bigger picture that emerges from all of this witness testimony: an environment, in both Combs's working relationships and his intimate ones, of fear, paranoia, and unpredictable outbursts of temper. 

One longtime staffer, Capricorn Clark, testified that Combs issued a death threat to her on the first day she worked for him, physically assaulted her, and at one point kidnapped her, forcing her to come with him to track down Ventura's boyfriend. (The boyfriend was musician Kid Cudi, whose Porsche Combs is also accused of firebombing.) She as well as another former staffer have each testified to having been required to take polygraph tests by Combs to keep their jobs. 

Another former staffer, testifying under the pseudonym Mia, recounted being pressured to reside mainly with Combs at his residences, where she said she was then not permitted to lock her bedroom door or leave the property. At one point, she alleged on the stand, Combs began a pattern of intermittently sexually assaulting her over the eight years she worked for him.

The physical abuses that Combs allegedly inflicted are covered in the trial and are on their own horrific enough. But what's left unexplained is the mental and emotional anguish that a pattern of coercive control creates. Having rules about where and how to live, the implicit invasion of privacy that comes with a forced polygraph test or not being allowed to lock a door; these things could add up to a sense that a person does not have agency over their own life. 

All of these moments arguably create a pattern of abuse and manipulation by Combs — the hallmarks of coercive control that the witnesses seem to have lived with and experienced, even if they can't refer to it by name in the courtroom. 

So far, the only area of the legal system where coercive control has made inroads is the family court system — and the few states that do have laws on the books often have harrowing stories that put them there. 

Take Jennifer's Law, for instance, the 2021 Connecticut law criminalizing coercive control. It was named in part for Jennifer Magnano, a mother of three who was shot and killed in 2007 by her estranged husband. The murder occurred shortly after a judge ordered Magnano, who had fled the state, to return with her kids for a custody hearing, ignoring her claims of having experienced over a decade of abuse. The Connecticut law now defines coercive control and increases protections for people experiencing it while ensuring they don't have to testify in person before someone they are being protected against.

Yet even with these stiffer types of legal protections in place, problems abound. To someone experiencing coercive control, it's often the nonphysical meanings of “coerce” that can exert the most power and have the longest-lasting psychological effects. But courts may fail to recognize highly individualized acts of coercion because they're looking for signs of physical violence or threats. 

Additionally, just as abusers often use DARVO tactics (in which an abuser paints themselves as the wronged party using a strategy of “deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender”) to get authorities on their sides, coercive control patterns can be used against survivors in similar ways. Abuse victims can and often do react to their abusers with self-defense, or reactive violence. Their abusers will often use this reactivity to their advantage with authorities, rendering abuse victims vulnerable to being targeted by the same laws put in place to protect them. Think of it like a zero-tolerance policy in a school that punishes the bully and their victim equally without questioning who has the power and who is the target of abuse.

Cross has argued against passing laws criminalizing coercive control in favor of expanding resources to empower survivors who are trying to escape abusive situations. She points out that, unlike the UK, the US lacks a system of robust resources, rigorous risk assessment, and training around the issue that could help authorities identify it when they see it — and seeing it at all is the first challenge.

“You would need professionals to be able to see it differently in different people and validate that and understand how to respond to that,” Cross said. Rather than the courts trying to address coercive control after it's already established as a pattern, Cross explained what we need is “a wholesale societal reorganization to be able to take care of people.” 

And most of all, what we need is money. 

“People are trying really hard to meet this massive demand, but there aren't nearly enough supportive resources for anybody, including DV survivors, especially the most marginal DV survivors,” she said.

One thing that makes coercive control particularly complicated, Cross said, “is that to recognize and respond to it, we have to see it in ourselves” — and culturally, many of the traits that often comprise an abusive personality begin as highly lauded attributes, such as confidence, forcefulness, or invulnerability.

“We don't want to see that sometimes we do shitty and manipulative things and that maybe that crosses a line,” Cross said. “We don't want to see that we may have and take advantage of power differentials with our partners and people we love. I think to really understand coercive control, we have to be willing to look inside of ourselves, and people don't want to do that.” 

Cross pointed out that while coercive control isn't under discussion on the witness stand, it is on full display throughout the Diddy trial itself. 

“There is such an obvious analogy to me between the idea of this enterprise and the way that it relies on power and control and using fear to regulate and enforce the enterprise,” she said. “It may not be fraud, extortion, and bribery per se, but the emotional and psychological abuse amounts to a pretty similar outcome on an interpersonal level.” 

Essentially, organized crime and similar organized illegal systems exert pressure on their members, at scale, that resembles coercive control. While this context may not be made explicit in court, it's hard to ignore the similarities — and harder to ignore the possibility that this approach to relationships may have helped Combs hide in plain sight all along.

            Deep in the sweltering jungles of central Laos, a 4,500-foot stretch of cracked concrete cuts through the trees — an airstrip without an airport, in a village where many have never been on a plane.
    


            But behind its crumbling control tower and bomb-cratered runway lies a hidden chapter of America's Cold War history — a site once known as “the most secret place on Earth.”
    


            The village of Long Tieng sits in central Laos, about 80 miles northeast of the capital, Vientiane. Today, it's a sleepy settlement of a few thousand people who mostly rely on the land to carve out a living.
    


            There are a couple of restaurants, two guesthouses and a handful of multipurpose shops selling everything from rice to farming tools made from repurposed bombshell metal — a nod to the village's agricultural roots and wartime past.
    


            At the village center lies the airstrip. It no longer serves aircraft, instead now functioning as a kind of outdoor community center: children ride scooters, farmers herd cattle and elderly villagers take early morning strolls before the intense heat engulfs the valley.
    


            But 50 years ago, the scene was vastly different.
    


            From the 1960s to the early 1970s, Laos played a central role in the United States' fight to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. Long Tieng was the secret headquarters of a US-backed Hmong anti-communist army fighting against the communist Pathet Lao forces, which were supported by the North Vietnamese Army.
    


            At its height, tens of thousands of inhabitants — Hmong soldiers, their families, refugees from other parts of Laos, Thai soldiers and a small contingent of American CIA operatives and secret US Air Force pilots, dubbed “Ravens” — called this place home. It was the heart of the largest paramilitary operation ever conducted by the CIA.
    


            At one point in time, the tiny airstrip handled 900 daily take-offs and landings, making it one of the busiest airports in the world. Cargo planes would offload crucial supplies including ammunition and food, which would then be loaded onto smaller planes that flew to even smaller airstrips around the country.
    


            Despite the scale of the base, it was so secret even some of those participating in the war in other locations did not know of its existence, says Paul Carter, a Laos Secret War specialist who lives in Southeast Asia.
    


            “The war in Laos was so compartmentalized … I knew guys who participated in that war, they did not even know Long Tieng existed until the late 1960s when they started letting the reporters in there,” he tells CNN.
    


            From this remote mountain village, the CIA-backed Hmong army, led by the charismatic General Vang Pao, fought not only the communist Pathet Lao forces but also conducted guerrilla operations — destroying North Vietnamese supply depots, blowing up critical supply routes and generally harassing communist forces — all with full support from the US.
    


            As part of this secret war, the US launched a brutal bombing campaign that paralleled its broader military operations in Vietnam. And because international agreements barred direct military involvement in Laos, the effort fell almost entirely on the CIA.
    


            American pilots flew thousands of missions from Long Tieng's airstrip, which was known by the codenames Lima Site 98 and Lima Site 20A.
    


            Fifty years after the fall of Long Tieng in 1975, I set out to explore the remnants of the US presence in the area.
    


            I was drawn here after reading the book, “A Great Place to Have a War” by Joshua Kurlantzick. It pulled me into a world I'd never known — a hidden Cold War battleground on the sidelines of the Vietnam War. Watching old, grainy newsreels of reporters wandering around the base only deepened my fascination. Somewhere along the way, I realized I needed to see Long Tieng with my own eyes.
    


            Before long, I find myself in Vientiane with an old college friend who I've convinced to come along for an adventure and Mr. Pao — the only driver I could find with a car suitable for the journey.
    


            Pao says he used to work at the mines near Long Tieng and is familiar with the area, though he admits he's only visited the village once before.
    


            Several tour companies organize trips, but the number of tourists that visit Long Tieng still pales in comparison to Laos' major tourist destinations like Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng.
    


            Chris Corbett, owner of Laos Adv Tours and Rentals, tells CNN that his company operates around 10 motorbike tours a year to the site, taking a total of around 40 people to the village. He said his guests mainly come from the United States, Australia and Europe.
    


            Today, the village remains largely cut off from the rest of the country. Though just 80 miles from Vientiane, the drive takes over eight hours.
    


            Beyond the capital's outskirts, roads quickly degrade — first into unsealed dirt tracks, then into rugged mining roads scarred by landslides and potholes.
    


            Visibility is often poor — dust kicked up by mining trucks combines with smoke from slash-and-burn agriculture. At times, we crawl forward, barely reaching 5 mph.
    


            Part of the road winds over a rugged mountain pass with no guardrails, just a sheer drop into the valley below. Sitting in the back of the car, I grip the seat in front of me as our driver edges closer to the cliffside, the tires skimming loose gravel.
    


            At one point, our driver glances back and warns us that if we get a flat tire out here, we'll likely be stuck for a long time — maybe hours. There's no phone signal. We nod silently and keep going.
    


            As we approach Long Tieng, the rough dirt road suddenly gives way to smooth pavement. Cresting the final mountain pass, we expect to glimpse the airstrip — but thick smoke shrouds the valley, limiting visibility to a few hundred meters.
    


            Descending into the village as the sun sets, there's little sign that 30,000 people once lived here. Family farms now occupy land once filled with barracks and command centers. Military convoys have long been replaced by scooters and cattle.
    


            We stay in a guesthouse next to the airstrip. It's barebones — a wooden bed and a single creaky fan that spins with little effect. There's no air conditioning, and the humid air hangs heavy and unmoving. It's hard to sleep — not just because of the heat, but because I can't stop thinking about what this place had once been.
    


            The next morning, we walk down the center of the airstrip as the sun rises over the valley. Once one of the busiest runways in the world, it now lies silent. Tall grass sprouts from potholes left by artillery strikes. The crumbling control tower is only half its original height, and the hangars at the far end sit abandoned — rusting reminders of a war long past.
    


            As I walk along its length, I notice the absence of signposts, statues or any form of commemoration. Despite the airstrip's historical importance, there's nothing to mark it.
    


            Among those who operated out of Long Tieng during the war were the Ravens, a secret group of active-duty Air Force pilots who volunteered to serve in Laos. Their primary role was to act as forward air controllers (FACs), flying low behind enemy lines to identify and mark targets for US Air Force bombers.
    


            “They were just kind of taken off the books,” Carter says. “They operated under a different cover.“
    


            The Ravens wore civilian clothing and were issued US Embassy ID cards. In some cases, Carter notes, pilots were also issued US Agency for International Development (USAID) identity cards.
    


            The Ravens often flew in pairs — an American pilot in front and a local Hmong “backseater” who communicated with ground forces.
    


            But they weren't alone over the skies of Laos. Pilots from Air America, a secret CIA-owned airline, also operated in Long Tieng; they flew in crucial supplies to the base and conducted daring search and rescue missions to recover downed pilots deep behind enemy lines.
    


            “I landed there pretty much every other day,” Neil Hansen, a pilot stationed in Laos during part of the war, tells CNN.
    


            Hansen worked for Air America between 1964 and 1973 and detailed his experience in the book, “FLIGHT: An Air America Pilot's Story of Adventure, Descent and Redemption.”
    


            “I was flying a C-123, bringing in munitions, supplies and fuel for ‘the little birds,' which would then distribute it to other sites,” Hansen recalls. As part of his mission, he also transported “CIA customers.”
    


            During one flight in 1972, Hansen was shot down over the Plateau de Bolevan in southern Laos.
    


            “After getting my crew out and bailing out, I watched the C-123 fall out of the sky and explode,” he says, noting he was rescued by Air America helicopters shortly after.  



            About 100 meters west of the airstrip stands a two-story house that once served as the headquarters of General Vang Pao, the leader of the CIA-backed Hmong army. From this remote compound, Pao worked closely with American operatives to coordinate a covert war, marshaling thousands of Hmong fighters while receiving US air support, weapons and humanitarian aid in return.
    


            Set behind a tall fence and overgrown garden, the house still feels separated from the rest of the village — distant, guarded. A sign on the front door, written in English, reads: “No entry without permission.” It's the only English sign we've seen in the entire village, and it stops us in our tracks. With no one around, we circle the property, peering through dusty windows, unsure whether we can get inside.
    


            An older man in weathered military fatigues appears nearby. Without saying a word, he approaches, slowly dangling a key in front of our faces. He doesn't speak English, but types out a number on his phone. We nod and hand over the cash. A moment later, we're inside.
    


            The house is not what I expected. I'd imagined a preserved time capsule, cluttered with mementos or forgotten artifacts — but the rooms are eerily empty. No furniture, no decorations, no posters or portraits of the general. In the foyer, dozens of artillery shells are stacked neatly in one corner, with several mortar rounds resting nearby. It's surreal to see these instruments of war arranged with such quiet precision. Through a translation app, the man warns us not to touch anything — some might still be live.
    


            Upstairs, a single wooden desk and chair have been placed near a panoramic window facing the airstrip. I sit down, imagining General Vang Pao and CIA officers in this very spot, directing B-52 bombing runs on communist strongholds. The war — so vast, so devastating — had largely been coordinated from this small, simple room. It was almost impossible to reconcile the scale of the conflict with the modesty of this setting.
    


            We climb up to the roof. From there, the view stretches across the old airstrip and into the mountains that once shielded Long Tieng from attack. Today, the village is quiet. A few people walk slowly down the main road. Stray dogs nap in the sun. It's hard to believe that tens of thousands of people once lived here.
    


            Today, the impacts of the intense US bombing campaign on Laos are still being felt. Of the 270 million sub-munitions dropped on the country, an estimated 30% did not detonate, according to the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). These unexploded ordnances continue to kill, injure and hinder development across the country, according to MAG.
    


            Around the hills of Long Tieng, villagers still rarely venture off established roads and trails to avoid unexploded munitions.
    


            Full US-Laos relations were restored in 1992 and since 1995, the US has invested more than $390 million in a Conventional Weapons Destruction program aimed at addressing the legacy of the war. However, questions remain about future US funding of explosive ordinance clearance in Southeast Asia following the Trump administration's widespread suspension of foreign aid.
    


            “I fell in love with Laos,” says Hansen. “I look back on my time as exciting and a place where I could immerse myself in the culture. I was fulfilling a purpose where I knew I was accomplishing something that was needed.”
    


            Back in Long Tieng, children riding scooters zoom past my friend and me, their tires bumping over the broken concrete that once launched warplanes into the sky.
    


            I now understand why the community gravitates toward the airstrip whenever they can: it's one of the few open spaces cleared of unexploded ordnance.
    


            A rare place where children can play without fear of becoming another casualty of a war that ended 50 years ago.
    


            The legacy of a secret conflict — barely remembered back in the United States.

Rioters in Los Angeles, objecting to the efforts to deport illegal immigrants in the United States, have plagued the city with violence for three days, including assaulting law enforcement officers and federal agency officials, setting Waymo vehicles on fire, and other criminal acts.

The destruction and violence have led President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the National Guard deployment on his X account and warned that if the violence continues, Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton, California, were on high alert and would also be deployed.

It was a decision that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed with and called “common sense.” He spoke about the decision in a Sunday segment on Fox News Live.

“This is common sense. This is basic law enforcement,” Pompeo said. “What the secretary of defense is talking about is bringing in folks to provide support so we can do the fundamental duty of the government, which is to protect its law enforcement officers and the people from these violent assaults.”

Pompeo also referenced the summer of 2020 in the U.S., in which rioters devastated cities throughout the country.

“We do all remember the summer of '20 where this got out of hand, where local law enforcement and governors just let the flames burn,” Pompeo said. “This can't happen this time. And you see President Trump and his team taking the actions that are both appropriate and necessary to protect people.”

The former CIA director stressed the importance of ensuring that people in the country are here legally. He expressed the need for such people to be allowed to do their jobs without being attacked.

“If we don't support the folks who are doing the important work of securing our southern border, making sure everyone who is here is here lawfully, and then keeping people and property protected and safe, we'll end up in a very bad place again,” Pompeo said. “And that is not good for the United States of America.”

“When you let completely unvettable … people who you just … don't know who they are, when you let them into our country by the hundreds, you get precisely what you're seeing in Southern California today,” Pompeo added.

Democratic politicians in California, particularly Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), were heavily critical of the deportation efforts.

NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE ‘EVERYWHERE' IN LA, TRUMP SAYS

“As mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our society in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city.”

“Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” Newsom said. “Donald Trump's chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America's economy.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) responded to Tom Homan‘s warning on Sunday that obstructing immigration enforcement would lead to an arrest of “anybody,” telling the White House “border czar” to come arrest him.

“Come after me. Arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy. I don't give a damn,” Newsom told NBC News on Sunday night.

The California governor defended the illegal immigrant population of Los Angeles, which was targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a wave of raids late last week, spurring violent protests across the city.

Newsom said Homan needs to leave alone the “poor people just trying to live their lives” and insisted that the state needs to “push back” against the Trump administration, which has sought to control the law enforcement response to the protests.

“These guys need to grow up,” the California governor said. “They need to stop, and we need to push back. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let's go.”

Newsom has been critical of the Trump administration's move to deploy the National Guard to the area, which he sees as unnecessary given the state's resources. On Sunday, he said President Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis and is inflaming conditions” as the protests continue into the night.

Earlier on Sunday, he requested that the administration revoke its deployment order, deeming it “unlawful.”

A ship piloted by pro-Palestinian activists that was attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is now “safely making” its way to Israel, the Israeli Foreign Ministry announced.

In a statement on X, the foreign ministry referred to the Madleen, the ship operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, as a “selfie yacht” and its passengers, which include activist Greta Thunberg and a minister of the European Parliament, as “celebrities” staging a “media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity.”

The statement noted that the passengers would be expected to return to their home countries after the ship docks in Israel. It also said the “tiny” amount of aid the activists were attempting to deliver to Gaza would be transferred “through real humanitarian channels.”

“There are ways to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip — they do not involve Instagram selfies,” the foreign ministry added.

ISRAEL SAYS IT WILL STOP GRETA THUNBERG AID SHIP FROM BREAKING GAZA NAVAL BLOCKADE

Later footage shows Israeli soldiers handing out food and water to the activists, all of whom are “safe and unharmed,” the foreign ministry said.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had instructed the military this weekend to “take any means necessary” to stop the ship, which departed from Sicily last Sunday, from reaching Gaza.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he is "retiring" all 17 members of a crucial government panel of vaccine advisors.

"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science," Kennedy said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Monday.

Kennedy is removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.

ACIP members are independent medical and public experts who make recommendations based on rigorous scientific review and evidence. The CDC director has to sign off on those recommendations for them to become official policy.

The advisor overhaul is the latest move by Kennedy – a prominent vaccine skeptic – to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at HHS.

He said Monday HHS will put "the restoration of public trust above any pro- or antivaccine agenda."

Kennedy added some of the members on the committee were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration and noted that, without ousting advisors from the current group, the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.

Kennedy claimed that the panel has been "plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine."

But all HHS agencies and their advisory panels have had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. All members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest.

The announcement comes a week after pediatric infectious disease expert Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos resigned as co-leader of ACIP due to the belief she is "no longer able to help the most vulnerable members" of the U.S. population. 

But health policy experts previously told CNBC that a shake-up of the advisory committee could produce politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots. Those recommendations could also create greater distrust in the CDC and Trump administration among scientists and public health experts.

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Merck's shot designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus during their first season of the virus, bringing to market a rival to a similar treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca.

The decision will allow the company to launch the drug, which will be marketed as Enflonsia, ahead of the RSV season that typically kicks off around fall and winter and lasts through the spring. Merck said in a release that it expects orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the virus starts to spread widely.

The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from RSV are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns.

"We are committed to ensuring availability of [Enflonsia] in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems," Dr. Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a release.

Merck's shot will compete against a similar blockbuster treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide during the 2023 RSV season due to unprecedented demand.

Both are preventative monoclonal antibodies, which deliver antibodies directly into the bloodstream to provide immediate protection. But each targets a different part of the virus, making it difficult to compare them directly.

Merck's shot can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant's body weight.

Sanofi on Monday revealed an aggressive effort to increase supply of Beyfortus, including a plan to begin shipping the shot early in the third quarter. Last year, Beyfortus booked sales of €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).

Vaccines for RSV are also available in the U.S. from companies such as Pfizer, GSK and Moderna. But those shots are only for use in adults or in pregnant women. Recently, the FDA paused testing of RSV shots in young children while it evaluates safety concerns.

All of the companies in the market are waiting for a meeting of outside vaccine advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from June 25 to 27, when they will form recommendations for RSV shots and other immunizations.

In the mid- to late-stage trial on Enflonsia, the shot reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreased hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared with a placebo among infants through five months. The shot also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months.

RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia.

Sports entertainment, equipment and apparel stock Topgolf Callaway Brands surged on Monday after a high-profile corporate director bought shares in the company.

Shares rose 11%, hitting their highest level since May 13.

The moves comes after board member Adebayo Ogunlesi purchased about $2.5 million worth of shares last week, disclosed in a securities filing on Friday.

Purchases by corporate executives and directors can sometimes be seen as a vote of confidence in the company, and this purchase comes from an insider with the type of resume that Wall Street likes.

Ogunlesi is a founding partner and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, which was acquired by BlackRock last year in a $12 billion deal. Ogunlesi now serves on BlackRock's board after that deal, and he also joined the OpenAI board in January.

The purchase by Ogunlesi comes after a difficult period for Topgolf Callaway. Shares are down 9% in 2025, and more than 50% over the past year. Overall, the stock has delivered a negative return since Callaway first announced its acquisition of Topgolf in October 2020.

This is Ogunlesi's first purchase of Topgolf Callaway stock since June 2023, according to VerityData. Shares have dropped about 60% since that purchase.

President Donald Trump said Monday that he would support arresting California Gov. Gavin Newsom for purportedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles.

Trump's comment came shortly before Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta said they would sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying National Guard troops to deal with protests over those enforcement actions.

The suit will ask a judge to rule that Trump's federalization of the California National Guard was unlawful and to set aside the president's order. The civil complaint will argue that Trump's action violates the U.S. Constitution and exceed his authority under federal law related to the National Guard because it occurred without Newsom's consent or input, and because it was not warranted, Bonta's said.

Trump's action was the first time a president had activated a state's National Guard since 1965 without a request from a governor.

"We have a winning case here," Bonta said during a press conference.

Newsom, in a social media post, said Trump "flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,"

"The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA," Newsom wrote in the post on X. "It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing.

"We're suing him."

Bonta, in a statement outlining what he said was the failure of Trump's order to meet the criteria of federalizing the state's National Guard, said, "Let me be clear: There is no invasion. There is no rebellion."

"The President is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends," Bonta said.

"Federalizing the California National Guard is an abuse of the President's authority under the law – and not one we take lightly.

Trump's comment about arresting Newsom came in response to questions about his border czar, Tom Homan, who threatened to arrest Newsom, LA Mayor Karen Bass, and anyone else who obstructed immigration enforcement actions in California.

"I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity but I think it would be a great thing," Trump said.

Newsome, in a tweet, replied to Trump's statement.

"The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America," Newsom wrote.

"I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism," the governor wrote.

Meanwhile, federal prosecutors charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer. Huerta, president of SEUI California, was arrested on Friday during a protest in L.A. He is due to appear in federal court later Monday.

Newsom on Sunday asked Trump to remove the California National Guard from scenes of demonstrations in Los Angeles. Trump had signed an order on Saturday night deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to the protests.

"This is a preview of things to come," Newsom said in an interview with Brian Taylor Cohen that he embedded in his tweet about the planned lawsuit.

"This isn't about L.A., per se. It's about us today, it's about you, everyone watching tomorrow," the Democratic governor said.

"This guy is unhinged. Trump is unhinged right now, and this is just another proof point of that," said Newsom.

Trump defended his decision in a social media post Monday.

"We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California," he said in a post on Truth Social.

"If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated," said Trump.

Trump called Newsom "incompetent," and said the governor and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass should be thanking him, saying "YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL. WE WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOU, SIR."

"Instead, they choose to lie to the People of California and America by saying that we weren't needed, and that these are "peaceful protests," Trump wrote. "Just one look at the pictures and videos of the Violence and Destruction tells you all you have to know."

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump of engaging in a "diversion" by deploying the Guard.

"Donald Trump — in the midst of a war with Elon Musk and his ugly tax bill that would rip healthcare from 17 million people — is in desperate need of a diversion," Schumer said in a statement.

"His order to deploy the National Guard in California is unnecessary, inflammatory, and provocative. Trump should immediately revoke his command to use the National Guard, and leave the law enforcement to the governor and the mayor, who are more than capable of handling the situation," Schumer said. "Americans do not need or deserve this unnecessary and provocative chaos."

Lovable's technology allows people without any programming knowledge to build apps and websites.

Lovable, an AI startup that streamlines software development, is in talks for a large funding round that would make it one of Europe's biggest artificial intelligence newcomers.

The Swedish startup has held discussions with US investors to raise at least $100 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion or higher, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are early and the terms could change, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private.

As Elon Musk's fortune plunged by $36 billion last week and Tesla Inc.'s stock suffered a brutal drubbing, his most ardent backers rushed in to buy the dip — with leverage.

Investors poured $651 million into the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (ticker TSLL), marking the largest weekly inflow since the fund's 2022 debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest chunks came in on Thursday and Friday.

Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav ended his company's long relationship with the National Basketball Association. Now, he may be setting the stage to end his relationship with U.S. sports, altogether.

WBD announced Monday it's splitting itself into two companies — a concept CNBC first reported had picked up steam in April. One company, temporarily called Streaming and Studios, will consist of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max. The other, currently dubbed Global Networks, will be the rest of the company's assets: legacy cable networks, TNT Sports, digital products and free-to-air channels in Europe.

Zaslav will be the CEO of Streaming and Studios. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the current Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Financial Officer, will become the CEO of Global Networks.

The divorce raises the question of where live sports right held by TNT will land without Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming portfolio as part of the same company. 

During a conference call Monday, Zaslav said it will be up to Wiedenfels and his team to decide where they'd like to license TNT Sports programming to the Streaming and Studios business — or anyone else —in the future.

Currently, all of TNT Sports appear on HBO Max, Warner Bros. Discovery's flagship streaming service. Zaslav said U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max signups, suggesting that it may make sense for TNT Sports to consciously uncouple with the streaming service down the road.

"Inside the U.S., sports have been less critical," Zaslav said on a call with investors Monday. "It's viewed, but it hasn't been a real driver for us. So it will continue to be on HBO Max, but the Global Networks business will evaluate over time where the best place for that is."

HBO Max will continue to license sports for existing deals. Still, Wiedenfels will have options on how to monetize TNT's future streaming and digital sports rights. He could strike a licensing deal with a different media company for the live sports that appear on the Turner networks (TNT, TBS and TruTV), such as the NCAA's March Madness, the French Open, NASCAR, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.

"The U.S. sports rights will reside at the Global Networks, and its management team will determine how best to monetize the streaming and digital rights over time," said Wiedenfels. "Internationally, sports will largely coexist, both on linear and streaming, as they do today."

Or, he could decide to merge TNT Sports with another entity, such as the forthcoming Comcast spinout, Versant. Mark Lazarus, Versant's CEO, told CNBC Sport last month he was interested in bidding on sports rights to gain distribution heft with pay-TV operators. Acquiring TNT Sports could be a major step in that direction.

If Wiedenfels opts for consolidation, he will have to weigh the tax effects of selling off assets after the separation takes place. While Warner Bros. Discovery noted the split is tax-free, Wiedenfels emphasized on Monday's call that transactions could begin as soon as the separation occurs, which is expected by mid-2026.

"On the tax side, I said this earlier, I want to be absolutely clear: Once this deal closes, both companies are going to be free and clear," Wiedenfels said. "There is no minimum time."

A spokesperson for Versant did not immediately return request for comment.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC. Versant will become the parent company of CNBC when the spinout is complete.

The CEOs of Uber, Dell, Goldman Sachs and more are expected to announce Monday that they will collectively invest billions of dollars into so-called Trump accounts for the children of their employees, a White House spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.

The executive are slated to make the commitments during President Donald Trump's roundtable event touting the eponymous pilot program, which would deposit $1,000 from the government in investment accounts for newborn Americans. NBC News first reported the details of the event.

More than half a dozen corporate leaders are set to appear for the "Invest America" roundtable at the White House at 2 p.m. ET, the White House official told CNBC. They include:

The provision to create the accounts passed the House last month as part of the massive budget bill that the president is pushing Republicans to send to his desk before the Fourth of July. The bill is pending before the Senate, where it faces strong pushback from some fiscally conservative Republicans who are demanding major changes.

The program — previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts" — would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028.

The tax-deferred accounts, which track the overall U.S. stock market, allow additional contributions of up to $5,000 per year. The seed money will be funded by the Treasury Department and controlled by the child's guardians. Funds can be distributed once the beneficiary turns 18.

The pilot program is similar to other savings account options that already exist, including 529 college savings plans, which have higher contribution limits. Some financial advisors say that the Trump accounts may not offer the best investment incentives.

"The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will literally change the lives of working, middle class families across America by delivering the largest tax cuts in history, increasing the child tax credit, and by creating this incredible new 'Trump Account' program, which will put the lives of young Americans on the right financial path!" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC in a statement.

Dell Technologies pledged Monday to provide $1,000 for so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching what the government would contribute if the savings program for newborns delivered in the United States becomes law.

CEO Michael Dell vowed to match the government's seed money "dollar for dollar" for his employees' kids during a roundtable event at the White House with President Donald Trump.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan, which is part of the massive Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress.

But they did not make the same commitment at the event that Dell did, even though a White House official told CNBC earlier Monday that the attending CEOs would collectively announce billions of dollars of investment into their employees' Trump accounts.

Once the bill is signed into law, "Goldman Sachs would be excited to further support" the initiative, said Solomon, without providing details.

More than half a dozen corporate leaders were on the list for the "Invest America" roundtable at the White House. They include:

The provision to create the accounts passed the House last month as part of the major tax-cut bill that Trump is pushing Republicans to send to his desk before the Fourth of July. The bill is pending before the Senate, where it faces strong pushback from some fiscally conservative Republicans who are demanding significant changes.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., were seated alongside Trump and the CEOs at the event Monday afternoon.

The program — previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts" — would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028.

Walmart's majority-owned fintech startup OnePay said Monday it was launching a pair of credit cards with a bank partner for customers of the world's biggest retailer.

OnePay is partnering with Synchrony, a major behind-the-scenes player in retail cards, which will issue the cards and handle underwriting decisions starting in the fall, the companies said.

OnePay, which was created by Walmart in 2021 with venture firm Ribbit Capital, will handle the customer experience for the card program through its mobile app.

Walmart had leaned on Capital One as the exclusive provider of its credit cards since 2018, but sued the bank in 2023 so that it could exit the relationship years ahead of schedule. At the time, Capital One accused Walmart of seeking to end its partnership so that it could move transactions to OnePay.

The Walmart card program had 10 million customers and roughly $8.5 billion in loans outstanding last year, when the partnership with Capital One ended, according to Fitch Ratings.

For Walmart and its fintech firm, the arrangement shows that, in seeking to quickly scale up in financial services, OnePay is opting to partner with established players rather than going it alone.

In March, OnePay announced that it was tapping Swedish fintech firm Klarna to handle buy now, pay later loans at the retailer, even after testing its own installment loan program.

In its quest to become a one-stop shop for Americans underserved by traditional banks, OnePay has methodically built out its offerings, which now include debit cards, high-yield savings accounts and a digital wallet with peer-to-peer payments.

OnePay is rolling out two options: a general-purpose credit card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted and a store card that will only allow Walmart purchases.

Customers whose credit profiles don't allow them to qualify for the general-purpose card will be offered the store card, according to a person with knowledge of the program.

OnePay hasn't yet disclosed the rewards expected for making purchases with the cards. The Synchrony partnership was reported earlier by Bloomberg.

"Our goal with this credit card program is to deliver an experience for consumers that's transparent, rewarding, and easy to use," OnePay CEO Omer Ismail said in the Monday release.

"We're excited to be partnering with Synchrony to launch a program at Walmart that checks each of those boxes and will help serve millions of people," Ismail said.

Pump.fun's decision to raise $1 billion is sparking concern that a token sale by the most popular platform for creating memecoins risks siphoning demand away from the hundreds of coins issued daily through the website. 

The platform, which is based on the Solana blockchain, is still in the early stages of the token offering, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be named discussing private company information, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Alon Cohen, co-founder of Pump.fun, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly set to boost its manufacturing in India with a view to bolstering its international supply chains amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.

The Chinese-founded, Singapore-headquartered brand and Indian partner Reliance Retail are set to expand their supplier base in the South Asian country and begin international sales of India-made Shein clothes within the next six to 12 months, Reuters reported Monday, citing sources.

The plans aim to increase Indian suppliers from 150 to 1,000 within a year, they added.

Shein told CNBC the partnership was limited to the licensing of its brand to Reliance Retail for Indian domestic consumption only. Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the sources, discussions between the firms were underway ahead of fresh U.S. tariffs on China and the closure of the former's 'de minimis' trade loophole.

Analysts nevertheless dubbed it a potentially savvy move given brewing trade tensions and increased scrutiny over Shein's supply chains ahead of its closely watched initial public offering.

''Shein's expansion of its production in India is on the face of it a shrewd move, given the trade headwinds facing the company," Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email.

"It does look like using India as a manufacturing base is a long-term plan and the current tariff challenges could speed this up," Ed Sander, analyst at Tech Buzz China, added.

Shein launched in India in 2018 but it was banned in 2020 as part of a government clampdown on Chinese firms.

It returned to India in February, as part of a licensing deal with Reliance Industries, the conglomerate owned by Asia's richest person, Mukesh Ambani. The partnership is one of many Reliance has with global clothing brands including Brooks Brothers, Marks & Spencer and Diesel.

Under the deal, Shein-branded clothes are produced domestically in India and sold on the SheinIndia.in website. This differs from most other Shein websites, which list products made in China. The firm nevertheless has existing manufacturing in Brazil and Turkey.

An official from Reliance Retail said at the time that Shein would use India as "supply source for its global operations," according to the BBC. They added that the deal would simultaneously help Reliance in "building the network" and training Indian garment manufacturers as part of India's wider plans to promote its textile and garments export industry.

"I doubt if the option of exporting elsewhere from India will be the main aim at the moment," Sander said, noting current limitations around India's factory capacity. "Having said that, this could change in the future if Reliance scales up."

It comes as other companies have also been ramping up their production in India as they seek to avoid the most punitive tariffs on China. Tariffs on India are currently held at 10% while trade negotiations remain underway.

"With the outcome of U.S. China trade talks still unclear, diversifying the manufacturing base to other parts of the world which could benefit from lower tariffs on exports to the U.S. looks sensible," Streeter said in emailed comments.

U.S. tech giant Apple has also been boosting its production in India with a view to making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the coming years. Those plans sparked backlash from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose 25% tariffs on such goods.

The timing is especially interesting for Shein, however, as it seeks to overcome scrutiny in its troubled pursuit of an IPO. The e-commerce behemoth reportedly recently shifted its listing from London to Hong Kong after failing to receive approval from Chinese regulators.

Shein has long sought to shake allegations over the use of forced labor to produce its low-cost goods — claims it vehemently denies. Still, some raised concerns about whether India would provide the silver bullet.

"India is not without risk in this respect. There have been reports of labor violations amounting to forced and child labor occurring on cotton farms supplying to three Indian textile suppliers to 60 multinational clothing brands," Streeter said.

"Among responsible consumers and investors, there still may be significant skepticism about this move.''

A spokesperson for the Indian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the claims.

Warner Bros. Discovery stock jumped on Monday after the HBO and CNN owner announced plans to split into two separate companies.

The Streaming & Studios company will include Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, as well as their legendary film and television libraries.

The second business, Global Networks, will include entertainment, sports and news television brands including CNN, TNT Sports in the US, Discovery and the Discovery+ streaming service and some free-to-air channels in Europe.

WBD stock jumped almost 13% as the market opened to just above $11 before dipping slightly.

CEO David Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will run the Global Networks business. Both will continue in their present roles until the separation takes effect next year.

"We see this transaction as a natural progression for WBD," Wiedenfels said on a call announcing the spinoff. "The whole concept of this separation here has been to create two very strong and well positioned companies, in and of themselves."

Zaslav was the architect of the combined WBD, which only began trading in April 2022.

Last week investors resoundingly rejected the CEO's proposed pay package, which would have given him a 4% raise. WBD's revenue has declined 10% in the past year, and its debt rating was recently downgraded.

Zaslav said in a statement on Monday that operating as two distinct companies would give WBD's brands the "sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape."

Wiedenfels said Global Networks would work with distribution partners to "create value for both linear and streaming viewers globally while maximizing our network assets and driving free cash flow."

Bank of America analysts wrote in a note last week they maintained a  "Buy" rating with a $14 target price: "We continue to believe WBD has a compelling collection of assets."

The split plan comes after Comcast said late last year it planned to spin off some NBCUniversal channels, including MSNBC, CNBC, USA, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel.

NBC, Bravo, and the streaming service Peacock will remain under NBCUniversal, Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told NBCU employees in a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The "SpinCo" plan would take about a year and permit growth in NBCUniversal's remaining assets, he wrote.

Walmart Inc.'s credit cards will once again be issued by Synchrony Financial as the world's largest retailer makes a renewed push into financial services. 

OnePay, a financial technology firm backed by Walmart, picked Synchrony to issue both a co-branded card that can be used outside Walmart as well as a private-label card that will be available just for purchases at the retailer. OnePay will begin offering the cards in the US later this year.

The chances that a rival oil company will take over BP Plc are slim right now, even as peers have been running the numbers, because of the firm's size and complexity, said bankers from Moelis & Co. 

“We can't identify anybody in the US that would be a buyer,” Moelis Chairman and Global Head of Energy and Clean Technology Stephen Trauber said in an interview in London on Monday. “We don't really see any others globally that are buyers that view the assets as must-have.”

Kirkland & Ellis spent a decade building a billion dollar-plus energy and infrastructure business and becoming the top legal adviser for US oil and gas deals. It was perfectly placed to benefit from Donald Trump's “drill, baby, drill” agenda. 

Then, the US president's global trade war tanked the price of crude and stifled transactions in the country's oil patch, which are down by more than 40% this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Kirkland has also found itself among firms caught up in the US government's attacks on big law.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said she would invest in Elon Musk's Tesla if she were only allowed to pick one stock.

Wood was speaking to investor Steven Bartlett on his podcast "The Diary Of A CEO" when Bartlett asked for her top stock pick. The full interview with Wood aired on YouTube last week.

"Because, think about it. It is a convergence among three of our major platforms. So, robots, energy storage, AI," Wood said of Tesla.

"And it's not stopping with robotaxis, there's a story beyond that with humanoid robots, and our $2,600 number has nothing for humanoid robots. We just thought it'd be an investment, period," she added.

In June 2024, Wood's investment management firm, Ark Invest, issued a price target of $2,600 for Tesla. Wood told Bloomberg during an interview in March that she still stands by her target and expects Tesla's stock to hit $2,600 in five years.

Wood told Bartlett that Musk's work with Tesla's Optimus robots would generate productivity gains for the company and create a new source of revenue. Musk said in an interview with CNBC last month that he expects Tesla to make a million Optimus robots every year by 2030.

"We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, beginning this fall. And we expect to scale Optimus up faster than any product, I think, in history to get to millions of units per year as soon as possible," Musk told CNBC.

Tesla's stock has oscillated between highs and lows in recent months amid Musk's entry and exit from politics.

Tesla's stock hit a peak closing price of $479 in December, after President Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Musk was a prominent backer and supporter of Trump's campaign.

Musk's involvement with the White House DOGE office sparked protests and boycotts against Tesla. In March, Tesla's stock fell by over 40% from its record highs in mid-December.

This started to alarm investors, who repeatedly told Musk to spend more time on Tesla. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call in May that he would be scaling down his involvement with DOGE to focus on Tesla.

Last week, Musk's relationship with Trump seemingly broke down after he criticized the president's "big beautiful bill." Musk also agreed with an X post that called for Trump's impeachment, before deleting it.

Trump later threatened to cancel the government's contracts with Musk's businesses, saying it would be the "easiest way to save money in our Budget."

Tesla's stock fell by 14% on Thursday amid the spat between Musk and Trump. The company's stock is down nearly 27% year to date.

Wood said in a video posted to Ark Invest's YouTube channel on Friday that Musk's quarrel with Trump was an attempt to decouple himself from the Trump administration.

"One of the hypotheses out there is that what has happened was partly — not entirely — orchestrated," Wood said.

"Clearly, there has been some brand damage to Tesla, which he readily admits, and I think he's trying to disengage from the government and being associated with one party or the other," she continued.

Representatives for Wood and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Cacchione, a 41-year-old Swiss woman raising her daughter in Koh Samui, Thailand. She is also the founder of mate.travel, a destination-focused travel and events platform. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I met my now-husband in 2009 on a popular diving island in Thailand.

I was on vacation from my hometown of Basel, Switzerland, while he had stopped on the island to complete his divemaster training during a yearlong trip around the world.

After dating long-distance for a year and a half, we decided to move to Koh Tao to work at the diving center where we had first met. It's an island in the Gulf of Thailand, just a ferry ride from Koh Samui.

He became a diving instructor, while I started off as an underwater videographer and eventually became an instructor myself.

We got married five years later, and although we loved the time we'd spent on that island, we were ready to settle down and start a family.

Koh Samui, over 10 times bigger, offered the environment we were looking for, so we moved there instead.

It's a perfect mix of the laid-back island lifestyle we love and all the amenities we need. There is a cinema, a shopping mall, an international airport, and hospitals and schools.

When I was pregnant, my mother moved to Samui to be close to her first grandchild. I gave birth to my daughter in 2020, who is now five years old and enrolled in an international kindergarten on the island.

I normally drop my daughter off by 9 a.m. and pick her up between 3:30 and 4 p.m.

It's on the later side, since the earliest she can do is 8:30 a.m., but I don't like to rush in the mornings, and neither does she.

It's a Montessori-inspired school that follows the English curriculum.

In Switzerland, the school day usually starts around 8 a.m., so kids need to get up much earlier. In the afternoon, students typically return home for lunch. Moreover, different grades have different schedules.

When I was visiting a friend in Switzerland, her two kids didn't have the same lunchtime. Coordinating is impossible; your whole day revolves around your kids.

Many kids back in Switzerland also participate in lots of activities. As a mother, I probably would've felt pressured to enroll my daughter in something.

While there are extracurricular activities for kids in Samui, there is no pressure to sign them up. Nobody will say, "Oh, your kid's not doing ballet?" Everyone's friendly and supportive.

Social media here is more about traveling and breaking free from a conventional lifestyle. There is nothing about "I'm a perfect mom, this is what I did today."

Even in my daughter's school, the kids get exposed to so many different cultures and learn to be more accepting of others from a young age.

People living in Samui tend to be more open-minded. Most of the people I've met have already lived in other countries before; this is rarely their first stop.

When my daughter sees videos of other children playing at a park on YouTube or from friends back in Europe, and she says, "Mommy, can we go to the park?" I say, "Well, there's no park."

There are indoor play spaces but hardly any well-maintained outdoor playgrounds or parks like the ones I've seen back in Switzerland.

I've found that if you don't want to do an activity, it's difficult to just go somewhere and meet other families. You need to know where to go or arrange to meet someone somewhere.

For teenagers, it's much harder to find things to do. Some hang out at the shopping mall, but getting around the island can be difficult.

Walking here isn't easy — it's hot, there aren't many sidewalks, and there's no public transportation like buses or subways. The roads can be dangerous, so I'd never want my child riding a motorbike here.

They're really kid-friendly here. There's so much space almost everywhere, and she can run around. Even in restaurants, you never feel shushed.

We live up in the mountains, about 10 minutes from the main road. There is no road noise, and we have a nice view of the valley and a little bit of the ocean.

It's very quiet and slow, even in the mornings. If I'm 10 minutes late dropping my daughter off, it's not a problem. Even as a mother, I'm not stressed.

According to Jeff Dean on Twitter, Bill Atkinson, the pioneering developer behind the original Mac's QuickDraw library, has passed away (source: Jeff Dean, Twitter, June 9, 2025). Atkinson's contributions to software engineering, notably in graphics and interface design, are being revisited by the tech community. For crypto traders, this renewed focus on foundational tech innovation may drive increased attention to blockchain projects emphasizing user interface and developer tools, potentially impacting sentiment around tokens linked to tech infrastructure advancements.

Visa pilot demonstrates potential of eliminating intermediaries with blockchain, drastically reducing cross-border transaction times.

Visa and Chainlink have completed a key milestone in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) e-HKD+ Pilot Programme, successfully testing a cross-border blockchain transaction using central bank digital currency (CBDC) and stablecoins.

The trial, conducted in partnership with ANZ, ChinaAMC, and Fidelity International, is one of the first real-world simulations of programmable money being used for cross-border investment in tokenized assets.

The test used Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect ANZ's private blockchain, DASChain, with Ethereum's (ETH) public testnet.

This enabled an Australian investor to exchange an AUD-backed stablecoin (A$DC) for e-HKD and use the digital Hong Kong dollar to purchase a tokenized money market fund (MMF) offered by asset managers in Hong Kong.

The process achieved near-instant settlement and was designed to eliminate the traditional risks of delayed cross-border transactions.

Visa's Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) powered the creation and movement of digital money, while Chainlink CCIP coordinated smart contracts for payment-versus-payment (PvP) and delivery-versus-payment (DvP) flows.

The pilot also included on-chain identity verification through Chainlink's compliance services and tested token issuance using ERC-20 and ERC-3643 standards to evaluate regulatory compatibility and security features.

The simulation shows how investors in Australia could use either a CBDC or stablecoin to directly invest in Hong Kong-based funds, removing intermediaries, reducing wait times, and increasing transparency.

Currently, fund subscriptions can take two to three days to settle. With blockchain, the entire process could happen in seconds, around the clock, even on weekends and holidays.

With tokenized asset markets projected to exceed $2 trillion by 2030, the HKMA's pilot reflects a growing global push to modernize capital markets through digital infrastructure.

The e-HKD+ initiative expands on earlier phases to include tokenized bank deposits and programmable payments across both public and permissioned blockchains.

Fidelity and ChinaAMC, who have issued tokenized funds in previous initiatives, highlighted how programmable digital money could improve fund issuance, reduce operational friction, and reach broader investor bases.

ANZ's participation, including its A$DC stablecoin and role in FX conversion, further illustrates how traditional banks are integrating digital assets into cross-border finance.

The pilot will now enter its next phase, with end-to-end transaction testing and performance evaluation across compliance, speed, and interoperability. The results are expected to inform regulatory frameworks and set standards for future use of CBDCs and stablecoins in global financial markets.

Technical analysis of crypto assets can be hard—but we're here to try and make it a little easier for you. Today, we're starting with a near-death-cross experience for Bitcoin, Ethereum finding its footing despite bearish signals, and Fartcoin (yes, Fartcoin) showing strength among alts.

Let's get into it:

Cryptocurrency markets showed signs of life Monday after a prolonged 13-day correction that tested investor resolve. The total crypto market capitalization rose 1.72% over 24 hours to $3.37 trillion, getting closer to the peak reached in late May when traders took the crypto market to $3.52 trillion.

Traditional equity markets provided a supportive backdrop. The S&P 500 closed Friday around 6,000, gaining 0.55% for the week and nearing all-time highs, continuing its slow recovery after April's crash. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.34% to 19,674.07, maintaining its position near record territory despite lingering inflation concerns and Federal Reserve uncertainty.

The Fear & Greed Index, which as the name implies measures investor sentiment based on how fearful or greedy they might be acting, stood at 62 points, placing market sentiment in slightly bullish territory after weeks of extreme readings.

Bitcoin is trading at $108,313 on Monday, stabilizing after shedding nearly 10% during its recent correction. The cryptocurrency's technical structure revealed multiple bullish signals beneath the surface volatility.

The gap between the 50-day exponential moving average and the 200-day EMA has increased, which typically signals bullish momentum. Moving averages are basically the average price of an asset during a period of time, in this case the last 50 days and the last 200 days. The bigger the gap, the stronger the market phase is. This confirms a medium-term bullish outlook that was able to avoid a death cross in late May and makes it easier to see the short-term moving averages as a good price support zone—if prices go down, it would be a bit hard for them to crash below $100K, which is where the current EMA line is.

Bitcoin's Volume Profile Visible Range, often abbreviated as “VPVR,” highlighted a high-volume node between $92,000 and $96,000, establishing a critical support zone where significant trading occurred. This concentration of volume acts as a magnet for price, making it difficult for Bitcoin to fall below this range without substantial selling pressure.

Bitcoin's Average Directional Index, or ADX, stands at 19, suggesting the previous downtrend is now weakening. ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction—readings below 25 indicate a weak trend while values above 25 signal strengthening momentum. The declining ADX can therefore be interpreted as exhaustion in selling pressure.

The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at a neutral 58, sitting comfortably between oversold (below 30) and overbought (above 70) conditions. This positioning leaves room for upward movement without triggering technical sell signals that often accompany overheated markets.

For those into fundamentals, Bitcoin treasuries are all the rage right now: Paris-based Blockchain Group raised $340 million specifically to expand Bitcoin holdings, the company announced Monday, and Brazilian startup Meliuz announced a share offering to fund additional Bitcoin purchases for its treasury last week. They're yet another sign that global firms are following Strategy's playbook of accumulating BTC.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,567, demonstrating strength after testing the psychologically important $2,500 support level. The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators show mixed signals, with basically everything depending on whether that zone remains a strong support or not.

The 50-200 EMA configuration shows the faster moving average below the slower one, typically a bearish signal. However, the narrowing gap between these averages suggests potential for a bullish crossover in the coming days. The recent price action above both moving averages negated the bearish implications of this "death cross" formation.

Ethereum's ADX reading of 22 indicates the coin is basically stable, which also confirms what the RSI at 56—neutral territory with upward bias—shows. No buy or sell recommendations can be made based on technical analysis right now, at least for a short time frame.

Fartcoin rocketed 12.55% higher to $1.16, bringing its market capitalization to $1.12 billion and securing the 66th position among crypto peers in the market cap rankings. The meme token's technical indicators flashed uniformly bullish signals.

The ADX spiked to 23, approaching the 25 threshold that confirms trend strength and the end of the bearish correction that took the price down 47% after reaching an all-time high on May 23. Rising ADX during price advances validates the move's legitimacy rather than indicating a mere oversold bounce.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which identifies periods of low volatility before explosive moves, showed the token breaking out of a prolonged squeeze (basically a volatility compression before a major price swing), with momentum bars turning green and expanding into a bullish impulse. This pattern typically precedes explosive moves as compressed volatility releases.

And the meme coin's fundamentals? Coinbase announced the addition of Fartcoin to its asset roadmap on June 6, which continued to provide tailwinds. The coin's actual listing on Coinbase, though, remains pending.

A tsunami of new bitcoin BTC$108,577.48 treasury companies — firms that almost exclusively dedicate themselves to accumulating bitcoin — is flooding the market.

Since all of them are more or less following Strategy's (MSTR) playbook, questions are rising about the best ways to value them, and compare them to each other.

“The most important metric for a bitcoin treasury is the premium it trades at relative to its underlying net assets, including any operating company,” Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin financial firm NYDIG, wrote in a June 6 report.

On the surface, that means adding up the company's bitcoin, cash and enterprise value excluding the bitcoin stuff, and subtracting obligations such as debt and preferred stock. “It's this premium that allows these companies to convert stock for bitcoins, effectively acting as a money changer converting shares for bitcoins,” Cipolaro said.

One of the most popular metrics, mNAV, measures a company's valuation to its net asset value — in these cases, their bitcoin treasuries. An mNAV above 1.0 signals that investors are interested in paying a premium for exposure to the stock relative to its bitcoin stash; however, an mNAV below 1.0 means the equity is now worth less than the company's holdings.

But mNAV alone is “woefully deficient” to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these firms, Cipolaro said. The research report made use of other metrics such as NAV, mNAV measured by market capitalization, mNAV by enterprise value, and equity premium to NAV to provide a more complex picture.

The table shows, for example, that Semler Scientific's (SMLR) and Trump Media's (DJT) equity premium to NAV (which measures the percentage difference between a fund's market price and its net asset value), are the lowest of the eight measured companies, coming in at -10% and -16% respectively, despite the fact that both companies have an mNAV above 1.1.

Alas, both SMLR and DJT are little-changed on Monday even as bitcoin climbs to $108,500 versus Friday evening's $105,000 level. MSTR is higher by just shy of 5%.

 Bitcoin price pushed through a critical overhead resistance level, possibly opening the door to new all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin opened the week with strength as bulls target new highs in BTC and altcoins. 

Many major altcoins are stuck in a range, but HYPE is showing signs of strength.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a solid start to the week, sprinting toward the overhead resistance zone of $109,588 to $111,980. The move higher may have been triggered due to the optimistic expectations from the US-China trade talks in London.

Trader Cas Abbe said in a post on X that Bitcoin is likely to witness a big move, possibly above $109,000 to $110,000. Abbe noted that $15.11 billion in shorts would be liquidated if Bitcoin soars 10% from the current levels. On the other hand, a 10% down move risks liquidation of $9.58 billion in long positions.

Although most analysts believe Bitcoin's long-term trajectory is up, some anticipate a short-term dip before the uptrend resumes. Private wealth manager Swissblock anticipates a drop to $104,000, while analyst Mickybull Crypto expects a fall to $101,500.

Could buyers propel Bitcoin above the all-time high of $111,980, pulling altcoins higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week, and the bulls are trying to build upon the momentum on June 9.

The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,883) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory indicate that the bulls are in command. Buyers will try to push the price to the 6,147 overhead resistance.

The move higher may not be easy as the sellers are expected to defend the 6,000 to 6,147 zone with all their might. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA, opening the gates for a fall to 5,767.

Buyers are trying to start a recovery in the US Dollar Index (DXY) but are facing selling near the 20-day EMA (99.49).

The bears will try to sink the index to 97.92, an important support level to watch out for. A break and close below the 97.92 level signals the resumption of the downtrend. The index could then extend the decline to 95.67.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average (100.30). The index could then jump to the overhead resistance at 102.

Bitcoin rose above the 20-day EMA ($105,296) on June 7, and the bulls cleared the overhead hurdle at $106,794 on June 9.

The price action of the past few days has formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline near $112,700. If that happens, the pair could skyrocket toward the pattern target of $146,892.

Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bears are active at higher levels. The BTC/USDT pair could then plunge to solid support at $100,000. The bulls are expected to defend the $100,000 level with all their might because a break below it may deepen the pullback to $93,000.

Ether (ETH) has been consolidating between $2,323 and $2,738 for the past few days, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.

If the price maintains above the 20-day EMA ($2,515), the ETH/USDT pair could rally to $2,738. This is a critical resistance for the bears to defend because if the level gets taken out, the pair could soar to $3,000 and then to $3,153.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it suggests that the bears are trying to take charge. The trend will favor the bears on a break and close below the 50-day SMA ($2,284). The pair could then collapse to $2,111.

XRP (XRP) has been range-bound between $2 and $2.65 for the past several days, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price rises above the moving averages, the XRP/USDT pair could ascend to the $2.65 overhead resistance.

Conversely, if the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the pair below the $2 support. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the vital support at $1.61.

BNB (BNB) has been oscillating between $693 and $634 for the past few days, signaling buying near the support and selling close to the overhead resistance.

If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($655), the BNB/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range for some more time. The next leg of the up move could begin after buyers shove the price above $693. The pair could then rally to $732.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will strive to halt the relief rally at the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair risks a drop below the $634 support. If that happens, the pair could plummet to $580.

Solana (SOL) turned up from the $140 support on June 5, but the recovery is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA ($158). 

If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the bears will try to tug the SOL/USDT pair below $140. If they succeed, the pair could tumble to $123 and subsequently to the solid support at $110.

Instead, if the price pierces the moving averages, it suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair could attempt a rally to the $185 level, where the sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is finding support near the $0.16 level, but the bulls are struggling to maintain the higher levels.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.19) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have an edge. Sellers will try to pull the price below $0.16, challenging the crucial $0.14 support. Buyers are expected to mount a strong defense at the $0.14 level, keeping the DOGE/USDT pair inside the range for some more time.

The longer the price remains inside the range, the greater the eventual breakout from it. An up move could begin after buyers propel the pair above $0.26.

Cardano's (ADA) recovery is facing resistance near the 20-day EMA ($0.69), indicating that the bears are selling on rallies. 

The bears will try to pull the price below the $0.60 level. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could retest the $0.50 support. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $0.50 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $0.40.

Buyers will have to drive the price above the moving averages to gain strength. The pair may then climb to the downtrend line, which is a critical level to watch out for. A break and close above the downtrend line suggests the start of a new up move to $1.02.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) rose above the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 9, signaling that the uncertainty has resolved to the upside.

If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the HYPE/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar to $42.50. There is resistance at $40, but that is likely to be crossed. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $42.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to the pattern target of $46.50.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the triangle. That suggests the break above the triangle may have been a bull trap. The pair could slump to $30.50 and later to $28.50.

 Analysts say Bitcoin could break its all-time high within 1–2 weeks, following breakout patterns seen recently in gold and the S&P 500. 

Key takeaways:

A newly created whale wallet opened a $54.5M 20x long position on Bitcoin at $106,538.

Bitcoin nears $108,000 as US-China trade talks and bullish equity forecasts lift market sentiment.

Analysts expect BTC to break its all-time high within 1–2 weeks, mirroring recent breakouts in gold and the S&P 500.

Bitcoin (BTC) reached $108,000 on June 9, just as a newly funded crypto wallet executed one of the boldest leveraged trades of the year: a $54.5 million long position on BTC with 20x leverage.

The wallet, identified as “0x1f25,” was created earlier today and promptly funded with $10 million in USDC stablecoin. 

The trader then opened a 511.5 BTC position on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, using full cross-margin leverage. 

With an entry price of $106,538 and a liquidation level of $88,141, the trader is currently sitting on over $11,000 in paper profit, a modest but strategic gain amid increasing market momentum.

Some traders believe the whale behind wallet “0x1f25” may be James Wynn, a high‑profile Hyperliquid trader who recently suffered massive liquidations. 

Wynn lost an initial $99.3 million when BTC fell below $105,000 on May 30, as two long positions totaling 949 BTC were wiped out. A week later, on June 4, he took an additional $25 million hit when 240 BTC in another leveraged position were liquidated.

Despite these setbacks, Wynn has quickly opened fresh mega‑bets and maintains a pattern of entering new high‑leverage trades, matching the aggressive style behind wallet 0x1f25.

BTC's push above $108,000 came as traders monitored US-China trade talks unfolding in London. 

Negotiations began on June 9 afternoon with signs of a diplomatic thaw: the US is reportedly willing to relax tech export restrictions in exchange for more access to China's rare earth materials. 

Talks may continue into Tuesday if needed, according to officials close to the matter. Like Bitcoin, US equities have responded positively to the news, indicating an overall positive sentiment among risk traders.

On June 6, strategists at JPMorgan and Citigroup raised their year-end targets for the S&P 500, pointing to easing US-China trade tensions and stronger-than-expected economic data. 

Goldman's David Kostin said markets are beginning to reflect an “optimistic growth outlook” — a sentiment that appears to be lifting crypto as well, with the digital asset market adding more than $190 billion in value since the revised forecasts.

Bitcoin may retest its record high of around $110,000 and may even cross above it in the coming 1-2 weeks, according to analyst Ted Pillows.

Pillows compares Bitcoin's current setup to recent moves in gold and the S&P 500, both of which surged after breaking above similar resistance levels. 

His chart shows all three assets facing horizontal barriers — levels where prices previously topped out — and Bitcoin now looks poised to follow the same breakout pattern.

Some analysts see Bitcoin price reaching over $150,000 by year's end, a move that can push the whale's profit to around 225%—or $22.5 million—given his $10 million margin.

Chainlink (LINK) played a pivotal role in a successful pilot program that facilitated the exchange of two central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

The pilot involved the Hong Kong digital dollar (e-HKD) and an Australian stablecoin. It was part of Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program, initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol enabled seamless transactions. It showcases how smart contract technology can bridge traditional finance and the decentralized finance ecosystem.



At the heart of this milestone was Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, which allowed the exchange between the two digital assets. The transaction used the Australian Stablecoin issued by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group alongside the e-HKD. 

This integration was key in demonstrating how blockchain-based infrastructure can enhance the efficiency and security of international payments. Chainlink's protocol effectively bridged the gap between different blockchain networks, providing a seamless experience for all parties involved.

The pilot's success was further strengthened by the involvement of major financial institutions. Visa, Fidelity International, ANZ, and China Asset Management Company participated in the transaction framework. 

Each of these players contributed to the pilot's execution and success, reinforcing the growing collaboration between traditional finance and decentralized technologies. This partnership highlights how established financial players are beginning to adopt and integrate blockchain and digital currency solutions into their existing systems.

This pilot also comes when traditional financial institutions show increasing interest in blockchain and Web3 technologies. Recently, JP Morgan concluded its first transaction on a public chain, signaling a deeper commitment to the Web3 space. 

Using Chainlink's technology to connect private and public networks, JP Morgan's transaction with tokenized U.S. Treasuries on Ondo Finance demonstrates how blockchain is reshaping traditional finance.

 The USDt issuer plans to launch its open-source project by the fourth quarter of 2025, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. 

Stablecoin issuer Tether plans to open-source its Bitcoin mining software, a move the company said would allow new miners to enter the market without relying on expensive third-party vendors.

By open-sourcing its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS), “A horde of new Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the game and compete to keep the network safe,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a Monday X post. 

Ardoino described MOS as scalable and modular, “built with a peer-to-peer [Internet of Things] architecture at its core.” 

The new operating system will support existing mining infrastructure, including several containers and other power devices, he said. 

Ardoino said the project is expected to be rolled out by the fourth quarter of 2025.

The new project expands on Tether's ongoing efforts to promote decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April, the company partnered with the Ocean mining pool to help decentralize block building by committing its current and future hashrate to the protocol.

Large Bitcoin miners have a significant advantage over smaller players due to their economies of scale, ability to negotiate favorable power contracts and increased hashrate. However, even these large players are diversifying their business strategy to remain competitive in a post-halving world.

Some miners have built large Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries to benefit from the asset's price appreciation during the bull market, while others have repurposed NGUs for artificial intelligence applications. 

For Hive Digital, revenue from AI workloads has generated significantly more income than crypto mining, which has prompted the company to invest more heavily in this area.

“Institutions are much more interested in us with our AI than Bitcoin,” Frank Holmes, Hive's executive chairman, told Cointelegraph in September. 

Still, some companies have gone all in on Bitcoin by shedding less competitive parts of their operations. Bitcoin miner Cango, for example, generated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months after selling off its legacy operations to focus solely on its mining business.

Oops, something went wrong

An updated edition of the April 24, 2025 article.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been soaring high due to increasing acceptance as a non-sovereign asset, as well as higher institutional and corporate adoption. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, apparently benefiting from easing trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which reflected the digital currency's growing recognition as a store of value. As of April 28, more than 70 publicly listed companies, including the likes of MicroStrategy MSTR and Marathon Digital MARA, hold 720,728 bitcoins worth $68.5 billion.Bitcoin is now trading above $105,000, lower than the all-time high, but much higher than the $76,000 it registered in early April. The liberal policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have been benefiting Bitcoin and other crypto assets. An executive order by President Trump that directed a working group to study and propose changes to cryptocurrency regulations bodes well for crypto enthusiasts. In March, President Trump announced the creation of a crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, which augurs well for cryptocurrency miners, including BIT Mining Limited BTCM and exchanges like CME Group CME.Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain technology, which comprises complex cryptography and software that creates an immutable and decentralized database. The system offers enhanced security for users, as it maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of the owner. Blockchain's safety and decentralization features have been among the major drivers behind the proliferation of cryptocurrencies. Technology companies like International Business Machines IBM and Amazon are leveraging blockchain to drive growth. Per Gartner, business value generated by blockchain will reach $176 billion by 2025 and $3.1 trillion by 2030.

CME Group, the largest futures exchange in the world in terms of trading volume and notional value traded, is riding on record volume growth. In first-quarter 2025, the company reported a record average daily volume of 29.8 million contracts, up 13% over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter, driven by broad-based growth in every asset class. Commodity sector volumes grew 19% while financial products grew 12%.CME's investments in marketing and education of potential clients benefit prospects. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to see strong volumes in 2025, driven by strong customer demand for efficient trading and hedging solutions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearing and transaction fees contribute a major share to CME Group's top line. Increasing clearing and transaction fees should continue to boost the top line. The company is witnessing growth in electronic trading volume and higher adoption of crypto assets with increased interest across the entire crypto economy. Marathon Digital, a Zacks Rank #3 company, holds 47,531 bitcoins at the end of the first quarter of 2025. The company continues with its commitment to scaling operations and enhancing efficiencies. In 2024, Marathon acquired seven sites across the United States. In the third quarter of 2024, the company increased its interconnect-approved capacity by 372 MW across three Ohio data centers, positioning itself for sustained mining expansion. MARA also acquired the Hopedale and Hannibal facilities for just $270,000 per MW, significantly below the industry average of $900,000 to $1.5 million per MW. Marathon is developing a greenfield facility in Ohio, which is expected to add 150 MW of capacity. These strategic expansions support MARA's growth and reduce reliance on third-party providers. By owning and operating more than 50% of its 1.7 GW compute capacity, the company aims to minimize operational risks and lower costs. This vertical integration aligns with MARA's objective to lead the digital asset industry while maintaining flexibility in energy sourcing and operational strategy.Another Zacks Rank #3 stock, MicroStrategy, is the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company holding 580,250 bitcoins as of May 25, 2025. MSTR benefits from increasing bitcoin yield, 13.7% year to date (as of April 28, 2025), keeping the company on track to reach full year target of 15%, which is now raised to 25% and bitcoin dollar gain target to $15 billion (up from initial target of $10 billion). The company's disciplined approach to capital raising through preferred equity offerings — Strike (8% convertible preferred is trading with an effective yield of roughly 9%) and Strife (10% fixed coupon perpetual preferred) — is a key catalyst. MicroStrategy currently plans to raise $42 billion through equity issuance and $42 billion through fixed income securities by the end of 2027. Under the current plan, the company has $21.1 billion in equity and $35.6 billion in fixed income securities remaining to be issued.MicroStrategy benefits from continuing cloud demand with its flagship Strategy One that powers some of the largest analytics deployments in the world. MicroStrategy is leveraging generative AI to automate and accelerate the deployment of AI-enabled applications across enterprises. A rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, STACKIT and Google is noteworthy.

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, acquired 1,045 Bitcoin worth roughly $110 million at the time of purchase, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday.

The tokens, bought between June 2 and 8, bring Strategy's total holdings of the cryptocurrency to roughly 582,000 Bitcoin worth $62.7 billion based on current prices, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based Bitcoin software company's latest buy marks its fourth-smallest Bitcoin acquisition this year, according to Saylor Tracker, a log of Strategy's Bitcoin holdings.

It comes after the company last week notched its second smallest Bitcoin buy of the year, scooping up just $75 million worth of the digital asset. Bitcoin was recently trading at $107,300, up about 1.5% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto market data provider CoinGecko.. 

Strategy has announced a Bitcoin purchase for nine weeks straight, spending around $5.1 billion on Bitcoin since mid-April. 

In the filing, Strategy said that it has raised $112 million by issuing preferred stock. The company said that it raised $66.4 million and $45.8 million by selling its Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) and Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK), respectively.

Strategy's stock price rose 2% during pre-market trading on Monday, hitting $382 per share, according to Yahoo Finance. Over the past month, shares have slid 2.9%.

“Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor said Friday on X, formerly Twitter, highlighting the firm's comparatively strong performance compared to Tesla, Bitcoin, Meta, and gold, among other companies and assets over the past year.

The firm's latest Bitcoin acquisition comes as Strategy navigates several business challenges amid growing adoption of the world's oldest cryptocurrency as markets continue to whipsaw amid widening economic and geopolitical uncertainties. 

Strategy's premium has narrowed considerably as the company issues more shares to acquire Bitcoin—a move that could dilute its stock price.

The company's value has also come under scrutiny even as a widening field of competitors adopts the first-mover's Bitcoin-HODLing playbook. 

Two-hundred-twenty-six entities, including an increasing number of public companies, have established Bitcoin treasuries as of publication time, up roughly 10% in the past month, according to data from bitcointreasuries.net.

Meanwhile, institutional and retail investors' demand for Bitcoin has waxed and waned over the past few months, as U.S. President Donald Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats against China, the EU and other major U.S. trading partners stoke investors' jitters. 

The volatility has affected Bitcoin's market value, with the token trading between $101,000 and $108,000 in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.

Deutsche Bank is actively exploring tokenized deposit options and considering launching its own stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday. The report cited an interview with Sabih Behzad, the bank's head of digital assets and currencies transformation, who outlined the institution's strategic approach to digital currency initiatives.

Behzad explained that banks have numerous pathways into the stablecoin market, ranging from serving as reserve managers to issuing their own digital currencies, either independently or through industry consortiums. While Deutsche Bank hasn't yet announced its own tokenized deposit solution, the German institution participated in trials with UBS last year involving single bank tokens and continues evaluating whether to launch a stablecoin independently or join existing industry efforts.

The bank's exploration comes as several major financial institutions have already moved into tokenized deposits. Citi, HSBC, JP Morgan and UBS have all launched single bank solutions, while Deutsche Bank has been participating in collaborative initiatives. These include the Partior cross border payments platform alongside DBS, JPMorgan, and Standard Chartered, as well as multi bank tokenized deposit experiments in Germany through the commercial bank money token initiative.

Deutsche Bank already has some exposure to stablecoin development through its asset management division DWS, which partnered with Galaxy Digital and Flow Traders to create the AllUnity stablecoin joint venture. The bank has also expanded its services to cryptocurrency firms, positioning itself within the growing digital asset ecosystem.

The broader banking sector shows increasing interest in stablecoins, with Société Générale's FORGE becoming the first systemically important bank subsidiary to launch one. Santander is reportedly considering its own stablecoin, Standard Chartered has announced development plans, and discussions continue around a potential joint stablecoin among US banks.

The exchange specifically targets institutional users
and operates under a regulated framework with central clearing. According to the companies, Trading Technologies,
which facilitates billions of derivatives transactions annually, has now
integrated its global platform with GFO-X. 

“We're delighted to offer our clients access to GFO-X
to support demand for centrally cleared cryptocurrency trading,” said Alun
Green, EVP Managing Director for Futures & Options at TT. “With the
relaxation of the U.S. regulatory market, there is increased global interest
among our institutional clients for access to digital assets.”

The integrated platform reportedly allows institutional clients to trade the new
contracts using TT's full suite of execution and analytics tools.

GFO-X CEO Arnab Sen welcomed the integration: “Trading
Technologies' robust architecture and global connectivity align perfectly with
GFO-X's mission to deliver high-performance, institutional-grade access to
digital asset derivatives. This integration enables market participants to
leverage TT's advanced execution capabilities on a fully regulated and
centrally cleared venue.”

The launch of GFO-X comes amid rising demand from

Bowmoor Capital, a London-based investment firm, and SummerHaven Investment Management, a Connecticut investment firm, are two other companies that recently integrated Trading Technologies' futures transaction cost analysis platform, a tool designed to deliver insight into trade performance and execution efficiency.

“It's great to see Bowmoor and SummerHaven applying these important analytical tools to their highly sophisticated trading and algo strategies, as well as to report to their clients how they are keeping costs low to maximize their returns,” said Peter Weiler, the EVP Managing Director, Data & Analytics at TT.

Wall Street has now set its sights on altcoins, and inflows could follow if Bitcoin holds above a key level, says MEXC COO.

Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC). This demand could soon extend to proven, low-volatility altcoins, according to Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, who spoke with crypto.news. However, such a shift will largely depend on whether Bitcoin maintains strength above a critical threshold.

“Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy's hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. 

Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. One standout example was Circle's successful IPO. Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition.

“All of these moves together point to a big change: crypto companies are no longer just reacting to market trends; they're actually influencing how institutions can access crypto. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it's becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. 

According to Jin, this trend is likely to persist—at least in the near term. The key risk factor remains Bitcoin's price. If BTC drops below the psychological $100,000 level, a temporary institutional pullback becomes more likely.

As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000 and big investors keep wanting it, more companies will probably go public with it, buy more of it, and get more money flowing into it — and not just into BTC but eventually into the whole altcoin market as well, as more people feel confident about cryptocurrency.

Ruben Gallego, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, celebrated an election win for an Oregon Democrat with a social media post that alluded to her primary win over a well-supported opponent.

Rep. Andrea Salinas had “slayed the Crypto beast,” Gallego, D-Arizona, wrote in November 2022. He welcomed a Latina's win while he chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

His word choice from three years ago might suggest a hostility to Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency king whose PAC spent millions to boost Salinas' opponent in her Democratic primary before making news for the collapse of his company. But these days Gallego, now a freshman senator often mentioned as a possible 2028 presidential contender, seems more open to the industry.

Last year, groups aligned with the industry spent $10 million supporting Gallego's Senate campaign. This year, Marc Andreessen, a billionaire venture capitalist who is one of the biggest advocates for cryptocurrencies, headlined a fundraiser for Gallego's affiliated campaign funds.

It is part of the rapidly shifting politics of crypto. Gallego is part of a bloc of Democrats who have worked with Republicans on a bill that could become the first major legislation regulating stablecoins, a type of digital asset that generally tries to keep pace with the value of the U.S. dollar and is part of the cryptocurrency industry.

He is the top-ranking Democrat on a Senate subcommittee overseeing digital currency issues and embodies a recent embrace of an industry that many Democrats — and even President Donald Trump — had once viewed with wariness.

But Trump has dropped his reticence on an industry he once called “a scam” and has already pocketed billions from his family's own business interests in crypto.

With Trump's support, the crypto industry is on the cusp of a major legislative breakthrough, less than three years after a trillion-dollar retreat in digital money known as the “crypto winter.”

Gallego has delayed that triumph, at least for the moment. He has said he and other Democrats working on the bill want to ensure the measure contains safeguards against money laundering and protects national security.

On May 8, he helped block a vote on the stablecoin bill, urging more time to collaborate with his GOP colleagues on a measure he could support.

That position has garnered criticism from supporters and opponents of the crypto bill, known as the GENIUS Act.

“You are a traitor, and we're going to take it out on your house colleagues in 2026,” Ryan Selkis, the founder of the crypto data firm Messari, wrote on social media the day the bill stalled.

Selkis, a self-described member of the “crypto political machine,” pointed to the millions of dollars in backing Democrats like Gallego had received in 2024.

On the other end, Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said Gallego is further empowering an industry with a bill that will destabilize financial markets and hurt his own party.

“The Democrats in support of this bill are essentially putting our economy at risk and filling the pockets of an industry that is going to spend enormous amounts of money against them in 2026,” Frayer said in an interview.

The stablecoin bill would stand to create a regulatory framework for a payment system that to this point has gone unchecked by government. Relatively few people currently use cryptocurrency, but especially with a White House that markets it, that could change dramatically in the near term.

That reality has helped bring Democrats to the table for a bill that reflects their wishes, too.

Critics of the bill see it as treating crypto vendors too differently than banks.

Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, teaches financial stability regulation and worked with a congressional commission to identify the causes of the 2008 Wall Street crisis.

She worries the stablecoin bill won't provide the type of restrictions that already apply to banks to ensure sufficient reserves to protect investors.

“I think the narrative that the crypto industry is offering … over the last three or four years has really pushed the financial inclusion, or democratizing-finance angle,” she said. “Isn't it great for helping people who have been previously locked out of the financial system?

“The reality, just to shatter that narrative, is that it's essentially the same kind of story that was being told about some private mortgages in the lead-up to 2008, where people who have been previously excluded from financial opportunities are being offered something really quite predatory.”

Allen compared the crypto industry to a Ponzi scheme that depends on bringing in more people to prolong high asset values. When the crypto industry retrenched in 2022, it lost comparable value to the Wall Street crash in 2008.

“The key in 2022 why most people didn't even notice was that the crypto industry was not integrated with traditional finance,” she said.

“There were people who lost their lifetime savings. … But for people who had never invested in crypto, unless they were following the news, they wouldn't have known that anything had happened.”

Salinas' 2022 win in Oregon was no obscure contest.

It drew national attention for the outsized money poured into the Democratic primary in a Latino-heavy district with no incumbent running.

Bankman-Fried, the soon-to-be indicted billionaire entrepreneur who founded FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and his allies poured more than $10 million into the race in support of little-known Carrick Flynn.

Flynn, 35 at the time, worked in artificial intelligence in Washington, D.C., until the COVID-19 pandemic, when he moved back to his native Oregon and ran for Congress.

Salinas had been a state legislator for five years by the time of the May 2022 primary. She survived the deluge of crypto-rooted money that helped Flynn and won the primary. A few months later, she won the general election, which was unsurprising in a left-leaning district.

That's when Gallego congratulated Salinas for slaying “the Crypto beast.”

Three days before Gallego did, Bankman-Fried's FTX faced a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy. The implosion of FTX rattled cryptocurrency markets and put a glaring spotlight on Bankman-Fried.

In some ways, the arc of the Salinas race traced the highs and lows of the crypto world for a time.

During the period when Flynn was competing against Salinas in the Oregon primary, Bankman-Fried weighed helping Elon Musk finance his pending purchase of the social media platform then known as Twitter.

A legal resident of the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried had discussed personally paying off that country's $11 billion national debt.

Bankman-Fried even helped Gallego with $5,800 for his House campaign, the maximum allowed at the time.

By the time the elections ended in November 2022, FTX led a retreat for crypto assets. Bitcoin's price fell to its lowest point since the onset of the pandemic two years earlier. Ethereum, another leading crypto asset, tumbled as well.

Soon after the downfall of FTX, a bipartisan trio of senators questioned California-based Silvergate Bank about its significant relations to the crypto industry. In March 2023, the bank collapsed.

At the same time, then-President Joe Biden's proposed federal budget reflected a sense common among Democrats that crypto didn't need oversight breaks. Biden's plan included a provision to create a 30% tax on electrical costs attributable to maintaining cryptocurrency trading, known as crypto mining.

“Cryptominers' high energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country,” the White House said.

The Biden administration maintained a wariness toward crypto in May 2024, when he vetoed a bill intended to change the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules regarding the handling of digital assets by regulated banks.

But by then, some congressional Democrats sought a rapprochement.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, has been a crypto advocate for years and tried to smooth industry relations with the Biden White House in a private meeting in July 2024.

After Biden dropped out of the race, Khanna convened a similar meeting weeks later that included a representative for Vice President Kamala Harris and billionaire Mark Cuban, another left-leaning crypto fan.

That ended with industry executives “lashing out” at the White House team, according to an account by Fox Business citing unnamed sources.

Trump had completed a personal reversal on the issue long before that.

In 2021, he told Fox Business that “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar.”

Three years later, Trump vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” The Republican platform promised to “end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown.”

By contrast, the Democratic platform didn't mention crypto at all.

Gallego, meanwhile, was among the Democrats who were becoming friendlier to the industry in 2024.

Stand with Crypto, an industry group, provides grades on members of Congress.

It gave Salinas, the woman whose 2022 victory Gallego cheered for its crypto impact, an “F” on the basis of four votes against the interests of the crypto industry.

By contrast, Gallego got an “A” in part with three votes when he was in the House with Salinas. On one of them, Gallego voted on May 23, 2024, with her and against the industry.

Three weeks later, Gallego's written answers to Stand with Crypto's questions helped him win the support of the industry during his Senate campaign.

He said he didn't buy or sell assets using the blockchain technology at the heart of digital currency trading, but did think it would play a “major role” in the future and “is driving economic growth and supporting millions of jobs across the country.”

“I know firsthand that when Congress fails to keep up with our adversaries and competitors, we are putting our nation's security and economic growth at risk,” Gallego wrote in his only answer that went beyond yes or no.

“I know that emerging technologies fuel innovation, including in digital assets and digital currency, and we must encourage and foster growth in this space. If we do not, other countries will. We must also provide regulatory clarity that promotes safe, responsible use of technology for investors, consumers, businesses, and everyday Arizonans.”

One of the questions involved whether he would support something like a 2023 House bill that was an earlier attempt to create a stablecoin regulatory framework.

That bill, dubbed the “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” got almost no traction when Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, introduced it in July 2023. It never got a vote in the House and only picked up one co-sponsor, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-New York.

In July 2024, Gallego was one of 21 House Democrats to vote with almost every House Republican to override Biden's veto of the measure affecting SEC rules on crypto. The House fell short of the needed 2/3 vote because 183 House Democrats stuck with Biden's approach.

Gallego's more crypto-friendly rhetoric helped convince a super PAC supportive of crypto to back Gallego over Republican Kari Lake in their Senate contest.

Over a three-week span beginning in August 2024, Protect Progress, a political-action committee funded by people with ties to the crypto industry, spent $10 million in support of Gallego's candidacy.

The ads played up Gallego's biography as a combat veteran. His platoon commander in the Iraq War, a Republican, recalled an ambush attack and praised Gallego for “running towards enemy fire. He saved lives that day.”

The ad didn't mention crypto issues at all.

The super PAC was one of three crypto-aligned organizations, led by one called Fairshake, that spent a combined $291 million in the 2024 election cycle. Their spending was notably bipartisan, especially in an era when few PACs invest in both parties.

Only three candidates received more than Gallego: Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, $40 million and the fractionally larger sums spent supporting Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Michigan, and opposing the Senate campaign of former Rep. Katie Porter, D-California.

Four congressional candidates in Arizona also received support from the crypto-aligned super PACs: Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, $1.4 million; Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Arizona, $1.6 million; former Republican candidate Blake Masters, $583,000; and former Democratic candidate Andrei Cherny, $415,000.

For Selkis, who founded a crypto analytics firm, Gallego's recent vote shows the folly of helping Democrats at all.

Selkis is an enthusiastic Trump supporter who resigned his post as CEO of Messari after inflammatory social media posts following the first attempted assassination of Trump in July 2024.

“Anyone that votes against Trump at this point can die in a (expletive) fire,” he wrote in a post he later deleted. “Literal war.”

As Gallego and other Democrats blocked a vote on the stablecoin bill last month, Selkis ripped his allies at Fairshake for their credulity in dealing with Gallego, Slotkin and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California.

“It's hard to overstate how useless everyone in the crypto political machine was aside from me and (Bitcoin magazine chief) David Bailey last year,” he wrote.

Stand with Crypto “gave A's and Fair Shake gave $20mm+ to these three traitors on the GENIUS Bill. I did my job. They failed.”

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,566.74 is up 1.28% in the past 24 hours to reach $2,538.25. This comes as new data from CoinShares shows ETH drew in $295 million in weekly inflows, the most of any digital asset last week. The surge brings month-to-date flows to $296 million and lifts Ethereum's total assets under management to $14.09 billion.

Technically, ETH rebounded from earlier weakness to retest the $2,540 resistance level after consolidating near $2,500,  according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

The recovery reflects renewed confidence among institutional investors, who have now supported 15 straight trading days of spot ETF net inflows according to SoSoValue. Combined with steady DeFi and staking growth, ETH appears poised to benefit if it can firmly clear $2,540.

In the past five years, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have seen their legacy and public perception evolve exponentially in real-time. While these forms of digital currency were once little more than food for thought on the internet for niche online communities to discuss, they have since become integral to modern fintech and economics.

Today, the Bitcoin price is soaring to unprecedented heights, reaching values it has never achieved before. In this way, Bitcoin's success reflects a growing shift in how the world approaches not only cryptocurrency but also financial markets as a whole.

As of writing, the value of Bitcoin was $111,336.20 USD per token, which is very nearly the highest value the currency has ever had. The highest value Bitcoin has ever had in its history was logged just a handful of hours before this writing, when it reached $111,691.50 USD per token.

To this end, not only is Bitcoin flourishing at the moment, but it is outright setting new high-water marks that it has never reached before. Fluctuations in the price of BTC are often linked to economic events such as interest rate announcements, geopolitical tensions, or ETF flows. All of these factors have aligned within the last few weeks, creating a dramatic uptick in value for the digitized currency.

Bitcoin's value had hit a six-month low in the first few weeks of April, dropping as low as $75,000.00 USD. However, since then, the cryptocurrency has been on a steady ascent. Furthermore, the coin doesn't seem poised to relent anytime soon, having built up so much momentum that it continues to break its own records.

When it debuted to the public in 2008, through a nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” the concept of cryptocurrency felt more like science fiction than reality. In 2008, a major superhero movie had just come out, online shopping was often viewed negatively, YouTube was still emerging, and MySpace reigned as the leading social media platform. However, over the next decade, society and culture gradually aligned with the vision that Bitcoin's anonymous creators outlined in that original whitepaper.

Bitcoin's true utility began to be realized over a decade after its release. In 2020, during a period of global unrest and challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin's popularity surged. While many skeptics and forecasters doubted that cryptocurrency was a legitimate venture or one that would endure, the digital currency ultimately proved its staying power in the following years. Today, what was once an overlooked innovation in finance is now an important element of global commerce. Nevertheless, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, making it essential for investors to be acutely aware of Bitcoin's current price.

Global Events

Economic factors like inflation, interest rates, and government policies significantly influence Bitcoin's price. Designed for high reactivity and swift changes, it responds noticeably to major global events, affecting its value.

Regulations

In 2020, people seemed to recognize the opportunity in this uncharted, largely unregulated landscape to build new lives for themselves. Cryptocurrency initially attracted investors eager to embrace such ambition and get in on the ground floor. At the outset, regulations surrounding digital currency were extremely lenient, which further fueled the excitement around it. As a result, any news about new regulations concerning cryptocurrency and its use can significantly impact the value of Bitcoin.

Technological Developments

Bitcoin has a twenty-one million coin cap, making it resistant to inflationary dilution. Scarcity, especially in a climate of money printing and fiat instability, has fueled a renewed interest in this cryptocurrency. Additionally, recent technological advancements surrounding the token and the acquisition of it have also aided in this boost of value and popularity.

Advancements such as the Lightning Network have enhanced Bitcoin's utility for fast, low-cost payments. These tools have helped to position the digitized currency as not just a store of value, but as an evolving financial tool.

Market Sentiment

Market sentiment, which includes the behavior of institutional investors, retail traders, and major market players, also helps to shape Bitcoin's price. When a well-known cryptocurrency influencer or guru forecasts that Bitcoin's price will drop soon, many investors tend to sell off their tokens. This sudden wave of selling causes Bitcoin's price to decrease, demonstrating the delicate relationship between the highly reactive coin and the community that closely observes it.

Multiple factors influence the fluctuations in Bitcoin's market value. Bitcoin can greatly alter its worth almost instantly. Critics often view this as a flaw in cryptocurrencies; however, it actually highlights the technology's exceptional strengths.

Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies were designed to be highly responsive and interactive, acting as smarter funds that swiftly adapt to market dynamics. The creation of Bitcoin was prompted by the 2008 recession, a period marked by disastrous market crashes. Therefore, Bitcoin's persistent volatility is not a drawback of its technology; rather, it illustrates how effectively this digital currency is connected to the market's fluctuations.

After nearly twenty years since its initial inception, Bitcoin has climbed its way out of obscurity and reached unprecedented levels of success. In 2020, when its value first began to skyrocket, many discredited the digitized currency and its value as little more than a passing fad. However, over five years later, the cryptocurrency is continuing to hit new highs and show the world how integral it has become to modern finance.

Sony has announced Soneium For All, an incubation program designed to accelerate the development of consumer applications and gaming within its decentralized ecosystem, which already has 7 million users. 

The initiative, the result of collaboration with Astar Network and Startale Cloud Services, is supported by an investment from the Sony Innovation Fund and will be operational starting from the third quarter of the year.

Summary

The Soneium For All project originates from Sony Block Solutions Labs (SBSL), the division that built Soneium, a blockchain based on Ethereum and developed using the Optimism OP stack. This technology, known for its speed and convenience, was chosen to facilitate the transition between the traditional Web2 world and the emerging Web3 world.

According to what was stated by SBSL, the goal is to “bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 audiences, particularly for creators, fans, and communities.” In other words, Sony aims to make the blockchain more accessible and useful for a broad audience, going beyond the financial sector to embrace areas such as entertainment, gaming, and content creation.

Soneium, the blockchain on which the entire project is based, represents one of Sony's most ambitious moves in the field of emerging technologies. Linked to a giant in electronics with 78 years of history, the network has already managed to attract millions of users, demonstrating significant potential for the mainstream adoption of blockchain.

With the introduction of the Soneium For All incubator, Sony aims to stimulate innovation within its ecosystem, offering support to developers and startups that want to build consumer and gaming applications on its network. The initiative is part of a broader context in which large tech companies – from Apple to Uber – are exploring the possibilities offered by blockchain to transform their business models.

The heart of the project is the desire to empower content creators and digital communities. 

“This initiative reflects our vision of empowering creators globally through blockchain technology. By lowering entry barriers for developers and helping them reach users more quickly, Soneium For All brings us closer to a more open and creator-driven internet,”

stated Ryohei Suzuki, Director of Sony Block Solutions Labs. 

The words of Suzuki highlight a paradigm shift: no longer just large centralized platforms, but a decentralized internet, where creators can have direct control over their own content, monetize more fairly, and interact with their communities in a transparent and secure manner.

The strength of Soneium For All also lies in its strategic partnerships. The collaboration with Astar Network, one of the main Japanese blockchains focused on interoperability and scalability, and with Startale Cloud Services, a provider of advanced cloud solutions, ensures the program a solid technological foundation.

Furthermore, the Sony Innovation Fund, the investment arm of the group, will provide the necessary financial support to attract and support the best talents and projects. This type of integrated approach – technology, mentoring, and capital – is fundamental to creating a fertile environment for innovation.

With Soneium For All, Sony positions itself as one of the main players in the race for blockchain adoption in the gaming and consumer applications sector. The gaming industry, in particular, is considered one of the most promising grounds for Web3 technology, thanks to the possibility of creating unique digital assets, virtual economies, and decentralized interactive experiences.

The incubator will offer developers the opportunity to experiment with new forms of interaction, create innovative business models, and reach an already established user base. At a time when blockchain is trying to break out of its niche to become a mass technology, initiatives like this can make the difference.

The launch of Soneium For All represents a key moment in Sony's strategy for the digital future. By combining advanced technology, high-level partnerships, and a creator-centered vision, the Japanese company demonstrates its intention to play a leading role in building a more open, inclusive, and decentralized internet.

With the opening scheduled for the third quarter, the tech world is watching closely how this program could influence the evolution of Web3 and open new paths for innovation in gaming and consumer applications.

Solana's SOL SOL$156.05 posted a solid recovery over the past 24 hours, rising as much as 4.83% before retreating to trade around $152.16. While volatility remains elevated, the cryptocurrency has formed a pattern of higher lows, suggesting underlying strength amid a fragile macro backdrop.

The broader market remains focused on renewed trade talks between the United States and China, which kicked off Monday in London. The meetings bring together top officials, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, to address longstanding tensions over tariffs and tech restrictions. 

While the two sides struck a temporary truce last month, both have since accused each other of backsliding. Analysts say the rare earth export curbs and AI chip controls remain key sticking points that could influence global market sentiment—including for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Amid this uncertainty, Solana's network continues to show expansion potential, with some institutions projecting price targets as high as $420–$620 in 2026. In the near term, traders will likely watch how macro developments affect appetite for risk-on trades in assets like SOL.

Gamified engagement strategies drive OpenSea's user activity amidst broader NFT market optimism.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

OpenSea's rollout of its OS2 platform has driven its highest user growth in over two years, suggesting that the long-dormant NFT market may be flickering back to life.

Monthly active users on OpenSea jumped to roughly 467,000 in May, marking a 44% increase from April and the most since April 2023.

While sales volumes remain at a fraction of their 2022 highs, though the user activity surge is fueling cautious optimism about a broader market rebound. Namely, due to the number of NFTs sold in April and May has returned to February 2023 at over 2 million.

Launched on May 29, OS2 represents a strategic overhaul of OpenSea's identity. The new platform supports token trading across 19 blockchains, introduces a gamified rewards system called “Voyages,” and teases the long-rumored SEA token airdrop. These moves aim to turn OpenSea into a full-spectrum on-chain hub rather than simply an NFT marketplace.

“The OS2 upgrade is the foundation for the next generation of OpenSea,” said CEO Devin Finzer in May. “We've rebuilt the platform from the ground up to become the best destination for everything on-chain.” That includes fungible tokens, multi-chain NFTs, and a growing emphasis on user engagement through quests and XP.

The Voyages system, now live with OS2, incentivizes on-chain activity with XP points widely expected to translate into SEA airdrop eligibility. Early evidence suggests the campaign is working: address activity surged in tandem with the update, though critics caution that wallet counts, OpenSea's primary user metric, may be inflated by airdrop farming.

Momentum is hard to track directly amid incentives, but current signs are positive. OpenSea regained market share last month, reclaiming ground from rivals like Blur, whose token incentives had previously lured pro traders.

Sales volumes also rose slightly, reaching $81 million in 30-day turnover, though this remains more than 90% below the peak of $5 billion in January 2022.

Part of the recovery tailwind may be regulatory. In February, the U.S. SEC formally ended its investigation into OpenSea, removing a cloud that had hung over the company since mid-2023. That clearance de-risks a potential token launch and reassures creators and traders who are still wary of enforcement action in the NFT space.

Even with renewed interest, the path forward is far from certain. Many of OS2's gains are tied to speculation around airdrops, and OpenSea hasn't committed to a timeline for the SEA token. Meanwhile, its expansion into fungible token trading may dilute focus or draw the ire of decentralized exchange incumbents.

Still, the May surge signals that user interest in NFTs isn't dead, but they are awaiting a reason to return. OpenSea's gamble is that OS2, coupled with cleaner regulatory skies and multi-chain functionality, provides the spark. Whether that fire catches beyond this first wave of airdrop activity remains to be seen.

Unilabs' unique AI-backed DeFi asset management platform sparks presale demand; Dogecoin prepares for a rebound, while Cardano tumbles 10%.

Table of Contents

Despite the bold Dogecoin forecasts and the soaring Cardano price, Unilabs Finance is in the spotlight. Popular for its novelty, the pioneering AI-backed DeFi asset manager is among the new DeFi protocols to watch out for this year. 

At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token, currently in presale and selling out fast. Over $2.2 million has been raised in early funding, priced at $0.062 in the third ICO stage. Hailed as a future top 100 coin, it is a strong contender against DOGE and ADA. 

Despite the recent downturn in the Dogecoin price, 15% in the past week, the 9-HMA and Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a rebound. At $0.18, a retest of $0.20 could push DOGE above its 30-day high of $0.25. 

Additionally, a new all-time high isn't out of the question. Down over 70% from the 2021 ATH of $0.73, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry, positioning it among the leading tokens to buy. 

While Hcpxbt targets a rally between $0.50 and $0.60 in its next leg up, many top analysts predict a jump above last cycle's peak. ProTheDoge, popular for their bullish stance, believes the Dogecoin price could climb past $2 this year. Although one of the top tokens to buy in this bull run, experts consider UNIL more attractive due to its AI narrative and higher growth prospects. 

Like many top altcoins, the Cardano price is in a downtrend. It nosedived by 10% on the 7-day chart, trading at $0.6. However, its long-term outlook remains promising, especially considering growing adoption and institutional interest. 

At the same time, technical indicators point to a bounce in the Cardano price, the Williams Percent Range and Stochastic RSI Fast are key signals. Its next jump could push the price above the monthly high of $0.8608, positioning it among the top DeFi tokens to buy. 

Meanwhile, its long-term outlook is even more promising. Despite recent market downswings, Crypto_Twittier is optimistic, predicting a range between $3.80 and $5.60 this year, a bold Cardano price prediction. However, experts believe its upside pales in comparison to Unilabs' UNIL token, considered a more compelling alternative. 

Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a new DeFi protocol that intersects with traditional finance and artificial intelligence. Fundamentally solid, experts believe it could be the year's breakout project. Also, its native utility coin, UNIL, is considered a strong contender against ADA and DOGE, one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy this cycle. 

A hot topic within the crypto community is its novelty, which revolves around being the first AI-backed DeFi asset manager in the world. Designed to democratize access to alpha and unlock institutional-grade opportunities for everyday retail investors, it intends to level the playing field for small-scale investors. 

With its utility coin, UNIL, currently in presale, it has been selling out quickly. A token costs only $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, with early investors positioned for significant gain during the presale and post-launch. Other perks to holding include staking, periodic airdrops, exclusive access to high-potential opportunities, voting rights and redistribution of 30% of the total platform-generated fees to holders.  

In its early stages, UNIL is one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy due to its upside potential and budget-friendliness. Presenting a lower entry than the current Dogecoin price, investors don't have to break the bank before positioning for gains. Despite experts' bold Cardano price prediction, its small market cap leaves plenty of room to run.

PISTACHO

KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia's participation in Project Dunbar, a cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, is a sound move, said Professor of Economics Anella Munro.

She said the participation demonstrates Malaysia's commitment to being at the forefront of regional financial innovation.

“Being part of this project certainly fits into the goal of understanding what it is, developing capacity, considering potential use cases, and collaborating with others, some of whom have experience and some who do not. From an outsider's perspective, I believe Bank Negara is doing all the right things,” she said in an interview with SunBiz.

Munro said while there are other ways to facilitate cross-border transactions, CBDCs remain a superior option.

“None is really as good as a central bank digital currency because it's a safe settlement asset, like we use at the wholesale level, and I hope it would help potentially with transparency, speed, and cost.”

She said cross-border payments have traditionally relied on correspondent banking systems, which are slow and expensive.

“What if we had a system that provided a safe settlement asset for cross-border transactions at the wholesale level?”

However, Munro said, with cross-border CBDC implementation, there are a lot of issues about governance.

“It's more complicated than it seems, due to jurisdictional and legal issues, in addition to technological challenges.

“It's a sovereign currency, do you want it on the same platform? Do you want it to be used abroad? Borders become irrelevant once you're on some of these platforms.”

She pointed to stablecoins which could provide a similar kind of service, although they are not as strong as central bank liabilities because they come with a different kind of counterparty risk.

“If stablecoins are very well backed, they could potentially serve as a settlement asset in the system,” Munro said.

She said stablecoins were a disaster a few years ago as they were not properly backed and were considered the Wild West.

“They say they're stable, but often back themselves with questionable assets. This has changed a lot in the last few years, but the area is still an open question. The regulation has really come in to tame them and make them much more what they say they are.”

The push for CBDCs dates back starting with China's e-yuan project in 2014. When Facebook Libra came around in 2019, it renewed focus on the area, driven by concerns over big tech potentially controlling global payment systems and private data from social networks.

Munro also highlighted that the fear of privacy issues and the potential for unregulated payments within private networks has led to the current push for CBDCs. “Not only were there privacy concerns, but if a payment system operated within a private network, it could avoid oversight for anti-money laundering and other regulations, which was a significant problem.”

In 1966, archaeologists discovered a Roman building measuring over 7,000 square feet. It turns out it was a small part of a 43,000-square-foot villa.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Archaeologists only scratched the surface—quite literally—in 1966 when they examined what is now known to be one of the grandest Roman-era villas ever discovered in central France. 

When crews began the process of creating a gravel pit on the bank of the Yonne River back in the 1960s, they uncovered a 10-room, 7,500-square-foot residence—and stopped digging.

Now, new archaeological work shows that the impressive find from nearly 60 years ago wasn't the crown jewel of the site, but simply the “secondary wing” of a striking 43,000-square-foot home complete with gardens, thermal baths, radiant heating, mosaics, and all the other things a wealthy aristocrat from the first through fourth century A.D. could ask for. 

According to an announcement from the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research from the Sainte-Nitasse archaeological site, the four-acre property along the river shows off Gallo-Roman culture in Roman Gaul. “We are not talking about a simple country residence,” the team wrote in a translated statement, “but the core of a vast agricultural estate managed by a family belonging to the political or economic elite of the region.” 

The large villa in Roman Gaul is impressive not only for the sheer size of the structure, but for what it says about the development of residential buildings of the time. These sites often feature sophisticated architecture with materials such as marble, mosaics, and frescoes. Many also include pools, fountains, and gardens that create courtyards and private sanctuaries. This villa has all of that, and few villas have it all in the same scale.

“It is rare to find a pars urbana [residential area] so developed and excavated so extensively,” the team wrote. 

The building has a perimeter wall around it, expansive gardens on each side, a pool to the north, and a fountain to the south. The home features gallery rooms, reception spaces, work areas, a kitchen, traces of mosaics, and even thermal baths attached to the dwelling that fill the eastern wing.  

Initial findings suggest two stages of construction, although the team hasn't ruled out a third possible phase, which could coincide with the growth of the ancient of Auxerre (near which this villa was built). The city began as a secondary rural settlement at the beginning of the first century, and grew into a capital city by the fourth century. 

The researchers plan to analyze the recovered artifacts to hopefully reconstruct the daily life of the residents of the Gallo-Roman villa. “While the size of the buildings outlines the very comfortable lifestyle of the occupants,” the team wrote, “the remains of their daily lives still need to be studied to better characterize them.”

What's behind the Mysterious Epidemic of Kidney Disease Killing Thousands of Young Men?

As cases of chronic kidney disease emerge in outdoor laborers around the world, scientists are finding that repeated damage from prolonged extreme heat seems to be a leading factor to kidney failure

By Carrie Arnold & Nature magazine 

An epidemic of chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) persists in Nicaragua's Pacific coast. This disease mainly affects young men who work in sugarcane plantations, although children and women have also been affected.

For years, Oscar has greeted dawn with the rhythmic swing of his machete as he chops sugar cane in fields near his home in El Salvador. On a typical morning, the 33-year-old begins work long before sunrise in a futile attempt to escape the suffocating heat and humidity. But one morning in December, Oscar clutched his wife's hand instead of his steel machete. The pair sat in a waiting room of a clinic in the small town of Tierra Blanca. Oscar, a pseudonym being used to protect his privacy, had gone with his wife to find out whether his kidneys were failing.

Beginning in the late 1990s, a mysterious epidemic of chronic kidney disease began emerging in Bajo Lempa, a region on the Pacific coast of El Salvador where Tierra Blanca is located. The disease, which researchers have dubbed chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu), often affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. Many are agricultural workers or labourers without other known risk factors for kidney disease. As many as one in four adult men in Bajo Lempa have kidney disease, whether CKDu or another form, compared with an estimated one in ten men globally. Roughly 17% of men in Bajo Lempa live with kidney failure.

Although the epidemic of this perplexing kidney disease was first recognized in this region, more than half a dozen hotspots have since appeared elsewhere in Central America and around the world. Hard data on the number of people with CKDu globally have yet to be tallied. However, occupational-medicine specialist Emmanuel Jarquín says that tens of thousands of people have probably died from the disease, and the number continues to grow.

“This is the biggest story in the world about kidney disease,” says Jarquín, who is on the front line of the epidemic in El Salvador. In 2007, Jarquín founded the Agency for Development and Agricultural Health (AGDYSA), a scientific research organization based in San Salvador that aims to protect agricultural workers from kidney disease and other work-related conditions. There were so many cases of kidney failure in the district of Bajo Lempa that AGDYSA opened a satellite office in Tierra Blanca in 2023.

“People here are aware of their illness, but when they reach for treatment, they don't receive anything,” says Jarquín. Not prevention, not dialysis, not anything. As a result, people get sicker, and fast. “It's a vicious cycle,” he says.

Although the cause of the epidemic hasn't been definitively determined, most scientists agree that, at least among sugar-cane workers, intense labour in extreme heat is one of the major drivers of this condition. Elsewhere, CKDu shows up among other labourers, including rice farmers, construction workers and miners.

Many researchers expect the effects of climate change to increase the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which is already a growing health concern globally. In May, the governing body of the World Health Organization adopted a resolution to recognize kidney disease as a major cause of death and disability and to strengthen disease-prevention efforts.

Kidney disease is an example of the damage that prolonged, incessant heat can do to the body, says Ollie Jay, a heat physiologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. For the epidemic of CKDu, the agricultural workers of Bajo Lempa were an early warning sign.

More than two decades ago, when otherwise healthy young men in Bajo Lempa began to grow fatigued and anaemic, they chalked it up to long hours of intense and exhausting work. Sugar-cane cutters are “marathon workers,” says Fabiano Amorim, a physiologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Furthermore, “they sometimes don't have the proper food for the work they are doing. They don't have water available.”

Taking time off to rest wasn't an option. The men depended on their work to provide food and shelter for their families. So the workers swallowed ibuprofen and got back to their machetes.

But for many, the fatigue worsened until they could no longer get out of bed. With local physicians unable to help, some of the men managed to make the two-hour drive to Rosales National Hospital in San Salvador. When they arrived, the men learnt that their kidneys had failed. Their bodies could no longer filter certain types of toxin, such as uric acid, from the blood or eliminate excess water. When this happens, fluid accumulates in the body until the lungs can no longer fill with air and the heart struggles to beat. Without dialysis to clean and filter the blood, death is inevitable.

When the men arrived at Rosales National Hospital, nephrologist Ricardo Leiva and his then-trainee Ramón García-Trabanino were puzzled about why these seemingly healthy young men's kidneys had abruptly crashed. The textbooks that both physicians had pored over in medical school taught them that kidney failure was usually the result of untreated diabetes and high blood pressure or certain rare autoimmune and genetic conditions. The men from Bajo Lempa had none of these.

“They were so young … I had no answers,” says García-Trabanino, who now helps to run a private dialysis clinic in San Salvador. “It was a massacre.”

Yet, with the hospital flooded with people from Bajo Lempa, neither had much time to work it out. “I started work at 5 a.m. every day,” Leiva says. “And I didn't get home until after it was dark.”

When Leiva, García-Trabanino and a team of researchers published the first account of the mysterious kidney disease in a public-health journal in 2002, the condition seemed like a local kidney anomaly — what biologists call an endemic nephropathy. But then papers began identifying other hotspots of CKDu, including in the sugar-cane-growing region of Nicaragua.

“Nobody believed us that we were seeing a new form” of chronic kidney disease, says Marvin Gonzalez Quiroz, a physician and epidemiologist from Nicaragua, who is now at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “Nobody believed the prevalence that we were reporting.” Other research documented similar problems in Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, India and Sri Lanka.

None of the early studies could pin down a cause, but several leading hypotheses have emerged, including exposure to pesticides and heavy metals, as well as pathogens, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic heat stress. Researchers now say that CKDu could have multiple causes that vary between individuals, and across locations and time. Still, epidemiological and animal studies point to heat stress as an important factor.

Humans maintain their core body temperature in a narrow range of 36–37 °C, says Daniel Vecellio, a biometeorologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, and expend a lot of energy to keep it there. When our bodies heat up, blood vessels in the limbs and extremities dilate in a process called vasodilation, shunting blood away from major organs and to the surface of the skin, allowing heat to dissipate. As the core body temperature creeps up, glands in the skin begin pumping out sweat, further cooling the body. A fan or breeze amplifies this cooling; high humidity makes the process less effective, says Vecellio. When vasodilation and sweating are inadequate and the body temperature gets too high, muscles cramp, nausea takes hold and people can become confused and faint. In extreme cases, seizures and death can follow.

The kidneys are some of the first organs to feel the strain as body temperature rises. Sending more blood to the body's surface means that the kidneys and other major organs receive less oxygen and nutrients. This often happens while water is lost through sweating, forcing the kidneys to kick into overdrive to preserve the body's fluid balance. That effort can lead to drops in kidney function, even in healthy adults.

The entire heat response is a finely tuned physiological symphony that leaves little room for error, says Catharina Giudice, an emergency-medicine physician at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. “The kidneys are more vulnerable than other organs. They have a very intense metabolic demand, so small changes in blood flow tend to be more harmful,” she says.

People working in construction and agriculture don't just get hot from being outside in the Sun — they also generate heat through physical labour. Sweating a lot can leave them dangerously dehydrated at the end of a workday, even if they drink water as usual, says Giudice.

Except in the most severe cases, researchers thought that the kidneys could quickly bounce back from heat stress with no long-term damage. The emergence of CKDu instead hints that small, repeated injuries — even those that don't result in a hospital visit — can build up over time. Compounded and amplified by other exposures, these small insults can lead to end-stage kidney failure, says Giudice.

“You're having this acute kidney injury day after day,” she says. “Then you progress to a state where the cells can't recover fully.”

Biopsies from people with CKDu show damage to specific parts of the kidney called the tubules, which reabsorb and return water and other useful substances to the blood. The problem, says Zachary Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington, is working out how to detect this damage before kidney function drops drastically. Typical tests spot a problem only when there are elevated levels of a waste product called creatinine in the blood and protein in the urine.

Nearly ten years ago, Schlader decided to look for molecular distress signals that could be early indicators of declines in kidney function. In one study of sugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua, Schlader and his colleagues found that markers of tubule injury changed as blood creatinine increased throughout the harvest season. Another study by some of the same researchers, looking at workers during harvest, found that increased levels of white blood cells in urine (a marker of inflammation) and a decrease in haemoglobin in red blood cells (the production of which depends on the hormone erythropoietin secreted by the kidneys) could predict declines in kidney function across the harvest season.

“The hotter people got, the more dehydrated people got, these signals went up,” says Schlader. Importantly, he says, there are biomarkers that can be measured easily, and can be detected before more commonly used markers of kidney injury, such as creatinine.

“And it's not just the kidney that's being affected; the whole body is,” says Schlader. “Heat stress causes systemic inflammation, and CKDu is likely some combination of what's happening within the kidneys and what's happening systemically.”

Research by Schlader's team and others has shown that kidney damage can accumulate much more quickly than anyone thought.

“It affirmed a lot of what we hear anecdotally, which is that people start working when they're young, they're healthy. They have good kidney function, and then bang, they have stage-four kidney disease and will need dialysis soon,” says Madeleine Scammell, an environmental-health scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, who studies CKDu.

Laura Sánchez-Lozada, a physiologist at the National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chávez in Mexico City, studies how other factors, such as drinking fructose-sweetened beverages and using anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, can accelerate kidney damage in CKDu. Many agricultural workers in Central America lack access to adequate amounts of safe drinking water when working and instead turn to sports drinks and sodas for rehydration. In small amounts, the sugars in these drinks provide energy and help the body to absorb electrolytes. But large amounts of fructose can trigger an inflammatory response as kidney cells work to metabolize the sugar.

When Sánchez-Lozada and her colleagues gave rats fructose-containing beverages rather than plain water for rehydration, the rats experienced greater dehydration and increased kidney injury. Providing safe, plain drinking water and lower-sugar electrolyte drinks for heat-stressed workers will be key to preventing further damage, Sánchez-Lozada says.

Meanwhile, researchers are investigating other contributing factors for CKDu. In Bajo Lempa, scientists proposed early on that pesticides and naturally occurring heavy metals could be culprits, and these factors are still under investigation. Further research on CKDu in Sri Lanka, a hotspot studied for nearly two decades, links exposure to pesticides — such as glyphosate — to an increased risk of kidney disease. Glyphosate has been shown in rodent studies to be toxic to the kidneys. The mineral-rich ground water in parts of Sri Lanka slows down the natural degradation of pesticides, causing them to remain in drinking-water supplies for longer than in other regions. Anna Strasma, a nephrologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, says that CKDu might not be a single disease, but rather a collection of similar illnesses with slightly different causes.

Epidemiologists in Nepal have found high levels of kidney failure in men who have worked overseas in Malaysia and the Middle East, where they are often hired for manual labour at construction sites and oil fields, exposing them to extreme heat and potential toxins. Other scientists are investigating where else CKDu might exist. In the second half of this year, Strasma and her colleagues at Duke will begin screening farmers and other workers in Kenya to look for cases there. And researchers in the United States have detected potential signals that CKDu might exist among agricultural workers in California. In March, Strasma and a team of scientists documented cases of CKDu in dialysis clinics in Houston, Texas.

It has long been known that heat can kill, but deaths were thought to be rare or, more recently, tied to extreme temperature events. “There's all this good research on the maximum amount of heat that humans can take,” says Vecellio. “But heat kills well before we get to these thresholds.”

The combined effects of exertion, dehydration and humidity alongside age, body size, acclimation to the local climate and other physiological differences mean that any individual's threshold might be lower. And intense heat can be particularly problematic in places where night-time temperatures don't get low enough to offer relief. There are more hints that long-term exposure to excessive heat can increase people's risk of, or even cause, disease, Vecellio says.

The influx of CKDu cases has left the health system in El Salvador unable to cope. A small dialysis unit operates in the Bajo Lempa town of San Pedro, but demand is so high that people who do get a dialysis spot can attend only two days per week (three times per week is considered standard). The situation is similar at the Rosales National Hospital, Leiva says.

At any given time, the hospital might have 5 spots available per 1,000 people who need dialysis, Jarquín says. The people waiting for treatment can't get a place until someone receiving dialysis has died.

That makes the prevention efforts that Jarquín and García-Trabanino are undertaking all the more important. Some individuals whose kidneys are struggling but have not yet failed can benefit from controlling their blood pressure and diabetes that might occur alongside CKDu, as well as making dietary changes and seeking alternate employment if possible. García-Trabanino — who sees people from Bajo Lempa at a private haemodialysis centre in San Salvador — says that with blood pressure medications, improved nutrition and hydration, some people have staved off progression to kidney failure for more than two decades. “Prevention works. It really works,” he says.

Together with local non-profit organizations, Jarquín is working to provide regular health tests for community members. Although the tests don't look for CKDu-specific biomarkers, they can still catch declining kidney function before dialysis is required. It was the results of one of these tests that brought Oscar to the AGDYSA clinic in Tierra Blanca for further consultation with Jarquín.

Sitting in the waiting room, Oscar's wife murmured reassurances as she caressed his knuckles with her thumb. Oscar's concerns weren't just about his health, but also the future of his family. How would they survive without his income? Would they need to sell their few cows, pigs and chickens to keep a roof over their heads and pay for his dialysis?

For Oscar, there was good news. Jarquín told Oscar that although he had kidney disease, it was mild. Oscar sagged with relief. He didn't need dialysis, not now and hopefully not ever. He could continue working, but he'd have to find ways to drink more water during the day and seek out rest and shade when he could. It's a matter of life and death, said Jarquín.

Oscar bobbed his head rapidly in agreement. For the rest of the appointment, he didn't stop smiling. “Gracias a Dios,” he whispered. “Gracias a Dios.”

Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.

A new study led by Keck Medicine of USC researchers may have uncovered an effective combination therapy for glioblastoma, a brain tumor diagnosis with few available effective treatments. According to the National Brain Tumor Society, the average survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is eight months.

The study finds that using Tumor Treating Fields therapy (TTFields), which delivers targeted waves of electric fields directly into tumors to stop their growth and signal the body's immune system to attack cancerous tumor cells, may extend survival among patients with glioblastoma, when combined with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (temozolomide).

TTFields disrupt tumor growth using low-intensity, alternating electric fields that push and pull key structures inside tumor cells in continually shifting directions, making it difficult for the cells to multiply. Preventing tumor growth gives patients a better chance of successfully fighting the cancer. When used to treat glioblastoma, TTFields are delivered through a set of mesh electrodes that are strategically positioned on the scalp, generating fields at a precise frequency and intensity focused on the tumor. Patients wear the electrodes for approximately 18 hours a day.

Researchers observed that TTFields attract more tumor-fighting T cells, which are white blood cells that identify and attack cancer cells, into and around the glioblastoma. When followed by immunotherapy, these T cells stay active longer and are replaced by even stronger, more effective tumor-fighting T cells.

"By using TTFields with immunotherapy, we prime the body to mount an attack on the cancer, which enables the immunotherapy to have a meaningful effect in ways that it could not before," said David Tran, MD, PhD, chief of neuro-oncology with Keck Medicine, co-director of the USC Brain Tumor Center and corresponding author of the study. "Our findings suggest that TTFields may be the key to unlocking the value of immunotherapy in treating glioblastoma."

TTFields are often combined with chemotherapy in cancer treatment. However, even with aggressive treatment, the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. Immunotherapy, while successful in many other cancer types, has also not proved effective for glioblastoma when used on its own.

However, in this study, adding immunotherapy to TTFields and chemotherapy was associated with a 70% increase in overall survival. Notably, patients with larger, unresected (not surgically removed) tumors showed an even stronger immune response to TTFields and lived even longer. This suggests that, when it comes to kick-starting the body's immune response against the cancer, having a larger tumor may provide more targets for the therapy to work against.

Using alternating electric fields to unlock immunotherapy 

Pembrolizumab, the immunotherapy used in this study, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), which enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancers by improving T cells' ability to identify and attack cancer cells.

However, there are typically few T cells in and around glioblastomas because these tumors originate in the brain and are shielded from the body's natural immune response by the blood-brain barrier. This barrier safeguards the brain by tightly regulating which cells and substances enter from the bloodstream. Sometimes, this barrier even blocks T cells and other therapies that could help kill brain tumors.

This immunosuppressive environment inside and around the glioblastoma is what makes common cancer therapies like pembrolizumab and chemotherapy significantly less effective in treating it. Tran theorized the best way to get around this issue was to start an immune reaction directly inside the tumor itself, an approach known as in situ immunization, using TTFields.

This study demonstrates that combining TTFields with immunotherapy triggers a potent immune response within the tumor -- one that ICIs can then amplify to bolster the body's own defense against cancer.

"Think of it like a team sport -- immunotherapy sends players in to attack the tumor (the offense), while TTFields weaken the tumor's ability to fight back (the defense). And just like in team sports, the best defense is a good offense," said Tran, who is also a member of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Study methodology and results

The study analyzed data from 2-THE-TOP, a Phase 2 clinical trial, which enrolled 31 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients who had completed chemoradiation therapy. Of those, 26 received TTFields combined with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Seven of these 26 patients had inoperable tumors due to their locations -- an especially high-risk subgroup with the worst prognosis and few treatment options.

Patients in the trial were given six to 12 monthly treatments of chemotherapy alongside TTFields for up to 24 months. The number and duration of treatments were determined by patients' response to treatment. The immunotherapy was given every three weeks, starting with the second dose of chemotherapy, for up to 24 months.

Patients who used the device alongside chemotherapy and immunotherapy lived approximately 10 months longer than patients who had used the device with chemotherapy alone in the past. Moreover, those with large, inoperable tumors lived approximately 13 months longer and showed much stronger immune activation compared to patients who underwent surgical removal of their tumors.

"Further studies are needed to determine the optimal role of surgery in this setting, but these findings may offer hope, particularly for glioblastoma patients who do not have surgery as an option," said Tran.

Moving the research forward

Keck Medicine is participating in the multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial to validate the efficacy of TTFields with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Tran, who has been researching TTFields for more than a decade, serves as the chair of the steering committee for this trial. Frances Chow, MD, neuro-oncologist with USC Norris, is the principal investigator of the Keck Medicine study site.

This Phase 3 trial, currently open at 28 sites across the United States, Europe and Israel, aims to enroll over 740 patients through April 2029, including those with gross total resection, partial resection or biopsy-only tumors to assess the extent of how surgically removing tumors influences immune response.

Ashley Ghiaseddin, MD, and Maryam Rahman, MD, MS, colleagues from the University of Florida, also contributed to this work.

A small region of the brain, known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), plays a key role in how we process rewards. It produces dopamine, a neuromodulator that helps predict future rewards based on contextual cues. A team from the universities of Geneva (UNIGE), Harvard, and McGill has shown that the VTA goes even further: it encodes not only the anticipated reward but also the precise moment it is expected. This discovery, made possible by a machine learning algorithm, highlights the value of combining artificial intelligence with neuroscience. The study is published in the journal Nature.

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a key role in motivation and the brain's reward circuit. The main source of dopamine, this small cluster of neurons sends this neuromodulator to other brain regions to trigger an action in response to a positive stimulus.

"Initially, the VTA was thought to be merely the brain's reward centre. But in the 1990s, scientists discovered that it doesn't encode reward itself, but rather the prediction of reward," explains Alexandre Pouget, full professor in the Department of Basic Neurosciences in the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine.

Experiments on animals have shown that when a reward consistently follows a light signal, for example, the VTA eventually releases dopamine not at the moment of the reward, but as soon as the signal appears. This response therefore encodes the prediction of the reward -- linked to the signal -- rather than the reward itself.

A much more sophisticated function

This "reinforcement learning," which requires minimal supervision, is central to human learning. It's also the principle behind many artificial intelligence algorithms that improve performance through training -- such as AlphaGo, the first algorithm to defeat a world champion in the game of Go.

In a recent study, Alexandre Pouget's team, in collaboration with Naoshige Uchida of Harvard University and Paul Masset of McGill University, shows that the VTA's coding is even more sophisticated than previously thought. "Rather than predicting a weighted sum of future rewards, the VTA predicts their temporal evolution. In other words, each gain is represented separately, with the precise moment at which it is expected," explains the UNIGE researcher, who led this work.

"While we knew that VTA neurons prioritised rewards close in time over the ones further in the future- on the principle of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush -we discovered that different neurons do so on different time scales, with some focus on the reward possible in a few seconds' time, others on the reward expected in a minute's time, and others on more distant horizons. This diversity is what allows the encoding of reward timing. This much finer representation gives the learning system great flexibility, allowing it to adapt to maximise immediate or delayed rewards, depending on the individual's goals and priorities."

AI and neuroscience: a two-way street

These findings stem from a fruitful dialogue between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Alexandre Pouget developed a purely mathematical algorithm that incorporates the timing of reward processing. Meanwhile, the Harvard researchers gathered extensive neurophysiological data on VTA activity in animals experiencing rewards.

"They then applied our algorithm to their data and found that the results matched perfectly with their empirical findings." While the brain inspires AI and machine learning techniques, these results demonstrate that algorithms can also serve as powerful tools to reveal our neurophysiological mechanisms.

Understanding the famously complex Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory could solve mathematics' greatest problems.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

It's likely that you won't understand any of the mathematics in this article, but you'd be in good company—most mathematicians don't understand it, either. That's because we're talking about the famously difficult Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory (IUT), first proposed across 2,000 pages in 2012 by Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki and vigorously debated in the 13 years since: is it a revolutionary way of understanding mathematics or a complete waste of time?

The best way to think about IUT is that it's a completely novel understanding of mathematics that makes a drastic departure from the theorems taught in universities around the world. According to mathematics expert Kato Fumimot, speaking to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the theory is almost an otherworldly creation.

“Imagine an alien coming to Earth who can only speak an extraterrestrial language,” Fumimot told the SCMP. “If he were to give a speech in front of a large group of Earthlings, surely no one would understand what he is saying, and no matter how many times he repeats it, there would be no progress.”

Whole branches of mathematics have been set up to try to interpret the secrets of IUT. According to some estimates, only two dozen or so mathematicians in the world can even begin to understand this mysterious language. However, it seems that a promising new mathematician may have recently been added to their number. 

Zhou Zhongpeng isn't a learned professor or noted mathematician, but a former doctoral student turned tech worker—one that happens to be obsessed with learning IUT. After decoding key elements of IUT and proposing novel refinements and explanations of the ABC conjecture, he sent his work—uploaded to the preprint server arXiv—to the theory's creator, Mochizuki, and Ivan Fesenko, one of the few mathematicians who has made some headway in understanding IUT. According to SCMP and Interesting Engineering, Fesenko immediately reached out to Zhou and told him to fly to his campus in Westlake University in China. Zhou promptly quit his tech job and began working with Fesenko. 

If mathematicians at large are ever able to truly learn IUT, they could be able to find more efficient solutions to some of the field's most devilish problems. Take, for example, Fermat's Last Theorem. Formulated in 1637 and named after French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, the theorem states that no three positive integers (a, b, and c) can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn where “n” is greater than two. Although this seems simple, it took more than 350 years to prove it, and the solution ran 130 pages long. Zhou's work could solve such a theorem in fewer steps and also prove useful for other mathematical enigmas.

For now, IUT remains a mostly an “alien language.” And because so many of the theory's adherents live in Japan, New Scientist says that, effectively, the proof is only true in that country. Only time will tell whether that claim spreads to eventually envelop the world.

New Doubts about Milky Way–Andromeda Collision, Explanation of 2023 Marine Heat Wave and Worms That Build Towers

The Milky Way's big crash with Andromeda might not be a sure thing. Plus, we discuss an overheated ocean, a giant planet circling a tiny star and worms that build living towers.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed.

You've probably heard that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is doomed to collide with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy sometime around 5 billion years from now. But according to new research, maybe we shouldn't count on this multigalactic merger deal going through.

In a study published last Monday in Nature Astronomy, researchers who analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope and NASA's Hubble say the event is more of a coin flip than a given: the team's 100,000 computer simulations suggest there's just about a 50–50 chance of the two galaxies colliding within the next 10 billion years or so. When you look at the next 4 to 5 billion years, that chance drops down to around 2%.

In other space news, scientists are buzzing about a tiny star that punches way above its weight. TOI-6894 is a red dwarf that's roughly 20% as massive as our sun. But in a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, researchers say they've spotted the signature of a giant planet orbiting the little guy. The planet, called TOI-6894b, is described as a low-density gas giant—it is a little bigger than Saturn, but only has around half as much mass. Astronomers say the presence of a gas giant around such a small star is so surprising that it challenges the most widely accepted theory of planet formation. That theory, called core accretion, suggests that giant planets are born when their solid cores get massive enough to start pulling in lots of gas. Smaller stars generally lack enough gas and dust in their protoplanetary discs to allow for such a process, but this red dwarf ended up with a gas giant anyhow. Because red dwarf stars are super common in our galaxy, this could mean gas giants are more plentiful than we thought. The researchers will use the James Webb Space Telescope to study the planet's atmosphere, which should provide more clues about its formation.

Now let's move on to some environmental news. Back in the summer of 2023 an extreme marine heat wave hit the North Atlantic Ocean, affecting water temperatures from Greenland to the Sahara and all the way over to the Americas. A study published last Wednesday in Nature aimed to explain why. The researchers say the summer temperature surge was equivalent to around 20 years of typical warming in the North Atlantic. While climate change, of course, played a role, the new study pinpoints some other factors that made water temperatures particularly hot that summer. For starters, in June and July of that year, the winds over the North Atlantic were weaker than at any other period on record, which meant less churning to mix sun-warmed surface waters. As a result heat was more concentrated and rose more quickly.

The researchers also note that it's possible a reduction in sulphur emissions led to fewer clouds in some areas, so more sunlight hit the water. But the scientists were quick to add that weak wind was the primary driver—and that climate change is likely to make things worse. Reducing pollution from the atmosphere, generally speaking, remains a great thing to do. In a news release, the study's lead author noted that if we don't cut down our fossil fuel emissions, extreme marine heat waves like the one we saw in 2023 will only get more common and more intense. And that's bad news for everyone: warm water releases heat into the atmosphere, contributing to heat waves and severe rainstorms. Warmer oceans also mean more hurricanes. And higher water temperatures are tied to increases in coral bleaching as well.

But another study, published last Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science, offers some hope for ailing coral—not from bleaching but from a disease that can be just as devastating to a reef.

Stony coral tissue loss disease, or SCTLD, was first identified off the coast of Florida just over a decade ago and has now been spotted on reefs throughout the Caribbean. More than 20 species of coral can catch it. SCTLD quickly destroys a coral's soft tissue, with some species dying within weeks of symptoms appearing. It's not clear exactly what causes SCTLD, but it seems likely that bacteria at least play a part because treating affected corals with an antibiotic paste has been shown to help them survive.

The issue with this treatment is that it's a temporary fix, and it opens the door for the potential evolution of a resistant strain of whatever bacterium is involved. This new study reports on the promising results of treating coral with probiotics instead.

Corals have microbiomes just like we do, and a boost of good bacteria seems to help keep them healthy. The researchers behind the new study started by testing more than 200 strains of bacteria from disease-resistant corals and ultimately focusing on a particularly promising strain from great star corals in the lab. In 2020 the scientists took their experiment into the ocean, applying a solution of seawater and probiotics to a Florida reef impacted by SCTLD and using weighted plastic bags to create a sort of in-ocean aquarium that kept the treatment from floating away. After two and a half years, the probiotics seemed to be preventing the spread of SCTLD without causing any other disruptions to the reefs' microbiome. More research is needed to see how this treatment might impact coral in other regions, but probiotics could prove to be an important tool for fighting this devastating disease.

We'll wrap up today's episode with something fun, if maybe also a little bit creepy: an act of “collective hitchhiking” featuring a living tower of worms.

Nematodes are tiny worms that you probably don't spend much time thinking about, but they're actually the most abundant animals on Earth, making up an estimated four fifths of all animal life on our planet. According to a study published last Thursday in Current Biology, these creatures might sometimes use their vast numbers to make up for their miniscule size.

Individual nematodes will sometimes stand on their tails and wave around to try to hitch a ride on a passing animal. Scientists have long suspected that they can also link together to form multi-worm “towers” to increase their height, but this had only ever been observed in a lab setting. In the new study scientists describe seeing some of these waving worm towers inside decaying apples and pears found in the dirt of orchards.

Further observations proved that, far from a chaotic pile of worms, these structures reflect the kind of superorganism behavior we see in slime molds and fire ants. While many species of nematode could be found in each piece of rotting fruit, the towers only consisted of members of the same species. Once in place, the nematodes would wave in unison as if they were one giant worm. Experiments in the lab showed that nematodes could self-assemble in just two hours and remain stable for more than 12. They could even create little arms with which to explore the space and build bridges to cross gaps to new locations. So the next time you're struggling with a group project at school or work, just remind yourself that even nematodes can figure out how to work together.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday.

Developing robotic hands that adapt to real-world dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and machine intelligence. Despite notable advances in replicating human-hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (P < 0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering promising perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behaviour.

Precise sensory–motor control in real-world scenarios is fundamental to machine intelligence and embodied artificial intelligence (AI)1,2. A hallmark challenge in this field is the control of dextrous robotic hands3. Despite advances in mechatronic systems and sophisticated finger designs that enable enhanced dexterity4, the limited availability of rich sensory feedback fundamentally restricts their ability to adapt during dynamic interactions5,6. Understanding and addressing this sensory limitation is crucial for deploying robotic hands in real-world scenarios that demand nuanced control and rapid adaptation.

The robotics community has long recognized this challenge, approaching it through increasingly sophisticated hardware and control strategies. On the hardware front, researchers have developed intricate mechanical designs that closely mimic human-hand kinematics7,8,9,10,11, primarily relying on proprioceptive sensing for joint-level feedback. These hardware advances, often combined with visual perception, have enabled various control paradigms: from planning-based methods that execute precise finger gaiting12,13 to learning-based approaches that develop control policies through training14,15,16 and recently to large language models that provide high-level task reasoning17. However, a fundamental limitation persists: without the direct sensation of local contacts—crucial information for both modelling and control—these systems fail to handle unexpected physical interactions5.

The solution may lie in understanding human hand control, which achieves remarkable precise control through a sophisticated tactile perception system. This biological system comprises two key elements: a dense array of tactile sensors embedded throughout the skin18,19,20 and specialized neural processing in the primary somatosensory cortex that rapidly interprets and integrates this massive sensory input20,21,22. This combination enables humans to instantly detect and respond to subtle contact changes during manipulation, a capability that current robotic systems have yet to replicate.

Drawing direct inspiration from this biological architecture, we present F-TAC Hand (Full-Hand Tactile-Embedded Biomimetic Hand), a system that bridges the sensory gap in robotic manipulation. The core innovation lies in its comprehensive tactile sensing capability, featuring high-resolution coverage (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of the hand surface. This is achieved through the effective integration of 17 vision-based tactile sensors in six optimized configurations, where sensor covers serve dual purposes as both sensing elements and structural components. The hand maintains full human-like dexterity, demonstrated by its high Kapandji score23 and ability to perform all 33 human grasp types24. Complementing this hardware, we developed a generative algorithm that produces human-like hand configurations, creating a rich knowledge base for object interaction. The integration enables closed-loop tactile-informed control that processes high-dimensional contact data for precise, adaptive manipulation.

To rigorously validate F-TAC Hand's capabilities, we focused on multi-object grasping—a task that epitomizes the challenges of dextrous manipulation5,25. While single-object manipulation has been successfully addressed by one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) parallel grippers26,27,28, simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects presents two distinct challenges: it requires both precise contact detection across the entire hand and strategic motion adjustments to prevent object collisions. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand directly addresses these challenges. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates significant performance improvements over non-tactile alternatives (P < 0.0001), particularly in scenarios involving real-world execution noise and dynamic object interactions.

Our work advances the field through two primary contributions: a practical demonstration that full-hand tactile sensing can be achieved without compromising hand motion capabilities, and comprehensive empirical validation of its benefits. By solving the technical challenges that previously restricted tactile sensing to simple grippers, this research enables unprecedented investigations into sophisticated tactile-embodied intelligence6. More broadly, our results provide concrete evidence for the critical role of rich sensory feedback in intelligent behaviour, suggesting promising directions for developing embodied AI systems beyond purely computational approaches29,30.

F-TAC Hand advances the state of dextrous robotic hands through its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities while maintaining a full range of motion. The hand achieves human-like tactile coverage, with sensing elements extending across 70% of the palmar surface at a density of 10,000 taxels (the pixels in camera CMOS) cm−2 (Fig. 1), notably surpassing current commercial solutions such as Shadow Hand, which provides only five-point feedback over less than 20% of its surface11 (comparison with other tactile arrays is available in Supplementary Section 1). This extensive coverage is achieved through an array of vision-based tactile sensors in multiple configurations (see exploded view in Extended Data Fig. 1a and physical dimensions in Supplementary Section 1), featuring specially designed covers that align with the hand's phalanges and palm to minimize mechanical redundancy while replicating the natural kinematic structure of the human hand (Fig. 2a). Each of the five fingers incorporates three DoFs, contributing to the hand's total 15-DoF configuration that enables human-like dexterity. A specialized electronic module enables large-scale sensor reading acquisition while minimizing space, weight and cabling requirements (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The hand's dimensions mirror those of an adult human hand, measuring 194 mm from wrist to middle fingertip (Fig. 2a), and its modular design architecture allows for easy adaptation to different physical dimensions while maintaining functionality.

F-TAC Hand is a dextrous robotic hand featuring a high-density tactile sensing array that matches human capabilities, as benchmarked against physiological data from ref. 19. Detailed illustrations of the sensor construction and assembly process are provided in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1. Similarly to its biological counterpart, it leverages sophisticated tactile feedback to accomplish complex manipulation tasks, such as precise in-hand object pose arrangement, enabling simultaneous and stable grasping of multiple items, a capability highlighted as challenging but crucial in ref. 5.

PP, proximal phalanx; MP, middle phalanx; DIP, distal interphalangeal; PIP, proximal interphalangeal; MCP, metacarpophalangeal.

Building upon its extensive tactile sensing coverage, F-TAC Hand also achieves comprehensive motion capabilities that match state-of-the-art dextrous hands9,10,11. The hand implements full mobility using just five slim cables (Extended Data Fig. 1c) with substantial payload capacity (Fig. 2b). Each cable controls the flexion and extension of a finger (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e), working in concert with stiffness-tuned springs at each joint (Fig. 2c) to replicate the coordinated yet semi-independent movements characteristic of human hands31 (Fig. 2d). An additional degree of actuation enables thumb opposition, expanding the hand's motion versatility (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Detailed fabrication procedures are provided in ‘Tactile sensor fabrication' and ‘F-TAC Hand fabrication' in Methods. The hand's dexterity is demonstrated through two evaluations: the Kapandji test23, completing all ten designated thumb-to-hand contact points shown in Fig. 2e, and the successful execution of all 33 human grasp types (Fig. 3).

Empowered by its smart design, the workspace of F-TAC Hand enables it to perform all 33 human grasping types, as documented in ref. 24.

The hand's tactile sensing system utilizes the photometric stereo principle32,33, converting light intensity variations into surface gradient information (Fig. 4a). Contact surface geometry is reconstructed through a two-stage process. First, an array of encoder–decoder neural networks (Fig. 4b) maps physics-based relationships between surface gradients and intensity variations for each sensor. Next, a Poisson solver generates high-fidelity surface geometries, visualized as normal maps (Fig. 4c). The detailed sensor characteristics are available in Supplementary Section 1.

a–d, Raw tactile sensor readings from the configuration shown in Fig. 1a (a) are processed by neural networks (b) to reconstruct contact site geometries (c), visualized as normal maps. The neural networks, trained on simulated data (d) generated by a physics-based image formation model, enable efficient and precise mapping of extensive raw data to geometric information at the contact interface. e,f, When grasping an object (e), F-TAC Hand captures detailed contact information through its advanced tactileer sensing capabilities (f). g, This rich tactile feedback enables F-TAC Hand to accurately perceive and interpret object characteristics, as demonstrated by its precise estimation of in-hand object poses.

The unprecedented scale of F-TAC Hand's tactile sensing system required development of efficient calibration solutions. We addressed this through a physics-based image formation model (detailed in Supplementary Sections 2 and 3) that generates synthetic readings of elastomer deformations during contacts (Fig. 4d). This approach enables efficient neural network training (Fig. 4b) and accurate sensor calibration.

The integration of fine-grained tactile sensing with robust motion capabilities enables F-TAC Hand to effectively grasp diverse objects, including challenging cases such as crystal balls (Fig. 4e), while simultaneously capturing detailed contact information (Fig. 4f). These sensory data enable accurate object pose estimation during manipulation (Fig. 4g). Additional demonstrations are provided in Supplementary Video.

Through this combination of dense tactile arrays and advanced motor capabilities, F-TAC Hand achieves unprecedented biomimetic fidelity, advancing both robotic manipulation capabilities and our understanding of human manual dexterity.

While F-TAC Hand's high articulation enables sophisticated manipulation, it presents unique challenges in grasp planning. The increased number of DoFs makes traditional mechanical equation-based methods computationally intractable34. Learning-based alternatives35, though avoiding complex analytical solutions, require extensive training data that are both costly to collect and potentially biased by human demonstration preferences—a particular challenge for highly articulated dextrous hands.

We model the robotic grasp generation of rigid objects as sampling hand poses from a Gibbs distribution conditioned on object geometry. Each grasp is associated with an energy value derived from force closure criteria, which evaluates how well the grasp can resist external forces. Lower energy values indicate better grasping capability; see ‘Probabilistic formulation for grasp generation' in Methods and Supplementary Section 4 for details. Due to the hand's high number of DoFs and the non-convex nature of the problem36, we sample grasps from random initializations and apply a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to reduce energy and escape local minima, converging to low-energy, high-quality grasps; see ‘Exploration algorithm for complex energy landscape' in Methods for details. We validated the approach using a diverse test set of 23 objects, including spheres, cylinders, cuboids and irregular shapes (Fig. 5a). By executing the algorithm from various initializations, F-TAC Hand's biomimetic kinematics (Extended Data Fig. 2) and varied object geometries result in diverse grasping poses (Supplementary Video).

a, A total of 23 objects, varying in dimensions and geometrical complexity, are chosen to assess the efficacy of the grasp generation method. b–d, The landscape of possible grasps is depicted as a disconnectivity graph, generated using the ADELM algorithm. e, For the pliers, the diversity in grasp strategies mirrors its common usage in daily human activities. f, This diversity in grasping strategies is maintained even when the object possesses complex geometric features. g, Comprehensive categorization of the generated grasps for all 23 objects, on the basis of human grasp types adopted from ref. 24. The results collectively cover all 19 common grasp types, implying the human-like diversity of the generated grasping strategies.

The resulting grasping poses are analysed through the Attraction–Diffusion Energy Landscape Mapping (ADELM) algorithm37 to visualize the complex energy landscape defined in equation (2), as shown in Fig. 5b–d. In this visualization, circles represent local minima (areas of low energy), where each local minimum contains at least one feasible grasp. The circle's size indicates how many similar grasps exist within that local minimum. The circles are colour-coded according to the majority grasp type on the basis of ref. 24: power, precision and intermediate. The vertical connecting bars between circles represent energy barriers between different local minima, where shorter bars indicate easier transitions between grasping poses, while longer bars signify transitions that are more difficult to achieve. Direct comparisons between generated grasps and human demonstrations (Fig. 5b–d) in the boxes below validate the human-like nature of our solutions. This approach maintains its effectiveness even for challenging cases such as pliers and adversarial objects38 (Fig. 5e,f), with comprehensive energy landscapes presented in Extended Data Fig. 3.

To quantitatively assess the human-like diversity of our approach, we analysed 1,800 generated grasps according to the taxonomy of ref. 24, categorizing them into 19 common grasp types (Supplementary Section 5). The resulting distribution (Fig. 5g) demonstrates comprehensive coverage across the human grasp repertoire, from frequent strategies such as power sphere and precision sphere to specialized configurations such as distal type and palmar grasps.

Further analysis using contact maps39 reveals natural clustering patterns that align with human grasp classifications. By applying dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis and visualization via t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (Extended Data Fig. 4), we observe distinct groupings of power and precision grasps, with intermediate grasps appropriately positioned near the boundary defined by a radial-basis-function-kernel support vector classifier. This distribution mirrors human grasp categorization patterns, where intermediate grasps share characteristics of both primary types (computational details in Supplementary Section 6).

The demonstrated ability to generate diverse, human-like hand configurations provides F-TAC Hand with both optimal and near-optimal control strategies. This algorithmic foundation, working in concert with the low-level controller, enables enhanced dexterity and adaptability in real-world manipulation scenarios.

The integration of advanced tactile sensing with diverse grasping strategies enables F-TAC Hand to implement a closed-loop sensory–motor feedback mechanism, allowing real-time adaptation to environmental changes. The implementation details are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 7 and described in ‘Context-sensitive motor controls' in Methods.

We demonstrate F-TAC Hand's capabilities through multi-object grasping5, a critical benchmark for hand dexterity that surpasses the limitations of 1-DoF parallel grippers. This challenging task demands precise contact detection and strategic adjustments to avoid collisions—capabilities that remain elusive for current AI systems5. While recent advances13,25 show promise, managing the stochastic nature of real-world objects, especially those with complex geometries, remains challenging. F-TAC Hand overcomes these limitations through precise contact-point identification (Fig. 6a).

a, F-TAC Hand's ability to grasp multiple objects simultaneously in a human-like manner. b, Despite execution noise, F-TAC Hand can optimize object transport through multi-object grasping. c, Real-world disturbances significantly increase second-grasp collision rates (inset: collision detection point in red), highlighting the necessity of tactile monitoring. d, Tactile-informed adaptation significantly improves second-grasp success rates. Plots c and d show 60 independent technical replicates (blue dots), each representing a unique object combination tested across 10 trials. Box plots show 25th–75th percentiles (box), median (centre line) and minimum/maximum values (whiskers). Shaded areas (orange in c, green in d) show kernel-density estimations of data distribution. The identical P values (2.1 × 10−17) displayed in the two panels derive from one-sided paired t-tests (t(59) = 11.8) comparing perfect versus real-world execution (c) and with versus without tactile-informed adaptation (d). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

To evaluate real-world performance, we mounted F-TAC Hand on a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm for multi-object transport tasks (Fig. 6b). The goal is to grasp as many objects as possible in one go to maximize transportation efficiency. While optimal strategies exist under ideal conditions (red route in Fig. 6b), real-world variables—such as imperfect robot positioning and object perception—require adaptive motor control. The other coloured routes in Fig. 6b illustrate actual scenarios where F-TAC Hand encountered wrong object positions but leveraged its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities (Fig. 4g) to assess situations and dynamically switch to alternative strategies that accommodate available space, even if theoretically suboptimal. Additional demonstrations of adaptive behaviours, including responses to finger impairments and ball size adaptation, are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Video.

We quantified the impact of tactile sensing through extensive experiments involving 60 object combinations across 600 real-world trials. Initial grasps were programmed from a disembodied AI perspective, using theoretically optimal strategies without considering environmental dynamics. Each combination underwent ten real-world trials, with tactile feedback assessing in-hand object positions and potential collision risks. Collision detection involves two steps: using tactile information to estimate the grasped object's pose as shown in Fig. 4g, and then checking whether the union of the grasped object geometry and the next target object geometry is null. The observed collision rate in real-world execution (M = 0.465, s.d. = 0.306) differed significantly from theoretical predictions (M = 0.000, s.d. = 0.000), highlighting the substantial gap between simulation and reality, t(59) = 11.8, P = 2.1 × 10−17 (Fig. 6c).

F-TAC Hand's adaptive capabilities become particularly evident when comparing tactile-informed versus non-tactile-informed control. Upon detecting collision risks, the system rapidly (~100 ms) switches to alternative strategies that might be suboptimal in theory but practical in reality. In scenarios with potential collisions, the non-tactile-informed approach inevitably fails, while the tactile-informed approach maintains productivity through adaptive replanning. The tactile-informed approach achieved perfect adaptation (M = 1.000, s.d. = 0.000) compared with significantly lower success rates without tactile feedback (M = 0.535, s.d. = 0.306), t(59) = 11.8, P = 2.1 × 10−17 (Fig. 6d). Notably, in collision-free scenarios, the two approaches demonstrate comparable execution times, with tactile-informed collision checking adding only ~1 s of processing time, indicating that tactile sensing provides critical robustness with minimal computational overhead during normal operations. The detailed method and the logic chain are available in ‘Context-sensitive motor controls' in Methods.

F-TAC Hand represents a substantial advance in robotic sensory–motor integration, achieving unprecedented integration of comprehensive tactile sensing with human-like dexterity. Its high-density tactile coverage (70% of palmar surface, 10,000 taxels cm−2) substantially exceeds current robotic hand capabilities. This exceptional sensing is achieved through the effective integration of vision-based tactile sensors, physics-based calibration methods and specialized electronics—all while maintaining full motion capabilities.

Recent advances in tactile sensing33,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 have primarily focused on parallel grippers. While these sensor-equipped grippers demonstrate enhanced capabilities in specific tasks—such as cable following26, surface following27 and articulated object manipulation28—their low-DoF mechanical structure fundamentally limits their dexterity for complex manipulation.

In contrast, F-TAC Hand's integration of comprehensive tactile feedback with high articulation enables more sophisticated manipulation, as demonstrated by its successful multi-object grasping under uncertain conditions. The closed-loop sensory–motor feedback enables context-sensitive adaptations, significantly improving performance in dynamic real-world scenarios. This combination of sensing and adaptability is essential for practical robotics applications requiring safe and efficient environmental interaction.

The design philosophy behind F-TAC Hand emphasizes replicability, aiming to catalyse broader research in tactile-enabled manipulation. Its achievement of human-like capabilities opens possibilities in prosthetics, teleoperation, collaborative robotics and human–robot interaction. The hardware's compact, modular architecture facilitates efficient data acquisition and calibration while being adaptable to various robotic platforms. The training-free stochastic optimization approach for grasp generation remains platform independent, enabling rapid deployment across different hand designs (Extended Data Fig. 6). While our current implementation assumes known object geometry, this was a deliberate scope decision to focus on tactile-informed adaptive control rather than geometry reconstruction. Pre-grasping geometry acquisition could be readily integrated using existing vision techniques49,50, and real-time reconstruction during manipulation represents a promising direction for future work. This combination of diverse grasping capabilities and environmental adaptability makes F-TAC Hand particularly suited for complex manipulation tasks.

Beyond technical achievements, our results suggest that practical AI requires tight integration between sensory processing and strategic adaptation. The demonstrated importance of comprehensive tactile feedback in achieving human-like dexterity aligns with cognitive and neuroscientific perspectives that emphasize the essential role of physical interaction in intelligence51,52,53,54.

The tactile sensor design for F-TAC Hand's distal phalanx (Extended Data Fig. 1a) addresses key challenges in miniaturization and integration. A custom camera module using a single flexible flat cable for both power and data transmission resolves traditional cabling constraints. The sensor housing's U-shaped clevis and tang structure enables the interconnection necessary for anthropomorphic articulation.

Contact detection relies on analysing elastomer surface deformation through reflected light intensity. To achieve uniform illumination in the confined phalanx space, we developed a specialized Lambertian membrane. This membrane combines an air-brushed spherical aluminium film (mill-resistant matte oil with 1-μm spherical aluminium powder) with a clear silicone base (Smooth-On Solaris parts A&B, 1:1 ratio). The illumination system comprises surface-mounted Lumileds LUXEON 2835 Color Line light-emitting diodes (red, green, blue and white) arranged around an acrylic support, enhanced by light-diffuser films. An OV2640 image sensor with a 160° wide-angle lens provides colour-compatible imaging, while 7-mm × 7-mm × 4-mm heat sinks ensure thermal stability.

The complete sensing system architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1b) integrates these components with a custom control module. The module interfaces with cameras through digital video ports, maintaining 240-px × 240-px image buffers. Spatial resolution of 0.1 mm per pixel is achieved, verified through known-object calibration. An expanded Serial Peripheral Interface bus coordinates sequential camera captures, with USB connectivity for PC data transmission and U2D2 protocol for servo control.

The tactile components are integrated into anatomically scaled phalanx covers matching adult hand dimensions. This modular, single-cable design overcomes traditional challenges in implementing high-resolution, extensive tactile sensing in robotic hands.

F-TAC Hand's structure (Extended Data Fig. 1c) integrates 17 compact vision-based sensors in six configurations to achieve human-hand proportions. The four fingers—index, middle, ring and little—share a common architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1d) with three serial revolute joints: metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal, each offering 0–90° range. These joints utilize aluminium shafts supported by deep-groove ball bearings, with screw-bushing fixation and torsion springs maintaining a 0° rest position.

The thumb design (Extended Data Fig. 1e) features an additional carpometacarpal joint DoF, enabling 90° motion range with a 45° offset from its proximal interphalangeal joint axis. The two-part palm base facilitates assembly and houses compact tactile sensors, with the upper region incorporating dual cameras in a single sensor for enhanced perception (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

Finger actuation employs a cable-driven mechanism, with a single cable routed along both sides of each finger's phalanxes, converging at the palm base. Torsion springs facilitate a return to rest position upon cable relaxation. Each finger is powered by a DYNAMIXEL XC330X-T288-T servo motor. For experimental validation, F-TAC Hand mounts onto a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator.

The generation of grasp configurations for multifingered robotic hands presents notable challenges, particularly when maximizing dextrous capabilities. Instead of relying on data-driven approaches that demand extensive annotated datasets, we formulate grasp generation as a Gibbs distribution sampling problem:

where H = (T, q) represents the hand's pose and joint configurations, O denotes the target object, E(H, O) defines the grasping energy function and Z is the intractable normalizing constant. The hand's surface geometry S(H) is computed through forward kinematics.

This energy function combines two weighted components—grasp quality energy Egrasp and physical plausibility energy Ephy:

To assess the quality of the grasp, we use force closure criteria to define Egrasp(H, O):

where x = {xi} represents frictional contact points on S(H), and FC(x, O) assesses force closure formation on the object.

Ephy enforces physical constraints by penalizing hand–object penetration and joint limit violations:

where \({d}_{O}^{{\rm{SDF}}}(v)\) defines the signed distance function from point v to object O, and \([{q}_{j}^{\min },{q}_{j}^{\max }]\) specifies joint limits for each of the J joints.

This probabilistic formulation enables scalable generation of diverse, effective grasp configurations.

The nonlinearity of hand kinematics and contact-point selection creates a complex energy landscape for E, making naive gradient-based sampling prone to suboptimal local minima. We address this through a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm that alternates between contact-point sampling and gradient-based pose optimization.

The algorithm initializes with random hand pose H and contact points x ⊂ S(H). Through L iterations, it updates H and x to maximize P(H, O). Each iteration stochastically chooses between updating the hand pose via Langevin dynamics or replacing a contact point with a uniform sample from the hand surface. Updates undergo Metropolis–Hastings acceptance criteria, favouring lower-energy configurations.

This combination of stochastic updates enables escape from local minima, while Metropolis acceptance guides sampling toward low-energy configurations. An algorithm efficiency analysis is detailed in Supplementary Section 7.

Extended Data Fig. 7 demonstrates adaptive control in a four-ball transport scenario, where ball repositories are weighted and combined by volume. Initially, at t1, F-TAC Hand plans to grasp a golf ball and softball using its little finger and remaining digits. To illustrate the control mechanism, we introduce a manual perturbation during golf-ball acquisition, causing F-TAC Hand to secure the golf ball with its index finger at t2. The occupation of the index finger invalidates the planned softball grasp (light grey in Extended Data Fig. 7), necessitating a strategy revision. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand detects the situation and adapts by executing an alternative approach—grasping a yoga ball using its thumb, index and middle fingers. While this solution was initially considered suboptimal, it demonstrates the system's capacity for real-time adaptation to unexpected conditions.

We adopt the modified Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) norm to establish the coordinates for the palm base and finger phalanxes. The transformations between these coordinates are represented in DH tables. In these tables, ai−1 is the distance along Xi−1 between Zi−1 and Zi, αi−1 is the angle about Xi−1 between Zi−1 and Zi, di is the distance along Zi between Xi−1 and Xi, and θi is the angle about Xi between Xi−1 and Xi.

We examine the grasp relationships among six example objects (pawn, vase, multimeter, board eraser, coffee bottle, and Coke can) using a large disconnectivity graph. This landscape comprises 79 basins, each categorized into one of three grasp types (Power, Intermediate, Precision) based on the majority of grasps it contains. Within each basin, similar grasp strategies are observed across different objects, as illustrated in (a)-(f).

Visualization of grasp samples with t-SNE reveals that most Power grasps and Precision grasps are clustered separately, with Intermediate grasps lying in between. This map indicates a strong alignment between the generated results and human definitions of grasp types.

F-TAC Hand's stable grasping with some fingers disabled (shown in light gray), mirroring human compensation for finger injuries.

F-TAC Hand employs a two-stage strategy for multi-object transportation. It adjusts for in-hand position variations due to perturbations, dynamically adapting its second-stage strategy to prevent collisions and maximize efficiency (Light gray in the grasping repository indicates that grasping strategies are rendered infeasible at the current time).

Werner syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging. From their twenties, patients develop gray hair, hair loss, cataracts, diabetes, and other age-related conditions normally seen in the elderly. Additionally, patients develop severe and untreatable skin ulcers, often requiring limb amputation, and face early death from cardiovascular diseases or cancer. This debilitating condition, which affects approximately nine per million people in Japan, lacks effective treatment options.

Interestingly, a recent study from the Bohr lab (Nat Commun, 2019 Nov 21;10(1):5284) showed that patients with WS model systems and patients had decreased levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a biomolecule crucial for cellular energy production, DNA repair, and various metabolic processes. This finding suggested that NAD+ depletion may contribute to the progression of the disease. While direct NAD+ supplementation isn't feasible in mammals, using its precursor -- nicotinamide riboside (NR) from Niagen Bioscience -- has shown promising results in animal studies, extending lifespan and protecting against age-related decline. In human clinical trials, NR has also demonstrated benefits against chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and muscle weakness across various populations. However, the effects of NR in WS remained largely unexplored -- until now.

In a recent study, a research team led by Associate Professor Masaya Koshizaka from the Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University/Department of Diabetes, Metabolism and Endocrinology, Chiba University Hospital, Japan, conducted the world's first rigorous clinical trial of NR in patients with WS. Their paper, published in Aging Cell on June 03, 2025, was co-authored by University President Koutaro Yokote, Assistant Professor Hisaya Kato, Associate Professor Yoshiro Maezawa, and Assistant Professor Mayumi Shoji, all from Chiba University, along with Affiliate Professor Vilhelm Bohr from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

This groundbreaking work involved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NR supplementation. The research team enrolled patients with WS in a crossover design, where participants received either a daily dose of NR or a placebo for 26 weeks, switched treatments for another 26 weeks. Researchers tracked NAD+ blood levels, skin ulcer size, arterial stiffness, and kidney function.

NR supplementation significantly increased NAD+ levels in patient blood compared to placebo. Importantly, NR improved arterial stiffness (a marker of cardiovascular disease risk), reduced the skin ulcer area, and appeared to slow the progression of kidney dysfunction -- all without any serious side effects. Moreover, a comprehensive examination of metabolites in blood revealed that NR treatment reduced levels of creatinine and other compounds associated with kidney dysfunction. This suggests that NR may help protect kidney function, addressing another serious complication of WS.

Dr. Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, Global Director of Niagen Bioscience's External Research Program called CERP, commented, "this study represents a significant step forward in understanding how NAD+ restoration with NR may help address the underlying biology of WS. By supporting cardiovascular, skin, and kidney health, NR shows potential to improve the quality of life for patients with this devastating condition. We are proud to support Chiba University's groundbreaking research as part of our ongoing commitment to advancing NAD+ science for rare and underserved diseases."

The treatment's multiple benefits across many different organ systems indicate that NAD+ depletion may be a fundamental mechanism in WS that can be targeted therapeutically. "Our findings suggest NR could serve as a valuable treatment option for two major symptoms, arteriosclerosis and skin ulcers, as well as for preventing kidney function decline," explains Dr. Koshizaka. The results are particularly significant given that untreatable skin ulcers affect well over 70% of patients with WS, often leading to amputation, while cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of early mortality in this population.

Though larger studies are needed to extend these findings, this pioneering research offers new hope for patients with WS who have long lacked effective treatment options. Beyond its immediate implications for this rare condition, the study also provides valuable insights into the biology of aging and potential interventions to address age-related decline more broadly.

"We hope our work will accelerate studies on not only WS but also other premature aging disorders and common age-related diseases -- ultimately helping to extend health span and improve quality of life in both patients and the broader population," concludes Dr. Koshizaka.

The discovery was only possible because of the damage caused by an earthquake.

Here's what you'll learn when read this story:

A damaging earthquake in Croatia had an unexpected bright side—revealing hidden Roman-era secrets. Crews working in the basement to restore the city hall of Sisak, Croatia, after a 2020 earthquake discovered a small Roman theater, complete with stone rows and the theater's stage. 

The find, as announced by Croatia's Ministry of Culture and Media, shows how Sisak grew from a Roman military outpost into a full-fledged city sometime during the third century A.D., with the small theater, known as an odeon, a sign of the prominence. 

According to Brittanica, an odeum is a small concert hall, typically constructed as a theater for both musicians and orators to perform. They were not as grand as amphitheaters, but were similarly designed so that all instruments—or voices—could be easily heard.

Archaeologists called in to investigate the discovery uncovered three parallel semi-circular rows of stone blocks to hold an audience (all roughly 65 feet across), space for an orchestra, and the theater's podium (stage). 

“This extremely valuable find, which provides new insight into the size of the ancient city and further completes the interpretation of the urbanism of ancient Sisak,” the ministry wrote in a translated statement.

At some point, a “monumental building with buttresses” was built over the theater, although archaeologists said more research is needed to understand what that building was designed for. The city hall structure was constructed in 1914 over the older buildings already on site. 

Croatian officials didn't know the odeum existed under the city's main government building until the 2020 earthquake, which caused structural damage to the site that required extensive underground work. Structural reinforcement needs sent crews digging below the existing structure, and that effort revealed the history of the site. 

To avoid again burying the odeum, the city has preserved the ruins at the current location and created a window into the past with glass flooring. 

While the northern Croatia city is now known as Sisak, it was once Roman Siscia, and was most prominent in the late third century, according to Atlas Obscura. It was even named a capital city in 295 A.D., and was known for minting bronze coins for Rome.

The restoration of Sisak's city hall has revitalized its original color, the original design of the main entrance (created by Dionis Sunko in 1914), the original main gable, and the original tiling of the building. 

Not much of the original Siscia still remains, save for a piece of a defensive wall outside the Sisak Cathedral. This newly-discovered Roman odeum has now become a prominent piece of the city's history, and will be a part of its future for many years to come.

Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, shifting tectonic plates -- these are all signs that our planet is alive. But what is revealed deep inside the Earth surprises laymen and scientists alike: Almost 3000 kilometers below the Earth's surface, solid rock is flowing that is neither liquid, like lava, nor brittle like solid rock. This is shown by a new study by geoscientists led by Motohiko Murakami, Professor of Experimental Mineral Physics at ETH Zurich. The study has just been published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Half a century of guesswork

For over 50 years, researchers have been puzzling over a strange zone deep inside the Earth -- the so-called D" layer, around 2700 kilometers beneath our feet. Earthquake waves suddenly behave differently there: their speed jumps as if they were traveling through a different material. What exactly happens at that layer of the mantle has been unclear for a long time, until now.

In 2004, Murakami, who has been a professor at ETH Zurich since 2017, discovered that perovskite, the main mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, transforms into a new mineral near the D" layer under extreme pressure and very high temperatures -- so-called "post-perovskite."

The researchers assumed that this change explained the strange acceleration of the seismic waves. But that was not the full story. In 2007, Murakami and colleagues found new evidence that the phase change of perovskite alone is not enough to accelerate earthquake waves.

Using a sophisticated computer model, they finally discovered something important: depending on the direction in which the post-perovskite crystals point, the hardness of the mineral changes. Only when all the crystals of the mineral point in the same direction in the model are the seismic waves accelerated -- as can be observed in the D" layer at a depth of 2700 kilometers.

In an unusual laboratory experiment at ETH Zurich, Murakami has now proven that post-perovskite crystals align themselves in the identical direction under enormous pressure and extreme temperatures. To do this, the researchers measured the speed of seismic waves in their experiment and were also able to reproduce the jump that occurs at the D" layer in the laboratory. "We have finally found the last piece of the puzzle," says Murakami.

Mantle flow aligns crystals

The big question is: what makes these crystals line up? The answer is that solid mantle rock that flows horizontally along the lower edge of the Earth's mantle. Researchers have long suspected that this movement -- a kind of convection like boiling water -- must exist but have never been able to prove it directly.

A new chapter in Earth research begins

Murakami and his colleagues have now also demonstrated experimentally that mantle convection of solid rock is present at the boundary between the core and the Earth's mantle, i.e. that solid -- not liquid -- rock flows slowly but steadily at this depth. "This discovery not only solves the mystery of the D" layer but also opens a window into the dynamics in the depths of the Earth," Murakami explains.

It is not only a milestone, but also a turning point. The assumption that solid rock flows has been transformed from a theory into a certainty. "Our discovery shows that the Earth is not only active on the surface, but is also in motion deep inside," says the ETH professor.

With this knowledge, researchers can now begin to map the currents in the Earth's deepest interior and thus visualize the invisible motor that drives volcanoes, tectonic plates, and perhaps even the Earth's magnetic field.

Apple's bulky, powerful, occasionally beautiful, and way-too-expensive XR headset, the Vision Pro, is coming into the fold of Apple's software ecosystem as well as the wider VR market. At WWDC25, Apple shared more info about this first step to a more mature “spatial” ecosystem with visionOS 26. The update should allow for easier controls with your eyes and—for the first time—actual controllers you can port from other headsets, like Sony's PlayStation VR2.

While the rest of the Apple ecosystem is changing its look to match what was already on the Vision Pro, the look inside Apple's headset isn't changing much, despite the growth spurt from visionOS 2 to visionOS 26. The first big improvement is the introduction of eye-scrolling. It means users no longer have to pinch and drag to look through a web page or PDF. Apple's “spatial computer” should instead use the headset's eye-tracking to help you jump to where you want to be on the page. There are additional all-new widgets designed specifically for the Vision Pro. These are designed to be placed against a wall within AR space. They include a subtle 3D effect to make each widget appear like it was set into a wall. Another widget can act like a fake window to look out at a panorama photo you've taken with a phone. Apple is opening up its OS to support more 180- and 360-degree footage from companies like Insta360 and GoPro, which means you may have more access to 3D content than what Apple's willing to share with users.

One of the headlining features for the Apple Vision Pro was “Personas,” which were supposed to act as lip-synced 3D avatars for users talking over FaceTime or other supported apps. At launch, these had a waxy, dead-eyed appearance that was equal parts intriguing and off-putting. The new update could finally offer a more lifelike appearance, with more texture on users' hair and eyes.

Currently, the Apple Vision Pro hand-tracking recognizes several gestures for navigating through apps. Most important to daily use has been the pinch, though a bare few apps could also recognize the orientation of your fists as if you were holding onto an invisible steering wheel. This isn't anywhere close to enough for most VR games. Finally, the AVP will accept third-party controllers. First on the list are the Logitech pen for mixed reality art apps and the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. This should make it easier to use when you need pinpoint controls, like in drawing apps.

Apple suggested this “new class of games” available to AVP will include such heavy hitters as the pickleball simulator Pickle Pro. The introduction of third-party peripheral support could be a big deal—the headset tracks six degrees of freedom (DoF), and with vibration support, it could offer one of the more immersive VR experiences available. It also means we may finally get to experience more ports of other VR games. We can already imagine how nice it would be to get Steam Link working on a Vision Pro to play Half Life: Alyx on the relatively wide field of view with the twin 4K micro-OLED displays.

We shouldn't feel too disappointed Apple didn't craft its own first-party controllers; PlayStation's VR2 Sense controllers are a solid option. The Apple Vision Pro sometimes feels like the red-headed stepchild of the Cupertino tech giant's larger brand. It's been around for more than a year, and it has improved significantly in the intervening months with every new update for visionOS 2 and onward. The latest updates to guest accounts made it a better device to share with people nearby. Plus, turning your Mac screen into an ultrawide monitor in AR space is both cool and surprisingly useful. What's missing is pure content. Apple has produced numerous short- and long-form content viewable exclusively on the AVP, including a full-length biopic about Bono and small movies like Submerged. But for every bit of passive content that arrives on the platform, there has been a dearth of active content we mostly associate with VR and AR—especially gaming.

In 1966, archaeologists in France uncovered an ancient 7,535-square-foot building near the town of Auxerre. Remains of furniture in the edifice's ten rooms led archaeologists to estimate that it was inhabited from the first to the fourth century CE, and evidence of mosaics and floor heating indicated that the inhabitants were members of a wealthy social class. But it turns out that these spaces were a small part of an even grander dwelling.

Archaeologists have revealed that the building excavated almost six decades ago is just a secondary wing of a luxurious 43,056-square-foot villa—one of the largest known Roman villas in modern-day France.

According to an agricultural treatise by the ancient Roman writer Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella called De Re Rvstica, Roman villas were divided into three main sections: the pars urbana, where the landowner and his family lived; the pars rustica, which housed the workers, animals, and farming tools; and the pars fructuaria for the harvest tools. The excavation near Auxerre has thus far revealed the complex's residential pars urbana, along with some features that may have belonged to the pars rustica.

The building wrapped around a square garden, with a basin at one end and a fountain at the other. The chambers surrounding the garden included spaces to receive guests, technical rooms, and possible a kitchen, and the eastern wing of the building showcased thermal baths. The space that may have belonged to the pars rustica section of the complex consists of a rectangular space near a boundary wall that encircles part of the villa.

In a statement by France's National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (Inrap), archaeologists suggest the villa was built in two or three stages. Further research will be necessary to determine the building's potential association with ancient Auxerre, known as Autessiodurum, which became a prominent city in the fourth century.

By the mid first century BCE, future Roman dictator-for-life Julius Caesar had conquered all of Gaul, a region including most of modern day France and Belgium. Large Roman Gallic villas traditionally had richly developed pars urbana and almost always included private thermal baths. They also usually incorporated fountains, gardens, private sanctuaries, and elaborate interiors featuring marble, frescoes, and mosaics for the enjoyment of their wealthy landowners, who made up the region's political elite.

The recently uncovered estate represents one of the largest Roman villas in Gaul, according to The History Blog. It remains to be seen what further insight the magnificent remains will provide into the lives of Gaul's wealthiest ancient residents. In the meantime, visitors will have the rare opportunity to tour the site on June 15 in honor of European Archaeology Days.

In the months since US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. mentioned chlorine dioxide during his Senate confirmation hearing, the online community advocating for the use of the toxic bleach solution as a cure for everything from malaria to autism has become emboldened. Activity on bleach-supporting social media groups is exploding, and influencers are reemerging in an effort to push President Donald Trump's administration to approve bleach as a mainstream treatment.

“We are thrilled that RFK Jr. is in charge,” Michelle Herman, who sells a nasal spray containing chlorine dioxide and says she's discussed the topic with Kennedy, tells WIRED. She was pictured, along with other bleach enthusiasts and activists, at the recent Truth Seekers conference held at Trump's Doral resort in Florida.

Chlorine dioxide is sold under a variety of names, including Miracle Mineral Solution, Chlorine Dioxide Solution, Water Purification Solution, and God's Detox. Whatever name it goes by, it has been promoted as a cure for a wide array of ailments since the mid-1990s, and despite prosecutions and warnings from authorities it continues to be popular in many parts of the world. It has been peddled as a “cure” for everything from malaria to cancer, from HIV to autism to Covid-19. (There is no credible evidence to back up any of the claims that chlorine dioxide can cure any of these ailments.)

While Kennedy has a long history of promoting anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, he has not explicitly promoted chlorine dioxide as a treatment. However, in January, during his Senate confirmation hearing, he referenced chlorine dioxide while praising Trump for “looking at all of the different remedies” for Covid, using it as an example of the open-mindedness that Kennedy characterized as a “demonstration of leadership.”

Since Kennedy mentioned chlorine dioxide, groups dedicated to chlorine dioxide use on platforms like Telegram and Facebook are filled with new members and increased activity. (Telegram did not respond to a request for comment; Meta said it was reviewing the groups WIRED flagged and would remove any it determines violate the company's policies.) Activists who have spent years fighting to highlight the dangers of chlorine dioxide are now deeply concerned that the Trump administration could seek to approve its use as a cure for a wide variety of ills.

“The bleachers are back, making connections with powerful people, reaching RFK and Trump,” says Fiona O'Leary, an Ireland-based activist who has autistic children and has spent years trying to highlight the dangers of toxic bleach solutions being sold as an autism cure. “Bleachers want RFK to approve chlorine dioxide as a treatment for autism, cancer, and other conditions. It is like watching a horror show.”

Kennedy, according to chlorine dioxide advocates, has been interested in their cause dating back to at least 2023.

Days after the confirmation hearing, Pierre Kory—a physician and one of the main promoters of ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19, despite there being no credible evidence to back up the claim—claimed on a podcast that Kennedy had called him to discuss the use of bleach ahead of the hearing.

“Bobby thought they were going to come after him on that,” Kory told the Royce White: Call Me Crazy podcast. “So I basically told Bobby what the real story was on it.” Kory, who has appeared alongside Kennedy multiple times, including at a “Defeat the Mandates” protest in 2022, added that the health secretary “called me his hero; he's my hero.”

Kory, who has written about chlorine dioxide repeatedly on his Substack in recent months and is allegedly writing a book entitled War on Chlorine Dioxide, did not respond to a request for comment. Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment about his links to Kory, but the health secretary has praised the doctor on social media, calling him a “brave dissident doctor” and “honest, brave, and sincere.”

Kennedy's interest, though, appears to stretch back further. Herman says that she met Kennedy in October 2023. “I was honored to meet him in late 2023 and was able to talk with him for about 30 minutes,” Herman tells WIRED. “I shared that, very similar to the war on ivermectin, the war on chlorine dioxide was the same story … He listened intently, indicated he was not familiar with it, but was nonetheless very intrigued and asked for more information.”

Herman claimed while speaking on a livestream organized by David Oates, the administrator of the popular Chorine Dioxide Testimonies channel on Telegram, that she wrote an email to Kennedy after his confirmation telling him that “chlorine dioxide must be included in the national conversation about health care.” In the channel, users share details of the concerning side effects they experience after taking the solution. (“Urgent! By mistake I took 30 drops of sodium chlorite in a cup of water” one member wrote last month, referencing one of the active ingredients in chlorine dioxide solution. “I am feeling nausea and vomiting-like feeling. I have taken a glass of milk and a couple of glasses of water. Also I have called [an] ambulance. Could anyone advise on what to do?”)

Oates is one of the influencers who appeared at the Doral event. His Telegram channel is a platform to sell his own chlorine dioxide solution, which he brands as God's Detox, and to promote his one-on-one private phone consultation service, for which he charges $100 an hour. “I can provide you protocols to detox the body based on the named disease,” Oates says on the website where he advertises the service. He did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Meanwhile, one of the most notorious figures within the bleaching community has reemerged. Mark Grenon was sentenced to a stint in federal prison in 2023 alongside three of his sons for selling bleach as a cure for Covid. A self-styled archbishop of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, Grenon was released from prison in September 2024, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website.

While Grenon initially told a supporter on Facebook that he was “not allowed” to become part of groups promoting chlorine dioxide, he has appeared on numerous podcasts and livestreams in recent months to promote the use of bleach. An individual with the username Mark_Grenon is also now listed as an administrator of Oates' Chlorine Dioxide Testimonies Telegram group, which has more than 30,000 members.

In one question-and-answer session hosted on Zoom related to “curing” cancer with chlorine dioxide last week, which was reviewed by WIRED, Grenon told those listening that chlorine dioxide is “growing worldwide.”

In another recent online interview, Grenon claimed a member of his church treated a 4-month-old baby with liver cancer by soaking them in a bath of water topped up with 100 drops of chlorine dioxide.

Grenon hung up on WIRED when contacted last week, saying he doesn't trust any reporters. In a follow-up text message, when asked if he was breaching the conditions of his supervised release, Grenon said his probation officer knew what he was doing, adding, “President Trump has made it very clear that no law enforcement agency can restrict freedom of speech. Look up his executive orders. In the US we are guaranteed that.” (His probation officer did not respond to requests for comment.)

Last month, Grenon attended the Truth Seekers conference at Trump's resort, which was filled with bleach enthusiasts and antisemitic conspiracy theorists. Grenon was pictured at the event alongside Herman and Oates as well as Kerri Rivera, who has long promoted chlorine dioxide as a treatment for autism. Rivera has been living in Mexico in recent years; previously, German authorities investigated accusations that she had caused bodily harm to a child, though no charges were ultimately filed. Riviera did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Andreas Kalcker, another bleach activist, was also at the conference. Kalcker was charged by authorities in Argentina in 2021 following the death of a 5-year-old boy whose parents gave him Kalcker's chlorine dioxide solution with the belief that it would ward off Covid.

In an interview published recently on Rumble, Kalcker said he once met Kennedy at the AutismOne conference in Chicago in 2013 where they were both speakers. “While we were both speakers at the same conference in Chicago over a decade ago, I have had no direct relationship or contact with Mr. Kennedy,” Kalcker tells WIRED.

For years, a central aim of some chlorine dioxide advocates has been to remove a key warning about chlorine dioxide issued by the US Food and Drug Administration in August 2019, during Trump's first term in office. It was viewed as a significant block to more widespread adoption of the treatment by doctors.

“The solution,” the news release read, “when mixed, develops into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.”

“RFK has to rescind that FDA warning against chlorine dioxide,” said Herman during a March livestream on Rumble, an alternative video sharing platform. “That's what stops everybody in their tracks. Every doctor, no matter how much guts they have, they see that warning and they get nervous, they get scared … that's got to be rescinded.”

Over the weekend, Kalcker posted on Facebook, asking Kennedy to revise the government's warning about chlorine dioxide. It was, though, already gone: The FDA warning was last live on the agency's site on May 15, according to an archived version of the site available on the Internet Archive. “News releases on FDA.gov are archived via content lifecycle standards,” Andrew Nixon, director of communications at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), tells WIRED. “Two years of content are kept on the active site, which is why that is now archived.”

Many other FDA releases from around the same time were indeed also archived over the course of the past month. Other pages that are similarly old have not been archived, and there are still several posts on the FDA site which warn against chlorine dioxide—including one outlining the prosecution of members of the Grenon family for selling the bleach solution as a Covid cure.

Nixon tells WIRED that “there is not any new FDA action and the general public health position on [chlorine dioxide] being dangerous has not changed.”

Herman did not say whether Kennedy or anyone at HHS had responded to her March email calling for the warning to be removed, and Kennedy did not respond to a WIRED request for comment about the email.

“I don't know if it is a website error or if it was purposely removed,” she says of the warning, “but I'll hope for the latter.”

Other proponents of the toxic solution clearly view the removal of the warning as a victory.

“I was genuinely surprised, and as someone from China, I couldn't imagine our own government quietly removing a public warning without any announcement,” Xuewu Liu, who promotes the treatment of cancerous tumors by directly injecting them with chlorine dioxide, tells WIRED. “This quiet removal won't immediately change everything, but it opens a door.”

Liu, who has been promoted by Kory in the past, wrote about the removal on Substack on Saturday; within hours, Kalcker, Herman, and Oates were all sharing the news on their social channels.

While the removal of the warning is a huge boon for those promoting the toxic bleach solution, it is just the first step in a push to make chlorine dioxide a mainstream treatment. In her livestream interview in March, Herman said she suggested that someone hold a “Make America Healthy Again roundtable” to discuss chlorine dioxide, while getting the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research into chlorine dioxide and setting standards for the toxic solution.

“We know that there is awareness and support for repurposed drugs and what are termed ‘alternative' therapies, and we hope that the restraints and prosecutions will cease,” Herman tells WIRED of her hopes for the Trump administration. “Will they outright approve these therapies? We just don't know. More realistically, they will hopefully encourage further evaluations towards such approvals.”

“I and other activists, scientists, have been speaking out against this lethal bleach product for more than a decade now,” says O'Leary, the Ireland-based activist. “When chlorine dioxide is ingested, it causes serious, life-threatening illness.”

A healthy chunk of corporate America has eagerly embraced AI, betting the tech will bring unrealizable productivity gains. But adoption may be leveling off, according to transaction data from fintech company Ramp.

Ramp's AI Index, which estimates the U.S. business adoption rate of AI products by drawing on Ramp's card and bill pay data, leveled off at 41% in May after close to 10 straight months of growth. As of May, 49% of large businesses had deployed AI in some form compared to 44% of medium-sized firms, and 37% of small companies, according to Ramp.

Ramp's AI Index isn't a perfect measure. It only looks at a sample of corporate spend data from around 30,000 companies. Moreover, because the index identifies AI products and services using merchant name and line-item details, it likely misses spend lumped into other cost centers.

But it's certainly true that businesses are beginning to realize that there's a limit to what today's AI can do. 

Last month, Klarna, which said it would work to replace hundreds of support agents with AI, was forced to hire some workers back after the company's cuts led to “lower quality” customer service. According to S&P Global, the share of companies abandoning most of their generative AI pilot projects has risen to 42%, up from 17% last year.

Nvidia will utilize different GDDR memory versions on its RTX 50 series graphics cards, just like the Turing generation.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Rumors have made it clear that the RTX 5050 might use older GDDR6 memory rather than speedier GDDR7 (or even GDDR6X for that matter). Benchlife.info reports that Nvidia add-in board partners have confirmed the RTX 5050 will use GDDR6 memory from two suppliers, Samsung and SK hynix.

The news puts to rest any inkling that the RTX 5050 might use GDDR7, at least for the launch version (assuming there will be multiple variants in the future). Moving to GDDR6 will inevitably improve production costs for the RTX 5050 and improve any potential supply chain issues that might impact GPU production (on the memory side). GDDR6 is a very mature and popular memory type at this point in time, and is being produced by a variety of manufacturers (not just SK hynix and Samsung).

Having two suppliers (for the RTX 5050) not only boosts the overall number of GDDR6 chips Nvidia can purchase but also helps alleviate any potential supply chain bottlenecks that might occur. Nvidia can bounce between the two manufacturers, relying on one more than the other if one manufacturer can't keep up with orders.

What has still not been confirmed is the performance of the GDDR6 modules used on the RTX 5050. GDDR6 has been around for so long that multiple speed bins exist (not even counting GDDR6X), ranging from 12 Gbps, all the way up to 20 Gbps. Nvidia could use any version between these two ranges for the RTX 5050, though more recent video cards have been taking advantage of 16 Gbps, 18 Gbps, and 20 Gbps versions of GDDR6. (The RTX 4070 GDDR6 and RX 9070 series use 20 Gbps GDDR6.)

Previous rumors suggest the RTX 5050 will take advantage of 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a 130W power rating. The entry-level Blackwell GPU will allegedly use a fully enabled GB207 die boasting 2,560 CUDA cores, 20 SMs, and a 128-bit memory interface; if the RTX 5050 were to use 18 Gbps GDDR6, that would translate to 288GB/s of memory bandwidth. For context, the RTX 5060 has almost twice the bandwidth, featuring 448GB/s.

Even though the RTX 5050 will not use GDDR7 memory, that does not guarantee the RTX 5050 won't use it in the future. Nvidia has created multiple versions of its xx50 class cards in the past, sporting different memory types. The GTX 1650 was one such GPU, which came in a whopping four different trim models during its lifecycle, not even counting the GTX 1650 Super. Nvidia launched the GTX 1650 in 2019 with 8 Gbps GDDR5 memory, then a year later launched an upgraded GTX 1650 with 12 Gbps GDDR6 memory. Eventually, Nvidia also released TU106 and TU116 versions of the GTX 1650 with the same specs as the GTX 1650 GDDR6 variant.

In addition, the laptop version of the RTX 5050 sports GDDR7 memory, making it even more likely that Nvidia will eventually make a GDDR7 version of its RTX 5050 desktop counterpart. If this happens, we will most likely see a GDDR7 version during Nvidia's RTX 50 series Super refresh, during which the company is rumored to be refreshing at least some of its outgoing Blackwell consumer GPUs with 3GB GDDR7 ICs. If Nvidia extends its Super refresh down to the RTX 5050, the RTX 5050 Super might feature 12GB of 28 Gbps GDDR7.

Normally, when you have expenses, you deduct them off your revenue to find your taxable profit. If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit.Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not "really" an "expense", regardless of the fact that you paid them.What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case).Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k.So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think "well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation," but in this case software engineers are special and aren't deductible in the same way.In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable.These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers.It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules.

So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable.These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs.

- A business is usually taxed on its profits: you deduct your revenue from the cost of producing that revenue, and the delta is what you are taxed on.- In software businesses, this usually means if you spend $1M in software development to develop a web app, and it makes $1.1M in that year, you'd get taxed on the $100K profits.- However, a few years ago, the IRS stopped allowing the $1M to be deducted in the year it was incurred. Instead, the $1M was to be amortized over 5 years, so now the business can only count $200K as the deductible expense for that year. So now it's going to be taxed on "profits" of $900K. Assuming the tax rate is 50%, that means the business owes $450K in taxes, even though it has a total of $100K in the bank after the actual expenses were paid. So it would have to either borrow to pay taxes or raise venture capital, meaning that VC-funded companies would be advantaged over bootstrapped ones!- The letter's goal is to bring things back to how they were (and how they are for all other businesses): let businesses deduct their actual expenses from their actual revenue, and tax that actual profit.I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, this is just my understanding of this issue.

Some big tech companies affected have laid off teams around the world, perhaps in order to mitigate the numbers looking bad to investors; so in a way, this adversely affected tech employees globally.Every country should have such a rule for software businesses, which is an industry where all the cost has to be upfronted, so that bootstrapping is facilitated. There are plenty of smaller markets where the VC model is not
the most appropriate funding instrument.

And it's transferable -- if your company fails, there are companies out there that will buy the rump of your company to realize the unrealized tax refunds.Which is why it's usually fairly straightforward to get a factor loan to pay those $450K in taxes -- it's backed by an asset.Factor loans are usually expensive with a high interest rate.   Because you can get a factor loan, the taxes are not going to immediately bankrupt the company in the short term, but the high interest rates are going to hurt in the long term.Not a lawyer nor an accountant.

The traditional capital asset treatment applied to software leaves a lot to be desired. Some software is a capital asset, but much just isn't. Or at least should be considered to depreciate rapidly.


reply




reply



The IRS is using a theory of value where software (1) is a capital asset (okay, sure), (2) has a six-year deprecation schedule (uhhh why not 5 like everything else?), and (3) is valued at the exact cost of all inputs to it, including salaries (uh oh).This is unlike how capital assets are valued for any other industry! And it has the effect that hiring a second lawyer is “cheaper” (for five years anyway) than hiring a second developer.

Using salaries as a proxy for value of the asset encourages only the safest shovelware bets, discouraging risk taking lest your asset be taxed at substantially higher than it's worth.Avoiding that risk-adverse dynamic is why Section 174 was written the way it was since the 50s to encourage R&D, and it's paid off in spades.

Well, that framing is just wrong. The companies are paying taxes over what those employees created, not over the employees. Does the company own the software?> The IRS is using a theory of value where...Notice that all of your 3 points are exactly like any other kind of capital.Most countries exclude salaries from the income calculation because it has good practical consequences (both on making accounting cheaper and on incentivizing companies to hire), not because of any theoretical problem.

The same is true for all true R&D, which is why historically the government has tried to provide protections for R&D work to incentivize people to not just churn out the safe bet over and over again. Patents fall into this category, but software patents are (rightly) hard to come by. Through 2022, the risk of software development was offset by the ability to expense the costs and avoid a tax bill, and this was good policy if your aim is to encourage innovation.The capital asset theory could still work if there were some way to appraise the value of the actual asset you created. But absent such a way, this thinking is deeply flawed for all but the most shovelware of jobs.

If you start the year with 0$ in your bank. After the end of the year you have made $200k in revenue. However you "spent" $200k on software salaries. However, because these are software costs, they must be depreciated over 5 years, so only 20% of that $200k software cost can be applied as depreciation cost which is considered an expense. So your net income for this year is $200k revenue - $20k depreciation expense = $180k. Your 15% tax on this is $27k.So you made $200k and spent all of it on software, so your bank account is 0, but you owe $27k in taxes.

That being said, I do think there's a little sloppiness/dishonesty in what is categorized as "R&D" in the software development. Is code maintenance R&D? Bug fixes? Performance improvements? Is it a "capital asset" no longer under R&D once it hits production? This aspect has always seemed too gray given how much money is at stake in taxes.But again, this complexity is an advantage for larger more established firms with legal departments and the infrastructure in place to document everything in order to handle audits. Which, in my view, is a form of regulatory capture.One potential argument I can see is that maybe this balances out since presumably the more established firms would have less "R&D" as a fraction of expenses to deduct in the first place?

They're literally aren't any. Treating payroll expenses as depreciating assets is insane, and that's why it isn't done in any other context. That sounds like a biased explanation, but it's genuinely the truth: it was stuck in the Trump's tax bill to help it evade budget balancing rules, but was designed to be so awful that a future Congress would “surely” repeal it, after the TCJA had passed successfully. This sort of horse-trading happens all the time with budgets, but for whatever reason, this provision was never repealed.

Keep good paying jobs in the USA. If we need immigrant labor, give them Green Cards instead of precarity.

This is counter-intuitive but absolutely the right answer. Giving immigrant employees full bargaining power will murder H1B mills. And no waiting periods in precarious limbo either. If you want an immigrant worker, they automatically get all bargaining power as an American and then you make your decision based on the market forces.

The Section 174 changes altered the accounting method that software development companies must use for calculating their profit for tax purposes. Starting in 2022 software dev must be treated not as an expense but as an investment in an asset, such that you're now required to amortize the expense over 5 years instead of deducting it from your revenue the year you spent the money.The gigantic problem with this change is that without the ability to expense software development expenses as expenses, a new software startup can very easily be considered profitable in their first year because only 10% of their software development-related expenses get to be counted as expenses.And note that, contrary to what you say, most white-collar work is not treated this way, and software is further singled out from other R&D-type work in that it is the only type of work that is explicitly called out in the section as being required to be marked as R&D. So we're not asking for software to be treated specially, we're asking why it suddenly changed in 2022 to be treated specially in an extremely negative way.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204565

Some examples of white collar work that builds long-lived assets but where the work isn't required to be amortized over long periods of time:- marketing collateral development, unless it is done by engineers- development of standard legal documents like contracts- development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance.

That's how it should be, and that's also how it actually was until relatively recently. A new law went into effect that treats software differently. I believe Congress was looking for an easy way to generate extra tax revenue by tapping into the wealth of rich tech giants. Whatever the intent, the workers ended up being the ones who suffer because now hiring people has worse tax consequences than it used to.So all that people want is to undo that, to take away that special rule that applies only to software, and put it back like it was.

When you pay people to get work done for a business, that paid work is an expense.You can deduct expenses from your income to calculate your profits.IIRC the problem is that software development is not being classified as an operating expense, now, but rather a "research" capital expense, and the deductions then have to be amortized over a number of years.

This is untrue. The rule is not about taxation, but deductions/expenses. If your expenses cover most revenue, you owe little in taxes. With this rule, a particular type of expense (software engineering salaries) is no longer deductible from revenue to calculate taxable income over which taxes are owed. So you might previously owe no taxes, but now you do. The deduction might carry over to the next few years and eventually (after 6 years) you will reach the same point - assuming your salaries don't go up and your business doesn't grow. The remainder in deductions will be returned after the business stops employing software engineers. I'm not sure why anyone would want the tax code to incentivize a business outcome that all of us would consider failure.

The UK eventually put out guidance that business as usual development isn't really "research and development", but afaik there hasn't been a serious crackdown on the practice.It seems kind of absurd to pretend that most work that developers do is pioneering the profession.R&D tax breaks make sense, both to encourage genuine research but also to prevent brain-drain.Not taxing (or tax credits / refunds ) for line-of-business software isn't really excusable.It's bad that the law in the US has been changed in a cliff-edge way though.

That said, here's my perspective on 174 (which should be reverted to full deduction on the year the expense is incurred).You do not have to amortize 100% of your engineering costs. Not even close.Here's the key:  Development costs incurred to remove uncertainty are amortized.  
  All other costs are deductible during the tax year where they are incurred.

How does this work?You are going to design a new robot arm.In January, you spend $100K to "remove uncertainty". In rough strokes, this means discovering all the things you don't know and need to know for this robot arm to become a product. This amount will be amortized over five years under 174.Now, with uncertainty removed, you spend an additional $1.1MM from January until December for engineering implementation. No uncertainty being removed. Just building a product. This is 100% deductible that tax year.Analogy: You want to build a new brick wall with specific properties. You spend $100K to develop a new type of brick and $1.1MM to build the wall using that brick. The $100K is amortized, the $1.1MM is deductible in one shot.BTW, at year 6 the amortization schedule reaches steady-state and you are amortizing the full $100K every year. In other words, the impact of 174, if treated intelligently, is the time value of money until steady state is reached for the engineering costs incurred to remove uncertainty.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2

My understanding is that previously, software dev salaries would be counted as a business expense in the year they are paid. Now they are amortized over X years on the tax paperwork. As a result, a lot of software companies suddenly show relatively high income, and have a large increase in their tax burden. This is especially hard for startups that were “on the edge” of making it. If the salaries go back to being an expense in the year the salary is paid, the tax burden will decrease again, because apparent company income will be less.

I'd say most of foreign devs in the US are actually L-1 that is actually worse because L-1 prohibits the dev from changing jobs unless the dev gets a new visa.


reply



H1B rules around changing jobs means that even if the employee joins at a market-level salary when they come to the US, they tent to stay at the same company much longer and can be exploited. The new company has to go through a lengthy paperwork process to allow the visa holder to switch jobs. Also, since the tech world tends to use things like stock options / RSUs / monetary bonuses for large parts of compensation package and those do not count towards "salary" you may have a situation where an h1b holder on paper seems to be paid fairly but in practice get only about 40-50% of what their peers get.If they were allowed to change jobs freely they would be able to negotiate their compensation fairly. The companies would be less intensified to hire H1Bs to save money and would also consider local talent for same positions. Everybody would win: both H1B visa holders and their families and American workers, too. The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.

The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.

So, that said: H-1B shouldn't exist for software. The point of it is to fill jobs that cannot be filled by an American for some reason; a condition that doesn't exist in software development. Hire immigrants as software engineers, fine. But find a way to do it that isn't bullshit.

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, a dedicated gaming app, and a virtual health coach. This could be a big update, with a dramatic redesign inspired by the Vision Pro — and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. And be sure to check out our live coverage of the keynote right here. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg — the company reportedly refers to the new interface as Liquid Glass. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem (including CarPlay) with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Additionally, there are three apps expected to undergo the most changes — the Phone app, Camera, and Safari. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. 9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence could power a polling feature that lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. 

Additionally, Messages may also add the ability to set a background image, following in the footsteps of WhatsApp and Instagram.

Apple may bring its Preview app from macOS to iPad and iPhone users, allowing them to annotate and edit PDFs. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg.

As Bloomberg reports, Genmoji could gain a small yet exciting feature that allows users to combine existing standard emojis, such as a basketball going into a trash can. 

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. 

This story was originally published June 3 and will be updated as more rumors come out.

We're almost halfway into 2025 and with it comes a bunch of opportunities to save on a variety of electronics and personal devices. Last year, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and right now you can get them for as low as $100. These noise-cancelling earbuds are normally priced at $250, but after a trade in, you can get a credit of up to $150. Choose between either white or silver as both options are available with the trade-in deal. If you don't have an old pair to trade in, no sweat. You'll still receive a cool $60 off, getting them for $190.

See at Samsung

The Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed to be Samsung's most comfortable in-ear headphones yet so they can stay in all-day comfortably for an immersive listening experience. The Buds3 Pro each come with it's charging case and charging USB-C cable as well as three sets of ear tips of various sizes so you can mold them to your ears perfectly.

Adaptive active noise cancellation means the earbuds can change modes on their own automatically based on your surroundings. This allows you to stay alert to what's around you while still not being distracted by ambient sounds as you're listening to your music, podcasts, or audiobooks on the go. The adaptive equalizer can even tell how you are wearing them and tailor-fit the sound you hear to your ears. You can even pair them with your TV to experience full 360-degree immersive sound that feels like its coming from all around you.

With Galaxy AI, you can have conversations across the language barrier, face-to-face, in real time. This is the kind of ability joked about by Douglas Adams with the babel fish in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of novels. But now it's really coming I guess. They say “Hola,” and you'll hear “Hello,” in your ear.

Touch controls make it easy to pause, skip, accept calls and more without needing to remove your phone from your pocket.

The trade-in will bring the price of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro to as low as $100. By trading in your old pair of earbuds, you can save up to $150 on your new Galaxy Buds3. Samsung is accepting a wide array of in-ear headphones are part of the offer. If you hand over a set of Galaxy Buds2 Pro, you'll receive the full $150 credit. A standard pair of Galaxy Buds or will net you $100 as will the original Galaxy Buds Pro. Samsung is also accepting Apple AirPods. Trade in the AirPods Pro 2 and you'll get you the full $150 credit.

Without any trade-in at all, the Galaxy Buds3 can still be yours for just $190—down from $250.

Hoping that you'll still be oohing and ahhing over your new Switch 2, Nintendo has a teensy little bit of bad news: the Legend of Zelda movie is being delayed. The good news is that it's not for that long.

Taking to Twitter rather than the Nintendo Today app this time, Shigeru Miyamoto released a brief statement confirming that Wes Ball's live-action Zelda movie will now release just over a month later than planned, on May 7, 2027.

This is Miyamoto. For production reasons, we are changing the release date of the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it…

— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) June 9, 2025



“For production reasons, we are changing the release date of the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be,” the statement reads in part. “Thank you for your patience.”

The release date, and now this changed one, is pretty much all we've definitively heard about the Zelda movie since its shock announcement from Nintendo and Sony Pictures back in November 2023. Although recently rumors have begun to swirl about potential casting, so much of just how one of the most beloved gaming series of all time is going to make the leap to live-action (outside of the occasional funky TV ad, that is) remains to be seen.

We'll bring you more on Sony and Nintendo's plans for the Zelda movie as and when we learn them.

          We found out the hard way just how bad Switch 2 DRM can get.
        


          But don't get too excited, it's not coming out until next year.
        


          Maybe ordering stuff online isn't the best way to buy after all.
        


          Even if GameStop stapled your Switch 2, remain calm and avoid paying $700 for a new console.
        


          Beyond patches to upgrade frame rates and resolution, you'll be able to use your OG Switch to play games alongside the Switch 2.

A cybersecurity researcher was able to figure out the phone number linked to any Google account, information that is usually not public and is often sensitive, according to the researcher, Google, and 404 Media's own tests.

The issue has since been fixed but at the time presented a privacy issue in which even hackers with relatively few resources could have brute forced their way to peoples' personal information.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

“I think this exploit is pretty bad since it's basically a gold mine for SIM swappers,” the independent security researcher who found the issue, who goes by the handle brutecat, wrote in an email. SIM swappers are hackers who take over a target's phone number in order to receive their calls and texts, which in turn can let them break into all manner of accounts.

In mid-April, we provided brutecat with one of our personal Gmail addresses in order to test the vulnerability. About six hours later, brutecat replied with the correct and full phone number linked to that account.

“Essentially, it's bruting the number,” brutecat said of their process. Brute forcing is when a hacker rapidly tries different combinations of digits or characters until finding the ones they're after. Typically that's in the context of finding someone's password, but here brutecat is doing something similar to determine a Google user's phone number.

Brutecat said in an email the brute forcing takes around one hour for a U.S. number, or 8 minutes for a UK one. For other countries, it can take less than a minute, they said.

In an accompanying video demonstrating the exploit, brutecat explains an attacker needs the target's Google display name. They find this by first transferring ownership of a document from Google's Looker Studio product to the target, the video says. They say they modified the document's name to be millions of characters, which ends up with the target not being notified of the ownership switch. Using some custom code, which they detailed in their write up, brutecat then barrages Google with guesses of the phone number until getting a hit.

“The victim isn't notified at all :)” a caption in the video reads.

A Google spokesperson told 404 Media in a statement “This issue has been fixed. We've always stressed the importance of working with the security research community through our vulnerability rewards program and we want to thank the researcher for flagging this issue. Researcher submissions like this are one of the many ways we're able to quickly find and fix issues for the safety of our users.”

Phone numbers are a key piece of information for SIM swappers. These sorts of hackers have been linked to countless hacks of individual people in order to steal online usernames or cryptocurrency. But sophisticated SIM swappers have also escalated to targeting massive companies. Some have worked directly with ransomware gangs from Eastern Europe.

Armed with the phone number, a SIM swapper may then impersonate the victim and convince their telecom to reroute text messages to a SIM card the hacker controls. From there, the hacker can request password reset text messages, or multi-factor authentication codes, and log into the victim's valuable accounts. This could include accounts that store cryptocurrency, or even more damaging, their email, which in turn could grant access to many other accounts.

On its website, the FBI recommends people do not publicly advertise their phone number for this reason. “Protect your personal and financial information. Don't advertise your phone number, address, or financial assets, including ownership or investment of cryptocurrency, on social media sites,” the site reads.

In their write-up, brutecat said Google awarded them $5,000 and some swag for their findings. Initially, Google marked the vulnerability as having a low chance of exploitation. The company later upgraded that likelihood to medium, according to brutecat's write-up.

Known for its orange styling and overclocking capabilities, the SOC Force returns with a modern twist

Gigabyte has listed a new B850 motherboard on its official webpage, confirming the return of its iconic SOC Force series. Originally designed for Intel chips, the series was distinguished by its bright orange aesthetics and included models like the GA-Z97X-SOC Force and the GA-Z170X-SOC Force. The latest addition, however, is meant for AMD CPUs specifically for the AM5 platform.

First spotted by @unikoshardware on X (Formerly Twitter), the new B850M Force is an M-ATX motherboard with a black PCB splashed with white and orange patterns that expand to the thermal heatsinks and chipset. A Wi-Fi 6E version of the motherboard has also been listed, which offers a similar set of features.

The B850M Force comes with only two memory DIMM slots, which, in a way, makes sense as one may not get the best stability when installing four RAM sticks instead of two. Speaking of which, Gigabyte lists support for DDR5 memory overclocking up to 9,600MT/s. It also comes with three M.2 storage slots, two of which have PCIe lanes connected to the CPU, while the third relies on the integrated chipset. All three support PCIe Gen 4 speeds, but the topmost slot additionally offers support for PCIe Gen 5 SSD when using the motherboard with a Ryzen 9000 or 7000 series CPU. There are also four SATA ports, if you prefer 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch SSDs/HDDs.

Other key features include an X3D Turbo Mode, which is a one-click solution to deliver optimized performance on Ryzen 9000 X3D and non-X3D processors, system debug LEDs, updated BIOS UI with improved features, and an adapter-based Wi-Fi antenna solution if you opt for the Wi-Fi variant of the motherboard.

As for the rear I/O, the B850M Force motherboard comes with HDMI and DisplayPort for video out, a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, two USB 2.0/1.1 Type-A ports, an RJ-45 Ethernet jack (2.5G), Wi-Fi antenna connector (Wi-Fi 6E model), and standard 3.5mm audio jacks for audio out, line-in, and microphone input. For some odd reason, Gigabyte has also included a PS/2 port on the motherboard, probably as a throwback to the original SOC Force lineup.

Gigabyte is not the only company reviving legacy models, as we recently saw MSI bringing back its Cyclone series of GPUs. Combining retro aesthetics from its classic designs with the latest RTX 50 series hardware, the company first gave us a glimpse of the MSI RTX 5070 Cyclone Visual at this year's Computex. Eventually, MSI introduced the RTX 5060 Cyclone OC featuring a round aluminum heatsink design along with two heatpipes and a single cooling fan.

PayPal is partnering with hotel payment provider Selfbook to let users search for and book hotels within the PayPal app.

The company said that it will let users pay through PayPal at checkout and offer exclusive discounts to users within the app. Users can also use PayPal Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) for select hotels that have enabled the feature.

People using the PayPal app will be able to go to the Offers section and search for hotels with filters like travel dates and number of guests using an in-app browser.

Users will see hotels that use Selfbook's payment suite on these apps, but it is not clear if Selfbook is making its entire catalog available to PayPal users.

For PayPal, this is a move to upsell another offering to users within the app. The company said that with its payment products, it has observed an 84% uptick among people who pay online for travel. 

“We're excited to go big in travel with Selfbook and help PayPal customers discover new merchants and save money through unique rewards and discounts,” Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal said in a statement.

PayPal also said that Selfbook will soon integrate the payment checkout products within its workflow outside the app. What's more, Selfbook will use PayPal's enterprise payment suite to power credit card payments for its hotels.

Selfbook is also using PayPal as a payments partner within Perplexity, which unveiled a feature that lets users discover and book hotels within the chat in March.

“Paying for a hotel has traditionally been the most fragmented part of travel—search one place, book another, pay somewhere else,” Khalid Meniri, Selfbook's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch over email. “With PayPal, we're collapsing all of that into a single flow embedded directly into AI-powered experiences like Perplexity. It's not just more convenient for travelers, it gives hotels a direct line to their guests, better margins through no commission, and more control over their brand,” Meniri said.

Air fryers are nice, but they take soooooooo long to cook wings. And where's my smart app? And why can't I bake a pizza?

I had precisely zero of these thoughts until last month. That's when the Dome 2 arrived at my doorstep—a king-sized, retro-futuristic air fryer from Silicon Valley kitchen startup Typhur that sorta looks like an alien spaceship as imagined by a little boy in the 1960s. But that shape is maybe fitting: In some ways, this Typhur can feel like the air fryer of the future.

At the very least, the Dome 2 is the rare air fryer that feels new. I've tested two dozen air fryers in the last six months alone, and the Dome is one of only a couple to offer any particular innovation since Philips rolled out the first air fryers 15 years ago.

I've got a few gripes with the Dome's control panel, granted. It's also a Hoover for counter space, and it costs as much as a cheap laptop. But thanks to an innovative two-burner design and some smart temperature control, the Typhur Dome 2 can cook crispy wings faster than any air fryer I've ever used. It will grill a mean cheese sandwich, char a fillet of meat, and tan the bottom of a frozen pizza. And its brushless motor makes it preternaturally quiet, often more hushed than the ambient noise of my house. And a self-clean feature means it's been mostly smoke- and smell-free for the time I've used it. Here's the rundown.

The first thing you'll notice about the Dome 2 is its shape. It's different, and not just because of the squared-off bulbousness of its exterior. (I still can't decide whether it looks more like a B-movie flying saucer or the head of a cartoon robot.)

The 5.6-quart air fryer basket is shallow, but broad enough to lay out a 12-inch pizza or two dozen party wings. This broad basket allows you to spread out food into a single layer across the bottom of the basket, offering even airflow. Which is to say, the Dome leans in hard to exactly what an air fryer does and is, with the main trade-off that it's now very difficult to air-fry a whole chicken. If you're a whole-chicken air-frying person, you'll have to spatchcock the heck out of it.

The temp is also accurate, a rare quality among air fryers. (Instant Pot and Philips also keep accurate temp.) The Dome 2 stays within 10 degrees of target temperature, as measured by a wireless ThermoPro TempSpike Pro ($106) I've found to be accurate for tracking ambient oven temps. The Dome 2's success should maybe be no surprise: Typhur's other main product is a line of wireless thermometers that rank among WIRED's favorites.

On the one hand, I could wish for a window to watch the cook without opening the basket. On the other, the Typhur is well-shielded. The fan noise is low enough I don't hear it if I'm standing by the fridge. Heat vents out the back, so the device's surface doesn't get overly hot. And smells are likewise shielded: This is now my preferred way to cook bacon, because the grease doesn't smell up the house for hours. The bacon fat, collected at the bottom of the basket, is reusable.

So far, so good. But what sets the Dome 2 apart from almost every other air fryer—including the previous generation Dome—is the added dual burner that allows the device to heat from both the top and the bottom of the frying basket. Only a few basket fryers have tried out this feature, including a Cosori Dual Blaze ($180) that had a hard time keeping accurate temp during my air fryer testing.

This adds up to two main qualities for the Dome 2: Food cooks fast. And food cooks evenly. Bacon crisps up like the air in Wisconsin. Even truly crappy crinkle fries will do the same. Wings air-fry to done after 14 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, about four minutes faster than other basket fryers. Add two more minutes to fry them “hard,” the way they do it in the wing belt extending from Ohio to the hot wing's birthplace in Buffalo.

But especially, the dual burners add versatility. Each of the device's settings now has multiple variables to play with. You can toggle the speed of the convection fan. But you can also change the distribution of power to the top or the bottom burner.

Typhur lets you control this the way sophisticated toaster ovens like Breville's do: through settings like “grill” or “broil” that modulate both fan speed and primary heat source. The grill setting combines the crispness of an air fryer with direct heat from the bottom of the basket—meaning I can brown and even lightly grill-char a pair of chicken legs at 450 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to deliciously crispy-fatty skin. This is also how the oven does pizza and pancakes, heating each from below but at a much lower fan setting to avoid drying out the crust or batter.

This said, Typhur doesn't make its settings overly easy to parse, except via a recent blog post that still requires a little parsing. I'd love if the device or app offered indicators to show which burners were most active, and the speed of the fan, for each setting. But for now, below is a handy chart explaining the various cooking modes.

In general, the higher the fan speed, expect more browning or crisping on the surface as the air draws across the surface and steals the moisture—which is the main reason air fryers are so effective at creating crispy food. That said, too much fan can dry out the food over time.

But you won't get full use out of the Dome 2 unless you pair it to your phone. Many functions aren't accessible from the eight-button control panel on the device itself. The app's most straightforward bonus is a 48-deep menu of recipes designed specifically for the Dome 2. These range from simple recommendations for bacon, chicken legs, or asparagus to air fryer cakes and cookies, and chicken cordon bleu.

Once you choose a recipe, you can tweak both temperature and time, based on how much food you've added or how thick you've sliced your bacon. Then click start, and the device's setting will pair up with the recipe on the app. You'll still have to physically press start on the device, as a safety measure.

But many useful functions are app-only, including dehydrate, bake, and roast—plus an added Steak preset. No baking or steaking if the Wi-Fi's down! (The Wings and Bacon presets, oddly, are the buttons on the device that are most similar to the baking function.)

The self-clean function, which heats the oven at high temps to burn gunk off the heating elements, is also app-only. The basket and griddle grate are coated with PFAS- and PTFE-free ceramic nonstick, and it's pretty easy to wipe clean—but the self-clean, meant for monthly use, is a good backup for the oven interior.

Price aside —this Typhur isn't cheap—reliance on the app is one of the main sticking points on an otherwise terrific device. (Though I'd also like more visibility on fan speed and primary burners.) I've accepted, for whatever reason, that my Google TV is a brick without a remote or a phone app. But I guess I still want to be able to bake cookies when my phone's dead. Maybe I need to learn to stop worrying and love the smart kitchen.

When capacity and speed are crucial

Max out your PCIe Gen 4 bandwidth with this fantastic SSD deal on a superfast Gen 4.0 M.2 SSD from Crucial. The T500 was one of the last hurrahs on Gen 4, with read and write transfer speeds that could match and even exceed the performance of popular SSD stalwarts such as Samsung's 990 Pro and Western Digital's SN850X. What makes this T500 deal so good is that it's cheaper than the previously mentioned competition and also comes with an attached heatsink.

You can find this deal on the Crucial T500 2TB SSD + Heatsink at Amazon for just $132. On checking the Camelizer (Amazon's price-checking tool extension), we can note that this is one of the best prices we've seen for this SSD since late 2023, when the drive was released.

If you'd like more information on this SSD, then take a look at our review of the Crucial T500. We put the drive through our suite of benchmarking tests to see how it performs in comparison to the competition. We awarded the T500 an impressive 4 stars for its excellent all-around performance, software, and encryption support, but were disappointed at the original launch MSRP price of the drive.

Crucial T500 2TB M.2 SSD + Heatsink: now $132 at Amazon (was $209)The Crucial T500 is one of the more recent Gen4 SSDs, making the most of its Gen4 bandwidth.  With sequential read/write speeds of 7400/7000 Mbps, the T500 is no slouch and is more than enough for top gaming performance in both PC and PlayStation 5.

The Crucial T500 uses the Phison E25 controller and features 232-layer Micron TLC memory. The popular 2280 M.2 form factor is highly compatible with the majority of motherboards that support an M.2 slot, and thanks to the thin single-sided design, this SSD is also a great fit for devices where space is a premium commodity, such as laptops or the PlayStation 5 console.

The legal battle between Micron and YMTC has taken a new turn as Micron attempts to overturn earlier agreements and court rulings, citing national security concerns. Under those prior rulings, YMTC gained access to 73 pages of Micron's confidential 3D NAND technology documentation, but now Micron wants to reverse that and leave YMTC without such access. While Micron's petition may seem unusual in the digital age, as observed by PatentlyO, there might be a reason behind the move.

Micron has petitioned the Supreme Court for 'a writ of mandamus,' challenging lower court rulings that allowed Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (YMTC) to receive 73 pages of printed copies of Micron's confidential documents during discovery as part of the 2023 litigation under which YMTC accused Micron of patent infringement. Micron's arguments claim that the district court ignored key provisions of the protective order and therefore failed to consider national security concerns associated with disclosing sensitive semiconductor information to a Chinese state-supported company that is on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List.

Micron's argument began with the nature of the dispute. In the 2023 case, YMTC alleged that Micron's 3D NAND memory products infringed several of its patents. Discovery proceeded under a jointly agreed-upon protective order that limited access to highly sensitive materials, such as source code, to outside counsel and experts, excluding company employees. It also restricted printed copies to 1,500 pages overall and no more than 30 consecutive pages.

"YMTC demanded 10 times more printed pages of source code for Micron's latest-generation chips than it had for earlier-generation chips," a statement by Micron reads.

Eventually, YMTC requested 73 printed pages from Micron's '150 Series Traveler Presentation,' containing information about Micron's latest and upcoming 3D NAND devices. Although numerically compliant with the protective order's page limits, Micron objected, claiming that the request was excessive, unnecessary, and dangerous given the nature of the information and YMTC's links to the Chinese government. Nonetheless, the court ruled that Yangtze Memory could get access to the printed 73 pages. Now, while an avid reader of Tom's Hardware is probably fluent with copying via a wide range of means, gaining hardware copies under a protective court order does not mean that one can make copies, at least legally. These are for eyes only — if everyone follows the rules. 

Under the protective order, only authorized individuals, in this case, YMTC's outside counsel and experts, can handle the originals. Also, no duplication of printed copies is allowed, no scanning, no photocopying, and no electronic reproduction; this is strictly prohibited.

In addition, every page is Bates-numbered and tracked; any duplication would be a violation of the protective order and subject to court sanctions, including penalties, adverse rulings, or contempt of court. If YMTC or its legal team were to make unauthorized copies, they would be in serious legal trouble, and there is no evidence they have. Nonetheless, Micron wants this decision to be reversed.

Who doesn't love Lego? Appealing to folks of all ages, Lego makes for wonderful gifts or collectors items. I find myself just really enjoying the process of it all. Popping on a podcast or some music while I just tune out and build. You take each piece of the instructions one step at a time while you can see your progress moving along in real time. It's pretty mindful and therapeutic as you put this cool thing together in front of you while your mind wanders and your real-life stressors momentarily go away. Plus, Lego's got awesome sets covering every franchise under the sun — Marvel being one of its most popular. Speaking of, this Lego Marvel Captain America's Shield set is currently 20% off, bringing the price down to just $160.

See at Amazon

It's the iconic shield of Cap himself. And it's not made out of vibranium. No, it's made of something much tougher and even more deadly if you accidently step on—Lego. At a life-size measurement of 47 centimeters (18.5 inches), this Lego set is massive. It contains a total of 3,128 pieces to put together the red, white, and blue symbol of heroism. It's built for display as it comes with a stand marked with a Lego Infinity Saga plaque.

Also included is a minifigure of Captain America. Falcon has taken over the title and shield, but this minifigure is of the first Captain America as he appeared during the first decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films as portrayed by Chris Evens. The minifigure has his own shield. In his other hand, you'll find Mjolnir—the hammer of Thor. Marvel fans will remember the showstopping fight between Captain America and Thanos in 2019's Avengers: Endgame in which Cap proved himself worthy to wield this mighty weapon.

The Lego builder app can make the building process easier and more immersive than ever before. Zoom in and rotate sets in 3D while tracking your progress of the build in front of you intuitively. It's a really cool way Lego has kept up with modern consumer expectations. You can check it out on the Lego website.

The long and short is that Marvel is cool and Lego is fun. For a limited time, you can get the Lego Marvel Captain America's Shield set with its Chris Evans minifigure for the discounted price of $160—a savings of 20% that amounts to $40. And be sure to check out the other Lego Marvel sets on sale at Amazon.

Apple has long possessed a tradition of premium pricing and hardly ever offers deep discounts, preferring instead to maintain its prestige brand name and perceived quality. But as Amazon reinstated Apple's complete lineup, the world's largest online seller has been more aggressive on pricing cuts, even on freshly released products like the AirPods 4.

Since Sunday afternoon, both models of the AirPods 4 (with and without active noise cancellation) are available at an all-time low price, and it is a great time to invest in Apple's new wireless earbuds. The standard AirPods 4 model without ANC now costs $99 from its original $129 price which is a discount of 23%. If you're looking at AirPods 4 with ANC, they now cost $148 from the original $179 price (17% off).

Both models of the AirPods 4 are filled with the latest technology that raises the bar for wireless sound. The standard model comes with Bluetooth connectivity, personalized spatial audio, and a water and sweat-resistant construction, and they are ideal for fitness use and daily wear. They also boast a USB-C charging case, an improvement from previous generations, and Apple's H2 chip which delivers greater sound quality, faster connectivity and improved battery life. With the charging case, users can get 30 hours of overall listening time, ready to last through long commutes, travel, or even a day at work and play.

AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation take it further by incorporating adaptive audio, transparency mode, and wireless charging compatibility. Adaptive sound smartly blends transparency mode and noise cancellation and automatically adjusts to your environment for a seamless listening experience. Transparency mode allows listeners to stay aware of their environment without needing to remove the earbuds, especially useful for noisy situations. Wireless charging adds convenience with the ability to charge earbuds without needing to dig out cables.

You will love the seamless setup for iPhone owners: Due to Apple's deep integration within iOS, pairing the AirPods 4 is literally as easy as opening the case close to your iPhone. The H2 chip also facilitates quicker device switching so that users can transition easily from their iPhone to iPad or Mac without skipping a beat. Personalized spatial audio is powered by dynamic head tracking and produces theater-quality sound that adapts in response to the movement of your head, so music, movies, and calls sound more lifelike.

Water and sweat resistance of the AirPods 4 makes it a reliable sidekick to accompany runners and gym-goers. The USB-C charging case future-proofs the device but it also makes it easy for users to locate compatible charging devices as USB-C is already becoming a mobile standard. With 30 hours of battery life, the designers have ensured that the users will enjoy uninterrupted sound for days in a single charge, a feature that is unparalleled in the noisy wireless earbuds space.

Amazon's price reduction on the AirPods 4 is rare for Apple products, particularly so soon after they released. Now is the perfect time to grab this deal before it is gone, make sure you get yours as soon as possible.

Floating in orbit above Mars, NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured a panorama of the Red Planet's biggest volcanoes, Arsia Mons, peeking over a sea of clouds. The picturesque moment offers an exceptionally rare view of a Martian volcano, showing the landform at an angle in space that captures the planet's horizon.

“We picked Arsia Mons hoping we would see the summit poke above the early morning clouds. And it didn't disappoint,” Jonathon Hill, the operations lead for Odyssey's camera and a mission planner at Arizona State University's Mars Space Flight Facility, called the Thermal Emission Imaging System, or THEMIS, said in a statement. THEMIS can view Mars in both visible and infrared light.

Launched in 2001, Odyssey has been circling around Mars for over two decades, studying the Martian surface. But in 2023, the orbiter began taking breathtaking panoramic views of the Martian horizon. Because THEMIS can't pivot to get these stunning views, the orbiter flips on its side, rotating a full 90 degrees. That way, it captured Mars' “limb,” the edge of the planet's horizon. This is THEMIS' fourth limb observation since 2023.

Odyssey captured the image on May 2, just before dawn. In it, Arsia Mons stands 12 miles (20 kilometers) high and measures 70 miles (450 km) in diameter. For comparison, Earth's tallest volcano, Mauna Loa, stands 6 miles (9 km) above the seafloor and measures 75 miles (121 km) in diameter.

Arsia Mons is also one of Mars' cloudiest volcanoes and the southernmost of the three Tharsis volcanoes that form Tharsis Montes, or Tharsis Mountains. These mountains are often surrounded by water ice clouds, particularly early in the morning. The clouds form when air expands as it blows up the sides of the mountain and then rapidly cools.

This view also allows scientists to study Martian weather and phenomena like dust clouds and how they change over the course of the seasons. Odyssey might be able to capture a few more of these panoramas before its eventual retirement, likely at the end of this year.

That empty folder was more important than it looked

If you accidentally deleted the mysterious folder Microsoft warned all users to absolutely not delete, the company has now released a PowerShell script to help you restore it. The folder in question, ‘inetpub', began appearing on users' system drives (C:\) after the April 2025 security update for Windows 10 and 11.

While the folder does not appear to have any files, Microsoft confirmed that it plays a critical role in enabling protections for CVE-2025-21204, a security vulnerability in the Windows Update Stack.

To help users who may have deleted the folder, intentionally or unintentionally, Microsoft has shared a PowerShell script to restore the folder with the correct access control lists. Notably, this process does not require users to manually enable Internet Information Services (IIS), the web server platform with which the folder is associated.

To run the script, open PowerShell as Administrator and execute the following command to enable signed scripts and modules -

Next, copy and paste the following to download the script -

If a prompt asks you to install NuGet Provider, respond with Y to proceed, and run the above script again. Finally, to apply the fix, use the following command-

After successfully running the script, the inetpub folder should be created.

Back in April, the appearance of the inetpub folder left many users scratching their heads. Microsoft later clarified that the folder is a required component for securing systems against CVE-2025-21204, which involves “improper link resolution before file access” in the Windows Update Stack. This vulnerability could essentially allow an authorized attacker to gain elevated privileges if exploited.

While users can also recreate the folder by enabling IIS through “Turn Windows features on or off,” doing so adds additional system folders that many may prefer to avoid. That's why Microsoft's script-based method is the recommended approach if the folder has already been removed.

Even though the folder is empty and IIS may not be in use, deleting inetpub can compromise the effectiveness of the security patch, leaving systems potentially vulnerable. Microsoft emphasizes that the folder should not be removed under any circumstances.

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that predicts acute child malnutrition up to six months in advance could help combat the condition in Kenya and across Africa, nearly half of deaths among children under five linked to acute undernutrition - most of them in low- and middle-income countries - according to the World Health Organization.

However, gaps in data can make it difficult to know where to focus resources in countries like Kenya.

Five per cent of children in Kenya are acutely malnourished, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic Health Survey, a level considered a public health concern.

Scientists have come up with a machine learning model that uses clinical health data and satellite imagery to forecast malnutrition trends across the country.

The tool was developed by a team from the University of Southern California (USC), in collaboration with Microsoft's AI for Good Research Lab, Amref Health Africa, and Kenya's Ministry of Health.

Lead researcher Laura Ferguson, director of research at the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health, says the goal is to equip health authorities with early warnings that support effective prevention and treatment responses.

"The tool is designed to predict malnutrition across counties in Kenya [and]… prepare prevention and treatment strategies," Ferguson told SciDev.Net.

To make these forecasts, the model pulls data from the government's District Health Information Software System (DHIS2) and combines it with satellite imagery to pinpoint where and when malnutrition is likely to occur.

Unlike traditional models that depend solely on historical trends, this AI tool integrates clinical data from more than 17,000 Kenyan health facilities.

It achieved 89 per cent accuracy for one-month predictions and 86 per cent accuracy over six months, marking a significant improvement over baseline models.

The tool can also integrate publicly available data on agricultural vegetation derived from satellite imagery into the model, to indicate available food sources, Ferguson added.

Encouraged by the results in Kenya, the researchers hope the tool can be adapted for use in nearly 125 other countries that also use DHIS2 — particularly in the 80 low- and middle-income nations where malnutrition remains a leading cause of child mortality.

"This model is a game-changer," said Bistra Dilkina, associate professor of computer science and co-director of the USC Center for AI in Society.

"By using data-driven AI models, you can capture more complex relationships between multiple variables that work together to help us predict malnutrition more accurately," she explained.

To maximise the impact of the tool, collaboration across sectors is key, says Samuel Mburu, head of digital transformation at Amref Health Africa, who also worked on the project. He suggests aligning health services with agriculture and disaster management efforts.

"Continued investment in digital health infrastructure and training is also critical," Mburu told SciDev.Net.

Peter Ofware, Kenya country director for Helen Keller International, a US-based non-profit focused on nutrition and health, agrees that integrating vegetation data with DHIS2 improves forecasting accuracy.

"This improves the accuracy of forecasts," said Ofware, who did not participate in the research.

"However, DHIS data, which is their primary source, has many limitations in quality —especially for malnutrition."

Children are typically only screened for malnutrition in facilities where treatment is available, which limits how representative the data is, he added.

Researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that children living with multiple sclerosis (MS) show signs of accelerated biological aging, even in their teenage years. The research published online recently in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, is the first to examine whether MS causes early aging in a pediatric population - offering new insight into the disease and its long-term progression.

We found evidence that children living with MS experience accelerated biological aging. Compared to young people without MS, youth with MS had evidence of accelerated epigenetic age, a measurement of DNA chemical modifications associated with aging. We know that aging is related to the development of a less treatable form of MS and that adults with MS face both normal aging and accelerated aging from the disease."

Jennifer S. Graves, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study, professor and vice chair of neurosciences and division chief of neuroimmunology at UC San Diego

MS is a lifelong autoimmune disease that attacks the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The research team used DNA methylation markers - molecular changes that indicate biological age - to analyze blood samples from 125 children with MS and 145 children without MS. In contrast to chronological age, which reflects the number of birthdays, biological age tracks how quickly the body is wearing down on a cellular level.

The study focused on children and teenagers not yet impacted by the processes of normal aging and age-related illnesses like hypertension and diabetes. Despite appearing outwardly healthy, children with MS showed DNA patterns indicating they were biologically older than their peers.

The researchers found differences in four different epigenetic clocks and signs of accelerated aging in MS patients in models of two clocks most sensitive to health-related stress and inflammation. Epigenetic clocks are age-predicting algorithms that calculate epigenetic age as an estimate of chronological age or age-associated clinical events such as disease or all-cause mortality. The most affected kids appeared to be aging up to two years faster biologically than their healthy peers, even though their average chronological age was just 15.

Biological age has already been linked to disability progression in adults with MS. This study suggests the process may start much earlier than previously thought, potentially even before visible symptoms of progression appear. And that could change the way MS is treated.

"This is a whole new concept in MS," said Graves. "Aging isn't something we think of affecting teenagers. But these kids are accumulating cellular damage that may not show up clinically until years later, when they suddenly transition from doing fine to disease progression in their 30s. It is a significant finding to see this accelerated aging in children. If we can understand the interplay between the immune system, the brain and aging - and break that open - we might be able to put MS into full remission in the future."

The researchers hope future studies will track patients over time to see how early biological aging contributes to long-term disability. They also plan to explore how social stressors, obesity and environmental exposures may accelerate aging in children with MS, especially given the higher prevalence of pediatric MS among lower-income families.

Additional co-authors on the study include: Christopher Goyne, M.D. and Ashley Fair at UC San Diego; Defne Yilmaz, M.S. and Lisa F. Barcellos, Ph.D. at UC Berkeley; Jonathan Race, Ph.D., Allison Schuette, M.S., T. Charles Casper, Ph.D. at University of Utah; Stacy Caillier, John Rose, M.D. and ​​Emmanuelle L.

Spending too much time on screens may cause emotional and behavioral problems in children – and those problems can lead to even more screen use, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.

Conducted by an international team of researchers, the study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed 117 studies, encompassing data from over 292,000 children worldwide. The findings were published in the journal Psychological Bulletin.

Children are spending more and more time on screens, for everything from entertainment to homework to messaging friends. We found that increased screen time can lead to emotional and behavioral problems, and kids with those problems often turn to screens to cope."

Michael Noetel, PhD, associate professor in the School of Psychology at Queensland University and one of the authors of the study

Noetel and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis to better understand the relationship between screen time and socio-emotional problems, like aggression, anxiety, or low self-confidence. They included any study with participants under 10 years of age that measured screen use and socio-emotional problems, where children were followed-up for at least six months. Screen-based activities included social media, video games, TV watching and online homework. 

Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (41 studies), followed by Canada (13), Australia (11), and Germany and the Netherlands (7 each).

The study revealed that the more children engaged with electronic screens the more likely they were to develop socio-emotional problems. This included both internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression, and externalizing problems, such as aggression and hyperactivity. Conversely, children experiencing socio-emotional problems were found to be more likely to turn to screens as a coping mechanism.

The researchers identified several factors that may moderate these relationships. Compared with younger children (ages 0-5), older children (ages 6-10) were more likely to develop socio-emotional problems with greater screen use. Girls were generally more susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems with greater screen use, while boys were more likely to increase screen use when facing socio-emotional challenges.

The type of screen content and purpose of screen use also played a role, according to Noetel. Gaming was associated with higher risks compared with educational or recreational screen use. Children experiencing socio-emotional problems were also more likely to turn to games to cope.

The findings suggest parents might want to be cautious about what screens they allow and use parental controls to manage time, said Noetel. He also noted that kids who use screens heavily might need emotional support, not just restrictions. Parents could benefit from programs helping them handle both screen use and emotional problems.

"This comprehensive study highlights the need for a nuanced approach to managing children's screen time," said lead author Roberta Vasconcellos, PhD, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who conducted the research while a doctoral student at Australian Catholic University. "By understanding the bidirectional relationship between screen use and socio-emotional problems, parents, educators and policymakers can better support children's healthy development in an increasingly digital world."

Because every study in the meta-analysis followed kids over time, the research is a big step closer to cause‑and‑effect (as opposed to correlation) than the usual snapshots done at a single point in time, according to Noetel.

"It's about as close as we can get to causal evidence without randomly cutting screens for thousands of kids," he said. "But still, we can't completely rule out other factors-like parenting style-that could influence both screen use and emotional problems."

With the advent of extensive 3D biology studies, we are at a pivotal moment in transitioning from 2D biology-based research to more accurate and reliable 3D models.

The shift towards utilizing complex organ-like structures developed from stem cells or tissue samples is becoming essential; these organoid models are leading the way to next-generation, animal-free research methodologies.

Organoids show significant potential in various applications, including disease modeling, drug discovery and development, personalized medicine, cell biology processes, and genetic disease research. In the field of cancer research, there is particular interest in patient-derived organoids (PDOs), which are created using cells sourced from patient-derived samples such as biopsies and surgical resections.

Tumor heterogeneity and genetic variations within tumors challenge drug treatment strategies and often require multiple lines of therapy, which can lead to the development of resistant cell populations.

While several traditional in vitro assays exist for drug response studies, there is a growing need for improved combinations of 3D models, biological handling systems, and assays to better capture the complexity of in vivo conditions.

These improvements should address common pain points such as timely handling of complex 3D models, scaling up workflows, automating assay steps, enhancing data acquisition, and enabling deeper analysis for therapeutic drug discovery.

In this article, colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids were chosen as the model system for drug response studies, using established anti-cancer compounds to evaluate the effectiveness of robotics-based assay development.

The BioAssemblyBot® 400 (BAB400) was utilized to automate CRC dome assays, allowing for standardized processing and uniform distribution of patient-derived CRC organoids. The organoids were cultured and treated over a six-day period, during which an image-based endpoint assay was conducted to analyze drug responses.

The BAB400 pipette hand was employed to dispense organoids into Matrigel® domes. Subsequently, organoid cultures were monitored over a six-day period through imaging for time-course observation and endpoint assays.

Immunotherapy is gaining traction as a prominent approach to cancer treatment. These therapies encompass the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-engineered T-cells (CAR T-cells), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other genetically modified T-cells to specifically target cancer cells.

While significant progress has been made with immunotherapy for blood cancers, its effectiveness in treating solid tumors remains limited.

A key factor contributing to this low success rate is the solid tumor microenvironment (TME), where suppressive cytokines hinder the tumor-killing capacity of T-cells. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the role of the TME in T-cell responses to develop more effective cancer therapies.

The advantages of using three-dimensional (3D) patient-derived organoids (PDOs) stem from their ability to replicate the physical and chemical cues of the tumor microenvironment (TME)—factors that are absent in traditional 2D monolayer cultures.

Research indicates that PDOs respond to drugs in ways that closely mirror the responses of the original tumors, highlighting their potential to improve therapeutic outcomes.

As physiologically and pathologically relevant cancer models, PDOs better capture the key characteristics of primary tumors. This makes them a more suitable platform than 2D models for evaluating the effectiveness of T-cell–mediated killing.

Despite the advantages associated with PDOs, substantial obstacles hinder their widespread implementation in drug discovery. The production of organoids is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor. Furthermore, organoid culture requires specialized manual skills, leading to significant variability among operators.

To address the challenges associated with large-scale applications of PDOs, a semi-automated bioprocess has been developed for the large-scale expansion of assay-ready organoids. 

In the study discussed here, a method to evaluate T-cell invasion in solid tumors using PDOs was devised.

Utilizing bioreactor-expanded patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids (CRCs), activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with CellTracker and introduced to CRCs (stained with MitoTracker) in a 96-well microtiter plate, with monitoring occurring every four hours for three days via a high-content imager.

To quantify T-cell invasion, an image analysis method to measure the distance of each T-cell to the nearest organoid was established. The findings indicated that stimulated T-cells demonstrated a shorter interaction distance compared to non-stimulated T-cells. These results highlight the utility of bioreactor-expanded organoids in large-scale T-cell-based screening assays.

Taking antipsychotic medications as prescribed lowers the risk of a car crash for drivers with schizophrenia, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250020.

Schizophrenia can cause hallucinations and disorganized behaviour that affect the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. Most people with schizophrenia are prescribed antipsychotic medications that improve many of these symptoms. Researchers hypothesized that these medications may also reduce the risk of a motor vehicle crash - but only if patients continue to take the medication as prescribed.

Dr. John A. Staples and colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, used 20 years of population-based health and driving data to examine 1130 motor vehicle crashes involving drivers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and prior treatment with antipsychotics. They found that taking antipsychotic medication as prescribed significantly reduced the odds of a crash.

We found that perfect adherence to antipsychotic medication (relative to complete nonadherence) was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of a crash. We believe our results suggest that antipsychotic medications reduce crash risk among individuals with schizophrenia."

Dr. John A. Staples, University of British Columbia

The findings have important implications.

"Our results provide one more reason for doctors and family members to encourage people with schizophrenia to take their antipsychotics as prescribed. We think our results also suggest that health systems should put more resources into programs to support antipsychotic adherence among people with schizophrenia," says Dr. Staples.

He adds, "If a driver with schizophrenia isn't taking their medications as prescribed, should their driver's licence be temporarily suspended? This approach deserves some consideration. But we also know that people with schizophrenia are often marginalized, with limited opportunities for employment and social engagement. Taking away their driver's licence might make them more isolated. We think more research is needed so that policy-makers can understand these risks before enacting a policy that might be coercive or harmful."

Detection of melanoma and a range of other skin diseases will be faster and more accurate with a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool that analyses multiple imaging types simultaneously.

University of Queensland researchers including Professors H. Peter Soyer and Monika Janda were part of a Monash University-led team that developed the tool, which improved skin cancer diagnosis accuracy by 11 per cent when used by dermatologists in a reader study.

 'PanDerm' analyses multiple types of images, including close-up photos, dermoscopic images, pathology slides and total body photographs.

A series of evaluations showed the model helped non-dermatologist healthcare professionals improve diagnostic accuracy on various other skin conditions by 16.5 per cent. 

It could also supported clinicians to detect skin cancer early, identifying potentially concerning changes before clinician detection.

Professor Soyer said the tool could be particularly valuable in busy or resource-limited settings, or in primary care where access to dermatologists may be limited.

Differences in imaging and diagnosis techniques can arise due to different levels of resources available in urban, regional and rural healthcare spaces.

The strength of PanDerm lies in its ability to support existing clinical workflows.

We have seen that the tool was also able to perform strongly even when trained on only a small amount of labelled data, a key advantage in diverse medical settings where standard annotated data is often limited."

Professor H. Peter Soyer

Trained on more than two million skin images, data for the model was sourced from 11 institutions in multiple countries, across 4 types of medical images. 

First author and PhD student Siyuan Yan from Monash University said the multimodal approach was key to the system's success.

"By training PanDerm on diverse data from different imaging techniques, we've created a system that can understand skin conditions the way dermatologists do; by synthesising information from various visual sources," Mr Yan said. 

With skin conditions now impacting 70 per cent of the global population, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial and can lead to better treatment outcomes. 

Unlike current models, which are trained to perform a single task, PanDerm was evaluated on a wide range of clinical tasks such as skin cancer screening, predicting the chance of cancer returning or spreading, skin type assessment, mole counting, tracking lesion changes, diagnosing a wide range of skin conditions, and segmenting lesions. 

Alfred Health Victorian Melanoma Service Director, Professor Victoria Mar, said PanDerm showed promise in helping detect subtle changes in lesions over time and provide clues to lesion biology and future metastatic potential. 

"This kind of assistance could support earlier diagnosis and more consistent monitoring for patients at high risk of melanoma," Professor Mar said.

"In real-world hospitals or clinic settings, doctors use diverse ways and different types of images to diagnose skin cancer or other skin conditions."

Though showing promising research results, PanDerm is currently in the evaluation phase before broader healthcare implementation.

The team plans to establish standardised protocols for cross-demographic assessments and further investigate the model's performance in varied clinical settings, with a particular focus on ensuring equitable performance across different patient populations and healthcare environments.

The research led by AI and machine learning experts at Monash University also included collaboration with researchers and clinicians at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Alfred Health, Medical University of Vienna, NVIDIA AI Technology Centre in Singapore, University of Florence, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW Health Pathology and Hospital General Universitario de Alicante in Spain. 

The research is published in Nature Medicine.

Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to develop new therapies for age driven diseases, today announced the publication of new research identifying a novel, single-gene target for cellular rejuvenation. Capable of reversing cellular aging across multiple cell types, without inducing dangerous pluripotency pathways seen in other approaches, SB000 is well positioned as a target for safer, next-generation cell rejuvenation therapeutics, with broad application across age-driven diseases.

Existing approaches to cell rejuvenation primarily focus on the Yamanaka Factors (OSKM), a combination of genes that can be used to reverse cellular aging but are known to induce pluripotency that may result in tumorigenesis, limiting their use in a therapeutic setting. In this seminal study, SB000 demonstrated cellular rejuvenation at both methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without evidence of pluripotency. Not only is this approach safer when compared to OSKM, it also demonstrated comparable methylome rejuvenation, consistently across multiple cell types.

The discovery of SB000 marks a major milestone, both for Shift and for the cell rejuvenation field more broadly, and demonstrates the power of our unique, dataset-driven approach to target identification. Offering comparable efficacy to the Yamanaka Factors without the safety concerns associated with pluripotency, SB000 is well positioned as a target for next-generation, safer cellular rejuvenation therapeutics, helping us bring about a future where we have substantial control over the aging process and age-related diseases. We are pleased to progress SB000 on to proof-of-concept studies and expect this paper to be the first in a series of publications as we uncover the previously hidden biology of cellular ageing and rejuvenation."

Dr Daniel Ives, CEO, Shift Bioscience

Shift Bioscience will now proceed with further studies to progress SB000 as a therapeutic target, including research to confirm efficacy across an even broader range of disease-relevant cell types, and to advance to in vivo proof-of-concept rejuvenation studies.

World Cup

The U.S. host cities for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 admitted on Monday they were “monitoring closely” the current political situation in the United States amid rising tensions over President Trump's crackdown on immigration — but insisted visitors will be made welcome at the tournament.

FIFA's President Gianni Infantino claimed earlier this year that “America will welcome the world” for next year's tournament, which will be shared across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Infantino said: “America will welcome the world. Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun and to celebrate the game will be able to do that.”

Infantino has also claimed that FIFA's tournaments in the U.S., first the Club World Cup in 2025 and then the World Cup next year, will generate almost $50 billion in economic output for the U.S. Foreign travellers are integral to hitting these targets for both FIFA and the host cities.

However, this past weekend has seen protests develop against the government, and clashes between protestors and the authorities. During an event in New York City to mark a year out from the 2026 tournament, host city officials were forced to address concerns that the current political environment may dissuade visitors from travelling to the United States. California has been a hotspot for the developments, with President Trump sending in the National Guard to protect immigration agents and the state of California now say they will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration. The administration last week imposed wide-ranging travel bans against over a dozen countries.

Speaking in New York City, the Philadelphia host city executive Meg Kane said: “For us as host cities, we recognize that our charge as host cities is to be prepared to welcome whomever is in our city and to make them feel welcome when they are there. There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level. There are going to be geo-political issues that we don't even know right now that are going to affect the tournament next year.

“So we recognize that we're planning within uncertainty. One of the things that I think we all recognize is that we have to be really good at operating within that uncertainty. For each of our cities, we want to be prepared to make any person that makes the decision to come to the United States for this World Cup, feel that they are welcome.

“We do not play a role necessarily in what is happening in terms of the decisions that are made. What we can say is that the current administration — while there are certain situations that we are watching, that we are certainly monitoring closely — has been extremely supportive of the World Cup.”

“It has to be recognized both now in the second term under President Trump — but also in the first term when President Trump was in power when the letters of intent were signed – how important FIFA World Cup is to elevating the nation and how important it is to sporting side. There is that understanding. I think we feel that that has been communicated to us at the federal level.

“We all share confidence in the fact that we're going to prepare our cities the best that we can. We allow for FIFA to continue having constructive conversations with the administration around visas, around workforce, around tourism, and that we will be prepared for whatever comes our way.”

Speaking to The Athletic, Jason Krutzsch, Vice President, Marketing & Communications for the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, said: “We're actively monitoring. It's all unfolding in real time.”

Asked to explain what monitoring actually entails, he added: “We're all learning about it right now just how it's all unfolding and we're gonna use the information and figure out how to work across all the cities to deliver the most exceptional experience that we can next year. Meg said it on the stage to just really focus on (the fact that) people are coming and we need to be prepared for that, and we're going to be prepared for whoever is wanting to come. Our markets will be prepared to welcome them with open arms and deliver an exceptional experience.”

Landon Donovan took aim at Christian Pulisic and the U.S. men's national team for missing out on this summer's Gold Cup. 

The USMNT legend was part of Fox's broadcast for the 2025 Nations League final that ended with Portugal stunning Spain in a penalty shootout. Emphatic celebrations unfolded at the Allianz Arena that had Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo in tears following the victory.

Donovan could not help but use the moment to highlight the passion on the pitch for Portugal compared to the lack thereof for the USMNT as of late.

“This is what it means to represent your country. This is what it means,” Donovan said postgame as pictures of an emotional Ronaldo played on the broadcast. “If you don't want to take this—as a professional soccer player, as someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey—seriously and responsibly, then don't come in.

“[Ronaldo's] 40 years old. He's played a long-a-- season. He's tired [and] he was out there grinding and hurt himself in the process. And I can help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in Gold Cup. It's pi----- me off,” Donovan ended.

Donovan's comments come just days after the USMNT announced its 2025 Gold Cup roster that featured notable absentees including Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Folarin Balogun, Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna are also missing out on the tournament to compete in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup with their respective teams.

The Gold Cup is the last true opportunity for the USMNT to participate in a competition before the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and Mauricio Pochettino will be without almost all of his best players. Pulisic, in particular, has come under fire for opting out of the competition to prioritize his rest and recovery after his career-best season for AC Milan.

Amid the recent criticism, McKennie jumped to Pulisic's defense.

“Obviously, none of us take for granted playing for the national team. None of us want to lose games,” McKennie told USA TODAY Sports. “All of us want to compete. And for me, it's a little bit, I won't say sad, but as a former national team player, I think as a national team player pool—previous, present—I think it's more about trying to build or even say something like that to a person directly rather than putting it out there.

“That's just my opinion because we've all been through those moments, even when comments about us losing the Nations League were made by many players from before, but they've had the same thing on a bigger stage with not qualifying for the World Cup.”

Pulisic's father, Mark, also posted a response on Instagram which his son liked further calling out Donovan via an AI chatbot's response. “This guy is talking about commitment,” the caption read. 

The USMNT is gearing up to play Sweden in its final international friendly of the month before kicking off the Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, June 15. Pochettino will hope the Stars and Stripes can snap their three-game losing streak ahead of the tournament, even without his superstars available.

International Football

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams will not play Tuesday night in Nashville against Switzerland due to precautions around a foot injury.

U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said Monday in a press conference that Adams would be rested in this friendly as the U.S. eyes his involvement in the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup.

“Tyler is out for tomorrow because he suffered a small issue in his foot,” Pochettino said. “But I think it's not a big issue. Hope it's not a big issue. I think we can manage it in a good way and rest it for a few days, and then see if he can be ready for the Gold Cup. That is why he's not going to be involved tomorrow.”

Adams played just the second half in Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Turkey, and after that appearance Pochettino said it had been a planned substitution due to the foot issue that Adams brought into camp from his Premier League season with Bournemouth.

Pochettino also said the U.S. team would be heavily rotated for its second friendly in four days. The U.S. is entering the match at GEODIS Park on the heels of its first three-game losing streak in 10 years.

“Preparing for the Gold Cup, I think it's good to make some changes now and to give the possibility to other players to play,” Pochettino said. “What I want to see tomorrow is to continue evolving the way that we started to play against Turkey. It's a continuation of this feeling. If we will get tomorrow after 90 minutes, the same feeling, I think the progression is there and I'm going to be happy. The result also is important. But I think now, with a lot of new players, for the first time and building a team for the Gold Cup, I think the focus is more in the process to improve than maybe the result. And of course, I think the Gold Cup is going to be both progression and results.”

Unused subs that could feature in this game include goalkeeper Matt Turner; center backs Walker Zimmerman and Tim Ream; fullback John Tolkin; midfielders Sebastian Berhalter, Brenden Aaronson and Paxten Aaronson; and forward Damion Downs.

The U.S. lost to Turkey on Saturday in Connecticut, but Pochettino was pleased with the effort and mindset his team played with against the world's 27th-ranked team, according to FIFA's table. Switzerland, No. 20, will provide another tough test for the U.S., coming off a 4-2 win over Mexico in Utah on Saturday.

Following the friendly, the U.S. will turn its attention to the Gold Cup, where it will open group play against Trinidad & Tobago in San Jose, Calif., on Sunday. Matches against guest nation Saudi Arabia and Haiti will follow, as the U.S. seeks to wrest back the continental title from Mexico. The two nations have alternated winning the competition for the last seven editions.

NWSL

The past few days in Cary, North Carolina have felt like a U.S. women's national team reunion, complete with slide tackles and a $1 million prize on the line. World Cup winners like Heather O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger and Hope Solo laced up once again, not just for nostalgia, but to satiate that ever-present hunger for competition and glory.

Their battleground was The Soccer Tournament (TST), a seven-a-side, winner-takes-all competition which is equal parts entertainment and sport. And for the second year in a row, it has become something of a post-retirement playground for the U.S. women's national team.

Starting last week, games were played on a smaller field with a fast-paced format designed for high-stakes and comebacks. The tournament featured rolling substitutions and target score time, meaning a game finishes on a final goal as opposed to when time ends. The target score is determined by adding one to the leading team's score after the full-time whistle and having teams compete to see who is the first to reach that total. As an added obstacle, a player from each team is removed from the field of play every three minutes until this target score is reached.

In its third year, 48 men's teams and 16 women's teams competed for a $1 million prize. It all comes down to the two finals on Monday night: reigning champions US Women play Bumpy Pitch FC Women at 7 and Bumpy Pitch FC (men) take on Pumas De Alabama at 8:30, streaming on ESPN+.

“This is our third year in the tournament,” O'Reilly, US Women founder and captain, told The Athletic. Chatting from her bed between two matches, in mid-recovery on Friday, she talked about the tournament's evolution. “Year one, we were the only all-women's team, got our butts kicked, but probably were fan favorites. That loss turned into something bigger and the following year we demanded a women's division and equal prize money.”

TST organizers first questioned the idea of paying women equal prize money, but O'Reilly pushed hard for it. The organizers said there was an ongoing discussion about the prize money and eventually agreed that equal pay was the only way to go.

“Don't even do it at all if you're not going to do it equally,” O'Reilly said.

O'Reilly is the driving force behind assembling the US Women team. She retired from professional soccer in 2019 but came back to fulfil her dream of playing the UEFA Champions League with Irish champions Shelbourne in the 2022-23 season. (Gotham FC also signed her as an Injury Replacement Player for a game in 2024.)  Though she shifted to coaching in her post-playing years, O'Reilly never stopped jumping to lunchtime pick-up games when she could. When she heard TST was taking place in her backyard, she knew she had to play.

Last year, she recruited her longtime friend Lloyd, who was pregnant at the time, to coach. But this year, after welcoming her daughter Harper in October, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year is back on the field, fit and focused. The 42-year-old scored the winning goal for the US Women on Friday to make it to the semifinals over the weekend.

Krieger is also on the squad. So are Allie Long, Amber Brooks, Cat Whitehill, Casey Loyd, Jill Loyden and Jo Lohman. Former USWNT midfielder and Bay FC co-founder Leslie Osborne is serving as an assistant coach, while Lori Lindsey is the team's general manager.

Solo entered her own team this year, Solo FC, falling to Ultrain FC in the quarterfinals. In that match, the former U.S. goalkeeper made a diving save reminiscent of those she made in World Cup and Olympic finals.

Knowing more opponents were joining the tournament this year, the US Women's preparation started early: Zoom calls, strategy sessions, and even custom workout plans were sent out weeks in advance.

“Every year, new teams come in better prepared,” O'Reilly said. “Some of these coaches know this format inside-out.”

This year, O'Reilly added a handful of younger legs too, including University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores, who scored the game winner for the USWNT U-23 team in Germany last month.

“You have to keep evolving, find those small margins. This game is different from 11-a-side,” O'Reilly said. “Last year we lost our first game, and it was a real wake-up call.”

When the US Women won the tournament in 2024, each player took home around $50,000, while coaching and staff took in about half of that. “That's not just gas money, that's tuition for kids' schools, a mortgage, real-life stuff,” O'Reilly said.

On Monday night, they will face off against Bumpy Pitch Women — a squad making its TST debut with a mix of former NWSL players like Ally Prisock, Katie Johnson, McCall Zerboni, as well as college talent, and European and Japanese pros — for the same $1 million prize.

From the start, the team's mission wasn't just to compete, it was to make a statement. They lobbied for equal prize money. They got it. Now they want more. “There's so much brand value here,” she said. “You've got U.S. legends, high-level soccer and an audience that's hungry. Sponsors should be lining up.”

Founded by TBT Enterprises, which also created The Basketball Tournament, TST has grown from a quirky offseason tournament into a potential model for a fast-paced version of soccer mostly consumed by younger fans. The tournament was unveiled in 2022 with 32 men's teams. TST added the women's tournament in 2024 and doubled the size of the women's side this year, expanding from eight to 16 teams after receiving more than 50 applications. The tournament signed a broadcast deal with ESPN and on the women's side, signed with RBC Wealth Management as the main sponsor.

Similar tournaments like the Kings and Queens League in Spain and World Sevens Football have followed in recent years. O'Reilly has had offers to play or coach in other tournaments, but for now, she is loyal to TST, a date she circles in her calendar every year.

“For me, TST is kind of the one time of the year, our annual time to get the band together,” she said. “I wasn't expecting TST to even be in my life, and now it is. We'll see what the future brings. But it is an interesting idea. I think a lot of people are thinking, maybe this is the future of the sport in some way and that's amazing.”

The USMNT is a mess, and Landon Donovan isn't happy about it.

Remember all the excitement and momentum the U.S. men's national team seemed to grab when it hired Mauricio Pochettino as manager in September 2024 with the 2026 World Cup fast approaching? Yeah, neither do we.

With a slow start featuring disappointing results in Pochettino's young tenure in the U.S., it certainly feels like the USMNT is heading in one direction, and it's not a positive one.

The latest chapter of the ongoing not-so-upbeat story involves arguably the greatest USMNT player of all time in Landon Donovan, Christian Pulisic, who is the biggest star in U.S. soccer history, and the latter's father, Mark Pulisic.

Over the weekend, the USMNT fell 2-1 to Turkey in a lead-up match to the Gold Cup. It was a match that didn't really matter, especially when the squad's core group of Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Tim Weah, and Pulisic aren't on the 26-man roster and don't plan to be in the immediate future for various reasons.

Landon Donovan Calls Out USMNT After Pathetic Performances Against Panama, Canada

Dest and Robinson are rehabbing significant knee injuries, but Pulisic is skipping out on international duty due to fatigue from a very busy schedule with AC Milan. The face of U.S. soccer choosing to not represent his country is a tough look in general, but even more so with the 2026 World Cup being hosted in North America in just over a year's time.

It's an opportunity for Pulisic and others to build momentum ahead of the biggest soccer event in the history of the United States. Most realize that, but maybe no one more than Donovan, who let his feelings be heard during FOX Sports' UEFA Nations League Final broadcast over the weekend.

"This is what it means to represent your country," Donovan said after Portugal beat Spain in penalties. 

"This is what it means. And if you don't want to take this as a professional soccer player, as someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in. This is what it means. (Cristiano Ronaldo)'s 40 years old, and he's played a long ass season. He's tired. He's out there grinding. Hurt himself in the process, and I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off."

Donovan did not name any names, but it was undoubtedly a not-so-subtle jab at Pulisic and the like.

To be fair, Pulisic opting out of playing in the underwhelming Gold Cup that the USMNT typically takes rather lightly would not be as big of a deal if it weren't months out from the 2026 World Cup. Again, this is a momentum and excitement-building stage, yet Pulisic is nowhere to be found.

Nevertheless, Pulisic's father, Mark, brought up some old receipts about Donovan thanks to an assist from ChatGPT.

Mark asked ChatGPT why Donovan took a sabbatical from the sport altogether at the end of 2012 through March 2013. He posted a screenshot on Instagram highlighting the fact that Donovan took his break due to fatigue as well, and the post was liked by Christian.

It's easy to see Mark Pulisic's logic here as he's blatantly calling Donovan a hypocrite, but Donovan was already a more-than-proven player on the International stage with more than 10 years representing the red, white, and blue on his resume.

Pulisic is already a far more proven player than Donovan ever was from a club performance perspective, but representing your country and playing for a top team in Italy are two different things, especially with a World Cup on North American soil about a year away.

Donovan, whether you think it's his place or not to do so, is trying to spark some sort of fire within this USMNT, which should be welcomed by all, given the non-existent history U.S. men's soccer has.

Group L qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continues Monday with a key clash between Croatia and Czechia.

Czechia currently sits atop the group with a perfect record, three wins from three matches. Croatia, which joined qualifying later due to UEFA Nations League obligations, has played just once so far but made a strong statement with a dominant victory. With Montenegro (currently in second place) idle this matchday, a win on Monday would allow Croatia to jump into second and tighten the race at the top.

Czechia has dominated so far. It opened play with a surprisingly close 2-1 win over the Faroe Islands, needing a late goal from Patrik Schick to secure the victory. Since then, they've found their rhythm, cruising past Gibraltar 4-0 and controlling the match in a 2-0 win over Montenegro on June 6.

Croatia, which didn't play in the first window due to UEFA Nations League commitments, finally joined the qualifiers earlier this week and made an immediate impact with a dominant 7-0 win over Gibraltar. Five of those goals came in the second half, as Gibraltar simply couldn't hold off Croatia's relentless attack.

For Croatia, it's about building momentum toward another deep World Cup run, after all, they finished second in 2018 and third in 2022. Czechia, on the other hand, is looking to return to the World Cup stage for the first time since 2006 and solidify its resurgence on the international scene.

Group J qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continues Monday when Belgium takes on Wales in a key battle for the UEFA spots in the 2026 World Cup.

Wales currently leads the group with seven points, having won two matches and drawn one from its first three games. Belgium, meanwhile, has only played once so far, a draw, after missing the first qualifying window due to its participation in the UEFA Nations League.

That leaves Belgium in fourth place with one point, but with games in hand and plenty of time to climb the table. A win on Monday, for example, would put them just one point behind second-place North Macedonia.

Wales opened group play with a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan, then followed that up by drawing 1-1 with North Macedonia in a strange game that was scoreless when the 90th minute arrived. This week, the team beat Liechtenstein 3-0 to assert itself as the top team in the group.

As for Belgium, the team's lone game in qualifying play was on June 6 against North Macedonia. The team led until the final minutes thanks to a Maxim De Cuyper goal, but North Macedonia just managed to squeeze in a tying goal.

Belgium is aiming to qualify for its fourth straight World Cup, continuing a run that began in 2014. Meanwhile, Wales is on course to reach its second consecutive World Cup, something the nation has never accomplished before.

We're now a year-ish from the World Cup. The tournament is still dominated by European and South American teams. But which continent without a winner (Asia, Africa, Central and North America and, I guess, Oceania) has the best chance of lifting the trophy first?

– Stacey

This is a fascinating question and one that brings a wide range of factors into play. To start, what difference will the expansion of the tournament make? On one hand, extending the tournament so the winner will have to get through eight games rather than seven probably makes shocks less likely, but on the other hand an extra knockout round adds another layer of randomness. Even with four knockout rounds, most champions usually had at least one game of significant jeopardy – a win on penalties, or an edgy one-goal victory after extra-time. Winning all five knockout games in 90 minutes, I suspect, will prove extremely rare but the likelihood is still that the winner will be one of the major European powers – France, Spain, Germany, England, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands – or one of the big two from South America – Argentina and Brazil.

On a similar note, weight of numbers should help the other confederations: 15 of the 32 qualifiers in 2022 were from outside Uefa and Conmebol; in 2026 either 25 or 26 of 48 will be. That should increase the chance of a side hitting a run of exceptional form at the right time.

But this isn't just about confederations. Between 2006 and 2018, 13 of 16 semi-finalists in the World Cup were European. There was a clear sense within the game that the major western European nations had in effect industrialised youth production – to the extent that the majority of, say, Morocco's squad in 2022, had been trained in France. Add a wealthy league in which the best of a nation's youth can gain an exceptional and immediate education and the advantage enjoyed by western Europe is clear. Argentina bucked that trend in 2022, in part because of the brilliance of Lionel Messi, and in part because of its remarkable reserves of coaching talent (seven of the 10 Conmebol nations are managed by Argentinians, and that's without counting Óscar Ibáñez, who was born in Argentina but played for and now manages Peru).

But to return to the specifics of the question: money helps, so the USA, Mexico and Canada have at least a slim chance of success. Africa has the talent but its football – and this is obviously a generalisation – is beset by poverty and corruption. Morocco showed their capacity in Qatar, and if, say, Nigeria or Senegal managed to find an enlightened coach who could bypass all the political issues at the same time they had a gifted generation, there's no reason there couldn't be an African winner – although it doesn't feel imminent.

Asia, perhaps, is most likely, although we're probably only talking about three countries at the moment. Japan and South Korea have been regular World Cup qualifiers, their level has improved dramatically, there is money to invest, a deep-rooted passion for the game, and their players are increasingly gaining experience at the best clubs.

Or there's Saudi Arabia, a traditional power in the Asian game, and hosts in 2034. We're yet to see what impact all the Saudi PIF's investment in football will have, but money, a political will to succeed, an improving league must give them at least an outside chance with home advantage in eight years.

As an American, I defy anyone to argue the 1994 World Cup jersey is not the best in soccer history. Do you have any personal favorites? 
   – Matt

I confess I find the fetishisation of shirts a little odd. I hate over-fussy shirts, and I wish Sunderland would go back to black socks, but I'm not sure there are any shirts I really love. I was talking to a friend about this on the way to the Championship play-off final, looking at the masses of red-and-white all around while we were both wearing very neutral check shirts. We wondered whether it's because in our formative years of going to games, away games especially, in the late 80s and early 90s, it was useful to be able to blend into the background if any violence kicked off.

But I suppose if pressed, I always quite liked the simple Adidas, early 80s, plain colour with three stripes along the sleeves – the pale-blue West Germany goalkeeper's top in particular.

What will predominate: the next tactical evolution, or the rise of the nation-state owner in European and English football?

– Andrew

I don't think you can separate the two. Ownership, whether state or otherwise, necessarily creates the conditions in which the game is played. So Pep Guardiola, for instance, was in effect asked to devise his ideal environment at Manchester City, and the result was six league titles in seven seasons. City's owners had the financial might to attract him to the club, to give him the facilities he needed and to provide an extremely high-level squad. As a result, there was little need to compromise on his principles as a manager at a less wealthy club might have had to.

Or take Paris Saint-Germain. Coach after coach was undermined by the club's insistence on signing major stars, which may have been good for the brand, but left the team on the pitch looking distinctly unbalanced. Once the club changed approach, Luis Enrique was able to put together the side that won the Champions League. What was necessary was the money to buy a squad good enough, but also owners prepared to let a sporting director and manager put together a coherent side free from the egos of the celebrities they had previously been burdened with.

It's probably my age – I've watched football for nearly 70 years – but I really miss old-fashioned wingers, playing on the “correct” wing, beating their defender on the outside and providing crosses for their fellow attackers. The case for inverted wingers seems to be that coming “inside” on to their stronger foot increases their chances of shooting and scoring. It's now de rigueur for wingers to be inverted. Does the likelihood of inverted wingers scoring goals by coming inside really compensate for the fewer effective crosses they make for their fellow attackers?

I agree that there remains something aesthetically very pleasing about a centre-forward meeting an outswinging cross with a header – Alexander Isak's goal from Anthony Gordon's cross for Newcastle against Arsenal last season, for instance – but I suspect that ship has sailed.

Herbert Chapman was arguing that a focus on wingers crossing for forwards was inefficient 100 years ago, and most modern theory seems to agree with him. The preference now is either for wide players cutting infield – Peter Taylor was a pioneer in England, but Dennis Tueart and others did it as well – or to work the ball to the goalline for a low cutback – the classic Manchester City goal of a couple of seasons ago.

One of the reasons wide forwards now cut inside is the explosion in attacking full-backs, who now provide most of the width. A full-back could go inside, as say Trent Alexander-Arnold or João Cancelo do, but that is relatively rare and if the full-back is going on the outside, the wide forward has go inside to create space for him. I think there's also a recognition that forwards cutting in, often against the defender's weaker foot, is very hard to combat – hence the rise in the sort of goal Lamine Yamal seems to score every week, whipping the ball into the far corner.

Kevin Keegan was perhaps the first English player, certainly in the postwar years, to make a success of a move to a European giant. He left Liverpool in 1977 for Hamburg, where he won the league in 1978-79 and was twice named European Footballer of the Year. He also marketed himself with an eagerness unusual in English players of the time, becoming a bona fide celebrity. And, on 9 June 1979, he released his second, but by some distance his most successful single, Head Over Heels in Love.

His first single, It Ain't Easy, had been released in 1972, just a year after he'd moved to Liverpool from Scunthorpe and made very little impression. But Head Over Heels reached No 31 in the UK charts, and No 10 in Germany. And this is where those of a nervous disposition should look away. Keegan gave a preview of the song on Das Aktuelle Sport-Studio. His German seems very good, but that thought soon fades as he gets to the performance …

Landon Donovan's latest criticism of Christian Pulisic appears to have hit a nerve within the AC Milan star's family, with his dad Mark now having come out swinging.

U.S. Men's National Team legend Donovan called out “players who chose to skip the Gold Cup,” with Christian being the highest profile player to have done so, during FOX Sports' broadcast of Portugal's recent Nations League Final triumph over Spain.

After Cristiano Ronaldo helped his side secure the title on penalties following a 2-2 draw, Donovan cited the former Real Madrid star's passion as an example of what he felt was missing from the current USMNT, which lost 2-1 to Turkey on Saturday.

"This is what it means to represent your country," Donovan said. "And if you don't want to take this, as a professional soccer player and someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in.

"This is what it means. He's (Ronaldo) 40 years old, he played a long a-- season, he was out there grinding and hurt himself in the process. And I can't help but think about some of our (USMNT) guys on vacation right now not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's p------ me off."

While Donovan may not have named Christian, he has previously been critical of the Milan midfielder's request for a summer break, and it seems clear this latest dig was likely at least partially aimed at the 26-year-old.

But it appears that Christian's inner circle has heard enough, with his dad Mark having taken to social media to fire back at Donovan. In a post on Instagram, he shared a screenshot seemingly asking an AI chat why Donovan previously took a sabbatical, seemingly in reference to his break from international soccer in early 2013.

“Landon Donovan took his sabbatical because he was feeling both physically and mentally exhausted after years of intense competition and the pressure that comes with being a top athlete,” the response read.

“He'd been playing professionally from a young age and had participated in multiple World Cups, so he felt the need to step back and take some time for himself. This break allowed him to rest, travel, and ultimately return to the game with a refreshed mindset.”

Mark captioned this screenshot, “This guy is .. talking about commitment.. look in the mirror + grow a pair and call names out or are you afraid next time you want an interview you will get rejected again.” What's more, Christian then appeared to ‘like' the post.

As for Donovan, he recently opened up on his Unfiltered Soccer podcast, which he co-hosts with Tim Howard, on exactly what drove his decision to take a break in 2013, admitting that he was close to a “breakdown.”

“I got in 2013, I had played probably 14 straight years of 11 plus months of soccer. 40-plus games a year,” he said. “And I don't, I have never said this publicly, but I was on the verge, and I think I've mentioned this to you, I was on the verge of a real breakdown where it could have got scary for me.”

The 23rd edition of the FIFA Men's World Cup is already in the making. But before that, comes the Club World Cup, which should not be confused with the old, regular World Cup. Here's what you need to know?

The World Cup is in 2026. The global tournament is set to run from June 11 through July 19, 2026.

The Club World Cup is a tournament between the best private soccer teams in the world. Unlike the World Cup, players in this tournament don't represent the country they are from, but rather the teams they are part of.

The Club World Cup is relatively new. It debuted in 2000, and then resumed in 2005 to be held annually until 2023. After the seven-team structure in 2023, the tournament switched to a quadrennial format starting this year.

The 32-team FIFA Club World Cup is scheduled to run from June 14 to July 13, 2025, across various cities in the United States.

Streaming platform DAZN is partnering with FIFA and will be offering all 63 matches of the tournament for free.

The final match will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Yes, Argentinian legend Lionel Messi is set to play in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup as a member of the Inter Miami CF team, one of the two American teams that qualified for the Club World Cup along with the Seattle Sounders.Here's the initial schedule for Messi:

June 14: vs. Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami – 8:00 p.m. ET

June 19: vs. FC Porto at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta – 3:00 p.m. ET

June 23: vs. Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami – 9:00 p.m. ET

It's a new week, which means new drama for the U.S. men's national team. And this time, Christian Pulisic's father, Mark, is getting involved.

In the wake of the USMNT star's absence from the Gold Cup roster, Pulisic has been subjected to criticism from all sides of the U.S. soccer community. Pulisic — who was coming off a career year at AC Milan — had asked head coach Mauricio Pochettino to leave him off the Gold Cup roster in order to rest and recover this summer.

Yet, the Gold Cup represents the final competitive tournament the USMNT will have before next year's World Cup. It is also the last remaining extended training camp together. And with a new coach trying to implement his system, it was a terrible look for Pulisic to ask for it off.

On Sunday, Landon Donovan watched as a 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo helped lead Portugal to a UEFA Nations League title — a newer tournament with little prestige relative to other UEFA events. But the fact that the top Spain and Portugal players were willing to play for their national teams in that when USMNT players opted to skip the Gold Cup — well, it had Donovan frustrated.

Donovan said of Ronaldo:

"He's tired. He's out there grinding. Hurt himself in the process, and I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

It was an obvious swipe at Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Antonee Robinson who all are skipping the Gold Cup without injuries or Club World Cup obligations. Mark Pulisic saw those comments, and he put together the most Soccer Dad response.

In an Instagram post of a ChatGPT screenshot, Mark asked for information about Donovan's sabbatical in 2012. The post was liked by Christian as well.

Back then, Donovan wanted time away from the game to focus on his mental health. He had already played a major role in three World Cup runs for the USMNT, but then-head coach Jurgen Klinsmann held the absence against Donovan and left him off the 2014 World Cup roster.

Donovan notably did not skip out on his team during the last competitive opportunity before a World Cup. He took part in World Cup qualifying matches in the lead-up to 2014 and participated in the 2013 Gold Cup. He was on the final squad for friendlies before the shocking revelation that he was left off the roster heading to Brazil.

Pulisic's situation is entirely different, and it was yet another poor display from a USMNT parent to use the sabbatical against Donovan.

And judging from the "like," Christian doesn't recognize that difference either.

It's non-stop. Real Madrid continue their season into June and July, without much rest, and a ton of injuries still lingering.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

These observations — where I look at Real Madrid's history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. All previous editions can be found here.





There is more football now than ever — with seemingly no end in sight. If anything, the number of games will increase before they decrease.

This season is unprecedented. Two additional Champions League games were added to the slate, and four if you were seeded into the playoff zones after the group stage. The first ever Club World Cup this summer will see 32 teams meet in the USA for more gruelling games — nearly one month of football — and for the bigger teams like Real Madrid, a likely long stay on US soil as the team progresses beyond the initial three games.

It's unclear what pre-season looks like after the Club World Cup, especially for teams that make it far in the tournament. The Premier League has rejected a request from teams to delay the start of next season in order to incorporate more rest and preparation. 

Per club sources, Real Madrid will not plan any pre-season games after the Club World Cup, stating “there is no time.” 

(There is a small chance this could change, but it's unlikely, and in the club's words, “it's too difficult”).

By Spring time every year, the pre-season schedule is made public. The Club World Cup is in a weird twilight zone — almost an extension of the current season rather than the start of a new one. The tournament wraps up mid-July, which is usually long before any pre-season even begins.

Part of scrapping pre-season games may come down to how seriously Real Madrid, and, other teams, will take the Club World Cup. What is seen as an annoying ‘extra' tournament, will likely go down as a big success, despite our complaints about the unnecessary amount of football on the calendar. There won't be any significant sporting events the tournament will be competing with for eyeballs. Every team will try to win. There is real prize money involved. Beyond money, there is real drive within Real Madrid to be the first-ever winners of the competition, setting the tone for it to be ‘their's' — much like the Champions League is.

If Real Madrid bounce from the tournament early (unlikely if they bring their A-team and A-game against inferior teams on paper), the club may arrange some last minute pre-season games, probably behind closed doors, within Spain before the season starts to get the blood pumping again before the 2025 - 2026 season gets underway. It will be a far-cry from pre-arranged tournaments with advanced ticket sales.

But the whole scenario does raise concerns about everyone's preparation for the following season. Last summer, most of Real Madrid's team barely had a pre-season, and some didn't have one at all. Last pre-season in the USA, during the Soccer Champions Tour, Real Madrid filled their team sheets with Castilla players. 

Nothing wrong with that — in fact it's welcome. But the South American stars joined late after Copa America, as did the Europeans after the Euros. Some, like Mbappe, didn't join at all. The team came out of the gates slow, unpolished, and without ample time to integrate Mbappe. Match fitness was lacking.

The introduction of the Club World Cup now adds something extra on ‘off years' where the are no international tournaments. Don't be surprised if the remaining rare summers where nothing is planned, FIFA or UEFA will eventually figure out a way to add something — introducing a revolving tournament every summer. 

What is the solution? FIFA or UEFA could work with teams to decrease games, but there is too much money involved, and the financial implications of gutting games from the calendar don't reflect well on the bottom line for executives higher up (and ‘smaller clubs' are generally ok with so many games that reward them financially. They need the money and relevancy more than big clubs do). Taking games off the slate means they'd likely have to charge more for remaining games. Offering / securing bigger TV deals to compensate for less games will likely mean the consumer will pay more for their package.

FIFA will also argue and urge clubs to use the money to build more depth and rotate more to combat more games. Fine. But are bigger squads, a dilution of stars, more games, and just a higher quantity of everything actually good for the sport overall? Does more quantity decrease the quality? 

It's impossible not to bring up the main argument against the overwhelming football schedule: deteriorating health. Football is heading into uncharted territory when it comes to dealing with such an astronomical number of ACL injuries.

In February, The Athletic reported that the number of ACL injuries has skyrocketed in the last decade, and, that this season was the worst in Premier League history:

“The average number (of ACL injuries) across the six seasons between 2017-18 and 2022-23 is just 6.3; between 2012-13 (when Premier Injuries' data collection began) and 2016-17, the average was 10.4,” Elias Burke of The Athletic wrote. “As it stands, the Premier League is on track to end the campaign with 13.” 

More games, more fatigue, and less time to recover can contribute to the rise of season-ending blows.

No one knows this better than Real Madrid. When Real Madrid lost all three of Eder Militao, David Alaba, and Thibaut Courtois early in the 2023 - 2024 season, Carlo Ancelotti said it was “unprecedented” in his coaching career. This season alone, Real Madrid lost Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao (again), and Joan Martinez to ACL tears. Fielding any sort of ‘Once de Gala' — especially over a the course of more than a couple games — has proven to be impossible in the last couple years.

Xabi Alonso won't have that luxury for months, literally. He will be without several important players due to injury this Club World Cup. Even if everyone returns before the season starts, Alonso will lose Jude Bellingham as the Englishman recovers from shoulder surgery. If we're lucky, we'll see Alonso's best XI sometime before Christmas. 

(The club has placed a big bet on winning the Club World Cup by delaying Bellingham's shoulder surgery. One realistic option was to shut him down the day after the league Clasico loss in May. Speaking to club sources over the past year, there was always a dilemma on how to deal with Bellingham's surgery. The moment he goes under the knife, there's a 2-3 month recovery process. He could potentially avoid the surgery altogether and play through the pain with a shoulder strap, but it affects his mobility and performance greatly. Had the surgery been done in May, he would've been back for the start of next season. Real Madrid's first three games in the Club World Cup are against teams they should beat with or without Bellingham — so really they're prioritizing a handful of knockout games over 10-12 La Liga games next season.)





“Constantly adding international matches and competitions has broken the calendar,” Jerome Perlemuter, General Secretary at World Leagues Association said in September. “We only have 365 days in a year, which means very simply that if you keep adding matches, at some point there is no more space – national leagues cannot organise their competitions properly anymore and players pay for it with injuries.”

This is one of those seemingly unfixable problems. If it was up to one league, one regime, you could enforce reform. But it's almost impossible with so many hands in the pot: FIFA, UEFA, Leagues, Federations — they all have their own set of fixtures they want to vomit on the calendar in return for financial gains. You'd have to almost erase everything and start the sport from scratch, or bring everyone together to consult on a unified solution — something difficult to do.

“It's important to remember FIFA organize about only 1% of the footballing calendar,” a spokesperson from FIFA told me for this story. “We are always looking at ways to work with teams and players and have conversations about maximizing players' health.”

FIFA feels most of the blame of the overwhelming football calendar, and the major injuries that come with it, are not down to them — but others.

“Some leagues in Europe — themselves competition organisers and regulators — are acting with commercial self-interest, hypocrisy, and without consideration to everyone else in the world,” FIFA said in July of 2024 in a statement in reply to FIFPro and 37 European Leagues jointly filed an antitrust complaint against FIFA. “Those leagues apparently prefer a calendar filled with friendlies and summer tours, often involving extensive global travel.”

But others argue that FIFA can still step in to regulate, and, unlike UEFA, have taken an authoritative, rather than collaborative approach.

“The problem of the overloaded calendar is not caused by league competitions, but by FIFA, with its new format and duration of the tournaments, and by UEFA with the Nations League and the new UEFA club competitions with the increased number of dates and games,” Luigi De Siervo, Serie A Chief Exeuctive said. “But the difference is that UEFA had a strong consultation with all the stakeholders — leagues included — and decided on a reform in the format of club competitions after a long discussion.

“FIFA imposed their new format and competitions without any discussion, consultation and without accepting to have any form of relationship with the other competitions organisers.”

You will never have a perfect solution to keep everyone happy. Smaller teams don't have the same complaints about their stars being worked into the ground, nor can they afford to say no to additional games. Bigger teams always ask for the biggest slice of the pie because of the marketability they bring to the table. League and Federation executives just want more of everything, namely: games and money.

Could European football adapt an NFL model? The NFL has a short blitz of games (17 games, around five months), and generates an astronomical amount of money. In 2023, the NFL generated $18.7 billion in revenue — far and away the most of any major North American sports league, as well as European football as a whole. They bring in a considerable amount through TV deals. The demand from loyal consumers is high. The NFL generates more than FIFA and the Premier League combined.

Real Madrid's pre-season planning dilemma won't be unique to them alone. Every team will have to endure the grind. PSG and Inter, the two Champions League Finalists Real Madrid may have to go through to win this summer's tournament, just finished their season May 31st. Inter are on their last lungs. PSG had nine players featuring in the UEFA Nations League Semi-finals, to varying degrees.

But as things stand, despite all the struggles in maintaining squad health amid a wild calendar, there is some optimism with regards to the squad heading to the USA this Saturday. Eder Militao, Dani Carvajal, and David Alaba completed part of the training in Xabi Alonso's first session as a Real Madrid manager. Antonio Rüdiger is making a push to return in time — though things look more grim for Eduardo Camavinga as of now. 

But Alonso will have time to train with the stars and most of the squad before the first game kicks off in Miami against Al-Hilal on June 18th. Real Madrid should have enough in the tank to win their first three games. Things will get really interesting once they get past those fixtures. If I had to guess, and this is a wild prediction based on the groups and potential seedings, Real Madrid could play Juventus in the round-of-16, River Plate in the quarter-finals, Chelsea in the semi-finals, and PSG in the final. (Don't quote me on this, but the bracket could shake-out this way or not, football is wildly unpredictable — regardless of the path, it's going to be fun if Real Madrid keep advancing.)

Once Real Madrid return from the USA — and we are far away from knowing the timeline or the state of the team at that time — Alonso will have a unique situation where he has a month plus change to work with his squad in training, with no pre-season games, before the 2025 - 2026 season kicks off.

Doja Cat, Tems and J Balvin will headline the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup Final Halftime Show, with the sports organization and Global Citizen announcing Monday (June 9) that the three musicians will take the stage for one of the most-watched sporting events on Earth.

This year's final will take place July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with the halftime show set to air live in a free broadcast on DAZN.com. The lineup was personally curated by Chris Martin of Coldplay to benefit FIFA Global Citizen's Education Fund, which launched in April with a mission to raise $100 million for children's education and soccer programs all over the world.

“From Medellín to MetLife — I'm honored to headline the first-ever halftime show of the FIFA Club World Cup final,” Balvin said in a statement. “It's a historic moment — for me, for Latin culture and for every kid who dreams big.”

Tems added, “We're going to bring the world together for a beautiful moment — to celebrate football, feel the unity that music brings and improve the lives of millions of children through the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund.”

The lineup reveal comes a couple of months after it was first announced that Martin would be spearheading the Super Bowl halftime show-esque concert, building on his history as the Global Citizen Festival's international curator. The nonprofit organization is producing the show in partnership with Live Nation, Done+Dusted and DPS.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino previously teased that the production would be the “best halftime show ever.”

“We're thinking big,” he added in a March interview with FOX 5. “We'll have 2 billion viewers from every corner of the world. It's like 20 times the Super Bowl. So, we are very excited about that. You have to watch it — that's the surprise. It will be global, different languages, different countries.”

Music superstars J Balvin, Doja Cat and Tems will perform a half-time show at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey next month, as football follows the example of the Super Bowl.

Colombian singer Balvin, US rapper Doja Cat and Nigerian star Tems will cram their performances into the 15-minute half-time break.

The line-up has been curated by Coldplay's Chris Martin, and the event will hope to emulate the success of the long-running Super Bowl half-time show, which has featured stars including Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna and The Weeknd in recent years.

Teams including Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain will take part in the tournament across the US from 15 June to 13 July.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: "This show will be unforgettable - not just for its spectacle on a landmark night, but also for the lasting impact it will make."

Previously an annual tournament contested by seven teams, the Club World Cup has been expanded to 32 teams and is aiming for an increased global profile.

Superstar player Lionel Messi will take part for US team Inter Miami, although the team's participation has raised some eyebrows.

There will be no Cristiano Ronaldo, though, who has declined offers to play for various teams. The 40-year-old is out of contract with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr at the end of June.

A war of words appears to have erupted on social media between former U.S. Men's National Team forward Taylor Twellman and team legend Landon Donovan, in the wake of the latter's latest criticism of the current generation of stars.

The USMNT's 2-1 friendly loss to Turkey on Saturday, their third in a row under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, clearly left a sour taste in Donovan's mouth. During later coverage of Portugal's dramatic Nations League Final win over Spain, Donovan pointed to the dedication and fight of Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. as something he felt the USMNT was missing.

"This is what it means to represent your country," he said on FOX Sports. "And if you don't want to take this, as a professional soccer player and someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in.

"This is what it means. He's (Ronaldo) 40 years old, he played a long a-- season, he was out there grinding and hurt himself in the process. And I can't help but think about some of our (USMNT) guys on vacation right now not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's p------ me off."

While Donovan abstained from naming specific players he took issue with, it seems highly likely he was referring, at the very least, to Christian Pulisic, who is absent from the USMNT's summer roster as per his request for a break. Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Yunus Musah was also made unavailable for selection for unspecified personal reasons, while Fulham's Antonee Robinson was also made unavailable and has since undergone minor surgery.

Donovan's on-air comments went down poorly with his former USMNT teammate turned broadcaster Taylor Twellman, who subsequently took to social media to criticize the LA Galaxy legend.

“While I agree with a lot of what Landon Donovan said about playing for your country, we can't forget that his “sabbatical” during WCQ nonetheless led to him being left off the World Cup roster in 2014,” he wrote, including a link to an article which covered former USMNT boss Jurgen Klinsmann's comments on Donovan's costly absence.

“He needed a break and Klinsmann didn't forget. Many at the time were wondering why and how was this happening in the moment. But it did. I gave LD the benefit of the doubt as I will with the current players….”

Twellman's comments, which Donovan has yet to respond to, came shortly after the four-time MLS Cup winner admitted when speaking with fellow ex-international Tim Howard that his break from USMNT soccer came at a point in life where he was close to suffering a mental breakdown.

“I got in 2013, I had played probably 14 straight years of 11 plus months of soccer. 40-plus games a year. And I don't, I've have never said this publicly, but I was on the verge, and I think I've mentioned this to you, I was on the verge of a real breakdown where it could have got scary for me,” Donovan explained on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast, when prefacing his criticism of Pulisic's absence.

Donovan went on to add that should there be serious issues behind the scenes for any missing players, such as Pulisic, he sympathised. However, as there was no evidence to suggest this was the case, he added, “I'm going to assume for sake of this conversation, that's not going on, but I am admitting I could be wrong with that.”

He then went on to criticize Pulisic for requesting a break whilst simultaneously continuing to play for Milan in what was a largely meaningless season-ending game.

U.S. Men's National Team standout Weston McKennie defended teammate Christian Pulisic on Monday after Landon Donovan made indirect comments toward the current captain.

While commentating Portugal's celebration after the team won the UEFA Nations League final Sunday on Fox Sports, Donovan said, “This is what it means to represent your country. … I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

While Donovan didn't name Pulisic, it's clear the former USMNT captain was referring to the latest one. Pulisic decided to take the summer off after two straight 50-match seasons with AC Milan instead of joining the national team for the Concacaf Gold Cup later this month. Donovan, himself, also took a brief sabbatical from the team in 2013.

“Obviously, none of us take for granted playing for the national team. None of us want to lose games," McKennie told USA TODAY Sports on Monday, from Juventus headquarters in Italy preparing for the Club World Cup. "All of us want to compete. And for me, it's a little bit, I won't say sad, but as a former national team player, I think as a national team player pool – previous, present – I think it's more about trying to build or even say something like that to a person directly rather than putting it out there.

“That's just my opinion because we've all been through those moments, even when comments about us losing the Nations League were made by many players from before, but they've had the same thing on a bigger stage with not qualifying for the World Cup.”

McKennie is also not participating with the USMNT this summer to help Juventus compete in the FIFA Club World Cup. Juventus is in Group G of the tournament and will play Al Ain (United Arab Emirates) on June 18 in Washington D.C., Wydad AC (Morrocco) on June 22 in Philadelphia, and Manchester City (England) on June 26 in Orlando during the group stage.

Still, McKennie is keeping an eye on his teammates with the national team led by new coach Mauricio Pochettino.

The USMNT lost a friendly to Turkey 2-1 on June 7 in East Hartford, Connecticut. The Americans will play Trinidad and Tobago on June 15, Saudi Arabia on June 19 and Haiti on June 22 in the group stage of the Gold Cup.

McKennie believes the USMNT has a good group of players who are ambitious with room to grow before World Cup 2026, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. He believes the team needs to find its identity by practicing in a competitive environment.

“You fight for each other. You run for each other. You sacrifice for each other,” McKennie said. “I think with the group that we have and some of the players that have been there a little bit longer, including myself, need to start not thinking that we're young anymore. We're veterans on the team, and we need to start acting like that. And take control.

"And show the way, and show the culture that the U.S. men's national team has presented before because we've always been known as a country to fight, never give up, maybe not have been the best talented-wise. But now we have a lot more talent. And so now, we just need to add that grit and grind, and competitive nature back into the system.”

As for Donovan's comments, McKennie sided with Pulisic while reiterating their desire to suit up for the national team because of its significance.

“No names were named,” McKennie said. “Coming off a long season, a stressful season, obviously, some players feel a different way about it, and some players feel another way. But the comments are comments. Everyone has their own opinions, and that's life, and that's football.

“Obviously, like I said before, none of us take for granted that we get to represent a national team because it's one of the biggest honors that we can have in the sport of football. ...

“So, any chance that we get, we want to play. But obviously, if you don't feel like your body is in the right condition, and you don't feel like your body is in the best form or shape or whatever, to be able to do that at 100%, and you feel like you're risking injury, then it's better to let someone else go in that is completely 100%.”

CARY, N.C. – Star power will be on display in The Soccer Tournament's women's and men's championship games, where $2 million total will be up for grabs in a doubleheader on Monday, June 9, at WakeMed Soccer Park.

Both the men's and women's championship can be seen live on ESPNU as well as ESPN+.

The second annual $1 million women's bracket championship will see US Women, led by former U.S. national team stars Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger, and Heather O'Reilly face off against Bumpy Pitch FC at 7:00 p.m. ET. The men's championship between Bumpy Pitch FC and Pumas de Alabama will follow at 8:30 p.m. Both matches can be seen live on ESPNU and ESPN+.

Looking to defend their 2024 women's tournament title, US Women have reloaded with more U.S. women's national team stars, and five current players from the University of North Carolina. After joining the US Women staff in 2024, Carli Lloyd decided to lace up the boots this year, making her first competitive appearance since retiring in 2021. Lloyd has scored two goals in five games, including the game-winner in Target Score Time against Streetball FC Canada in the quarterfinals.

Bumpy Pitch FC is the first team in TST history to have a men's and a women's team advance to the $1 Million Championship game.

Bumpy Pitch's women's roster features a number of collegiate stars, including players from Florida State University, Stanford University, and other top universities.

On the men's side, the lifestyle brand has assembled a squad of Major Arena Soccer League players, and is led by Cristian Martinez Borja, the Colombian who leads the race for the TST Golden Boot.

Bumpy Pitch FC's opponent in the men's championship, Pumas de Alabama, is a rising force in the U.S. amateur soccer scene. Their roster features a number of players from 2024 TST Champions La Bombonera.

In June 2025, TikTok users claimed FIFA, the international soccer governing body, decided to relocate scheduled U.S.-hosted 2026 World Cup matches to Mexico or Canada — countries that are already hosting some matches. According to social media users' posts and videos, this consideration followed FIFA receiving thousands of complaints from players, coaches and fans who refused to travel to the U.S. due to concerns over stringent immigration policies imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.

For example, in early June, a TikTok user published a video (archived) announcing FIFA decided to no longer allow the U.S. to host World Cup matches in 2026. The clip received over 1.5 million views.

The clip's narrator recounted the story as follows:

FIFA has decided to hold the World Cup in 2026, and it will not be held in the United States. FIFA has decided to take away the United States' qualification as the host country of the cup, and the responsibility directly lies with President Trump. The organization is facing a major mechanical problem after thousands of players, coaches and fans announced that they would not travel to this country, which is due to the policy. Trump's crazy immigration has generated fear, tension and negative reactions at the international level. Athletes and delegation members are afraid of being arrested.

Or even with valid visas, fans all over the world consider the United States an unsafe place. For a major event like the World Cup, the situation is so serious that several countries have announced that they will boycott the event. If it is still held in the United States, it will be a direct blow to the spirit of football unity. This is why FIFA has already taken action. The official move of the competition to Mexico and Canada offers safer and more popular conditions for both players and fans.

The United States was originally the main contractor and thus lost the world's largest sports event. All of this was due to the political crisis caused by Trump's policies. Leave your comments and share this news.

Other users also shared this rumor on Bluesky (archived), Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived), TikTok (archived) and X (archived).

However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo, as well as The Associated Press, CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post, found no credible reporting about FIFA seriously considering relocating U.S.-hosted World Cup matches outside the U.S., at least not as of this writing in early June 2025. Rather, this matter marked the latest chapter of users sharing false or unfounded rumors, including some posts featuring the use of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools.

Snopes contacted FIFA's media relations representatives to inquire about the rumor's accuracy and will update this article with more information as it becomes available.

The aforementioned lookups of search engines located some relevant news regarding Trump's policies and the 2026 World Cup, though again no reports confirmed the central claim about FIFA deciding to move U.S.-hosted games to Canada or Mexico.

For example, in March, FIFA President Gianni Infantino met with Trump at the White House, with FIFA reporting Trump reaffirmed support for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup tournaments.

On April 25, The Associated Press reported U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Democratic Party in Oregon, asked the Trump administration to reconsider policies impacting travelers arriving in the U.S., including citing upcoming sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

In early May, NBC News reported members of Trump's Cabinet warned World Cup visitors to the U.S. not to overstay their visas. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also cast the tournament as "an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place," adding, "We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together."

On May 13, Politico (archived) reported the details of a letter (archived) the Human Rights Watch organization addressed to Infantino. The letter cited Human Rights Watch's "grave concerns" about Trump's immigration policies, and urged Infantino to be "prepared to reconsider the hosting decision" if the safety of fans and players couldn't be guaranteed. Other reports told of concerns about long visa appointment wait times, as well as European countries issuing travel advisories for the U.S.

Two days later, on May 15, Reuters (archived) reported Infantino reassured that "the world is welcome in America," referencing the 2025 and 2026 tournaments.

Trump's travel ban, which targets 12 countries and adds restrictions on others, includes exceptions for "any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State."

Portugal successfully lifted the UEFA Nations League trophy after beating Spain via a penalty shootout in a thrilling final match. Drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams failed to win it during extra time, but Roberto Martinez's men held their nerves during the shootout.

Selecao das Quinas were determined to put on another strong display after beating Germany in the semifinal stage. However, they were facing a much tougher task from the hungry and determined Spain outfit.

Despite Portugal's determination, it was La Furia Roja that got things under control early on as they went 1-0 up through Martin Zubimendi. However, Cristiano Ronaldo and co got their act together and drew level five minutes later from Nuno Mendes' effort.

Spain raised their game again and regained their advantage just before half half-time break, this time from Mikel Oyarzabal's goal. In the second half, Portugal managed to improve their performance further and got back on level terms once again, thanks to Ronaldo's equaliser.

After drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams continued to look for that important winning goal during extra time, but neither was successful. As neither side was able to win in regular time plus the 2×15 minutes, the game went to penalties.

After a pretty tight shootout, it was Alvaro Morata, who cost Spain the game as it was his missed spot kick that sealed the deal for Portugal. Martinez's men got all of their penalties spot on, including Ruben Neves' decisive fifth kick, which made it 5-3.

Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, has ignited a firestorm online after bluntly stating that current WTA stars like Iga Świątek and Coco Gauff are yet to reach the “superstar” status once held by the likes of Serena Williams. In a follow-up video addressing the backlash, Mouratoglou didn't walk back his comments.

Instead, he doubled down, emphasizing that star power, not just ranking, dictates which players command primetime attention and fill up stadiums.

The comments come during heightened debate over gender inequality at Roland Garros, where only men's matches were slotted into the coveted night session throughout this year's tournament. These prime-time matches, starting at 8:15 p.m. local time, are billed as marquee events, but the absence of female players has fueled criticism.

In an attempt to shift the narrative, Mouratoglou released a video titled “Are Night Sessions Really Gender-Biased?” where he attempted to explain the rationale behind the French Open's programming decisions.

In a detailed explanation in his latest follow-up video posted to his Instagram account, Mouratoglou responded to the criticism head-on. He argued that the term “superstar” transcends athletic dominance or Grand Slam victories.

“There is a real difference between being a top player playing incredible tennis and being a star,” Mouratoglou said. “I explained that women's tennis at the moment lacks superstars.”

He made it clear that his comments weren't meant as an insult to players like Świątek and Gauff but rather as an observation on their current cultural impact. “There is one big star, I think, in women's tennis, which is Coco. In terms of aura, she's higher than anyone at the moment. I'm not saying that they will not be in the future.”

“I said that there has been huge superstars in women's tennis. I'm thinking about Serena, Venus [Williams], [Maria] Sharapova. And it can happen to men's tennis also to have some era when you don't have stars. It happened in the past. Between the Sampras-Agassi and the Roger-Rafa, there were no superstars of that level on men's tennis.”

 

 

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)



Using past examples, Mouratoglou emphasized the difference between athletic excellence and mainstream recognition. He pointed to Serena Williams' unmatched cultural resonance, recalling how tickets for the U.S. Open women's final sold out before the men's for the first time in history when she played.

He also mentioned a lesser-known example from Sweden: “When we went to Bastad in Sweden with Serena, the year before the final wasn't sold out. Serena comes, and before the tournament even starts, the whole week is sold out.”

Mouratoglou illustrated what he called “the superstar effect,” stating, “Superstars fill up stadiums. There are people who step onto the court, and they take it over. They're able also to have an aura out of the court, and they become big. Take a taxi and ask questions. Oh, do you know tennis? No, I'm not a tennis fan. Okay, who do you know? 90% of the time I ask women, Serena.”

“Most of the time, the men say, oh, Rafa. They are way beyond tennis. Those people are not tennis fans, but they know Serena. Everybody knows Serena.”

The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant.

Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5 1/2 hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands — and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one.

Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, “3 winners in Paris today,” then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and “the beautiful game of tennis. What a match!”

This was the 12th Alcaraz-Sinner meeting, the first in a major final.

“Hopefully not the last time,” Alcaraz said. “Every time that we face ... each other, we raise our level to the top.”

It would be shocking if there weren't many more of these to come — perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 2-ranked Alcaraz is the two-time defending champion.

His comeback against No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. It was unforgettable. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: “His strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.”

Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 — that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger — show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0.

Sinner is pretty good, too. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. 1. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won three majors. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches.

Notably, all three of those losses came against — yes, you guessed it — Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal.

Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz.

What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see.

“The level,” Alcaraz said, “was insane.”

Sinner's take?

“I'm happy to be part of this,” the 23-year-old Italian said. “Would be even more happy if I would have ... the big trophy.”

As with any great rivalry — think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed — Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts.

Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling “Vamos!” Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Sinner's ball-striking is pure. Alcaraz's drop shots are legendary. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping.

Both can improve. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. Alcaraz loses focus on occasion.

Both are eager to improve. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique.

Who knows what heights each can reach? They split the past six Slam trophies, and eight of the past 11.

Federer saw this coming.

During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it.

“It's going to happen, inevitably,” Federer said. “And it's almost not going to be that hard, maybe ... because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn't see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. ... Players are going to believe more.”

PARIS (AP) — Bad starts in Grand Slam finals are nothing new for Carlos Alcaraz, and each time it's happened he has won the tournament anyway.

But not in such dramatic style as Sunday's French Open final, when the Spaniard rallied from two sets down and saved three match points to beat top-ranked Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) for his fifth major title in as many finals.

It was Alcaraz's second straight French Open title with a comeback, after trailing 2-1 in sets to Alexander Zverev in last year's final, and a third major title from behind, following his five-set win against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final. 

“When the situations are against you, then you have to keep fighting. It's a Grand Slam final, it's no time to be tired, no time to give up,” Alcaraz said. “Do I enjoy that? The real champions are made in those situations.”

In producing one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the clay-court tournament on Sunday, he emulated Djokovic's feat from the 2021 final at Roland-Garros — when the now 24-time major winner fought back from two sets down to beat Stefanos Tsitsipas.

“Today it was all about the belief in myself,” Alcaraz said.

He became just the ninth player to rally from two sets down and win a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, which began in 1968. The first was Bjorn Borg in 1974 against Manuel Orantes at the French Open, where Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi achieved the same feat. Rafael Nadal also did so, at the Australian Open, and Sinner too.

It was the first time that Sinner had lost a Grand Slam final, but the fifth time in succession he has now lost to Alcaraz, who clinched the 20th title of his career at the age of 22.

It was also the longest-ever French Open final — 5 hours, 29 minutes — in the Open Era. It was so tight that Sinner won 193 points, Alcaraz 192.

It might not have been close to those numbers.

For after 3 hours, 43 minutes, Sinner had his first match point. But with just over five hours since the match began, Alcaraz served for the title at 5-4 up.

The drama was still not over.

Sinner made a remarkable retrieve from yet another superb Alcaraz drop shot. At the very limit he could stretch to, Sinner glided the ball over the net, with the ball landing with the softness of an autumn leaf and out of Alcaraz's reach to make it 15-40.

When Sinner won the game to make it 5-5, it was his turn to milk the applause and he was two points away from victory in the 12th game, with Alcaraz on serve and at 15-30 and at deuce.

But Alcaraz made a staggering cross-court backhand to make it 6-6 and force a tiebreaker, with the crowd going wild when Alcaraz's cross-court winner made it 4-0. 

“Just amazing the support you have given me today,” Alcaraz said. “During the whole tournament.”

Alcaraz won the match with a superb forehand pass down the line, fell onto his back to celebrate, then rushed over to dance and hug the team members in his box.

“I'm very happy for you, and you deserve it, so congrats,” the 23-year-old Sinner told Alcaraz. ”It's an amazing trophy, so I won't sleep tonight very well, but it's okay.”

Sinner may have nightmares about the ninth game of the fourth set.

Serving to stay in the match at 5-3 down, Alcaraz trailed 0-40 to give Sinner three match points.

On the second match point, and with Alcaraz on second serve, he hit a hurried backhand which landed just out. He then hit a forehand into the net for another unforced error, making it deuce.

The crowd chanted “Carlos, Carlos,” and roared when Alcaraz hit an ace, then gave him a standing ovation when his audacious forehand down the line went in — to win that game — and again when he broke Sinner's serve to level at 5-5.

“That's what the real champions have done in their whole careers. Not being afraid,” Alcaraz said. “That's why I had my best tennis in crucial moments.”

Despite having just lost a chance to win another major, Sinner showed great sportsmanship to give Alcaraz the point for a 30-0 lead in the 11th game. 

Alcaraz's forehand landed at the back of the court and, as the chair umpire prepared to come down and inspect the mark, Sinner told her to go back because he saw the ball was in.

The crowd applauded him politely, but the noise level erupted when Alcaraz won the fourth-set tiebreaker to level the match.

By now, the fans had what they wanted — an Alcaraz comeback — and fans showed their unbridled delight when he won points with astounding drop shots from deep or leapt to bang cross-court forehand winners. 

Alcaraz hit 70 winners, compared to 53 for Sinner, who might have been feeling like it was a case of déjà vu.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in the French Open semifinals last year, coming back from 2-1 down in sets. He beat Sinner last month in the Italian Open final — the tournament where Sinner returned from his doping ban.

Alcaraz now owns a 22-1 record on clay this year.

On a warm day with a light breeze caressing Court Philippe-Chatrier, big names turned out. 

Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman, movie director Spike Lee, singer Pharrell Williams, Formula 1 driver George Russell and world rugby star Antoine Dupont watched what promised to be a tight contest.

Sinner seemed on the way to victory, but No. 2-ranked Alcaraz fought back. After clinching the third set with a volley at the net, he stood in the middle of the court, shaking his fist in celebration.

One of the greatest finals in French Open history was just getting started.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner simply furthered their status on the ATP Tour at the French Open, with the duo having met in another final.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in the Italian Open final last month, and repeated that feat in the French Open final at Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Sinner is taking a break following his final loss at the clay court Grand Slam, in which he gave up a two-set lead against his opponent.

Alcaraz has now defended titles at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, with the Spaniard now boasting five Grand Slam triumphs.

Sinner does, however, remain top of the ATP Tour rankings after their latest battle, which took five hours and 29 minutes.

Alcaraz now has a phenomenal 20 career titles at the age of 22, with 23-year-old Sinner just one behind on 19.

They don't look like slowing down anytime soon, but perhaps there are a small number of players who could threaten their expected dominance in the near future.

Arguably sitting top of the pile is Jack Draper, who is the highest-ranked British men's player at this moment in time.

But he is making bigger moves on the ATP Tour, having just risen one spot to a career-high rank of world number four.

Draper won at Indian Wells earlier this season, and at 23 has three career titles so far, with four runner-up finishes.

His big-hitting is already an issue for a long list of his rivals, and could pose a real threat to Sinner and Alcaraz in the years to come.

Like Draper, Lorenzo Musetti has also now secured a new career-high rank after impressing at the French Open.

The Italian ace, who retired hurt against Alcaraz in the semi-finals in Paris, now occupies sixth place in the world rankings.

He is a two-time ATP champion at the age of 23 and is impressing across various surfaces, reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals last year.

Musetti has helped Italian tennis reach a whole new level in recent times, but he will now be eager to move out of Sinner's shadow and into the limelight.

A year younger than both Draper and Musetti, 22-year-old Ben Shelton is another who could be a danger to Sinner and Alcaraz.

He has also risen one spot in the world rankings to 12th, with his Roland Garros run ended only by the Spaniard in the fourth round.

Shelton gave Alcaraz big trouble in Paris before ultimately failing to progress, having done the same to Sinner in their 2025 Australian Open semi-final.

Tommy Paul is arguably flying the flag for American men's tennis right now, but Shelton isn't too far behind.

There is, however, one rising star on the ATP Tour who may just have a better chance of competing with Sinner and Alcaraz than the three aforementioned hopefuls.

Joao Fonseca is only 18 years old, but currently occupies a career-high rank of 57 on the ATP Tour, having just risen eight places.

The Brazilian is also already a one-time title winner, having lifted the trophy in Buenos Aires earlier this season.

He has been making real waves in men's tennis, most recently by reaching the third round of the French Open.

It took a top display from fifth seed Draper to send him out of the clay court Grand Slam, with Fonseca having previously knocked out 30th seed Hubert Hurkacz.

That superb victory was reminiscent of his 2025 Australian Open appearance, where he knocked out ninth seed Andrey Rublev in round one.

Intriguingly, Fonseca has already mimicked both Sinner and Alcaraz on the court, having triumphed at the 2024 NextGen ATP Finals.

The Italian clinched that title back in 2019, with the Spaniard doing the same in 2021, defeating Alex de Minaur and Sebastian Korda respectively.

Fonseca overcame fellow rising star Learner Tien in his final, but has rapidly moved on to impressing on the ATP Tour.

He is only going to get better, and could pose a real threat to the leading two players in men's tennis sooner rather than later.

Plenty of others will, however, also be keen to have their say on the matter, with the futures of Jakub Mensik and Arthur Fils also looking very promising.

Britain's top two combined in an intriguing doubles partnership as Queen's welcomes women's tennis for the first time in over 50 years

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Spectators had been queuing for an hour outside Court One in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu. One immaculately-dressed lady, a parody of Queen's genteel West Kensington surroundings, complained that she had bought tickets for the Andy Murray Arena in the expectation that Britain's top two female singles players would be in action there, and seemed baffled that she couldn't access the smaller court they had in fact been assigned. 

Those who had secured tickets for the small, intimate Court One enjoyed the sight of a fired-up Raducanu and Boulter securing their first win of the grass-court season, and their first as a somewhat surprising doubles pairing. The pair beat doubles specialists Xinyu Jiang of China and Fang-Hsien Wu of Taiwan 6-4, 6-2, in a match that was a fascinating insight into both players' attitude at the start of the swing. 

This was a partnership that had been some time in the making. Boulter said before the tournament began that the pair had been practicing on clay at Queen's when they mooted the idea of coming back to play doubles here; it had been suggested in the lead-up to Miami, Madrid, and Roland-Garros too. 

Boulter, the British No. 1, has a wealth of experience in doubles, most recently teaming up with Daria Kasatkina at the Madrid Open, while she partnered close friend Jodie Burrage at the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers in April. That match indicated the combined firepower of two singles players can overwhelm even a team of doubles specialists; so it proved again today. 

But for Raducanu this was something of a journey into the unknown, having only played doubles once previously, alongside Denmark's Clara Tauson at the Washington Open in 2022. After the match she cited the quick turnaround from clay to grass as an incentive to get as much match time on the surface as possible. The 22-year-old has been managing a series of back spasms that have affected her for much of the spring, but said afterwards it felt “in good shape”, and she fortunately did not look affected as the pair wrapped up victory in an hour and 11 minutes. 

The decision to maximise time on grass has an added edge this year, with both players hunting a seeded spot at Wimbledon. Boulter, the world No. 34, has the advantage over Raducanu, ranked three places below her. But a strong run for either at Queen's would send them up the rankings ahead of the most important tournament of the season. 

Much has been made of the battle for the British No. 1 spot, too, although Boulter in particular has downplayed it. Fun as this match evidently was for both players, it may also have been a case of keeping your friends close, and your enemies closer. 

Enemies in a strictly professional sense: the pair were all smiles as they walked out, and their similar on-court personalities – both cut positive, pumped-up figures – matched well. An early pattern was established of Boulter using her immense power from the baseline and Raducanu reacting at the net, the combination of pace and precision putting their opponents on the back foot. 

But Xiang and Wu fought back, imposing themselves in net exchanges. The 5'3” Xiang proved masterful at overheads despite her diminutive size. Raducanu hammered a superb forehand down the line to get out of trouble in a tricky service game for 3-1, and her serve came under pressure again at 4-3, when their opponents levelled proceedings after Boulter fired long.

But the British pair continued to up the ante and took the set with an error from Xiang. They seemed to settle into a groove in the second, breaking for a 2-1 lead courtesy of a lovely cross-court forehand winner by Raducanu. Break point up at 5-2, the Brits played a point that summed up their partnership: Boulter went toe-to-toe with Wu in an excellent, lengthy baseline exchange, before Raducanu sealed the break with a sweet forehand volley into the open court. Another blast of a volley by the 22-year-old wrapped up the match. 

“I feel like if one of us hits a good ball, we're both capitalising on that. So naturally I already feel a lot more confident that Emma is going to put the ball away if I've hit a good shot,” Boulter said afterwards.

There was the occasional apology over mix-ups with the ball, but this had the feel of a natural partnership. Raducanu said afterwards that it was important to “put ourselves in the best position possible” ahead of the Billie Jean King Cup, giving captain Anne Keothavong a wealth of options for doubles teams. (Burrage and Sonay Kartal – the latter up to world No. 50 – also combining in doubles at Queen's.)

The smiles continued in their post-match press conference: Boulter said they were “very pleased to get Emma's first win on the board for doubles,” while Raducanu confessed that she was “probably more nervous than the singles” at the start, but that “Katie made me feel so comfortable”. 

Britain's top two singles players have plenty of pressure on their shoulders at the best of times, but particularly as the grass season builds. This partnership offers both the chance to sharpen up ahead of a crucial three weeks, in a comparatively low-stakes format. All while keeping an eye on their biggest rival for the No. 1 spot. 

No plans have yet been made to continue playing together at Wimbledon, Raducanu said. But a grinning Boulter had other plans: “Scrap what she said, we're going for the Wimbledon title.”

Tennis star Coco Gauff won the French Open women's singles title on Saturday, becoming the first American since Serena Williams in 2015 to claim the trophy. She defeated top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in three sets.

Gauff described the nerve-racking moment she lost the first match point, saying, "Losing the first match point, I was … felt like I was holding my breath the whole game."

The 21-year-old explained she thought the ball was going out, but when it didn't, she knew she needed just one more opportunity.

"That first match point was crazy because she shanked it and I thought it was going out, so I kind of felt my heart rate spike up and kind of getting ready to celebrate, and the ball went in. I was like, 'Are you serious?' ... I don't know, I was just like 'give me one more chance. God, give me one more chance. I'll take advantage of it this time,' and I did," she said.

After her thrilling victory, Gauff wrote on Instagram, "I learned having doubt enter your head is impossible to escape, but not impossible to overcome."

The 21-year-old, who also won the 2023 U.S. Open final, admitted she still has self-doubt despite her wins, which she said she tries to talk openly about.

"I realize that I just try to redirect those into positive thoughts, even if you don't truly believe them. But eventually, when those moments are tough and you don't know your back is against the wall, you don't know where to lean on, you try to lean on the positivity and the belief," Gauff said. "I think that's what carried me through that match and honestly throughout the whole tournament."

The second-ranked Gauff also responded to viral comments made by Sabalenka after the match. Sabalenka told reporters she believed Gauff won because she made so many errors due to the windy conditions that made it challenging.

"I was a little bit surprised, but at the end of the day, it was tough conditions and a tough match," Gauff said, adding that growing up in Florida, she played in the wind often.

"I know that when I play on a windy day, you're not going to win by hitting winners, you're not going to win by playing pretty tennis because the ball is moving, your footwork, everything … feels like you're in space and you don't know what is happening," Gauff said. "Honestly and also when you're playing Aryna, she's such a tough hitter, so you know she's going to hit winners. You kind of have to make her make those mistakes."

Sabalenka has since clarified her comments and praised Gauff for her win, saying in an Instagram story that her opponent was the "better player" and "fully deserved to win."

It's the second Grand Slam for the young American, who said she's realized that she is where she belongs.

"As I got older and realized like I worked so hard off the court and on the court to be where I belong, and there's nothing easy. I had to go out and win seven matches like everyone else does. … Especially having consistent results, I think I prove that more and more each tournament," she said.

Most of all, she's grateful for her family's support through everything.

"Having that support system is so important, especially playing tennis and being on tour since I was 15 and still developing. I'm 21, but I still have a lot more life to learn," Gauff said.

Up next, Gauff said she's preparing for Wimbledon.

Nicolas Jarry channeled his fighting spirit to a much-needed win Monday at the Libema Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, where he claimed his first Top-50 win since January.

The 29-year-old dug deep for a 5-7, 6-4, 7-6(3) win over eighth seed Luciano Darderi in the first round at the grass-court ATP 250 event. Jarry trailed by a set and a break and saved four break points at 4-4 in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, before prevailing after two hours, 30 minutes.

Jarry has slipped to No. 150 in the PIF ATP Rankings after a topsy-turvy start to the season, during which he has posted a 6-12 record. The Chilean boasts a career-high World No. 16, but has been unable to defend recent points, notably at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome, where he reached the final last year before falling in the second round last month.

Gabriel Diallo scored his first tour-level win on grass by moving past Aleksandar Vukic 7-5, 7-6(2) and setting a second-round meeting with two-time finalist Jordan Thompson. The sixth seed, who advanced to the championship match in 's-Hertogenbosch in 2019 and 2023, defeated Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 6-4 and improved to 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“Two finals is heartbreaking, so hopefully I can just keep going like I did today, and give myself another chance,” Thompson said when asked if it was too early to start thinking of another appearance in the championship match.

 OAKMONT, Pa. — The U.S. Open long has been regarded the toughest test in golf, and this year it returns to what is arguably the toughest course in America. 

 Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh is the talk of the 125th U.S. Open, a course built in 1903 that is more about being feared than being fair. The rough is as thick as ever. The greens are as fast as any. There's also the famous Church Pew bunkers between the third and fourth holes. 

 Scottie Scheffler shot 69 in his U.S. Open debut as a Texas teenager. He missed the cut the next day in 2016. Now he's the favorite as he comes to Oakmont having won three of his last four tournaments, including the PGA Championship. 

 Here is a look at what you need to know leading up to the U.S. Open: 

 Golf's second-oldest championship — it dates to 1895 — starts Thursday at 6:45 a.m. Players in groups of three will start on the first and 10th tees, morning and afternoon. The biggest names typically start on No. 10 in the morning or on No. 1 in the afternoon to get peak TV coverage. 

 The top 60 and ties make the 36-hole cut Friday and advance to the weekend. 

 NBC and its platforms get their first major of the year, and there is wall-to-wall coverage of the U.S. Open. 

 Thursday starts on USA Network from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Peacock takes over until 8 p.m. Friday starts on Peacock at 6:30 a.m. until 1 p.m., and then NBC goes until 8 p.m. 

 Saturday has USA Network from 10 a.m. to noon, and NBC goes from noon until 8 p.m. The final round Sunday starts at 9 a.m. until noon on USA Network, and NBC takes over until the end. 

 The odds keep getting better for Scottie Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world. BetMGM Sportsbook has him at 275. Next in line is defending U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau . 

 Rory McIlroy was the second favorite on the BetMGM Sportsbook money line last week at 700. He missed the cut at the Canadian Open last week and goes into the U.S. Open at 1200, along with Jon Rahm. They are followed by Xander Schauffele at 2200. 

 Phil Mickelson needs the U.S. Open to complete the career Grand Slam and this likely is his last appearance. The 54-year-old Mickelson is at 25000. 

 Scottie Scheffler is being compared to Tiger Woods based on modern statistics. He is being compared to Jack Nicklaus for the way he plays the game from tee-to-green with minimal mistakes. He has won three of his last four starts going into Oakmont. A victory at the U.S. Open would send Scheffler to the British Open with a shot at the career Grand Slam. 

 Rory McIlroy is No. 2 and the Masters champion, along with becoming the latest player to complete the Grand Slam. There was thought the Masters title would give him freedom because he had gone 11 years without any major. But he missed the cut in Canada last week and said he found it hard to get motivated when he was practicing. 

 Xander Schauffele is coming off a year in which he won two majors. He was out with two months because of a rib injury. But he plays this major well. Schauffele has played the U.S. Open eight times and only once has finished outside the top 10. 

 Not to be overlooked is Bryson DeChambeau as the defending champion. He loves brute tests like Oakmont. And he was in the mix in the final round at the Masters and the PGA Championship. DeChambeau won his two U.S. Opens at Winged Foot and Pinehurst No. 2 . 

 The U.S. Open trophy doesn't have a name. The winner also gets the gold medal named after four-time champion Jack Nicklaus. The prize money hasn't been announced yet, but it was $21.5 million last year, with $4.3 million going to the winner. 

 The champion also gets a 10-year exemption to the U.S. Open, along with a five-year exemption to the Masters, PGA Championship and British Open. 

 The U.S. Open has gone the longest of the four majors without a playoff. That was in 2008, when Tiger Woods famously made a 12-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to force an 18-hole Monday playoff against Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines. That took 19 holes for Woods to win. 

 Since then, the U.S. Open has gone to a two-hole aggregate playoff on the Sunday after the conclusion of regulation. That has not been used yet. 

 There's been a lot of rain in the last week that has softened the course. The weekday rounds should be reasonably dry. But there's a good chance of thunderstorms on Saturday and lingering rain on Sunday. 

 Bryson DeChambeau got up-and-down from 55 yards away in a bunker, making a 4-foot putt for a 1-over 71 and a one-shot victory over Rory McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2. McIlroy had the lead late in the round but bogeyed three of his last four holes. That included missing a 30-inch par putt on the 16th hole and a par putt just inside 4 feet on the last hole. DeChambeau captured his second U.S. Open. McIlroy left without talking to the media.

In her latest Sky Sports column, Gigi Salmon reflects on an incredible French Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, while also speaking about her meeting with Coco Gauff's parents Candi and Corey after her maiden triumph at Roland-Garros. She also discusses whether Britain is becoming a clay nation and Novak Djokovic's poignant wave to the crowd in what could be his last appearance at the clay-court Grand Slam.

'Where were you when…' A question that will be asked with regularity when it comes to the men's final at Roland-Garros which set a new record for the longest final in the tournament's history, pushed the players in question up to and way beyond their limits, left spectators speechless and led me to say in commentary: "I love tennis" - something I don't normally say out loud on air!

I had the honour of commentating on one of the best matches I have ever seen live, for Radio RG [Roland-Garros], and possibly the greatest Grand Slam final.

From high up in Philippe-Chatrier a match that started in the late afternoon sunshine in Paris finished four-hours and 29 minutes later under the floodlights.

A first Grand Slam final meeting between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the first of many, a 12th meeting overall and, if we're honest, the final most people wanted to see. When these two players face each other it doesn't disappoint, it can't, the contrast in styles, personalities and the desire to be the best.

Alcaraz, 22, has now won five Slam finals from five finals, after saving three championship points on his serve and doing something that he has never done before, coming from two sets to love down.

For his part, world No 1 Sinner recovered from not converting those championship points and then from being an early break down in the fifth to take us the distance in what is only his second tournament back after returning from his three-month suspension.

A tournament that started with a tribute to the 'King of Clay' Rafa Nadal with a plaque laid in his honour on the side the court, fittingly rounded off with a final for the ages.

I was lucky to be behind the scenes shortly after the match finished and close enough to see every emotion possible from those closest to the players, the tears of joy, sadness and pride. Many legends of the game were finding it hard to put into words what they had witnessed. When I asked tournament director Amelie Mauresmo how she felt, she replied 'speechless', before adding that she would be reflecting on a successful two weeks with a nice glass of red wine!

The atmosphere on Sunday backstage was in stark contrast to Saturday which was buzzing in the aftermath of Coco Gauff's second Grand Slam title and her first in Paris.

Gauff's three-set win over world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka stood out for its own reasons, difficult conditions, the American's comeback, Sabalenka's inability to deal with the conditions and possibly the situation, and the drama of how it played out.

After the match, Daniela Hantuchova and I spent time chatting with Gauff's parents Candi and Corey, full of pride for their daughter and how she handled everything, remembering she is still only 21.

Dad Corey for a while now hasn't sat in the box as his living and breathing every point became unmanageable in the box and in his own words: 'I don't handle it well, that's why I don't sit in the box, I bring too much negative energy, I struggle all the way through - I find a corner and I stay in it.'

He also said that her mental strength comes from her faith and having great 'spiritual strength', going on to say: 'I have great belief in myself and it can be contagious. I always think I can be the best at everything as if I don't believe it then no one will - you must just believe in yourself.'

Gauff's coach JC Faurel said that any coach who tells you they are calm in the box are lying and that he was a mess inside, while Matt Daley who joined the team last year praised Gauff for being willing to make tweaks and changes during matches. The celebrations - they all confirmed - before the Gauff's headed back to America were going to be big and lasted long into the night!

So a new Champion in Paris in Gauff, a final that may never be beaten, a fitting tribute to the 'King of Clay' at the start and, from a British point of view, four finals featuring British players.

Someone posed the question recently, 'is Britain becoming a clay nation,' a strong statement and while some good inroads are being made, we're still a long way from putting the red dirt at the top of the list of British players favourite surface.

Jack Draper came into the French Open as a contender as the world No 5 having had a fantastic clay swing reaching the final in Madrid and the quarter-finals in Rome.

But no one was picking him to win the title and to seriously challenge the likes of Alcaraz and Sinner on clay would have been very tough and he would fall in the fourth round to Alexander Bublik who played the match of his life!

It's not to say Jack can't or won't in the future, all the signs look great and there's so much to take away from the last few months.

Cam Norrie had an excellent run to the fourth round, ultimately falling to Novak Djokovic, his first-round win over former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev in five sets and nearly four hours was fantastic and having had a tough 18 months of so, there's a lot for Cam to take on to the grass including a boost in his ranking. While Jacob Fearnley continues to rack up firsts, picking up his first French Open wins and going down to Norrie in the third round.

On the women's side, all three made it through to the second round with Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal winning their first French Open matches and for Emma Raducanu she had the misfortune to run into a revived Iga Swiatek in round two.

There was, though, a title and four finals to celebrate, with Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid winning their 23rd Grand Slam doubles title together and their six successive French Open doubles title with Hewett regrouping from losing the men's wheelchair singles title earlier in the day to the world No 1 Tokito Odo.

Hannah Klugman, 16, became the first British girl to reach the final of the junior competition in Paris in 49 years, which was also her first Grand Slam singles final and there was disappointment for Joe Salisbury and Neil Skupski, who lost out in the men's doubles final, having become the first British players to reach the final at Roland-Garros since 1936.

So in conclusion are we becoming a clay nation? No! Are we starting to enjoy it a bit more? Yes!

Someone who enjoys the clay with 20 of his 100 titles coming on the surface including three at Roland-Garros is Novak Djokovic but have we seen the last of him in the French capital?

He made a point of stopping in the middle of Court Philippe-Chatrier after his semi-final loss to Sinner, to take some time to applaud the crowd before reaching down to touch the clay.

He was asked in his post-match press conference if that was him saying goodbye to which he replied: "This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know.

"Do I wish to play more? Yes, I do. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? I don't know. That's all I can say for the moment."

Sensible words from a 38-year-old who will be 39 when the French Open rolls around in 2026.

I have heard from people close to him that he wants to and intends to play on next year but there are other factors in play. If he secures Grand Slam title No 25, does he do a mic drop having achieved everything there is to achieve in the sport? He still has Wimbledon and the US Open to come this year and will the body continue to play ball, that ultimately led to Nadal walking away when he did.

What a couple of weeks it has been in the French Capital, ending with a match that has transcended tennis. On my flight back this morning it was the main topic of conversation among the other passengers, a mix of tennis fans and those who just happened to come across it and then couldn't look away. I go back to what I said around four hours into the final, 'I love tennis!'

Andy Murray has claimed Jack Draper is “right in the mix” with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner to win future Grand Slams. And the double Wimbledon champion has claimed the current top two players in the world have a long way to rival the achievements of the Big Three. “We'll see whether they get that," said the Scot.

The world of tennis was yesterday still reverberating to the five-hour, five-set French Open final won in dramatic style by Alcaraz. Andre Agassi claimed the Spaniard combines the best attributes of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal - and will be even more dangerous at Wimbledon.

And fellow TNT Sports analyst John McEnroe backed Alcaraz and Sinner to have beaten Rafa Nadal “at his best” following their epic final in Paris.

Speaking at Queen's Club, Murray was full of praise for the two young stars who have won the last six Grand Slam titles "They're both brilliant athletes and very different personalities, which I think for fans is really exciting," he told BBC Sport.

"Moving forward, men's tennis is in a great place. People always worry at the end of a generation of players what's going to happen with the sport next, but generally sports continue to evolve and, in most cases, improve. From what I've been told, it was one of the best finals for a long time.

"Jack's right in the mix just now and doing extremely well. He's going to give himself opportunities to win majors over the next five, 10 years."

New world No.4 Draper, who reached the US Open semi-finals, is now set to be seeded to avoid the top two at Wimbledon until the last four.

But Murray cautioned against recency bias after the first-ever Gen Z final between two men born this century. Alcaraz now has five Grand Slams and Sinner, 23, is still on three.

Novak Djokovic (24), Nadal (22) and Roger Federer's (20) shared 66 Grand Slam singles titles as they dominated the sport for over a decade. And three-time Major winner Murray said: "The sport's in a really good place but it's important not to forget what the guys have done before them, what Roger, Rafa and Novak have done,.

"Winning 20-plus majors is something exceptional and it's easy in today's age to forget a little bit about that. I saw some pundits saying if [Alcaraz and Sinner] went on court against Rafa at the French Open, they would be favourites going into that match with Rafa in his prime.

"Alcaraz and Sinner are on the path to being two of the best, no doubt about that, but it takes time to build what Roger, Rafa, and Novak had. We'll see whether they get that."

But Alcaraz, 22, is trending in the right direction after winning his fifth Grand Slam title at exactly the same age as Nadal. “I'm going to say that's destiny,” he said “Hopefully it's not going to stop like this.”

After saving three match points against Sinner, Alcaraz's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero claimed: “I think he was born to play these kinds of moments. With Carlos, anything is possible.”

The top two male players on the planet will now rest before playing grasscourt events next week in the build-up to Wimbledon. They will be seeded to meet in the SW19 final July 13 in the potential next installment of their rivalry.

Ferrero added: “Jannik is a great champion, he'll go all out at Wimbledon. We're leaving with a two-Grand Slam advantage over him. They raise their level every time that they go on the court.”

Alcaraz, who celebrated last year's French Open win in Ibiza, is scheduled to play the HSBC Championships at Queen's Club starting on Monday.

Sinner said: “I'll prepare to play on grass in Halle before Wimbledon, the next goal. But now is not the time to cry."

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

How long will it be before Billie-Jean King comes out and says that the extraordinary 2025 French Open Men's Singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will shorten their careers by at least a year? That was what BJK famously said of the 2012 Australian Open final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, the longest ever men's Major Singles Final (at just under six hours), so it is only logical that she would say the same of yesterday's classic, which was the second longest ever men's Major Singles final (at just under five and a half hours). And yet BJK and other critics of the five-set format are wrong, because the Alcaraz-Sinner masterpiece was a necessary reminder of the greatness of five-set tennis.

Yesterday's French Open Final was so incredible that many tennis analysts, including The Tennis Podcast and indeed LWOT itself, are genuinely asking whether it was the greatest tennis match ever. That is probably a classic example of recency bias, whereby the most recent example of greatness in sport or art is immediately hailed as the greatest ever.

Yet the 2025 French Open Men's Singles final was undeniably a great match, certainly taking its place in the top five of the greatest men's finals ever, alongside Federer v Nadal at Wimbledon in 2008, the aforementioned Djokovic v Nadal in Melbourne in 2012, Borg v McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1980 (a match so good that the greatest film about tennis, Borg vs McEnroe (2017), was made about it) and Djokovic v Federer at Wimbledon in 2019. As undoubtedly the greatest ever French Open men's final, it easily merits its place even in such stellar company.

The only thing that let Alcaraz-Sinner 2025 down was its ending, which is why it probably only ranks as fifth in the greatest finals ever rather than as number one. It may have featured the first ever 10-point match tiebreak to decide a Major title (the Covid-ravaged 2020 US Open Men's final between Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev was decided by a regular tiebreak, with Thiem winning it 8-6), but that was actually the worst thing about the final, because it was so lop-sided. Alcaraz almost literally sprinted into a seven-point lead and eventually won it 10-2, albeit with the very last shot being a characteristic flash of Alcaraz brilliance.

Indeed, so (relatively) disappointing was the match tiebreak that it supported the argument that Grand Slam finals should only be settled with a match tiebreak after it goes to 12-12 in the final set, i.e. after the two players have effectively played the equivalent of an extra set to try and divide them. It is precisely because Federer v Nadal in 2008 went to 9-7 in the final set and Borg v McEnroe in 1980 went to 8-6 in the final set that they are likely to remain even more highly regarded by tennis fans and tennis historians than Alcaraz v Sinner in 2025. The endings in 1980 and 2008, with Borg and Nadal finally breaking their opponent's serve after a truly epic contest, mean that they will live even longer in the memory than the ultimately disappointing match tie-break in 2025.

Nevertheless, even allowing for the (relative) damp squib of its ending, Alcaraz v Sinner 2025 was unarguably a great tennis match – indeed, one of the greatest tennis matches ever – and a reminder that all the greatest tennis matches ever are five-setters. It is simply not possible to display the epic levels of endurance, both physical and mental, that both Alcaraz and Sinner demonstrated in a three-set match.

Yet BJK is not alone in questioning the continuing relevance of the five-set format. For example, Russell Fuller, the BBC's Tennis Correspondent, has increasingly suggested that at the Majors both men and women should play three-set matches up until the quarter-finals and then they should both play five-set matches thereafter.

Although there may be some merit in extending the final matches of a women's Major in this way, there is none whatsoever in reducing any matches of a men's Major, even in the early rounds. It is because men have to play seven five-set matches to win a Major that it remains not only the ultimate challenge in tennis but arguably the ultimate challenge in all of sport. As Mardy Fish, the former US professional who reached the quarterfinals at three of the four Majors (only failing to make the last eight at Roland Garros), memorably Tweeted or X-ed during the match: “Toughest sport in the world. No clock to run out. No timeouts to call. No subs to come in for you. No one to sit there and tell you what to do… This is as good as it gets guys.”

Fish is absolutely right: a five-set Major final is “as good as it gets”, not just in tennis but in all of sport. And tennis as a sport would be absolutely crazy to do anything to reduce it.

In the increasingly frenetic 21st-century, in which we are often told that human beings (and not just young ones) have an attention span that is greatly reduced from what it was in the past, other sports and indeed arts have attempted to reduce the amount of time they take, but invariably with negative results.

The classic example is cricket. First-class or five-day cricket might just be the greatest team sport ever invented and it is certainly the most complex, because it unfolds over a considerable period of time and therefore allows for numerous changes in momentum during that time. By contrast, 20-20 or T20 cricket, in which teams play for just 20 overs each for about three hours, is a vastly reduced form of cricket (and not just in time) that is usually just a “hit-it” game more comparable to baseball or even rounders than first-class cricket. It is truly a Big Mac compared with a Michelin five-star, five-course meal.

And the same is true of art forms. The greatest examples of any art form – Shakespeare's plays, Tolstoy's novels, Francis Ford Coppola's first two Godfather films or David Simon's The Wire in television – are inevitably, indeed necessarily, long. They simply have to be long if they are to be epic – that is, encompassing the fullness of time, with all its ups and downs, and infinite switches between joy and despair and back again.

At its best, as proven again triumphantly by Alcaraz and Sinner yesterday in Paris, five-set tennis is every bit as epic as a Shakespeare play, a Tolstoy novel or a Coppola film. It is a five-act drama that seems to encompass almost the entirety of human existence, or at least the entirety of human emotion. And any attempt to end it would be utterly foolhardy – a wilful destruction of the very greatest sporting encounter that has ever been created.

In the early 1980s, David Puttnam, the great British film producer of masterpieces such as Chariots of Fire, Local Hero, The Killing Fields and Midnight Express, famously said of the increasing trend for films to be watched on television screens rather than cinema screens: “Reduce the size of the screen, reduce the size of the dream”. Well, the same principle is true in sport: “Reduce the size of the fight, reduce the size of the might”. The 2025 French Open final between Alcaraz and Sinner, the latest entry in the list of the greatest tennis matches ever played, was a necessary reminder of the greatness of five-set tennis – and it is a reminder that we should never forget.

Emma Raducanu said it was good to test out her back in an exciting doubles match with Katie Boulter at Queen's. The British pair, dubbed ‘Boultercanu', beat Wu Fang-Hsien and Jiang Xinyu 6-4 6-2 in the first round on Monday in front of a packed, intimate Court 1 crowd.

Ahead of the tournament, Raducanu raised injury fears when she confirmed that the back spasms that haunted her before Roland Garros returned as she was planning to prepare for the grass swing, and she only started playing points in practice on Sunday. But she looked like her usual self as she and Boulter sealed victory on their debut as a pair.

Raducanu, who will also play her opening singles match against Cristina Bucsa on Tuesday, said: “Yeah, it was good to test it out and see how it goes in the match.

“And I have been managing it, and I think I will continue to. Hopefully it stays in good shape for tomorrow.”

The 22-year-old has rarely played doubles in her career, once teaming up with Clara Tauson in Washington three years ago. But she let Boulter take the lead and enjoyed her return to the doubles court.

“Yeah, for me, I was actually very nervous before the match. I don't know if Katie could tell,” Raducanu added.

“But probably more nervous than the singles, because I just didn't really necessarily know what to do, but I'm really happy once we got out there. Katie made me feel so comfortable, and I'm just so pleased to get a win on the board.”

Boulter, who has previously won doubles matches at Billie Jean King Cup partnering other British players and even teamed up with her fiance Alex de Minaur at Wimbledon, was happy to contribute to Raducanu's success.

“Obviously very pleased to get Emma's first win on the board for doubles,” she smiled.

“Yeah, I thought we played some very good tennis, considering it's our first time playing. I thought the level was really high. Very happy to get our first grass court win this year.”

In round two, Raducanu and Boulter will either face No. 1 seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Erin Routliffe or fellow Brits Jodie Burrage and Sonay Kartal. Boulter and Burrage sealed a crucial victory for Team GB over the Netherlands at the BJK Cup earlier this year.

But the British No. 1 believes her game also complements Raducanu's on the doubles court.

She explained: “I think we both serve and return very well, and we both have great volleys. I feel like if one of us hits a good ball, we're both capitalising on that.

“So naturally I already feel a lot more confident that Emma is going to put the ball away if I've hit a good shot. I feel like we are always going to keep making it very tough for the opponents. Yeah, I feel comfortable.”

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner lit up Court Philippe-Chatrier in their thrilling five set French Open final.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in the French Open final, with the Spaniard saving three championship points to do so.

This five hour and 29 minute final has received a huge reaction, with Coco Gauff and Roger Federer messaging Alcaraz after he defended his French Open title.

The highly dramatic final between Alcaraz and Sinner has received much praise for the level they produced and now a big prediction has been made about their Grand Slam future.

Both the Grand Slam titles this year have been won by Alcaraz and Sinner, who defended his Australian Open title earlier this year.

When discussing this French Open final on the Nothing Major podcast, former world number 21 Steve Johnson was asked if he thinks Alcaraz and Sinner can win 18 of the next 20 major tournaments.

Johnson could not argue against that happening and sent a warning to the rest of the ATP Tour.

“It is hard to bet against that,” said Johnson. “Their level is astonishing and then when they get to play one another it just gets played. 

“It's one of those things we are lucky as tennis fans and spectators that we get to watch these two guys at 21 and 22 years old do this in a sport that they haven't even both hit their primes yet, which is amazing for those two guys and scary for the rest of the tour.

“I don't think these guys are going to lose matches at slams. First, second, third round to anyone. These guys are way too good. They are too competitive. They don't take days off. It's crazy to think that I believe Sinner is 91-3 against everyone else in the last couple of years and he is 0-5 against Carlos. Those are insane numbers for himself.”

Since the start of the 2024 season, all six of the men's Grand Slam titles have gone to either Sinner or Alcaraz.

The top two ranked ATP players have evenly split these major titles, with Sinner winning all the Grand Slams on hard courts, while Alcaraz has dominated the natural surfaces.

Sinner lost his first Grand Slam final to Alcaraz at the French Open, with the other major runners-up including Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz.

The next Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, where Alcaraz is a two-time defending champion.

Sinner's best result at the grass court major is reaching the semi-finals, and he will be looking to better that when the tournament begins on Monday, June 30.

Wu Yibing returned to the ATP Challenger Tour winner's circle in memorable fashion Sunday.


Competing in just his fourth tournament of the year, the 25-year-old ousted countryman Zhou Yi 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the championship match of the Texas Spine and Joint Men's Championship, which was the second all-Chinese final, and first to be held outside China, in ATP Challenger Tour history.




Wu has had great success in the state of Texas, where in 2023 he won the ATP 250 in Dallas to become the first Chinese player to lift an ATP Tour trophy. In Tyler, just 90 minutes east of Dallas, Wu secured his sixth Challenger title, extending his record amongst Chinese players.


The Hangzhou native entered the week as No. 401 in the PIF ATP Rankings and after advancing through qualifying and going all the way to the title, Wu is up 121 spots to No. 280.


Zhou, 20, was aiming to become the third-youngest Chinese winner in Challenger history.

In other Challenger action, Otto Virtanen kickstarted his grass-court season by winning  the Lexus Birmingham Open. The Finn earned a 6-4, 6-4 victory against American Colton Smith, who played his semi-final match earlier in the day due to Saturday rain.


The 23-year-old Virtanen has triumphed in all seven Challenger finals he's played, making him the fourth player in Challenger history to hold a flawless 7-0 record in title matches. Former World No. 10 Pablo Carreno Busta holds the record, having won his first 11 Challenger final appearances.

Virtanen, a wild card at this week's ATP 250 in 's-Hertogenbosch, is just the second Finnish player to win a grass-court title and first since Tuomas Ketola in 2000.


“It feels amazing playing on grass. I don't think we have a single grass court in Finland,” said Virtanen, No. 101 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I have always liked the surface and enjoyed playing on it. It's a classic style and it suits my game.


“It was a good match from my side and he put me in a tough situation and I had to do my best on the very important points.”


Peru's Ignacio Buse claimed his first Challenger title at the Neckarcup 2.0 in southern Germany, where he dropped just one set all week. The 21-year-old ousted Guy Den Ouden 7-5, 7-5 in the final.

“This is such an important win for me. I've worked so hard for this,” Buse said. “It was a tough week with all the weather disruptions, but I stayed calm and I'm just really happy today.”


Hugo Dellien lifted his 14th Challenger trophy and first of this season at the Unicredit Czech Open. The 31-year-old Bolivian defeated Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-3, 6-4 in the final, spoiling Tseng's quest for back-to-back titles. Tseng last week won the Vicenza Challenger.

It took 5 1/2 hours, but on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz won the French Open for the second straight year. Alcaraz bested Jannik Sinner in a grueling, thrilling match after a stunning comeback, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2).

Alcaraz earned the win after dropping the first two sets, defeating Sinner after five sets and three tiebreaks. The wild matchup pitted the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds against one another in what is sure to become an instant classic.

The loss ends Sinner's run of two straight Grand Slam titles after he won the 2024 US Open and the 2025 Australian Open.

"I'm pretty sure you're going to be a champion, not once, but many many times," Alcaraz said of Sinner after the match. "It's a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, making history with you."

Sinner, who had an early lead, failed to capitalize on three championship points in the fourth set before Alcaraz forced a deciding set. In the fifth set, it was Sinner who completed the unlikely comeback from a break down to force a third tiebreak.

In the end, it was Alcaraz who came away with the trophy. The young Spaniard defeated Sinner 10-2 in the fifth set tiebreak to win his fifth Grand Slam title. At age 22, he becomes the third-youngest man to win five major titles, trailing only Bjorn Borg and Rafael Nadal.

As the more than five-hour match wore on — the longest in Roland-Garros history and the third-longest men's finals match in the Open Era — Sinner grew visibly fatigued, while Alcaraz stayed in control of the matchup. But both seemed to get a second in the final set, with it all leading up to the thrilling ending.

Alcaraz, who is famous for his ability to win marathon contests, is now 13-1 in five-set matches. Sinner, meanwhile, moves to 0-7 in matches that go past the four-hour mark.

The two traded games throughout the first set, before Sinner broke through to take the 6-4 win. In the second set, the young Italian got off to a strong start, going up 4-1. Alcaraz got on a roll to eventually tie Sinner at 5-5. Sinner then took the next game, but Alcaraz held on for an uncontested service game to force a tiebreak, which Sinner eventually won with some difficulty.

The third set was all Alcaraz to start. He had briefly lost the goodwill of the crowd before pulling them right back in with multiple excellent points. Though Sinner launched a late comeback of his own to keep the set alive, Alcaraz held on for a 6-4 win in a sequence that mirrored the first set.

In the fourth set, things stayed as tight as ever. Alcaraz seemed to have a slight advantage early before Sinner came back for a late surge. However, with Sinner up 5-3 in the set and 40-0 in the game with three shots at winning the tournament, Alcaraz fought back to win the game and, eventually, the set.

Sinner looked fatigued at the start of the deciding set, as Alcaraz quickly broke the Italian's serve to take the upper hand. But Sinner managed to get a second wind, breaking back late in the set to force yet another tiebreak.

And in the end, Alcaraz was victorious after a dominant tiebreaker victory.

            For five hours and 29 minutes on Sunday, tennis fans around the world were treated to one of the most absurd spectacles the sport has ever seen.
    


            In the longest French Open final – and the second longest grand slam final – in history, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner showed once again that tennis' future is in safe hands.

Roland Garros: A visual guide to the iconic clay court grand slam



            With Novak Djokovic in the twilight of his career and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal already hanging up their rackets, it would be entirely natural for fans to worry about the considerable void the three greatest players of all time will leave behind them.
    


            But as Alcaraz and Sinner crushed groundstrokes at each other on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros, displayed pinpoint precision with deft drop shots and volleys, and chased down each shot with a fierce determination, nobody was thinking about the Big Three and whether their sizeable shoes still needed filling.
    


            Instead, it was one of those special sporting moments in which everyone watching knew they were witnessing history.
    


            That Alcaraz ended up the victor – improbably coming back from two sets down for the first time and saving three championship points to eventually win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) – was largely immaterial to the final spectacle; Sinner winning that final-set championship tiebreak wouldn't have made the match any less remarkable.
    


            Even before Sunday's epic final, John McEnroe was so impressed with what he had seen from the pair in Paris that he made the case, though admitted it sounded “semi crazy to say,” that either Alcaraz or Sinner would beat the Big Three at their peak.
    


            “You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Rafael Nadal on clay, you know, he won this 14 times – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favored to beat Nadal, at his best,” he told TNT Sports.
    


            “Now, do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible – there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

            “But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.”
    


            Boris Becker, another former world No. 1, said the current level of tennis shown by Alcaraz and Sinner is “exactly the level” the Big Three played at.
    


            There is no doubt that an intense rivalry can elevate and even transcend a sport, and tennis has been blessed with no shortage of great rivalries over the past two decades.
    


            The drama and pageantry of the 2008 Wimbledon final between Nadal and Federer and the 2012 Australian Open final between Nadal and Djokovic elevated them both beyond the status of a mere tennis final. They are now singular events that beg the question: “Where were you when…?”
    


            We could now be seeing the blossoming of tennis' next great rivalry, with the head-to-head between Alcaraz and Sinner now at an intriguing crossroads.
    


            Alcaraz leads 8-4 but, crucially, has now won five matches in a row against Sinner and currently appears to have the world No. 1's number. The Italian is 111-10 since the 2023 Beijing Open, but half of the losses are to the man from Murcia, including all of Sinner's three losses in his last 50 matches.
    


            But a large part of the fascination in watching two rivals battle it out for the duration of their careers comes from the twists and turns, as both parties figure out weaknesses and try to gain the upper hand.
    


            For example, between March 2013 and January 2014, Nadal beat Federer five times in a row, before the Swiss turned the tide to win the next six matches between the two giants from November 2015 to March 2019.
    


            The future of tennis' newest rivalry will be the subject of much debate between now and the start of Wimbledon at the end of the month, but it seems a fairly safe bet that Alcaraz and Sinner – who have now won the last six grand slams between them – will be battling it out at the top for a long time to come.
    


            Alcaraz found it hard to explain what it was like playing in a match of that standard, describing it as “amazing.”
    


            “To put it into words is really difficult,” he told Eurosport's Lesly Boitrelle and Àlex Corretja. “Being two sets to love down against the No. 1 in the world, the level Jannik was playing at was unbelievable.
    


            “It's my first time coming back from two sets to love down. Honestly, I just poured my heart into it, I just tried to keep going, not think about the result and just play my best tennis in the third and fourth, and then the fifth.
    


            “The fifth set was just not giving up, it was just fighting and thinking point after point, and at the end of the fifth I was just playing with heart. Honestly, I don't know what I did to win this match. I'm really, really happy and proud with how I dealt with everything today.”

Wimbledon will be shown on a new TV channel for the first time having been covered by the BBC for 88 years. 

While the company will still remain the principle broadcaster in the action when it comes to this year's action at SW19, a new broadcaster will show the event for the first time. 

This is courtesy of a stipulation in Ofcom's Listed Events regulations, which permits 'secondary broadcasters' at major sporting tournaments.

This year's tournament runs from Monday June 30 to Sunday July 13 and costs the BBC around £60million per year.

But a new broadcaster will have rights to show highlights in 2025.

That honour will see them take over the daily 90-minute highlights show of the action at the conclusion of each day's play. 

TNT Sports will assume the five-year deal that was originally signed by Eurosport in May last year after it bought Eurosport - which disappeared from UK viewers' screens back in February. 

The BBC have broadcast events at Wimbledon since 1937, when matches from Centre Court were shown up to half an hour each day.

Coverage will come across BBC1 and BBC2, with all matches shown on BBC iPlayer, in addition to updates via radio, online and its app.

Carlos Alcaraz will be seeking a third successive Wimbledon title after beating Novak Djokovic in each of the previous two finals on Centre Court. 

Meanwhile, Djokovic has burning ambitions of his own to win a 25th Grand Slam title and hold the outright record for the most majors won by a single player in the history of the sport. 

But it is his rival Alcaraz who will come into the tournament as favourite after his astonishing comeback victory over Jannik Sinner to lift the French Open title at Roland-Garros on Sunday. 

At one stage, the Spaniard was two sets down and had to save three championship points before completing an almighty fightback to win his fifth Grand Slam. 

As is tradition, he will appear on Centre Court during the first day of the tournament, with women's singles champion Barbora Krejcíkova doing the same.

Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second Roland Garros title on Sunday (June 8). The match lasted over five hours, making it the longest final in French Open history. Now, let's take a look at the five longest finals in Grand Slam history during the Open Era.

A pulsating French Open came to a dramatic conclusion on Sunday, with Carlos Alcaraz battling back in a legendary final to stun Jannik Sinner and defend his title.

Here, we look at the big winners and losers from a fascinating fortnight of men's singles action at Roland Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz: An astonishing comeback and an astonishing triumph for Alcaraz, who is now one of just four men in the Open Era to win five majors before turning 23. It is hard to see the Spaniard slowing down anytime soon.

Alexander Bublik: The Kazakh picked up two hugely impressive top-10 wins to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final, reminding everyone just how talented he is. Let's hope we see more of this tennis from him in the future.

Frances Tiafoe & Tommy Paul: Best-ever Roland Garros runs for Tiafoe and Paul saw both men reach the last eight, as part of a strong US campaign in Paris. Both will be eyeing up a strong grass-court season.

The 6 men to win the French Open final from two sets down: Alcaraz joins Djokovic, Borg

ATP Rankings: Sinner's consolation, Alcaraz's title, Draper and Paul's new milestones, Ruud -8

Alexander Zverev: Another Grand Slam chance goes begging for Zverev, who fell into his passive patterns of play in his quarter-final exit to Novak Djokovic. It looks less and less likely that the German will win a major title.

Taylor Fritz: Expectations were low for fourth seed Fritz heading into Roland Garros, but an opening-round exit to Daniel Altmaier was underwhelming. The American now has to defend a heap of ranking points this summer.

Stefanos Tsitsipas: After a stunning second-round loss to Matteo Gigante, Tsitsipas now finds himself outside the top 20 for the first time since 2018. The Greek will hope his partnership with Goran Ivanisevic can revitalise his career.

Casper Ruud: Injury contributed to the end of Ruud's Roland Garros, with his second-round loss to Nuno Borges his earliest exit at the event since 2018. The Norwegian is another whose Grand Slam hopes may be fading.

Jannik Sinner: The world No 1 proved he was as sharp as ever throughout a dominant run to the final, but is now just the third man in the Open Era to miss championship points in a Grand Slam final. How will he process such a loss?

Novak Djokovic: Djokovic's motivation and hunger should not be questioned, and his tennis in Paris was arguably his best of the year. But, despite a strong display, he couldn't take a set off Sinner in the semi-final. It is understandable why he may be contemplating his long-term future in the sport.

Lorenzo Musetti: Musetti's strong clay-court season ended in heartbreaking fashion, pushing Alcaraz early on before injury forced him to retire in his first French Open final. Hopefully, it is not a long-term issue for the Italian.

Emma Raducanu has admitted to being a little jealous of the ATP Tour for being able to play at the Queen's Club. After a long hiatus, the WTA Tour has triumphantly returned to the West Kensington venue for the first time since 1973.

The Queen's Club is already known for its highly regarded men's tournament - a consistent winner of the best ATP 500 accolade - and now female players are eagerly seizing their chance to shine. Raducanu joins the likes of Australian Open winner Madison Keys and Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen on the fabled grass courts, who have previously shared their envy at the ATP players' chances to compete at the venue.

Keys found it too tempting to resist the WTA 500 at Queen's, especially given that her friend and ex-tennis pro Laura Robson is leading the event as tournament director. She admitted to pangs of jealousy each time her ATP friends played the west London leg of the tour.

She said: "Obviously, when Laura asked for me to play the tournament, it was a pretty quick yes. I'm happy to be here, and I've always loved the grass swing, so to start here for the first time in many, many years is really fun."

She added: "I've always heard amazing things about the tournament and I've always been pretty jealous because the guys just rave about how great it is here and they love playing here. So, I'm really looking forward to being able to play here."

Zheng, meanwhile, also admitted that her grass-court experience is limited, and that she has never made it to a quarter-final on the surface. Yet, the world No. 5 couldn't resist joining the historic first women's event at Queen's Club as the WTA Tour graces its lawns.

The Chinese sensation said: "I watched the men's event Queens and I'm really happy. The first time for the women, in my generation, that we can play in Queen's in such a special club.

"It's amazing for us that we can start first and we have the experience to play on such beautiful grass. I think it's a very classic, old, traditional place, and it's a special club because you have all the neighbourhood around, which is an amazing design from a long, long time ago."

Donna Vekic, a grass-court aficionado who stormed into the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, has also always dreamt of the ladies taking centre stage at the iconic venue. The Croatian ace said: "It's very historical and this club, when I watch the men's tournament, it's always amazing and I always wished that we had a chance to play and now we do, so I'm very excited to be playing here."

But perhaps no one is more thrilled than Britain's own tennis stars, who've grown up with eyes glued to the ATP event and are now set to dazzle their home crowd at this esteemed tournament. Raducanu couldn't help but reveal a touch of envy towards ATP players in the past, admitting with a smile: "A little bit, healthy. But it was great seeing the guys play here, of course.

"When I was young, I came here with my dad. I was like hunting the brownies on the ground and not so interested in the tennis. But now to be back here and competing is a different feel for sure.

"It's kind of interesting how it feels because you're at home, you don't necessarily feel like you're playing a tournament or a match tomorrow. But I think it is also really good to switch off and just to have comforts everywhere."

Elsewhere, British No. 1 Katie Boulter added: "I've actually always said to myself, I wish there was a women's event here, I wish I got the chance to play on this court, because you can feel the history and you can feel how incredible it is."

PARIS (AP) — Loïs Boisson, the revelation of the French Open, has rocketed 296 places up the WTA rankings after her fairy-tale run at Roland-Garros.

The Frenchwoman, who was 361st before making it to the semifinals at the clay-court Grand Slam last week, jumped to 65th in the latest edition of the rankings published Monday.

Coco Gauff defeated Boisson in the semifinals en route to her first French Open title. There was no change at the top of the rankings, with Aryna Sabalenka leading the pack ahead of Gauff and her fellow American Jessica Pegula.

Sabalenka lost to Gauff in the Roland-Garros final.

A wild-card entry in Paris, Boisson upset the third-seeded Pegula to reach the quarterfinals, then defeated sixth-ranked Mirra Andreeva before Gauff ended her unexpected run.

After retaining his title on Sunday in the longest ever final at Roland-Garros against top-ranked Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz remained in second spot in the men's ATP rankings behind his Italian rival.

Despite the loss, Sinner increased his lead to 2,030 points because Alcaraz, as the defending champion, was unable to add any points. Sinner gained 500 points by reaching the final, having lost in the semifinals last year.

Third-ranked Alexander Zverev dropped 900 points after his loss to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. Djokovic moved up to fifth place behind fourth-ranked Jack Draper.

French Open

Carlos Alcaraz produced a comeback for the ages to defeat Jannik Sinner and take the 2025 French Open final in a six-hour instant classic in Paris.

Alcaraz, 22, defended his title by coming back from two sets down and saving three championship points to win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2).

The Spaniard was broken twice as the world No. 1 and slight favorite Sinner started strongly on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and Alcaraz went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak at sunny Roland Garros.

Alcaraz won three breaks in the third set and won a dramatic tiebreak to level the match before he went 7-0 up in the championship breaker with some celestial tennis and sealed his triumph with a laser forehand.

Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic

You may have heard already — but we have our own tennis podcast at The Athletic these days.

The Tennis Podcast is now part of our audio stable. Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts have been podcasting after every day of this year's French Open.

And they will do so again today, following that unbelievable marathon of a men's final. I have no idea how they'll manage to sum up everything that transpired in an hour, but they're pros, they'll find a way! The episode will up in the next few hours.

Sinner's tennis is often compared to Djokovic, but there's something about his mentality that also resembles the 24-time Grand Slam champion. Like Djokovic, Sinner is extremely adept at shrugging off disappointment to lock back in. 

Curiously, the clock ticked beyond three hours and 50 minutes while Sinner was serving for the match, which made the fact that Alcaraz had kept things competitive in the face of a second-set rout a couple of hours earlier significant. 

Alcaraz certainly looked the fresher in the tiebreak, and the sprint finish Sinner had been hoping for disappeared. This had become a long-distance race again, and it was Alcaraz who had the edge. 

He went down 0-2, then up 4-2, conjuring memories of the Beijing Open final last fall, when Sinner led a tiebreak 3-0 before Alcaraz won it 7-3.

Alcaraz took this tiebreak by the same scoreline and the match went into a fifth set. From there, Sinner was at the point that his sprint for the line had been designed to avoid. Again, it proved the point of no return.

If the biggest edge Sinner has on Alcaraz is the serve, the biggest edge Alcaraz has on Sinner is rhythm. Not just his variety, Alcaraz can maneuver the ball and change the cadence of a match like no other elite player.

So perhaps Sinner's greatest achievement Sunday was stopping that from happening for large swathes of the match. 

For the first two sets, Sinner's consistent hitting and aggressive court position prevented Alcaraz from getting on top of the rallies and bringing his lethal drop shot regularly into play. By the fourth and fifth, Alcaraz took over. 

Having withstood his opponent's most lethal weapon for so long, the intensity that had taken Sinner to the cusp of the title left him powerless to stop the coup de grâce — until the one he caught up in the fifth set to prolong the match.

By the end, Alcaraz had hit more drop shots than during any other match in the tournament.

Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic

Ask any player who has done it on the biggest stages in tennis. So much of beating Alcaraz lies in finding a way to snuff out the surges that he uses to steamroll an opponent, whether he's ahead or behind.

On Sunday, the first surge came an hour and three-quarters into a match that had turned into one-way traffic for Sinner, who was serving for a two-set lead at 5-3. 

Sinner got to this match by snuffing out a similar surge form Novak Djokovic in the second set Friday night. Djokovic had the crowd and the moment. Sinner played clinical tennis and smote the danger.

In the seventh game of the fourth set, Sinner shut down any ideas Alcaraz might have had that this would go the distance and looked to be on his way. He wasn't, because Alcaraz was about to unleash maybe the biggest surge of his career. 

He won 13 of the next 14 points to climb from 3-5, 0-40 down to 6-5 up. Sinner pushed it to a tiebreak, but after falling down 0-2, Alcaraz cranked out a couple of aces on his way to winning seven of the last eight points.

Sinner did find a way to stifle it Until the one last Alcaraz rise that proved impossible to quell.

Anyone might have predicted that Jannik Sinner would have the edge on short points. He's got the bigger serve and induces more errors on return than most top players and more easy second shots as well.

Through the first set and into the start of the second, Sinner more than doubled Alcaraz's tally on points of four shots or fewer, winning 32-14. For shots that lasted longer than four shots, Alcaraz was in the lead 23-11.

Even as Alcaraz wiped out Sinner's two-set lead in his stirring comeback, Sinner's advantage in the short points held firm.

It's no coincidence that during the peak of his domination, he was winning 66 percent of points on his first serve, compared with a little under 60 percent for Alcaraz. 

These two players are a level above the rest of the tour, evenly matched rivals in their own galaxy. But if there is one notable gulf, it is between their serves. Alcaraz needs to close it.

Tennis fans will be watching tapes of five points from the 2025 French Open final 25 years from now.

The match seemed so lost, it was almost silly to consider what might happen when Alcaraz stepped to the line to serve at 0-40, 3-5 in the fourth set. The celebration in Italy was about to explode.

Then came a long rally, the kind Sinner was on the short end of for much of the afternoon. He went long with a ground stroke. Interesting. Two more match points and then a chance to serve it out. Then he tried to jump on a second serve, and sent the backhand long. Hmm.

On the next point, Sinner seized control, setting up a kill shot, but it went into the net. Alcaraz had his lifeline and whipped up the crowd, promising them more tennis if they could carry him to this most unlikely rise from the abyss.

An ace and a forehand down the line to the postage stamp later, Alcaraz was alive. When he was taken to the fifth-set tiebreak, it looked as if he had wasted his resurrection. 

Instead, the Spaniard produced a tidal wave that surpassed even his great escape.

Having fended off three match points, Alcaraz found himself in the position Sinner had been: serving at 5-4 for the French Open title. This final was surely going to get a conclusion at last. Instead, Sinner broke back to 15.

Court Philippe-Chatrier was stunned, and from there the match descended into a stunning psychodrama that enshrined this young sporting rivalry's place in the global sporting world. 

None of this had seemed possible at the start of the set, when Sinner could barely move. It was as though he was somehow back from the dead. Things then went supersonic. 

The tiebreak ended a three-game drama that transposed into one of the great surges of Alcaraz's career. It may prove to be one of his greatest. After all the tension, Alcaraz found his ceiling, which is peerless in the sport and borderline unplayable. 

There was time for one final miracle – a running forehand down the line that was too ridiculous for words. Alcaraz collapsed into the clay, a champion again.

And why not?!

He added: “I feel the same (that winning was a miracle). I didn't know what I did to win the match, three match points down. My grandfather, I'm pretty sure he was watching from home. I hope he is proud of my performance.

“I tried not to think about anything else, just to go point after point with a positive mind, with everything I had inside. To overcome the problems, trying to play much better tennis than Jannik. 

“It was very difficult in some moments but I'm proud and very happy about how I dealt with everything today. To say it was one of the best finals in the history of a Grand Slam is really high status.

“I have to say there have been more or better finals, Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final. I'm just really happy to put my name into one of the longest finals, in the history of the Grand Slam, Roland Garros.

“I'm really happy, especially for Samu, his first Grand Slam as a coach. I'm gonna celebrate tonight, I'm not gonna lie!”

Alcaraz, courtside, speaks on TNT Sports.

He added: “Yeah, it was honestly amazing. To put into words is really difficult. Being two sets down against the world No. 1, the level he was playing was unbelievable. The first match I came back from two sets down.

“I just put my heart into it, tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result, just putting my tennis on. Not giving up. It was just fighting, fighting, thinking point after point. 

“At the end of the fifth set I was just playing with the heart, and I think I did OK.”

Carlos, you think you did OK?

The trophy he so dearly merits.

He deserves the crown, the Spanish supernova.

He added: “I just want to say thank you to my team, my family, I have the privilege to live great things with you. 

“I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. Even those who are at home who couldn't come.

“Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us.

“To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. You were insane, unbelievable for me. I can't thank you enough. You were really important, you are in my heart and you will always be.

“Thank you very much and see you next year.”

He said: “Hi everyone. I wanted to start with Jannik. It is amazing the level you have, congratulations for an amazing two weeks, an amazing tournament. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament.

“I'm pretty sure you're gonna be champion here many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments.

“You are a huge inspiration for the kids, and for me as well. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.”

A match that will be remembered for the rest of time, Carlos Alcaraz inflicted a first Grand Slam final defeat on Jannik Sinner after a truly miraculous and barely believable 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-3, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) victory over his Italian opponent, winning his second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam crown.

The Spaniard looked down and out as he stared down the barrel. He had never come back from two sets down before, and Sinner was playing at a scarily high level. However, he dug as deep as he possibly could, saving three championship points in the process, as he reigned victorious in a five-hour and 29-minute thriller - the longest final in Roland Garros history and the second longest in Slam history.

Sinner will be absolutely devastated after missing those golden chances in the fourth set, but Alcaraz has this freakish ability to just produce top gear and reach otherworldly levels when he really needs to. Time and time again, he has done that in his career, showing the most phenomenal mental strength. His performance in the final set tiebreak was a sight to behold, as he raced to a 7-0 lead with perfect tennis. 

It will go down as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time, and this new modern-day rivalry is truly blossoming. A rivalry that will hopefully start transcending the sport and capture the hearts and imaginations of new fans. 

Alcaraz has now beaten Sinner five times in a row, and the world number one will be desperately trying to work out a way to beat this martian. However, he should take heart in the fact that he was so close to winning on a surface he has struggled on against an opponent whose favourite surface is clay. Who is for a rematch at Wimbledon next month?

Meanwhile, over on the women's side of the tournament, American Coco Gauff capped off a fine clay-court season with a dramatic 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the final, winning her second Grand Slam and her first here in Paris.

It was a tough match to watch, and in typical Gauff fashion, she didn't play the best tennis throughout the tournament, yet she keeps finding ways to win. Her athleticism, tennis IQ and mentality continue to be unmatched, and she was able to grind down and frustrate Aryna Sabalenka, who made 70 unforced errors and seemed to lose her cool.

At 21 years old, she is forging a superb career for herself on the court, and she carries herself magnificently off it.

It was utter heartbreak for Sabalenka though, who was the favourite throughout the tournament, especially after beating three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek in the final.

However, she was just unable to manage the windy conditions and the retrieval skills of Gauff, and she was extremely emotional following the match.

In her press conference, she was extremely critical of her own performance, and also downplayed Gauff's too. 

"It was really honestly the worst tennis I've played in the last, I don't know, in the last I don't know how many months,” she said. “Conditions were terrible, and she simply was better in these conditions than me. I think it was the worst final I ever played.

“Today was just, yeah, I mean, honestly sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow magically the ball lands in the court, and you kind of, like, on the back foot. Yeah, it's just, you know, like - it felt like a joke, honestly, like somebody from above was just staying there laughing, like, let's see if you can handle this.

“I don't know, I think if Iga would win against me the other day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts. Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did, that hurts.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas' torrid form just shows no sign of slowing down. Once a finalist at the French Open and someone who was so good on the clay, the Greek suffered an abysmal second-round exit to world number 167 Matteo Gigante, meaning he himself dropped to 26 in the rankings - his lowest in nearly seven years.

Following his defeat, Tsitsipas announced the high-profile appointment of former player Goran Ivanisevic as his new coach - the man who helped Novak Djokovic to nine Grand Slam titles. He will be hoping that he can turn his fortunes around.

Another player who has reached the final at this tournament - on two occasions - Casper Ruud also fell in the second round in shock fashion to Nuno Borges. The Norwegian seemed to be struggling with injury, but it was still a massively disappointing result for him, and he has also dropped down to 16th in the world as a result.

On the women's side of the draw, world number nine Emma Navarro was dumped out in the first round after suffering a brutal 6-0, 6-1 defeat at the hands of Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. To see such an incredible fighter like Navarro succumb to a loss like this was a major shock, but all credit to her Spanish opponent, who played some brilliant tennis.

After Rafael Nadal's damp squib of a send-off in the Davis Cup finals at the end of the 2024 season, the French Open announced ahead of the tournament that they would be holding a special ceremony for the all-time great. Nadal won a staggering 14 French Open crowns, and they wanted to celebrate him in style.

And they did just that. With the crowd all donning orange shirts to represent the colour of the clay, Nadal cut an emotional figure as he gave a speech and a highlight reel was played of his greatest moment.

But then, to the delight of everyone watching, his greatest rivals and fellow legends of the game, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray took to the court to share the moment with him, which produced some fantastic images.

Last but not least, the French Open unveiled a plaque with Nadal's footprint right next to the court on Philippe-Chatrier, making him a permanent fixture at his favourite venue. Nadal couldn't contain his emotions as this was revealed, capping off a magnificent ceremony and moment.

There were some absolutely magnificent rallies on the claycourts of Paris this fortnight, with players forced to battle and dig deep to win points.

Holger Rune produced a jaw-dropping around-the-net shot, Djokovic rolled back the years to win a mesmerising 41-shot rally against Alexander Zverev, while Gauff showcased her never-say-die attitude and brilliant backhand to steal a point against Sabalenka in the final.

The clay-court season has now come to an end, and the ATP and WTA Tours move very quickly onto the grass, with Wimbledon already fast approaching.

In London, Queen's Club welcomes back a women's tournament for the first time in 50 years, which is sure to be a fantastic occasion. Qinwen Zheng, Keys, Navarro and Elena Rybakina are the top seeds.

Over in Hertogenbosch, Liudmila Samsonova and Ekaterina Alexandrova are the top seeds, while Daniil Medvedev and Ugo Humbert headline the men's tournament.

Finally, there is a heavyweight cast in Stuttgart, with Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime leading the way.

Check out the draws for WTA Queen's, WTA Hertogenbosch, ATP Hertogenbosch and ATP Stuttgart.

20:55 CET - CARLOS ALCARAZ HAS JUST WON THE LONGEST ROLAND GARROS FINAL EVER - AND ONE OF THE GREATEST MATCHES OF TENNIS EVER - TO WIN HIS SECOND FRENCH OPEN CROWN!

The Spaniard was two sets down and staring down the barrel against world number one Jannik Sinner, but after saving three championship points in the fourth set, Alcaraz mounted a truly remarkable comeback to win in a final set tiebreak, 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a whopping five hours and 30 minutes. It is the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time.

Sinner will be absolutely heartbroken after missing his huge chance in the fourth set, and he has now lost his first Slam final. For Alcaraz, he is a five-time major winner and has won his second here in Paris.

Read our full match report of the final here.

20:47 CET - This match is getting the climax it deserves. We are heading to a final-set tiebreak to decide the French Open champion

20:33 CET - I can't believe what I am witnessing. With Carlos Alcaraz serving for the match, it is Jannik Sinner's turn to break back and make it 5-5 in the decider. What is going on?

19:47 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has an early break in the fifth set! All the momentum is with him now in this phenomenal match.

19:38 CET - Absolutely astonishing scenes here at the French Open as Carlos Alcaraz takes the fourth set 7-6(3), with this sensational final heads to a fifth set. Jannik Sinner will be devastated that he didn't take his chances, and now there is all to play for in the last set of this tournament.

19:22 CET - Incredible scenes here at Roland Garros, with Carlos Alcaraz saving three championship points on his own serve, then breaking back at 5-4 to bring it back level at 5-5. We are not done yet! Heartbreak for Jannik Sinner but jubilation for Alcaraz.

19:04 CET - A potentially HUGE moment in this match. Jannik Sinner has the first break of the set to take a 4-3 lead, and he is just two games away from his first French Open title.

19:01 CET - Midway through the fourth set, the pair are locked at 3-3. Incredible tension around Philippe-Chatrier.

18:29 CET - Jannik Sinner has lost a set of tennis at a Grand Slam for the first time since the Australian Open fourth round! Carlos Alcaraz produced an exceptional set to win it 6-4, breaking Sinner to love in the 10th game. Huge pressure now on the world number one as Alcaraz attempts a seismic comeback.

18:26 CET - Right in the nick of time, Jannik Sinner has broken back! Carlos Alcaraz was serving to take the third set at 5-3, but the Italian pounced. What a crucial few games we have coming up.

17:40 CET - Jannik Sinner has just won a huge and utterly critical second set against Carlos Alcaraz, hitting top gear in the tiebreak to go 6-4, 7-6(4) up. After being broken back when serving for the set, he kept his cool in typical Sinner fashion to regather himself, and has now put himself in a strong position to clinch his first French Open title against a player whose level seems to be constantly fluctuating. 

Remember: Alcaraz has never won from two sets down before. He has a mountain to climb.

17:18 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has broken back at the perfect time! With Jannik Sinner serving for the second set at 5-3, the Spaniard has capitalised on some poor serving from his opponent to get back into the contest.

16:31 CET - After a sensational set that lasted just over an hour, Jannik Sinner has landed the first real blow, winning it 6-4. There was some otherworldly tennis on show, but Carlos Alcaraz produced a few really poor errors in the 10th game to give his rival the set. Can the defending champion bounce back?

16:11 CET - Jannik Sinner has the break back in the very next game! Brilliant from the world number one.

16:05 CET - There is the break for Carlos Alcaraz! It has been a high-quality start to the match, and the Spaniard has first blood, taking a 3-2 lead!

15:40 CET - A stunning 12-minute first game has seen Jannik Sinner just about hang onto his serve. How about that for a start!

15:27 CET - Right then, we are underway! Let's hope it is a classic!

15:10 CET - World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz are about to head out to the court to contest the 2025 French Open men's final!

Stay tuned to the Tennis Tracker for major updates throughout the match or follow it point-by-point via the link below.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

Exclusive Q&A with ‘F1' movie star Javier Bardem

Valtteri Bottas has given his take on whether Red Bull or Alpine could be options for him as he looks to make a return to the grid, with the Mercedes reserve driver also revealing how far negotiations went with both teams last year when searching for a 2025 drive.

After spending three seasons racing for the Kick Sauber outfit, it was confirmed in November 2024 that the Finn would depart the squad at the end of the campaign, a decision that he admits arrived “too late” for him to find another seat on the grid.

“That was the issue,” Bottas explained to F1's Beyond The Grid podcast. “[I found out] after Brazil. I think some people knew before me so that really compromised everything, and that's obviously when I knew that now it's too late to sort out anything else, so a bit unlucky there.”

Bottas went on to return to Mercedes as a reserve driver for 2025, but the 35-year-old has made no secret of the fact that he is keen to get back to racing – and one team that could potentially have a vacancy in 2026 is Red Bull, the squad having yet to decide on Yuki Tsunoda's future.

Assessing whether the Milton Keynes-based outfit could be an option, Bottas said: “I don't know if they look outside their academy. They have so many drivers. They've got their junior team as well, the [Racing Bulls]. It's a tough one because it seems like it's not an easy car to drive.

“Max [Verstappen] is doing the job. He's really pushing almost beyond the limits of the car and whoever has been alongside him hasn't looked great. I just wonder if that car, to be driven fast, needs a driver with experience.

“I think they know that I'm keen to race. They know that I would be available for next year, but I don't know their mindset on that.”

In terms of whether he spoke with Red Bull about racing for them in 2025, the 10-time race winner added: “It was put down quite quickly because I think there's certain persons or a person within the Red Bull organisation that for some reason is not a big fan of mine, but that's life.”

Another possibility could be Alpine, with two drivers – Jack Doohan and Franco Colapinto – having already filled the seat alongside Pierre Gasly in 2025 as the squad continue to assess their options.

Bottas is keen to make a return to the grid, having been watching the action from the sidelines so far in 2025

“I think probably there has been some discussions,” Bottas explained. “I haven't really been involved, but I do have a management team who are always in the background seeing what is out there. They do have a Mercedes power unit for the future, which I think is a good call.

“They're on their second driver this year and I think the next races will show how that goes. Again, I think on a struggle street, let's say, experience can always help.

“But there's lots of politics in this sport. I don't have tens of millions to pay for a seat. Depends on the team but I do have some personal partners that could potentially join me, but still, not to an extent to some others. Let's wait and see a few races and see how things go. You never know if something opens up.”

Alpine were another team that Bottas spoke to regarding the chances of racing for them in 2025, but the Finnish driver suggested that the talks did not progress to a serious level as he expected to be staying with Kick Sauber ahead of their transition into Audi in 2026.

“I spoke earlier on last year to quite a few teams because I was naturally going to the end of my contract, but never really jumped in 100 per cent, again because I was always convinced I'm going to be part of the Audi project, which obviously didn't happen,” said Bottas.

Bottas assesses chances of racing for Red Bull or Alpine as he weighs up future options

Exclusive Q&A with ‘F1' movie star Javier Bardem

After a dramatic and at times controversial end to the triple header in Spain, the teams and drivers have all had a weekend without racing before making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean. Heading to a track that has often provided drama, there are plenty of unanswered questions arriving in Montreal.

Max Verstappen was delivering an excellent performance for the majority of the Spanish Grand Prix, as he and Red Bull went on the offensive and kept McLaren on their toes with an aggressive three-stop strategy.

Then it all started to go wrong, with a late Safety Car undoing all of the good work, as Red Bull only had new hard tyres that they could fit to Verstappen's car, and he soon started slipping through the field. A controversial collision with George Russell followed, and earned the defending champion a time penalty that demoted him to 10th at the flag.

Verstappen took to social media the day after the race to say that the incident “was not right and shouldn't have happened”. Regardless of your views on that clash, though, the reality is the three penalty points Verstappen picked up have left him just one point away from an automatic race suspension.

Race Highlights: 2025 Spanish Grand Prix

The Dutchman will be walking that tightrope in both Canada and Austria before two penalty points expire, so this is a weekend where he will really need to avoid punishment. Will that lead to a change in approach, or is the best way to deal with it not to second guess himself?

Another question that came out of the Barcelona weekend revolves around Lance Stroll, who unfortunately had to withdraw from the race on Saturday night on medical grounds.

READ MORE: Aston Martin's Krack provides more background on Stroll's injury with ‘Plan A' for Canadian to race on home soil

Stroll was advised not to race by his medical team having been suffering from pain in his right hand and wrist, with a statement from Aston Martin stating the belief that the discomfort is related to a procedure he underwent following a cycling accident in pre-season training back in 2023.

Aston Martin were unable to replace Stroll in Spain because he had qualified the car, and at such an early stage was not able to offer a prognosis for whether he would be fit to return at his home race.

It remains to be seen if Stroll will compete on home soil after missing the last race in Spain

Stroll did race through the pain in Bahrain in 2023 despite still recovering from his injuries, and was described as feeling pain again over the past six weeks, so he's previously shown his level of determination to drive, but if Montreal comes too soon then Aston Martin will have to look to their reserve options – led by Felipe Drugovich – or bring in an experienced replacement at short notice.

While there was plenty going on behind them, the two McLaren drivers were largely untroubled despite Red Bull's attempts in Spain, and it was Oscar Piastri who came out on top with his fifth victory of the season.

It was an important win for the Australian, who had seen Lando Norris cut his lead at the top of the Drivers' Championship to just three points following a win from pole in Monaco just one week earlier.

The gap is out to 10 points again, but the pair remain closely matched and are always both in the frame when it comes to pole positions and victories, even if who has the upper hand fluctuates.

McLaren have repeatedly said they are aware that at some stage the battle is going to lead to a clash on track, but so far the two drivers have kept it clean. Whether that can stay the case as we move towards the midpoint of the season remains to be seen.

There is little to separate Piastri and Norris at the top of the Drivers' Championship standings

One of the more intriguing aspects of this season has been the emergence of different teams to threaten McLaren at different venues. In Miami, Kimi Antonelli took Sprint pole for Mercedes, then Max Verstappen won in Imola for Red Bull, followed by Ferrari leading the challenge through Charles Leclerc in Monaco.

The last race in Spain saw Red Bull again put pressure on at the front, but Canada has been a happier hunting ground for Mercedes in recent years, courtesy of lower temperatures and the track layout.

Of course there are no guarantees what the weather is going to do this weekend, and we have seen very warm races in Montreal, too, but for now it's looking like being on the cooler side and that should still play to Mercedes' strengths. A year ago, George Russell was on pole position in Canada – setting an identical lap time to Max Verstappen but starting from pole because he set it first – as the top seven cars in Qualifying were covered by just 0.28s.

Mercedes are hoping for another strong weekend, and the chance to hit straight back at Ferrari having slipped to third behind Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship last time out.

Russell and Mercedes starred during Qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix last season

Last year's Qualifying session was epic enough, but the race itself was also a thriller as rain provided challenging conditions for all of the teams and drivers. There were multiple names in the frame for victory and the top four all crossed the line within five seconds of each other, with Verstappen winning out.

Even if rain doesn't play a role in the race, though, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is a great one for the drivers to fight with each other on. The layout sees a lot of long straights into chicanes or hairpins, with Turn 1, the Turn 10 hairpin and the final chicane of Turn 12 and 13 – where the 'Wall of Champions' waits on the outside – providing overtaking opportunities.

The presence of concrete barriers on the outside of many of those chicanes also means mistakes are punished and drivers have to be in full control at all times – any small error can lose a car a lot of momentum and leave them vulnerable to an attack from behind.

Throw in a huge crowd in a city that really embraces the race weekend, and it's usually a special atmosphere for the Canadian Grand Prix.

Executive Editor, Television


	When Sony Pictures Television surprised S.W.A.T. fans with Exiles, a spinoff of the CBS cop drama, it emerged that Shemar Moore was the only original star signed up to star, disappointing many loyal fans and some of Moore's co-stars.


	The ten-part series, which is based around Moore's Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson character, is being launched without an “anchor” broadcaster after a “frantic” dealmaking process.


	S.W.A.T stars including Jay Harrington, who played Sgt. David ‘Deacon' Kay, and David Lim, who played Officer Victor Tan, were among those caught off guard by the announcement. Harrington was sanguine about the move but admitted it “stung”, while Lim used the same phrase.

	However, Keith LeGoy, Chairman, Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, admitted that there is a chance for some of the former S.W.A.T stars may end up on Exiles.

	“There is a S.W.A.T family and that family is important. We would love to have other family members involved in some way, whether it's all of them all of the time, some of them some of the time, or something in between. That's something that we are still figuring out,” he said at the Banff TV Festival.


	LeGoy, who was promoted to the job in January, said that the company is looking at the series, which was announced at the LA Screenings, to take advantage of the thousands of international buyers that were in town, like a feature film. “We're going to take that risk on ourselves because we believe in our capabilities.”


	He admitted that it could sell the show to one global streamer or broadcasters territory by territory including in the U.S. “Is there risk? Yes. Did we acknowledge that risk and then kind of embrace it? Yeah. This business was founded 100 and something years ago, on people taking risks on their creative judgment, and on their kind of ability to finance their creative vision in whatever way. I think sometimes we've gotten a little too risk averse in this business, we've got a little too fear based, and sometimes you need to run towards something which is a little bit scary. But, to be honest, we're much more excited by the opportunity than we are scared of the risk.”

Justin Baldoni‘s $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds and an additional suit against the New York Times have been dismissed by a judge in a major setback for the “It Ends with Us” director and star.

Judge Lewis J. Liman found that Lively's sexual harassment claims were protected, and thus protected from a lawsuit. Baldoni's suit also alleged extortion, which the judge ruled to not constitute civil extortion. The judge did, however, allow Baldoni to amend and re-file his complaint by June 23.

“The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged,” the decision reads.

Related Stories ‘Another Simple Favor' Trailer: Blake Lively Cons Wedding Guests with Anna Kendrick in Paul Feig's Sequel ‘Another Simple Favor' Review: Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick Head to Capri for a Sequel That Somehow Makes Even Less Sense (in a Good Way) 

It continues: “The Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign. But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane, or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.” 

 










In a statement shared with press, Lively's lawyers declared “total victory” and called the lawsuit a “sham” from the beginning. 

“Today's opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane, and The New York Times. As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.”

Attorneys for Baldoni did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Baldoni filed his 179-page countersuit against Lively in January, claiming that messages presented in Lively's initial complaint were taken out of context. It alleged that Lively's publicist Sloane planted negative news stories about Baldoni, and that the legal move was designed to help rebuild Lively's own reputation. He also claimed the New York Times “cherry picked” its details about Baldoni in its original story about the “It Ends with Us” drama, but the Times has stood by its reporting.

 










On December 20 of last year, Lively issued a legal complaint, followed by a formal lawsuit, accusing Baldoni of retaliation, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. She also accused Baldoni of hiring a crisis PR firm to flood social media with negative comments about Lively after alleged issues of sexual harassment on the “It Ends with Us” set. Baldoni has denied all the claims.

The ugly back and forth since then has involved Baldoni's team slamming Lively for seeking to withhold medical information, Taylor Swift nearly needing to be subpoenaed, and accusations that Reynolds based his “Nicepool” character in “Deadpool & Wolverine” on Baldoni in an effort to mock him.

Billy Jones, the co-founder and owner of Baby's All Right and former booker at Pianos, Sin-é, and more New York venues, has died. According to a statement from the teams at Baby's All Right, Funny Bar, and Nightclub 101, Jones died on Saturday morning, June 7, due to “a highly aggressive case of glioblastoma.” He was 45 years old.

Jones moved to New York in the early 2000s after falling in love with the city's fast-paced environment and boisterous music scene. In the ensuing years, he turned his passionate fandom of bands and routine attendance at shows into a job as a booker at the now-defunct East Village venue Sin-é, as well as Elvis Guesthouse and the Dance. His curatorial talents left a permanent mark when he opened the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, bar and 280-capacity venue Baby's All Right, in 2013, with Zachary Mexico. The spot helped revive the city's indie scene, and often secured high-profile artists early in their career like SZA and and Billie Eilish for intimate gigs.

In addition to fostering a welcoming environment for artists and fans alike, Jones often rallied behind the importance of 18-plus shows at venues like Baby's All Right. “You know, there will be 10 super smart kids who are fans and really want to be there. For us to exclude them based on age isn't cool, we want to give them the opportunity to experience the music,” he told Brooklyn Magazine in 2016. “18+ shows are fun, the kids are really excited to be there and you can sense it. We do all age brunches. People will write to us ‘I really want to see this band, and my father I have CCed has agreed to chaperone me,' and it's awesome. Families like it, kids like it, it can be for everyone.”

Most recently, Jones and Tom Moore, in partnership with Knitting Factory Entertainment, opened the new venue Night Club 101 within New York's historic Pyramid Club. Following a soft launch at the end of 2024, it opened properly earlier this year. It hosts live performances and DJ sets courtesy of indie-rock, jazz, electronic, and experimental artists, as well as art shows, themed dance nights, and community-focused events. Jones and Moore also opened, at the beginning of 2025, the jazz-bar-restaurant Funny Bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Numerous artists and music industry peers have posted tributes in Jones' honor, including Cassie Ramone, La Femme's Alix Brown, and Windser. “When Baby's All Right opened, there was a certain synergy about it.. It answered the begging question of where to go after DIY favorite 285 Kent closed. The answer, according to Billy and Co., was to take the like-minded giddy, fever dream curation to a better space both for the band and audience,” Neon Indian's Alan Palomo wrote on Instagram. “It looked great, it sounded great, it IS great, and CONTINUES to be. An innumerable amount of bands have cut their teeth in that space and gone on to do many a great musical deed. A lot of my favorite NYC memories are at Baby's All Right, Elvis's Guest House, and Pianos; courtesy of Billy. Rest in peace, bud.”

The teams at Baby's All Right, Night Club 101, and Funny Bar shared an additional statement in tribute to Jones. “He was one of the best to ever do it. We are holding him in the light,” Jones' colleagues wrote. “As his family, ourselves, our staff, and his friends all take time to mourn this profound loss, we ask that everyone just try and do what he did every day: share the love of music. There will be a memorial held in early July at Baby's All Right—more details to come. Always remember: ‘It's a feeling.'”

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds‘ team are claiming “total victory” Monday after a federal judge tossed out Justin Baldoni‘s $400 million defamation and extortion suit over what went on during the making of It Ends With Us and the subsequent alleged preemptive astroturfing smear campaign against Lively last year.


	While Judge Lewis Liman has permitted Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, executives and PR team of Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel to submitted another amended complaint by June 23 against Lively,  his exhaustive 132-page order looks to leave little wiggle room for Baldoni.


	“The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged,” the judge said of the defamation claims by Team Baldoni, with reference to the sexual harassment and retaliation complaint Lively filed with California's Civil Rights Department against Baldoni, Nathan, Abel, billionaire Steve Sarowitz and CEO Jamey Heath in late December.

	“The Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign,” the judge (the brother of director Doug Liman) went on to say. “But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.”

	Telling, and perhaps going to the heart of the multimillion-dollar, multi-lawsuit fracas he once termed a “feud between PR firms,” Liman also noted: “Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee's wrongful threats.”


	As a part of today's order, Judge Liman kicked out Baldoni's separate $250 million suit against the NYT. 


	Baldoni's main lawyer Bryan Freedman did not respond to request for comment on today's ruling, but Lively's reps could barely contain their glee.


	“Today's opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,” lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb told Deadline this morning. “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.”


	While mum so far today, back in March when Lively's lawyers moved to have Baldoni's big-bucks complaint dismissed, Freedman said that the actress' attempt to “dismiss herself from the self-concocted disaster she initiated is one of the most abhorrent examples of abusing our legal system.”


	In a digital-age spectacle by any and all estimation that has seen the likes of Taylor Swift, Hugh Jackman, WME and others make what would be called cameos in any other context, today's ruling comes less than a week after a dust-up over Lively's 10th Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and her 11th Cause of Action for negligent infliction of emotional distress from her initially filed December 31 lawsuit took center stage. In the end, in part to preserve the privacy of her medical records, Lively dropped those claims, insisting they were essentially covered by other portions of her filing.


	With all that, and Deadpool star Reynolds, the NYT and Sloane's efforts to be let out of the matter in various stages of exiting the countersuit, the high-profile case is set to go to trial on March 9, 2026. Nobody is talking settlement right now, at least not before today.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has been publicly slamming President Donald Trump for taking control of the National Guard and deploying troops to Los Angeles amid anti-ICE protests. The Democrat dared the administration to arrest him on Sunday. Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, said on Monday that there were currently “no discussion” about arresting the governor, but didn't close the door on the idea. Trump flung it wide open, however, telling reporters on Monday that he thinks arresting Newsom would be “great.”


	“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great. Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job,” the president said.


	Newsom quickly responded. “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor,” he wrote on X. “This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”

	











	Newsom said earlier on Monday that the state will sue Trump over his federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Trump “flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,” Newsom wrote. “The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We're suing him.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump signed an order on Saturday authorizing the federalization and deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops, 300 of which were promptly sent to Los Angeles without the request or consent of city and state officials. The action hasn't been taken by an American president since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson bypassed Alabama's segregationist Governor George Wallace and sent the National Guard to protect civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. 

	











	Trump's order invoked Title X, and called the National Guard — typically under the control of state governors — into federal service “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.”

	The order does not mention California, but instead directs the National Guard “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” In effect, the order could be invoked in other states. Unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act, the National Guard would be barred from conducting law enforcement activities against U.S. citizens. 


	“Let's be very clear, there was no risk of rebellion, no threat of foreign invasion, no inability for the federal government to enforce federal laws,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a Monday press conference. 


	Bonta affirmed that his office would be pursuing a lawsuit to declare the president's unilateral commandeering of the National Guard as unlawful. “The Trump administration likes to ignore laws and just barrel forward. We like to follow the laws and go through the process, including going to court to secure a court order,” he said. Bonta explained that the state decided to persue a legal solution instead of issuing counter-orders to the National Guard in order to avoid confusion. “They'd be getting two orders from two of their bosses, so to speak […] we think the appropriate way is to get a clear order from the court saying that Trump's actions were unlawful.” 


	“The governor is in charge […] unless there is an appropriate invocation of a legal authority by the President to exert authority with respect to deploying the National Guard. He has not done that here,” Bonta added. “The court should be declaring that Governor Newsom has the command here, not President Trump. I think that needs to come from a court, not just from the governor saying it.”

	On Monday morning, the president further escalated the situation, advocating in a Truth Social post to “BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” in order to quash the protests. The threat to send active duty members of the military into L.A. has been echoed by prominent Republicans and Cabinet officials, while heightening tensions in the city. Trump later claimed that Los Angeles would be “completely obliterated” if he had not sent in the National Guard.

	











	“Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight,” Newsom said in a Sunday night interview with MSNBC. “He's exacerbated the conditions, he's lit the proverbial match, he's putting fuel on this fire, ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard — an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong told Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Trump administration to “fuck off” in support of the thousands of Los Angeles-area residents who have been protesting raids against the immigrant community, which began over the weekend. 


Armstrong posted an Instagram video filmed from one of the Los Angeles protests, captioned with a flipping-the-bird emoji and an ice cube. It's soundtracked to Green Day's “Fuck Off,” a bonus track from their Saviors (edition de luxe), which arrived in May. The clip shows a spray-painted car ignited in flames and police ostensibly arresting demonstrators, walking them while zip-tied away from the scene.


	The Green Day frontman was among the thousands who have joined in protest against the administration's ICE tactics against immigrants in the city, which began on Friday when ICE executed raids at several workplaces in the Los Angeles area. On Sunday, Finneas said he was tear-gassed while attending a “very peaceful” protest in downtown L.A.

	On Saturday night, Trump issued a memo federalizing National Guard units in California for 60 days. He also suggested that, via his Secretary Pete Hegseth, he could choose to additionally deploy members of the “regular Armed Forces as necessary.” Hegseth appeared to back that sentiment, tweeting in part: “And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.” On Sunday, the National Guard arrived in the city.

	Trump continued to antagonize protesters with threats of more troops on Monday, while area officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom have spoken against Trump's deployment of the National Guard, which they attribute to him escalating the situation.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Jonathan Daviss is set to star as venerable hip hop artist Snoop Dogg in the definitive biopic from Universal Pictures. Best known for Outer Banks, Daviss takes the lead role days after the studio set Craig Brewer to direct the film.


	The film will be produced by Snoop Dogg, Brian Grazer and Death Row Pictures president Sara Ramaker.


	Daviss hails from Houston and played the role of Pope in the Netflix YA drama Outer Banks. In 2022, he starred in Netflix's Do Revenge opposite Sophie Turner, Maya Hawke and Austin Abrams. Previous credits include Age of Summer and Edge of the World.

	











	The film is a look at how Calvin Broadus Jr. entered into the West Coast hip hop fray. Taking the moniker Snoop Doggy Dogg (he'd later drop the middle name), Snoop brought his laid back drawling delivery and sharp lyrics to Death Row Records, where he worked with Dr Dre on his smash debut album Doggystyle. He broadened into other platforms to the point he might well be seen rubbing elbows with Martha Stewart or getting in the pool with Michael Phelps during the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he became one of the high points of that Olympiad on NBC and Peacock.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The film is the first project under Death Row Pictures' overall deal with NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios as the label moves into motion pictures. Numerous of Snoop's recent forays are tied to NBCUniversal; he's returning to NBC's musical competition series The Voice this fall, reclaiming his red chair for Season 28.


	The Snoop Dogg film becomes Universal's third outing about the formative stories of hip hop icons. The others include the Eminem-starrer 8 Mile, and Straight Outta Compton traced the roots of the seminal rap group N.W.A and its rise to become one of the most influential acts of the gangsta rap and West Coast hip hop subgenres.


	Universal SVP Production Development Ryan Jones and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio.

	











	Daviss is represented by Monster Talent, Innovative Artists and Skrzyniarz & Mallean.

	In the trailer for Sony Pictures Classics' Oh, Hi!, the intoxicating lull of whirlwind young love sours into toxicity, going by way of many (if not entirely relatable) modern dating experiences.


	Cue the swelling of an infatuation-tinged tune that abruptly stops when Iris (Molly Gordon) brings up her surprise at how easygoing her and Isaac's (Logan Lerman) first trip as a couple is going — the point of contention being the operating word “couple.”


	As Isaac winces, a familiar line drops from his lips: “I think you're great. I'm just not really looking for a relationship right now,” he says after cooking a multi-course scallop pasta dinner under nocturnal lamplight and engaging in the duo's first sexually explorative BDSM session.

	In the romantic dramedy turned quasi-horror for Iris, a thoughtful weekend getaway and road trip to the quaint country becomes ground zero for a situationship hellscape known to many Gen Z and Millennial women in heterosexual couplings, as she discovers that her beau Isaac is not on the same page about their relationship — or lack thereof. As Iris goes to extreme lengths to navigate this unforeseen crisis, the film winds its way through the woes of the current dating era — communication breakdowns, commitment-phobia and all.

	And when Iris finds herself backed into a corner after trapping Isaac, as showcased in the trailer, she enlists the help of her best friend (played by Geraldine Viswanathan) for guidance on what to do, not realizing she has also brought along her boyfriend (played by John Reynolds).

	











	As Gordon describes, the role is based off of herself if she were “five percent crazier.”


	“We don't really get to be crazy,” she told Vanity Fair of her character in a recent profile. “There's just still not that many great female characters out there — the kind of wild characters usually played by men.”


	First premiering at Sundance Film Festival back in February, and acquired by Sony a month later for worldwide distribution, the Sophie Brooks and Gordon-penned dark comedy, based on a story by director Brooks, will bow in theaters July 25.

Girl meets guy. Girl falls for guy. Guy might not be totally truthful with girl. So what does a modern woman do? Well, Sophie Brooks‘ “Oh, Hi!” might be the twisted answer to a very relatable dilemma.

Billed as a “subversive rom-com” to not give too much away, “Oh, Hi!” premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman star as Iris and Isaac, a couple whose first romantic getaway soon goes awry. The description teases that the “odd dark comedy takes on the highs and lows of modern dating and the ways it makes us all a little crazy.”

 










Geraldine Viswanathan and John Reynolds co-star. Brooks wrote and directed “Oh, Hi!,” with Gordon having a story by credit (she also produces). “Oh, Hi!” is screening at the 2025 Tribeca Festival June 13 and 14 before debuting in theaters this July.

Brooks, whose first film “The Boy Downstairs” starred Zosia Mamet as a woman who has to live above her ex-boyfriend in a new apartment, is no stranger to challenging the romance genre. Brooks told IndieWire that “Oh, Hi!” was inspired by “The Worst Person in the World,” “Normal People,” and the HBO adaptation of “Scenes from a Marriage” with Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac. 

 










“It's all about tone, right? It's such a thin line,” Brooks said. “The film toes this really thin line of tone and perspective. It was really important to me that both characters felt like real people and fully rounded, realized versions of themselves. It's super-vulnerable, it's incredibly human to want love and to want to give love and be loved. Sometimes women, specifically, who say that are considered desperate or crazy, and I think that's really unfair. Iris is a really brave character, and it's a perfect storm of everything kind of landing in a way at the end of the first act where you're like, ‘Oh, if those things hadn't happened, she probably wouldn't have done this crazy thing.' I hope that people can relate to like, ‘Oh, I wouldn't do this, but in a perfect storm, maybe I would.' … The goal is to do it in a funny, lighthearted way that's entertaining to people.”

She added, “Because, inherently, the movie's about miscommunication and how these two people are not on the same page, that moment, the audience is seeing his perspective in a scene where it's supposed to be about her.”

“Oh, Hi!” is produced by Brooks, Gordon, David Brooks, Dan Clifton, and Julie Waters. 

Sony Pictures Classics will release “Oh, Hi!” in theaters on July 25. Check out the trailer below.00

	The Harry Potter HBO series has taken another step forwards with a slew of cast additions. 


Lox Pratt is slated to play Draco Malfoy, with Johnny Flynn as his father Lucius Malfoy. In more family castings, Bel Powley is set as Petunia Dursley and Daniel Rigby as Vernon Dursley, Harry's aunt and uncle. Additionally, Katherine Parkinson will play Ron's mom, Molly Weasley.


	Cast as Hogwarts students are Leo Earley as Seamus Finnigan, Alessia Leoni as Parvati Patil, and Sienna Moosah as Lavender Brown. 


	They are among nine new cast members unveiled by HBO today alongside Bertie Carvel who, as Deadline revealed exclusively yesterday, will be playing minister for magic Cornelius Fudge.

	The nine, which are believed to be recurring, join previously announced big hitters, adult leads John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid.


	This followed the biggest casting of them all, the three young leads, who will be played by newcomers Dominic McLaughlin (Harry Potter), Alastair Stout (Ron Weasley) and Arabella Stanton (Hermione Granger) in the HBO franchise that is set to run for a decade.


	Cameras will start rolling soon at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden in the UK. 


	Hogwarts bully Draco Malfoy was played by Tom Felton in the films; Lucius Malfoy by Jason Isaacs. (Felton is reprising the role that made him famous in the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.) The Dursleys were played by Fiona Shaw (Petunia) and Richard Griffiths (Vernon) in the movies; Molly Weasley was portrayed by Julie Walters.


Harry Potter showrunner Francesca Gardinerthe revealed in December that the Dursleys will be much younger in the show than they were in the movies.


	The series has been described as a “faithful adaptation” of the beloved books and is being exec produced by the source material's author J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is written and executive produced by Francesca Gardiner. Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series, produced by HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television. Rowling executive produces with Neil Blair, and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.

The abrupt visa issues have impacted touring schedules for Mexican stars like Julión Álvarez and Grupo Firme. 


													By
												

	Griselda Flores


Senior Editor, Latin


Henry Cárdenas was on his way to Texas from Chicago when he got the news: Julión Álvarez's work visa was cancelled, which meant the música mexicana hitmaker couldn't enter the United States in time for his sold-out show at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on May 24. “We had everything set up already,” says Cárdenas, founder/CEO of the powerhouse Cárdenas Marketing Network, still perplexed by the situation. “The entire production, including labor and equipment, amounted to over $2 million dollars — it was all a complete loss because we had to postpone the event. It was unbelievable.”  


	Álvarez — who in April made his grand return to the U.S. with a historic run at L.A.'s SoFi Stadium after being sidelined for eight years over since-cleared issues with the U.S. Treasury — was traveling from Guadalajara to Texas the day before the show and was informed at the airport that he couldn't board the plane because his visa was cancelled. “I've been in the business for 45 years and I had never seen this,” Cárdenas adds. “In the past, we've known of groups or bands that apply [for a non-immigrant visa] and are denied but at least we were informed ahead of time. The day before your sold-out stadium show with 50,000 people? No way. We immediately started calling our lawyers but unfortunately, we haven't gotten to the bottom of it. If you ask me right now what the reason for the cancelled visa is, I don't know. Nobody knows.” 


	In the past two months alone, at least a handful of regional Mexican acts — including Los Alegres del Barranco, Banda Cuisillos, Lorenzo de Monteclaro and, most recently, Grupo Firme — have shared a similar experience to that of Álvarez's. Their work visas — it's unclear if they are O-1 or P-1B visas — are either delayed in an “administrative processing” or outright revoked by the U.S. State Department, leading to postponed shows or cancelled festivals and performances. Such was the case for touring giant Firme, which was unable to perform at La Onda Fest in Napa Valley, Calif., on June 1. Chicago's Michelada Fest, featuring Mexican music headliners Luis R Conriquez, Firme and Gabito Ballesteros, cancelled its two-day summer event over artist visa “uncertainty.” 


	In general, U.S. visa uncertainties under the Trump administration have upended multiple communities and groups of people. “Everything is taking longer under Trump,” says attorney Daniel Hanlon, who specializes in immigration law. “It's a combination of a few things, including stricter vetting policies, which have resulted in delays in visa processing almost across the board. We're seeing this with foreign students at universities and now these musicians, and no one knows how it's being brought to the attention of those who are in the position to make these revocation decisions, or why they are deciding to do this now. It could be completely politically motivated.” 


	In an unprecedented move, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau announced on X that the State Department had revoked Los Alegres del Barranco's work visas after the group portrayed images “glorifying” drug kingpin “El Mencho” at a concert in Mexico in March. “In the Trump Administration, we take seriously our responsibility over foreigners' access to our country. The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” his post reads.  


	In Mexico bans on narcorridos have spread across the country, where now 10 states have implemented laws to control or limit the diffusion of corridos in public spaces. But the U.S. had yet to really take a stance on the lyrics, which can be compared to gangster rap. That quickly changed this year when a wave of regional Mexican acts began to be impacted by visa delays, going beyond those who sing narcocorridos. Grupo Firme and Julión Álvarez — two of the biggest touring acts in the genre's history, breaking barriers for regional Mexican artists in the U.S. — are mainly known for norteño and banda ballads and party songs, not narcocorridos particularly.  


	“We don't know what we are fighting against because we really don't know the reason these visas are getting denied or revoked, and it seems like it's no longer just because they sing narcocorridos, which is what they initially had said,” says Mariana Escamilla, vp at Promotores Unidos USA, a longstanding organization composed of promoters who specifically work the regional Mexican touring circuit. “People don't have the confidence to buy tickets in advance anymore if the artist is coming from Mexico. That's a huge problem because we rely on pre-sale to determine if an event is going to sell or not. Now, I think fans will wait until day-of to buy the ticket when they see that the artist has finally landed in the U.S.” 


	Non-immigrant visas like O-1 and P-1B, the ones artists typically apply for “extraordinary achievement or ability,” are short-term work permits that need to be renewed by the artists and their petitioners and must include an agenda listing performances scheduled and where they're performing every single time they apply. But even after being approved, these visas can be revoked at any time. Once the visa gets delayed by the State Department, for reasons like “administrative processing,” there's no timeline for resolution. “It's a euphemism for basically more background checks,” adds Hanlon. “It is unknown to the applicant what they are looking at, where they are looking or what they are looking for. They use that as a blanket to delay the processing of visas. So, the visa is refused until that's resolved and then it could be issued or approved later but often it goes into a black hole and there's nothing much you can do about it.” 


	In a statement sent to Billboard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico said, “Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally do not comment on U.S. government actions with respect to specific cases. Continuous vetting and visa revocation actions are not limited to visa holders from any specific country or area in the world. All visa applicants and visa holders, no matter the visa type and where they are located, are continuously vetted.” 


	What could be interpreted as targeting Mexican music and culture aligns with the Trump administration's “disdain for Mexicans,” says entertainment attorney Marjorie García, partner at King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano. “Any indication that [artists] are singing about anything the government doesn't like, just like they [want to cancel] funding for PBS and NPR, if you're not saying the things they want you to say, there is a perception that you don't get to be here.”


	Whether intentional or not, the timing couldn't have been worse. In the past few years alone, regional Mexican has exponentially grown in popularity and global exposure. In 2023, Billboard reported that regional Mexican music consumption in the United States had jumped 42.1% year over year, outpacing gains in the Latin genre overall, as well as country, dance/electronic, rock and pop, according to Luminate.  


	“The regional Mexican music movement can't keep growing if its artists can't tour the U.S.,” García says. “All aspects of our business will be impacted. Before, you could predict the length of time that you needed for the visa process; you had a window. But now, the visa is being pulled after it's already given, and as you get closer to the show, and at that point, you either show up or pay. There's no way you can plan for someone to cancel your visa. This is all going to have a chilling effect when artists voices are most needed and in demand.”  


	Visa delays or revocations will almost certainly not fall under a contract's force majeure clause, meaning event cancellation insurance very likely won't cover it. “It's up to individual artists to apply for those visas and get their documentation together. If the U.S. government says no, that's almost assuredly not going to be covered by event cancellation insurance,” says attorney Tim Epstein, partner at Duggan Bertsch, who represents most of the independent events and festivals in North America, including Sueños and Baja Beach Fest. “Maybe once a year you were dealing with artists having to cancel concerts or festival performances over visa issues, but having a whole festival canceled because of artist visa issues … I have never seen that before.” 


	The financial impact this will have on artists who can't tour the U.S. will be long-lasting. “A group like Los Alegres del Barranco that has a large following in the United States and already had contracts signed there, it is devastating financially,” Luis Alvarado, spokesperson for Los Alegres del Barranco, tells Billboard. “It is obvious that there is some kind of movement against Los Alegres del Barranco, but also against musicians who play this genre of music (regional Mexican). We're waiting first to clear the judicial process in Mexico and then begin a conversation with the U.S. government.”  


	The U.S. is the No. 1 market to tour in — it's the “base for success,” says Cárdenas. “You get guys like Firme and Julión who gross $10 million in one night here. This is where you make the big money — you don't make the money in Mexico, with all due respect.” 


	For now, Cárdenas is staying optimistic and working diligently to help resolve this issue. “There are thousands of people working at the stadium when a concert happens, from parking, to vendors, production staff, all kinds of occupations that didn't make any money because the Julión show didn't happen,” he says. “That weekend, we lost more than $2 million that we won't recover. How many of these instances can we survive? If this was a small promoter, it would go out of business immediately. You can't lose $2 million every weekend.  


	“Someone has to go see the guys in Washington and tell them, ‘Listen, we have to fix this,'” Cárdenas continues. “This is not $100 or $200, this is millions of dollars; we have 50,000 people in one stadium. They consume everything — food, water, beer, and people are working, trying to make a dollar. Now, we're talking to the political sector, calling our local congressmen and senators, and they are aware of the situation, and I'm sure they will fix it. Otherwise, this will jeopardize the entire industry.”

	Lauren Miller Rogen was 22 years old, celebrating her graduation from college the first time she noticed something was happening to her mother, Adele. It was relatively minor: “She repeated herself — she told a story a few times about a friend of hers,” Rogen says. But for Rogen, who had watched Adele care for her own parents as they slowly succumbed to Alzheimer's disease, it was the potential future that unnerved her. 


	Within two years, Adele, a first-grade teacher, would be diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at age 55. By that time, Rogen was living in Los Angeles, and dating her then-boyfriend, the actor Seth Rogen. When the couple married a few years later, Adele's condition had progressed to the point that it wasn't clear at their wedding if she even realized who Lauren was. “She knew I was the bride — she kept calling me the bride,” Lauren recalled in Taking Care, a documentary the couple made to raise awareness about the challenges that families face while caring for a person with advancing dementia. 

	











	The toll of caring for Adele was hardest on Lauren's father. “There was a time early on, before we brought care in, where we were like, ‘Oh, we're gonna lose him first.' This — caring for her — seemed like it's literally killing him,” she says. “Without being able to afford outside help, I dread imagining what would have happened.” The couple went on to found a nonprofit, Hilarity for Charity, that disburses grants to offset the cost of caring for a person with dementia.

	











	“Until we were part of the care system, we didn't realize how broken it was,” Seth says in a video they recorded on behalf of the organization Caring Across Generations, to raise alarms about the threat families face under a pair of proposals to slash health care programs for the poor and disabled that are being considered at the state and federal level, and encourage people to contact their legislators. He adds, “Millions of low income families, families of people with disabilities, families that have older adults in them, are facing this struggle every day right now.  And that is why it is so unfathomable that federal and state legislatures are making massive cuts to Medicaid as we speak.”

	“We are cutting crucial services for people who are aging and disabled,” he explains. “That means these people will be losing access or have less access to the health care they need, creating more out-of-pocket expenses and medical debt.”


	In Washington, President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which was recently approved by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, would cut roughly $600 billion from Medicaid in order to help pay for a new round of tax cuts for the wealthy.


	The Trump tax bill is projected to kick over 10 million people off Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The legislation would also limit so-called provider taxes, which states use to provide supplemental payments to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers to help pay the costs of treating Medicaid patients. The bill would additionally impose a financial penalty on states, like California, that offer health coverage to undocumented immigrants.  


	In California, the situation could be compounded by further cuts proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that would slash Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program.


	Roughly one quarter of the 5 million Americans with dementia rely on Medicaid, the country's largest payer of long-term care. Medicaid is a pillar for caregivers — some 12 percent of recipients are people who can't work because of their responsibilities caring for a family member. Their ability to access the program could be jeopardized by the Big Beautiful Bill, which would impose work requirements on all able-bodied adults under 65 in order to qualify for Medicaid.

	“Almost everyone in this country knows or loves someone that relies on Medicaid, even if they don't rely on Medicaid themselves. And we have the power together,” Lauren says in the video.

	











	“We need to reject any cuts or changes that would take more care away from families that need and deserve it,” Seth adds. “At the state level and the federal level.”

	In her documentary Call Her Alex, the media personality and Call Her Daddy podcast host Alex Cooper detailed alleged sexual harassment she said she endured during her three-season stint on the Boston University women's soccer team that began in 2013. In the film, which premiered at Tribeca Film Festival, Cooper claimed that her then-coach, Nancy Feldman, developed a fixation on her that led to “deeply uncomfortable” interactions, including verbal remarks and physical touch.


	“My sophomore year, everything really shifted,” Cooper said in the documentary, per Vanity Fair. “I started to notice her really starting to fixate on me way more than any other teammate of mine. And it was confusing because the focus wasn't like, ‘You're doing so well. Let's get you on the field. You're going to be a starter.' It was all based in her wanting to know who I was dating, her making comments about my body, and her always wanting to be alone with me.”


	Cooper noted that since she was attending Boston University on a full-tuition scholarship, she felt limited in her resources and options while navigating the alleged harassment. “I didn't follow this woman's rules, I was gone,” she said, adding: “Every time I tried to resist her, she would say, ‘There could be consequences.'” Cooper alleged that she submitted written documentation detailing her interactions with Feldman to Boston University. “They said, ‘We're not gonna fire her, but you can keep your entire scholarship and that's that.' No investigation. Within five minutes, they had entirely dismissed everything I had been through.”

	Feldman and Boston University did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. 

	











	In the film, Cooper claims that Feldman would pry for personal details about her intimate relationships. “It was this psychotic game of, ‘You wanna play? Tell me about your sex life. I have to drive you to your night class, get in the car with me alone,'” Cooper said. “I started trying to spend as little time as possible with her. Taking different routes to practice where I knew I wouldn't run into her, during meetings, I would try to sit as far away from her as possible. Literally anything to not be alone with this woman.”

	In one scene, Cooper and her former teammate Alex Schlobohm recalled unusual game tape reviews during which Feldman would allegedly make comments about Cooper's body. “We're gonna rewind my tape every five seconds and we're gonna talk about my hair and my body,” said Cooper. She recalled Feldman making remarks along the lines of, “‘Look at those legs. Everybody, look at Alex in her uniform.'”

	When Cooper and her parents first considered pursuing legal action prior to the start of her final year at Boston University, the attorneys they spoke to warned them of the grueling process that would await them. “If I'm gonna be real with you, they will drag this on for years and this will be your life,'” Cooper recalled being told. But they did agree that “this is clearly a case of sexual harassment.”


	Cooper ultimately did not play soccer during her senior year at the university. Feldman retired in 2022 and received the declaration of “Nancy Feldman Day” in Boston on Dec. 11. “I felt a lot of anger—anger at my coach, anger at my school, and anger at the system that allowed this to happen,” Cooper said. “I don't think anyone could've prepared me for the lasting effects that came from this experience. She turned something that I loved so much into something extremely painful.”

	Delighted Splinter Cell fans were shown a trio of clips from the upcoming animated Deathwatch series today at Annecy as Ubisoft execs gave them a peek into the making of the highly-anticipated Netflix adaptation.


	The audience at a packed Salle Pierre Lamy were shown three clips featuring the first appearance of protagonist Sam Fisher, voiced by Liev Schreiber, an epic fight scene and a car chase.


	The creative team talked the crowd through the various influences that have had such an impact on the TV version, which fast forwards Fisher's story to 2025. One of Ubisoft's flagship franchises, the hugely popular game series follows Fisher, the highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops sub-division within the NSA, dubbed “Third Echelon”, as he overcomes his adversaries. Having first been announced in 2020, the Ubisoft series will air later this year on Netflix.

	Director Guillaume Dousse said he approached the immense task of helming an adaptation of one of the world's most beloved video games by melding Michael Mann and Japanese director-animator Satoshi Kon. Live action noir properties like Ghost in the Shell were also a major influence, he added.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We took huge inspiration from live action,” he said. “There is this element of melancholy to the mise en scène. We wanted it to be full of contrasts.” 


	Dousse incorporated lengthier, fixed shots, a rarity for animation, as he cited the famous 17-minute scene in Steve McQueen's Hunger as an example of something he wanted to move towards. The creatives repeatedly stressed that the eight-episode show takes its time, going against the grain of super fast-paced narratives. The soundtrack was also hugely important, with Dousse citing  inspirations like Ozark and Tokyo Vice.


	Another slightly more unlikely inspiration for the older central character was Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise, who has been making those movies for decades and has grown up with them. 


	“It was interesting to have this ageing character, not totally like the Tom Cruise version but more realistic, and more weathered by life,” said producer Hugo Revon.

	











	Notably, Schreiber is taking on voice duties from Michael Ironside. Ironside, who voiced Fisher in the games, has previously said he is too old to return for the show. 


	Schreiber was “important for the project” as he is known for live action and the show is aiming to attract a broad audience who simply enjoy a great narrative, Revon said. “His voice comes to life,” he added of the Ray Donovan star. “It is so natural.” 


	The show brings the action to Europe and was described as a “roadtrip around Europe” by Ubisoft development manager Carl Tamakloe. 


	Fast forwarding to 2025 meant facing up to the realities of how war has changed since Splinter Cell first started out as a game.


	“We were interested in hybrid warfare,” added Tamakloe. “Fake news can destabilize a state. We wanted to be rooted in the idea that in 2025 you don't fight like you did in 2000.” 


	Without giving too much away, Tamakloe revealed some of the show will be set around the fictional Cop 31 climate conference, drawing out themes of energy and power.


	The first Splinter Cell video game was released in 2002. A series of tie-in novels following Fisher on his missions as a black ops agent were published in the mid-2000s. 


	The team were speaking on the first day of the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in the south of France, which is being attended by all the big American studios.

	President Donald Trump called for the military to be deployed against anti-Immigrations and Customs Enforcements (ICE) protests in Los Angeles. The protests, which began in response to ICE raids at various workplaces on Friday, escalated over the weekend after Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops into the city over the objections of Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats. 


	“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” Trump wrote early this morning on Truth Social. In another post, the president called for law enforcement to “ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” 


	U.S. Northern Command issued a statement on Sunday indicating that “approximately 500 Marines from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at Twentynine Palms, California, are in a prepared to deploy status should they be necessary to augment and support the DoD's protection of federal property and personnel efforts.” 


	The call from the president to deploy the military against U.S. citizens — a power that hasn't been invoked by a president since the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles — would be a serious escalation of federal involvement in what local authorities say remains a manageable, if in sporadic instances violent, outbreak of public protest. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Some Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have indicated their support for the deployment of military personnel to California. On Sunday night, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) shared a screenshot of a controversial opinion piece he wrote in 2020 calling for the military to be deployed against Black Lives Matter protests. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media Sunday night that “if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.” 

	











	The president and his administration have targeted Los Angeles and several other so-called “sanctuary cities” — cities and other state or local jurisdictions that limit its cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — as sites to conduct highly publicized ICE raids on immigrant communities. While the administration claims that they are focusing enforcement actions on criminals, acting ICE Director Tom Homan admitted today that ICE has been sweeping up migrants who just so happened to be at the location of one of their targets, including mothers, high school students, and migrants arriving to immigration court for scheduled hearings. As the administration's enforcement actions grow in intensity, and stray from the bounds of legality, Trump and his allies have claimed protests against their increasingly authoritarian tactics are effectively an illegal impediment to federal operations.

	“A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations,” Trump wrote on Sunday in a post that bears little resemblance to what is actually happening in the city. “Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.” Trump claimed on Monday that Los Angeles would be “completely obliterated” if he hadn't sent in the National Guard, and told reporters that it would be “great” if his administration arrested Newsom.


	In a Sunday press conference, Bass said that “what we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that has been provoked by the administration.” 


	“When you're at Home Depot and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans to our streets you cause fear and you cause panic and deploying federalized troops is a dangerous escalation,” Bass said. “We need to be real about this, this is about another agenda, it's not about public safety.”

	Bass added that the city remained committed to protecting the First Amendment rights of protesters, but that those legal protections “do not give you the right to be violent to create chaos are to be violent to create chaos are to vandalize property.”

	Newsom formally requested on Sunday that Trump revoke his federalization of the National Guard and withdraw them from the city. “In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, state and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property. Indeed, the decision to deploy the National Guard, without appropriate training or orders, risks seriously escalating the situation,” he wrote. 

	











	“There is currently no need for the National Guard to be deployed in Los Angeles, and to do so in this unlawful manner and for such a lengthy period is a serious breach of state sovereignty that seems intentionally designed to inflame the situation,” Newsom added.

With the 10-episode “Murderbot” series, we actually get two sci-fi shows in one: There's the main sci-fi comedy from Chris and Paul Weitz about a rogue security robot (Alexander Skarsgård) hiding his free will while on a dangerous mission with a group of scientists. In addition, there's Murderbot‘s favorite space soap opera that he watches for escapist fun: the cheesy “Star Trek” parody, “Sanctuary Moon” (starring John Cho as the Captain).

For production VFX supervisor Sean Faden, this meant wrangling a diverse array of nearly 1,800 VFX shots (spread among DNEG, Pixomondo, Image Engine, and Fin Design, among others). This included the opening and closing of Murderbot's helmet (his practical white suit was created by costume designer Laura Jean Shannon), the UI that reflects his POV (accompanied by his snarky voice-over commentary), a giant alien worm, and the realistic VFX used on the bridge of the spaceship on “Sanctuary Moon.”

“For the opening and closing of the helmet, the pitch that we had for the VFX team [at DNEG] with Chris and Paul was something mechanical based on the design of the suit itself,” Faden told IndieWire. “And then let the nanotech just kind of help us justify the pieces getting small enough that they could all fit together. 

 










“So that's why, when you watch it,” he continued, “the pieces still kind of have a motion to them that is more or less related to the shape of the helmet design itself. But the thing that was really fun was that Murderbot doesn't really wanna open its helmet most of the time, and I thought it would be great to have a button to play with. In Episode 1, it just opens quickly because it needs to. But, in Episode 2, Murderbot presses it and there's a pregnant pause to show that he's just messing with Gurathin [David Dastmalchian], who he doesn't like.”

For the floating graphics displaying Murderbot's system alert, Faden worked with Finn and their design team, Super Vixen. He even had an idea of making the graphics character-driven during a Murderbot fight scene with another robot. That's where he cycles through all of his opponent's programmed moves so he can successfully counter-punch.

“We wanted to bring all these graphics for fight enhancement that are still telling the story,” he said. “We did 20 or 30 versions of this shot until we had something that we all felt was working. Sometimes it would feel too fast or too long. It was like, what was the right amount of time for the audience to be able to read what was happening? And it was cycle, cycle, cycle, and then pose match, and then do an outline, blink, on the other unit until he's found the right match. And then you can rewind it and show that he's actually going to do the same move. I think we found the right sweet spot.”

 










The alien worm from DNEG was obviously very different from their iconic sandworm from the “Dune” franchise. This was more like a caterpillar body with odd patterns on its plates and a snapping turtle mouth. The sharp, bending legs were inspired by the warrior bugs from “Starship Troopers,” which Faden previously worked on. 

“When the worm swallows Murderbot, we literally had a kiddie tunnel attached to a crane with a camera and dropped that on,” said Faden. “Our stunt guy would actually get a real reaction of being inside the kiddie tunnel with a bunch of grips rocking it around and getting him knocked back and forth.”

Meanwhile, the use of an LED wall from Pixomondo to create the background environments on “Sanctuary Moon” was intended to look impressive in combo with a real set, despite the show's cheesy vibe. “We had the footage on the screen, and it was all tracked to the camera,” Faden added. “And we had three cameras running at once, so sometimes the lock off camera on the side might just be seeing a wall and didn't have to track, and that was okay. Whereas the hero camera would track with the standard volume workflow. That worked really well.”

But “Murderbot” also made use of a lot of good drone location footage from Toronto, Moab, Utah, and Iceland. “I went to Utah and shot a ton of stuff for over two days,” Faden said. “And a lot of those wider establishing shots were used for the Hopper spaceship. I think a huge part of the success of our show visually was that we were able to get that drone footage from a lot of different locations. And then we treated them. Fin added clouds, skies, and color corrected them. And then that material was put onto our LED walls, so that was really helpful.”

 










“Murderbot” is now streaming on Apple TV+.

The parody king is still showing younger performers from John Mayer to Clairo how to stand out — and stay in the game.


													By
												

	Rebecca Milzoff



Am I the first person to feel strange calling you ‘weird'?”


	John Mayer — bespectacled, grinning goofily, very much nerding out — is sitting across from “Weird Al” Yankovic, interviewing the Hawaiian shirt-clad parody music king, who is sitting across from him for his SiriusXM show, How's Life With John Mayer.


	“You can call me Al, like Paul Simon says,” Yankovic says with smile, before adding that the most normal thing about him is, probably, his pancreas.

	











	It's a funny quip, but also an understatement. Let's just get this out of the way: “Weird Al” Yankovic is, beneath his accordion-playing, polka-loving surface, exceedingly normal. He likes long evening walks to get his steps in. He enjoys seeing movies and trying out new restaurants with his wife and daughter, who just graduated college. He grumbles good-naturedly about the ongoing renovation of his home in the Hollywood Hills. (“It's going to look almost exactly the same as it did before, except it cost a fortune!”) The 65-year-old artist's one attempt at rock star behavior, back in his early-'80s heyday, was comically un-vain: On a touring rider, he requested, in the spirit of Van Halen's famed ban on brown M&M'S, “one really horrible Hawaiian shirt for every show I did.” (On that run, he did 200, and a collection that now extends to a storage unit somewhere in greater L.A. began.)


	Still, if not precisely weird, Yankovic is truly singular. His catalog can be divided into two types of songs: intricately crafted, meticulously arranged, hilarious yet never mean-spirited parodies of hits by acts ranging from Michael Jackson to Coolio to Nirvana to Lady Gaga, and original pastiches, for which he deep dives into artists' catalogs to create songs that, with eerie accuracy, mimic the sounds and idiosyncrasies of those genre-spanning artists.

	











	Between the two, he has accomplished feats usually reserved for the very artists he parodies. During each of the first four decades of his career, he has had entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and eight of his albums have reached the top 20 on the Billboard 200 — including his most recent studio release, 2014's Mandatory Fun, which became his first No. 1 on the chart. He has won five Grammy Awards and an Emmy. Billboard estimates he has sold 12 million albums in the United States (based on RIAA certifications pre-1991 and Luminate data from 1991 on).


	Incredibly, he's done all this without ever changing his essential “Weird Al”-ness. “From day one, there was never even a discussion that would not be about following his singular vision,” says Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager of 43 years and sometime creative collaborator (notably, they co-wrote the now nerd canon comedy UHF, which Levey also directed). “It's hard to find any career where there's literally no compromise, but we might be able to count on one hand the number of compromises he's made in his career.”


	Sometimes, that's meant turning down lucrative deals, like the $5 million beer endorsement that Yankovic passed on in 1990 because, he feared, the brand was “trying to make me into Joe Camel.” Many times, it's meant standing up to record-label executives, like when, amid his “draconian” first album contract with Scotti Brothers (an indie then distributed by CBS), he was asked to shoot 10 music videos on a $30,000 budget simply because he'd proved he could do one for $3,000. (“I'm like, ‘No. No, I can't!' ”)


	But just as often, it's meant embracing an open-to-anything spirit that seems to almost always work out in his favor. Yankovic decided very early in his career to ask permission of any artist he parodied — not because the law required it (it doesn't) but because he simply had no interest in making enemies. With very few exceptions, it turned out, the artists said yes, even supposedly impossible-to-convince ones like “American Pie” scribe Don McLean, who OK'd “The Saga Begins,” Yankovic's 1999 parody that essentially ­summarizes the plot of Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace. “When I heard his version, I thought it was better than the original. The sound quality was superb,” says McLean, who calls Yankovic a “straight-ahead good boy” who “could be on Leave It to Beaver.”

	











	Thanks to that combination of earnest good intentions, work ethic, backbone and obsession with quality, Yankovic finds himself in an unusual position today: He's no novelty relic of the '80s, but a truly cross-generational artist. In the past six years alone, he's portrayed Rivers Cuomo in Weezer's “Africa” music video, played accordion (and appeared in the video) for teen rock band The Linda Lindas' 2024 single “Yo Me Estreso” and lip-synced dramatically in a tux in Clairo's “Terrapin” video. “Growing up with his videos was a massive thing in my generation,” says Clairo, 26. “Back when YouTube was really simple, it really hit home for us in middle school to watch his parodies. He always knew how to draw people in.”


	He and his team will prove just how true that still is when Yankovic heads out on the Bigger and Weirder Tour this summer. It's his fastest-­selling, biggest-grossing tour yet, according to his agent, Wasserman Music's Brad Goodman, and his biggest by other metrics, too: an eight-piece band (his largest yet) onstage; first-time venues bigger than any he's played before, including New York's Madison Square Garden and L.A.'s Kia Forum; a mini-Las Vegas residency (the tour will open June 13 with six sold-out nights at The Venetian); and stops both expected (Red Rocks Amphitheatre) and less so (Riot Fest) on the route. And the concert itself is a trademark Weird Al spectacle: part rock show, part revival tent, part Broadway musical, all “joy bomb,” as actor and longtime fan Andy Samberg puts it.


	Whether it becomes a springboard for the next Weird Al era is anyone's guess — including Yankovic himself. Right now, he has no further plans to release albums; and since Mandatory Fun arrived over a decade ago, he's only sporadically released new music, most recently the 2024 “Polkamania!” single (the latest in his long-running series of madcap polka medleys, this one recapping the past decade's pop highlights, all sung in Yankovic's manic tenor). Around that time, his contract of roughly 20 years with Sony ended, and he decided not to renew with the label, or sign with anyone else.

	











	“Nobody owns any piece of me,” he says, exhaling. “I'm at a point in my life where if something isn't going to be fun or a pleasant experience, I have no problem saying no, even if it's a lot of money or a lot of eyeballs. I can do literally whatever I feel like doing.”


	Then again, for Yankovic, that's always been true.


	“When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about being the next Weird Al, like it's a position he applied for and got,” says Lin-Manuel Miranda, a lifelong fan who's now also friends with Yankovic. “And then you grow up and realize, ‘Oh, there's only one of that guy.' We're not going to see ­another Weird Al.”


On an overcast April afternoon a few days after the Mayer taping, Yankovic meets me for lunch at Crossroads, a vegan spot in West Hollywood where, years ago, he ate his first Impossible Burger. He's quick to jokingly note that he is not a member of the city's “vegan elite” — still, as he walks in, a man walking a golden retriever stops his phone conversation to stare and declare, “It's that Al Yanko-vich guy!”


	Despite his talent for writing songs about junk food (“My Bologna,” “The White Stuff”) and the fact that he once consumed the world's most ungodly snack, a Twinkie Dog, in UHF (watch and barf a little), he's been vegan since the early '90s.


	Chalk it up to veganism, staying out of the sun (“I melt in direct sunlight”) or following the directions of his longtime hair stylist, Sean James, very well (he never blow-dries those famous ringlets, hence their eternally bouncy and well-defined nature), but Yankovic has an ageless quality that lends many of his fans to liken him to mythological figures. “He's Santa Claus for nerds of a certain stripe,” Miranda says, a comparison Mayer had also made (as well as to Forrest Gump). His curls may be a little grayer, but his ultra-expressive face — acrobatic eyebrows in particular — reflects his eternal curiosity and up-for-anything-ness.

	











	As we settle in for almond ricotta-stuffed zucchini blossoms and meatless bolognese, Yankovic is particularly animated recounting his previous weekend, when he made his latest surprise appearance: his Coachella debut. To close out its surreal set, the crew from the cult-favorite kids show Yo Gabba Gabba! brought out a cast of characters both human (Thundercat, Portugal. The Man's John Gourley) and not so much (cartoon mascots like Sleestak, PuffnStuf and Duo the Duolingo owl) to sing “The Rainbow Connection” with its composer, Paul Williams — and, on lead vocals, Yankovic.


	“I've had a pretty bizarre life, so it wasn't like, so unusual,” Yankovic reflects. “But it was definitely a little bit of an out-of-body experience.” He admits that the “hey kids, let's put on a show” energy was fun and that the invite wasn't a total shock (having appeared on a season-three episode as an accordion-playing circus ringmaster, he's tight with the Gabba group). Still, he speaks of such invites with a kind of humble awe.


	“Nothing I've ever done was me thinking, ‘Boy, I hope kids discover this 40 years from now,' ” he says. Starting in the '80s, he released an album almost every year “because I was afraid I would be quickly forgotten. It was drilled into me: ‘You're a comedy artist, you're a novelty artist, you're lucky if you're a one hit-wonder — you're not destined to have a long career.' I wanted to grab that brass ring every time I went around.”


	Coming up concurrently with the birth of MTV, and savvily taking advantage of it, helped Yankovic snatch that ring. He had a keen ear for (and good taste in) hits at a time when, thanks to both MTV and top 40 radio's prevalence, a monoculture reigned — and perhaps even more importantly, he knew the power of a viral video before such a thing existed.

	











	Tweaking hits like Jackson's “Beat It” (“Eat It”) and Madonna's “Like a Virgin” (“Like a Surgeon”), Yankovic created new songs that, thanks to his painstaking re-creations of their arrangements, were immediately recognizable but rewarded repeated consumption — as did their accompanying videos, in which Yankovic demonstrated his incredible eye for detail and formidable acting chops. “MTV was on like video wallpaper in the background 24 hours a day,” he says of that time. “They were hungry for content, and I was anxious to give them content.”


	Since then, Yankovic's understanding of the promotional power of visuals has remained prescient — take when, leading up to Mandatory Fun's arrival, he insisted on releasing a music video on YouTube each day (not all at once, as some advised) to whet fans' appetites for the album. And his genre-agnostic approach to making music has proved ahead of its time, too. Before hip-hop was widely accepted as pop, he was especially drawn to rap. “A lot of pop songs are very repetitive,” he says. “How can I be funny in seven syllables, you know? But rap songs, I mean, it's nothing but words, and it's easy to craft jokes that way.”


	Parodies like “Amish Paradise” (Coolio's “Gangsta's Paradise”) and “White and Nerdy” (Chamillionaire's “Ridin' Dirty”) are among his most streamed — though he's been equally adept at literally any microgenre he takes on, from just-electrified Bob Dylan (“Bob,” entirely comprising palindromes) to arty new wave (the Devo pastiche “Dare To Be Stupid”) to crunchy Detroit garage rock (“CNR,” a tribute to Charles Nelson Reilly through the lens of The White Stripes).


	“The more you listen to him, the more you get access to making [any genre of parody] sound legitimate,” says Samberg, who calls Yankovic the biggest influence on his own comedic music group, The Lonely Island. “The nature of what he does is incredibly populist. He's not snooty about it; he's like, ‘This is what the kids like, and as long as I have a good angle comedically, I'm going to do it.' And because of that, it's always appealing to young people.”

	











	Growing up in Compton-adjacent Lynwood, Calif., Yankovic listened to rock radio, but as a teenager found playing the accordion a bit solitary. (His friends' rock bands weren't really interested in an accordionist joining up.) “When you take accordion lessons, I think the high-water mark is ‘Maybe someday I'll play in an Italian restaurant or at a wedding,' ” he says with a laugh. “I guess I was shameless. I grew up a complete nerd in high school. And when you're not somebody that's socially acceptable, you kind of have nothing to lose. I kind of held on to that mentality: Like, you know, ‘Who cares?' ”


	He didn't look to any particular musician's career trajectory as one he could follow. “It was more cautionary tales” — and one was especially haunting. One of his idols was Allan Sherman, the satirical singer best known for his 1963 summer camp send-up, “Hello Muddah Hello Fadduh!” “He was the last person to have a No. 1 comedy album before me,” Yankovic continues. “He had three No. 1 albums on, like, the pop charts — incredible! But within a few years, he completely burned out. He made some terrible choices in his personal and professional life and just went off into obscurity and sadly died a few years later. So I was always more concerned about, ‘Don't mess it up. Keep doing what you're doing and just try not to make bad choices.' ”


	“In a way, we're almost always looking over our shoulders at that,” his manager Levey says. He cautiously admits that he and Yankovic have ­finally reached a level in his career where they're “no longer at the point where every year [of continued success] is a surprise,” then adds, “I don't actually even like saying that out loud because it sounds like you're taking something for granted.”


	But if Sherman was a rocket that blasted off only to burst into flames, Yankovic has been the opposite: one that, as Levey puts it, has kept steadily traveling through space — maybe sometimes at a slower speed than others, but never plummeting back down to Earth, buffeted by the most unexpected boosters. Like, say, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, the 2022 parody of a music biopic that Yankovic co-wrote, starring Daniel Radcliffe in the titular role. Despite at first airing only on the Roku Channel, it won almost universal acclaim and a prime-time Emmy, while expanding Yankovic's universe yet again.

	











	“His longevity is a testament to his ability to be himself and stick to what his taste is, because it's so specific,” Radcliffe says. (“Bob” is his favorite Yankovic track, and he took the opportunity on set to ask his hero how he came up with all the palindromes.) “He threads a really hard-to-thread needle between wholesome fun and something … genuinely deranged and very, very strange. And in a way that is not affected.” At a time when the culture values authenticity above all else, Yankovic is a walking example of it — never not himself.


	Unwittingly proving the point, Yankovic gasps in glee as our lunch ends. “Mochi doughnuts!” He shows me a photo his wife has just texted him: a box of the treats for dessert later. Somewhat sheepishly, he explains the occasion: “Eric Idle is coming over for dinner tonight. That's my big flex for today.”


Later that afternoon, Yankovic meets me in a park near Coldwater Canyon called Tree People. He looks a little like a more aged version of his faux-Indiana Jones in UHF: Hawaiian shirt (a Goodwill buy), sensible shoes, safari hat shielding the waning sun.


	“I'm gearing up for a big tour, so I'm mostly just making sure I don't have a heart attack onstage or pass out or something,” he says of the walks he takes in spots like this. “I think I've lost 20 pounds in the past couple months just because I'm not, like, eating junk food at midnight anymore.”

	











	Yankovic's last tour outing didn't require much of a physical regimen. In 2022 and 2023, he took to smaller venues for The Unfortunate Return of the Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour, a follow-up to the first Vanity Tour in 2018. The idea, he recalls, occurred to him when “I was putting on my ‘Fat' suit for the thousandth time and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it just be nice to like, go out onstage and play the songs, sit on a stool and have an intimate evening with fans?' ”


	So Yankovic eschewed the usual production level of his tours — costumes, wigs, the parody hits — for a concept, his agent Goodman says, that the musician himself wasn't entirely convinced would work. Instead, it allowed him to visit new, smaller major-market venues (Carnegie Hall, Tennessee's The Caverns) and ­strengthen his presence in off-the-beaten-path markets (like, say, Huntsville, Ala.) while superserving his ride-or-die fans. When the concept returned in 2022, he played 162 Vanity shows globally (extending into the next year).


	“I loved it, the band loved it, the people who showed up loved it, and it definitely scratched that itch,” Yankovic says. “And now,” with the Bigger and Weirder Tour, he's back to “doing a show for everybody.”


	For Bigger and Weirder, Yankovic is in self-described “overpreparer” mode, the hyper-organized creative core of his team. “I came up with the setlist a year ago. I gave the band” — three of whom, as of our meeting, he has yet to meet — “their marching orders and said, ‘Here's the setlist, here's your charts, here's the demos, here are the rehearsal days.' ” He personally chooses and edits all the show's video content — clips of Weird Al in Pop Culture (say, on The Simpsons or 30 Rock) over the years that will play between songs and give him and the band time for the most frantic element of the show, which the audience never sees.


	“We have stage props, wigs, a lot of costume changes, and a big portion of what we need is a quick-change area behind the scenes onstage, usually 40 by 20 feet,” says Melissa King, his tour manager of nearly 20 years. On Bigger and Weirder, Yankovic will do 20 costume changes, give or take a jacket or hat; his band members will do nine; and all will occur in 45 seconds maximum.


	That backstage planning ensures that in front of the audience, the man who has spent his career parodying rock and pop stars is free to embody one himself. “When I speak to [talent] buyers and say, ‘Have you seen the show?,' if there's a pause, for sure I know the answer is no,” Goodman says. “Because if you've seen the show, it's just an immediate ‘Yeah, of course, it's incredible.' ”

	











	Onstage, Yankovic isn't just physically “working his ass off,” as Samberg says. “As a vocalist, he's f–king incredible,” Radcliffe marvels. “He has this amazing, clear tone. His range is so impressive — he does things to his voice that, as somebody who sings a bit in musicals sometimes, if I tried that I'd hurt myself.”


	Despite the “bigger” aspects of this tour — like how it will use three trucks instead of the usual one — King is still one of just 11 people comprising the crew. “It's very lean, but it works because we all work together,” she says. “Al's a genuine, kind person, and because he is, that's the way everyone in our camp is.” That ethos extends to both the fans who'll attend (“There aren't many arseholes who are Weird Al fans,” Radcliffe observes) and how Yankovic treats them: According to Goodman, he's kept maximum ticket prices for Bigger and Weirder to $179.50 and has always refused to engage with platinum ticketing.


	Right now, the tour is Yankovic's focus. When he decided against renewing his Sony contract, Levey says, they tested the waters with “very limited outreach” to a mix of indie and major labels. “And we got great offers and I brought those offers to him, and he thought about it and said, ‘I'm really loving this feeling of not being under contract to anybody … Please tell these people how appreciative I am of their generous offers and we're just not going to accept any of them.' ”


	He's now independent in the truest sense: He has an imprint, Way Moby, that's technically now his label, but he describes it more as existing for theoretical recording purposes. He figures he'll put out a single here and there, contribute to soundtracks if he's asked and, as always, remain open to what may come — like making a surprise appearance last November to duet with Will Forte on Chappell Roan's “Hot To Go!” at a charity event or developing a Broadway Weird Al jukebox musical that he says is in the very earliest creative stages, a “bucket list” project.

	











	“When [he had] the No. 1 album in the country, that was such a triumphant moment. I remember us celebrating,” Samberg recalls. “It just shows you — I don't think anyone else will really touch that space. It's his space. No one is going to say, ‘I'm going to do what Al does,' 'cause good luck. He owns that until he doesn't want to do it anymore.”


	The world, Yankovic knows, is also not the same as when he first became famous. “I got a record deal, I got on MTV, and I kind of had the market to myself,” he reflects. “Now the playing field has been so leveled that anybody can upload their material to YouTube or various portals like that. And if the stuff is good, chances are people will eventually see it. I'd like to think that if I was coming up now, I'd still do OK, but it would just be more of a challenge.”


	It's a generous sentiment, a reminder that, as Miranda puts it, one of Yankovic's many talents is also “reading the room.” But in its humility, it's also a reminder that, flooded as the market may now be with funny people on the internet, none of them, still, are doing it like Weird Al: the 65-year-old who once thought he'd play accordion at weddings and Italian restaurants, who's about to make his Madison Square Garden debut.

He and Gunnar Weidenfels detail the blockbuster unbundling of WBD: Decision "reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together."


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told Wall Street analysts Monday that the “bold choice” to effectively unbundle the company he helped forge three years ago “reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together.”


	“We are in the midst of this generational disruption, and things are changing, they've changed significantly in the last few months,” Zaslav said.




	The CEO and WBD CFO Gunnar Weidenfels (who will become CEO of the spun out TV networks business once the deal closes) hosted an investor call early Monday, outlining the rationale that led to the looming split and detailing a little bit about what each business will look like once they deal is complete.

	“These companies will be better aligned with shareholders based on each business's individual dynamics and growth prospects, more agile, more aggressive and creative in pursuing growth and sharper in their ability to deliver consumers more of the stories and entertainment they demand,” Zaslav said, adding that they expect each business to attract very different sets of investors.


	Zaslav will oversee the studios business, which will include the Warner Bros. film and TV studios and HBO Max, while Weidenfels will manage the global networks, including TNT, TBS, CNN and the former Discovery channels, as well as Discovery+. Notably, it will also include WBD's sports rights, with the CFO suggesting that the rights could give it optionality down the line: “The U.S. sports rights will reside at the global networks, and its management team will determine how best to monetize the streaming and digital rights over time,” Weidenfels said.

	











	But as strong an asset as the sports rights are, Weidenfels will also assume one of WBD's least desirable assets: Its tens of billions of dollars in debt.


	“It's safe to assume that the majority of the debt is going to live with global networks and a smaller portion — but a not-insignificant portion — on streaming & studios as well,” he told analysts.


	The executives remained coy on how the companies will team up after the split, though they indicated that they may still work together on things like distribution and ad sales, but that each company will also focus on their own business and do their own deals.


	Zaslav says of his future company, “We feel like we've found a very compelling strategy of quality,” leaning into HBO.


	“We put HBO back in [to HBO Max] for a reason. People see us as the highest quality streaming service out there,” Zaslav added. “We have the highest quality motion picture library, TV library, as all the HBO content. And then we have the ability with Warner Bros. Television in order to augment, which we did with The Pitt, which we're doing with Harry Potter. So we're the biggest maker of television.”


	“The piece that is up and down is the motion picture business,” he added, noting that it is more hit-driven and smaller compared to the TV business.


	“We have confidence in that business, but it's probably the more difficult business in terms of margin and swings,” Zaslav added, outlining the plan moving forward. “I think the thing that I feel best about is we put real discipline around it, but our overall content is underused — our great iconic content — rather than overused. So we'll be going more and more to the best content that we have, that people see and love all around the world, whether that's Lord of the Rings or DC. [WBD film chiefs Mike DeLuca and Pam Abdy] are really looking at mining the big brands. We're still going to do a lot of original, but mining those big brands that give us a real advantage in the marketplace.”

	











	As for the TV networks, Weidenfels told investors that “I have full conviction that we will see very successful networks for many, many years to come.”


	“The desire for people to consume content, especially from recognizable and iconic brands like TNT, sport, Food Network, CNN, etc., none of that is changing,” he added.


	Zaslav said that content from the linear networks account for about 25 percent of HBO Max viewing and that the split will likely come up during carriage negotiations, though a series of deals made over the past year mean no major talks are imminent.


	“There are times when you have distributors that really just want HBO Max, and we've ended up in protracted discussions trying to create a alignment around more of our products,” Zaslav said. “And there are times when people just want the free to air and the linear services.”


	But the split is also part and parcel with potential dealmaking.


	Weidenfels told investors that once the deal closes, each company should be “free and clear” to pursue deals, unlike the WBD deal, which had a complex structure that meant it would have to wait two years to do anything meaningful.


	“We do believe the transaction provides each business with greater ability to capitalize on potential options and opportunities that may arise, but I also want to stress that there is no such plan,” he added. 


	And in the meantime, there will be even more cost efficiencies to find and deals to strike.


	“Look, the important point for me is, yes, we will have to continue to focus on efficiencies and drive efficiencies as the traditional part of that business continues to see secular pressure,” Weidenfels said. “But I also think that we do have very significant investment opportunities and there will be more opportunity for driving efficiency and and transforming those brands into a into a digital future.”

Taylor Swift‘s Reputation has slithered its way back into the Billboard 200 albums chart at Number Five after the musician announced that she finally owns her entire catalog of music. The record previously spent four weeks at Number One following its 2017 release and has racked up 349 total weeks on the chart. It's also the one album Swift hasn't finished re-recording, though she doesn't really need to anymore.


	Last week, pre-masters victory, Reputation sat at Number 78 on the chart. The surge, per Variety, is the result of a 1,184 percent increase in album sales and a 125 percent increase in streaming, equivalent to 34.75 million streams.


	Fans are basking in guilt-free listening sessions now that Reputation is in Swift's sole possession. She purchased the album, along with the five that preceded it, from the investment firm Shamrock Capital. The firm itself ended up with her masters following a drawn-out series of sales that began with her former label Big Machine Records selling her catalog to Scooter Braun. Swift responded by setting off on a mission to cutting down the value in all of those albums by re-recording them.

	But that fight is all over now. The new battle Swift faces is figuring out how to recapture Reputation for its Taylor's Version release, if it ever received one in the same capacity as her previous albums 1989, Speak Now, Fearless, and Red. “I know, I know. What about Rep TV?” Swift wrote in her letter to fans announcing her ownership win. “Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it.”

	“The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it,” she continued. “All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”


	Swift shared loose plans to release the extra songs that were planned for the re-recording. “There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch,” she said. “I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”

Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band are back with another new song from New Threats From the Soul. The single “Monte Carlo / No Limits” features additional harmony vocals by Jenny Rose and strings courtesy of Elizabeth Fuschia. Give it a listen below.

A visual artist, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter based in Louisville, Kentucky, Ryan Davis gathered his band back together to record New Threats From the Soul with producer Seth Manchester at Machines With Magnets. The follow-up to 2023's Dancing on the Edge was led by the single “New Threats From the Soul,” a nearly 10-minute barn burner of a country song complete with a guest spot by alt-country icon Catherine Irwin of Freakwater. The full album is due out July 25.

At a certain point in Celine Song‘s sophomore feature “Materialists,” her follow-up to her much-loved “Past Lives,” I started to fixate on something a little strange: the Manhattan office in which our lead Lucy (Dakota Johnson) spends her days trying to arrange enduring romantic matches amongst the NYC elite. At first glance, the crowded and colorful office seems luxe; it's lined with desks and filled with eager matchmakers like Lucy, bubbling with feminine energy and joy. When a match goes really well — i.e. when the couple gets engaged, the ballyhooed happy ending of all romances, naturally — a bar cart is rolled out and all the young matchmakers gather around each other and cheer for their good fortune, and for the seeming success of love itself. They've done it! Love wins! The fees they collect for their services don't hurt, either.

Yet, the more time we spend in Lucy's office, the cheaper, the sadder, the darker it looks. Those desks? They look as if they will collapse at any minute, smushed into each other as if we were at some no-nonsense nail salon, no room to breathe, no space to think. The bar cart? It's wobbly. When it all gets too much, even Lucy heads straight to the fire escape to get some air. It is, quite simply, not at all what it looks like at first blush.

Neither is “Materialists.”

You'd be forgiven for taking the marketing bait on this one (even we did!), because while Song's second film may look, on the surface, like a glossy rom-com throwback about a beautiful woman (Johnson) split between two handsome men (Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans) as they wine and dine around a glittering Manhattan, “Materialists” is not a romantic comedy. It's not even a comedy, and your read on how romantic it is will be entirely fueled by how willing you are to grapple with a subject that rom-coms seldom broach: the limits of what love can do for someone.

Cynical, sad, increasingly fucked up, and often gloriously mean, Song has turned the genre inside out to show us how shallow these stories can be. In short, imagine if the decree that a film centers on “the love you could only find at the movies” wasn't a compliment, but a stern provocation. And while Song is not always successful at this challenge, the result is compelling, dark, and worthy of considerable discussion. 

Did you really think Celine Song, already one of our best chroniclers of what love actually is, would make a shiny little rom-com about good, happy people? Please.

It opens, hilariously enough, with a vignette centered on the romantic rituals of cavepeople. Even they, Song argues, engaged in courtship activities, weighing the merits of their paramours against the needs of the real world. And when two of her cavepeople make it official, it's not so much a happy occasion as the inciting incident for several millennia of good (and bad) unions.

 










For Lucy, love is a transaction. Her clients are goods. The dating scene? It's a market. No wonder she's been so successful at matchmaking (Johnson's naturally cool reserve works wonders for the role), her work steeped in running the numbers and comparing pros and cons, assessing potential romance like one might consider a business deal. Her various clients are not always of the same mind, however, and as Song pushes Johnson through increasingly awful, impersonal, and darkly funny meetings (women who only want tall men, men who only want younger women, and worse), it's easy to see why Lucy has become so clinical. 

A flashback, inspired by running into her ex John (Evans, working in the kind of downbeat register we haven't seen from him in years) at the wedding of two of her clients, further illuminates things: John and Lucy first came to the city years ago, itching for success, and too poor to even afford not just a full evening out on the town, but the parking fees for a single stint in a parking garage. Sick to death of being poor, Lucy ended things with John. Years later, their love for each other is still apparent, but so is the financial divide between them: John has yet to make it as an actor and is instead cater-waiting at the wedding, Lucy is there as a cherished guest.

 










Also on offer at the wedding: the groom's handsome brother Harry (an appealing Pascal), the kind of “unicorn” Lucy would love to fix up with some of her very eager female clients. But Harry is taken with Lucy, even when she's crystal clear: the number one thing she is looking for in a potential husband is that he's rich. The number two thing is that he's rich. She is, after all, a materialist. Fortunately, Harry is rich! And, as we come to learn, he's also very much of the same mind of Lucy about what romance is. A transaction. A deal. A merger.

As Harry and Lucy swan about the city on increasingly luxurious dates, John lingers at the edge of Lucy's mind. What if love really was about love? Not money or safety or incredibly nice penthouses (the first night they spend together at Harry's, Lucy appears to more revved up by the swanky spread than Harry's furious kisses)? Well, Lucy sure as hell ain't the person to interrogate that. 

Until she is. As Lucy — analytic, cold, and totally aware of her emotional deficiencies — attempts to juggle a most unexpected internal war, something happens that even she could not predict or prevent. For all her planning, for all her precision, for all her “let's take the emotion out of romance and get you married!” gusto, Lucy simply can't control people and what they will do. That this horrific upheaval comes care of Lucy's work is the real kicker. If her trusted professional methods can fail so terribly, what does that say about the way she conducts her personal life?

 










That destabilization is enough to push Lucy into new spaces, both expected and not. Who will she choose? John, who might not have a pot to piss in (and, even if he did, he'd have to share it with his many roommates), but sees Lucy as she is and still wants to be with her? Harry, who fully understands how love should look and move, and only uses that as a shield to his real self? Talk about bad options.

But while Song is eager to engage with these ideas — with the very nature of love itself, no small feat — even “Materialists” can't escape the pull of wrapping things up in a tidy bow full of big reveals and bigger proclamations. Or is that all part of a deeper trick, a wilder swing? Love itself may remain a mystery, but the way “Materialists” feels about it is not. Just don't fall for the shiny package.

A24 will release “Materialists” in theaters on Friday, June 13.

Some attendees of a Tribeca Festival post-screening panel on Friday appeared to be under the impression that it was a Cyrus concert.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Some Miley Cyrus fans who paid top dollar to attend the Tribeca Festival debut of the singer's new visual album, Something Beautiful, appeared to be under the impression that a post-screening Q&A would include a concert. When Cyrus sat down with the film's co-directors, Brendan Walter and Jacob Bixenman, and producer Pano Cosmatos to discuss the project on Friday night, they were interrupted by hecklers who demanded that she sing a song.

	











	“We thought this was a concert. We paid $800,” yelled one disgruntled attendee in a video posted on X. After initially appearing to ignore the shouts and smiling through the disruption, Cyrus looked confused and asked, “what?,” before turning to face the audience when the woman added, “Are you actually going to sing?” The interruptions continued, with a man yelping, “Miley, sing ‘The Climb!'” 


	Always happy to make her fans happy, Cyrus acquiesced and began an a cappella version of the song, telling the crowd, “You have to start it,” before giving them the first verse of the 2009 Hannah Montana: The Movie hit. “I can almost see it/ That dream I'm dreaming/ But there's a voice inside my head saying/ You'll never reach it,” she sang, gently berating the crowd for “not singing” as she finished the second verse.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Cyrus appeared unfazed by the disruptions in an Instagram pic post from the premiere on Saturday, in which she wrote, “Seeing Something Beautiful on the big screen at @tribeca @beacontheatre surrounded by the screams of the audience, was so worth every bit of effort lovingly labored into this visual album. Tonight was emotional, deep, fun & fabulous. All my favorite things, but YOU the crowd were my absolute favorite of all. I love you.”

	











	The Tribeca site clearly promoted the event as a screening of the 55-minute visual album, followed by “an exclusive conversation with Miley Cyrus,” with no mention of a musical performance. Something Beautiful will open in theaters on Thursday (June 12).

Caleb McLaughlin, Gabrielle Union, Nick Kroll, David Harbour, and Jenifer Lewis also join the NBA superstar in the basketball-themed feature, which screened first footage at Annecy on Monday.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	NBA superstar Stephen Curry is taking on his first major acting role in GOAT, a basketball-themed animated feature from Sony Pictures Animation.


	The action-comedy, directed by Tyree Dillihay (Bob's Burgers), and Adam Rosette is set in an all-animal world and follows Will, a little goat with big dreams who gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot to join the pros and play roarball – a high-intensity, co-ed, full-contact sport dominated by the fastest, fiercest animals in the world. Curry is also a producer on the feature.




	Sony on Monday unveiled the main voice cast for GOAT on Monday. Joining Curry on the roarball court are Stranger Things alums Caleb McLaughlin and David Harbour; Bad Boys II actress Gabrielle Union; Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan; Black-ish actress Jennifer Lewis; actor and comedian Patton Oswalt (Ratatouille, Young Adult); and veteran writer and voice actor Nick Kroll (Big Mouth).

	The star-studded voice cast was announced out of the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on Monday, June 9, where Sony screened exclusive footage of GOAT for the first time.


	Curry is producing the feature together with Erick Peyton of Unanimous Media and alongside Michelle Raimo Kouyate, Adam Rosenberg, and Rodney Rothman of Modern Magic. David Schulenburg co-produced the project, with Rick Mischel and Fonda Snyder as executive producers.


	The film marks Curry's first foray into animation, but he was an executive producer on Roxann Dawson's 2019 biopic Breakthrough, and a producer on the documentaries Sentenced and Good Shot, among other projects.


Sony Pictures Animation is releasing GOAT in collaboration with the NBA theatrically on February 13, 2026, timed to the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, which runs Feb. 13–15.


	The 40th Annecy film festival runs through June 14.

	The original action-comedy set in an all-animal world, follows Will (voiced by McLaughlin), a small goat living a downbeat life in an urbanized jungle community called Vineland, who is obsessed with roarball, spending every spare minute at the public court practicing moves and shooting hoops.


	A high-intensity, co-ed, full-contact sport dominated by the fastest, fiercest animals in the world, roarball takes its cue basketball but with modifications to fit the animal kingdom such as a special perforated hardball, suited to paws and claws, as well as regulations allowing two and four-legged movements.


	Will's big dreams become reality when he gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot to join the pros and play for his local team, the Thorns.


	His new teammates aren't thrilled about having a little goat on their roster, but Will is determined to revolutionize the sport and prove once and for all that “smalls can ball!”


	Union voices Jett Fillmore, a black jaguar and the star player of Will's new team who is none too happy about his signing.


	Further teammates include rhinoceros Archie Everhardt (Harbour), komodo dragon Modo Olachenko (Kroll),ostrich Olivia Burke (Coughan) and giraffe Lenny Williamson (Curry). Lewis voices the Thorns' tough-talking porcine Thorns owner Florence Everson.

	











	Other characters include Mane Attraction, a powerful stallion and rival player, with an impressive shock of hair, who plays for the Magma team in the Inferno Lava Coast region. 


Goat is produced by Curry and Erick Peyton of Unanimous Media, Raimo Kouyate, Adam Rosenberg, and Rodney Rothman of Modern Magic. David Schulenburg co-produced, with Rick Mischel and Fonda Snyder as executive producers.


	Sony Pictures Animation will released the movie theatrically In collaboration with the NBA on February 13, 2026, to tie in with NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles running from February 13 to 15)


	“We're excited to bring together an all-star cast to voice the incredible characters in Goat,” said Peyton and Curry. “Goat is the kind of story we love to tell at Unanimous— full of heart, humor, and high-octane action that we hope audiences of all ages will cheer for.”


	Four-time NBA Champion, two-time MVP, and 2024 Olympic Gold Medalist Curry and Peyton launched production company Unanimous Media in 2018 to create content focused on family, faith, and sports.

International TV Co-Editor


Warner Bros. Discovery is officially splitting into two separate companies.


	The David Zaslav-led conglom had signaled the move with an internal reorganization that grouped its businesses into Streaming & Studios and Global Networks earlier this year. On Monday — a bit earlier than many expected — it announced the separation will become an actual split along the lines of what Comcast has underway spinning out its cable networks from NBCUniversal, in a seismic reconfiguration of the U.S. media business.


	Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels becomes president and CEO for Global Networks. Both will continue in their present roles at WBD until the separation, which is expected to close in mid-2026.

	“The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world. It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history,” said Zaslav in a statement. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape.”


	Zaslav's new Streaming & Studios outfit will consist of Warner Bros Television, Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, as well as their film and television libraries. Global Networks, meanwhile, will include premier entertainment, sports and news television brands around the world including CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, top free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as the profitable Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report.


	Legacy media is responding to major shifts in the business led by the rise of streaming and faster-than-anticipated decline of linear television that has left investors confused and stock prices floundering. Comcast has said it expects the initiative for its cable spinoff, called Versant, to be completed by late 2025. The idea is that cable network groups like these two, which still throw off significant cash and revenue, could merge or be acquired by buyers like private equity firms that would manage their decline, so these splits are likely to presage a period of media M&A.

	











	Legacy media companies have been making similar moves of late. Lionsgate's split from Starz was confirmed last month.


	“This separation will invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles. This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value,” said Wiedenfels. “At Global Networks, we will focus on further identifying innovative ways to work with distribution partners to create value for both linear and streaming viewers globally while maximizing our network assets and driving free cash flow.” “We committed to shareholders to identify the best strategy to realize the full value of our exciting portfolio of assets, and the Board believes this transaction is a great outcome for WBD shareholders,” added Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of  WBD's board. “This announcement reflects the Board's ongoing efforts to evaluate and pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.”


	Benefits, WBD said, will unlock value for shareholders and create opportunities for both new businesses to thrive. They include equipping each to be faster and more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that strengthen their competitive positions; forming world-class management teams focused on creating greater strategic flexibility and focus so that each business can invest in and pursue its operational and financial goals; and enabling each company to be more agile and attract a shareholder base aligned with its growth prospects and financial profiles.


	WBD said it intends the split to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that the new companies plan to implement arm's-length transition services and commercial agreements post-separation “to facilitate the transition and maintain continued operational efficiencies.”

Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong has joined the artists condemning ICE raids amid the ongoing L.A. protests.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong has shared a message of support amid protesters rallying against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration's recent deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.


	On Sunday evening (June 8), Armstrong posted a protest snippet from downtown L.A. via Instagram Stories, captioned with a middle-finger emoji and an ice cube. The clip featured a live recording of “F— Off,” a track from Saviors (Édition de Luxe), the deluxe version of Green Day's 2024 album, released in May 2025.

	











	The post comes amid increasing criticism of federal raids across Southern California, which saw ICE agents detaining dozens of individuals alleged to be undocumented immigrants. The crackdown was quickly followed by the unrequested deployment of National Guard troops to L.A., marking one of the first times in modern history that the Guard was sent to a state without the governor's approval.




			Trending on Billboard		







	California Governor Gavin Newsom slammed the move as a “serious breach of state sovereignty” in a letter issued Sunday afternoon, while L.A. Mayor Karen Bass echoed that sentiment, calling the situation “provoked chaos” during a press conference.


	Armstrong's statement also follows comments from Finneas, who claimed he was tear-gassed while attending what he described as a “very peaceful protest” in downtown L.A.

	











	The Grammy-winning producer and artist posted several Instagram stories, writing: “Tear-gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown — they're inciting this.” Finneas also reposted a video showing 9News Australia correspondent Lauren Tomasi being struck in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting live from the scene.


	The protests began Friday in response to ICE raids at several Los Angeles-area businesses. By Sunday, the National Guard had arrived in the city, and images of heavily armed officers confronting peaceful demonstrators, including journalists and musicians, began flooding social media.


	For Armstrong, this latest act of resistance fits squarely within a decades-long tradition of speaking out against institutional injustice. Green Day's discography is filled with political commentary, from the anti-Bush sentiment of American Idiot to more recent critiques of gun violence and authoritarianism.

Both 'Gypsy' and the George Clooney-fronted 'Good Night, and Good Luck' were shut out despite landing five nominations apiece.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast, THR.com


	Early in the 2025 Tony Awards, host Cynthia Erivo singled out an “up-and-comer” who landed his first nomination this year: George Clooney.


	The Oscar-winning actor-director was going places, Erivo suggested, but just hours later Clooney, who got a number of onstage shout-outs during the awards ceremony that aired live on CBS, left the Tonys without the Broadway play receiving a single award, despite being nominated for five honors, including a best actor in a play nod for Clooney, which he lost to Oh, Mary!‘s Cole Escola.




	The play, which has been breaking records with its multimillion-dollar weekly box office grosses, closed out its run with a matinée performance before Sunday's awards, after which Clooney quickly went back to his natural hair color, which he'd dyed brown for the show, and Saturday night's performance aired live on CNN in a highly touted special.

					Tony Awards: 'Maybe Happy Ending' Wins Big, Nicole Scherzinger Takes Home First Tony		
			









	Similarly, the latest revival of Gypsy, which landed five nominations, including an historic 11th nod for Audra McDonald, making her the most Tony-nominated performer in history in addition to holding the record for most awarded performer in Tonys history, was also shut out Sunday night, with McDonald losing the best actress in a musical award to Nicole Scherzinger for Sunset Blvd.


	Other notable shutouts included Dead Outlaw and John Proctor Is the Villain (seven nominations each), Floyd Collins and Just in Time (six nominations each) and Real Women Have Curves (two nominations), with Real Women‘s best shot at a win coming in the score category, where it lost to Maybe Happy Ending.












	Indeed, though Maybe Happy Ending had already received multiple awards by the time Darren Criss‘ name was called as the best actor in a musical winner, his win, on his first nomination, was still somewhat of a surprise as he was in a tight race with Jonathan Groff, who was gunning for his second Tony in a row.


Death Becomes Her only won one award, for best costume design, given to Oscar-winner Paul Tazewell, despite the musical going into the Tonys in a three-way tie with Maybe Happy Ending and Buena Vista Social Club for the most nominations with 10 apiece.


	In an upset, Purpose won the Tony Award for best play, besting Oh, Mary! and John Proctor Is the Villain, starring Sadie Sink, both of which had been buzzed about — at the box office and in the industry — and considered top contenders for the Tony. But Purpose, which follows a powerful family in Black American politics recovering from scandal, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year and saw five of its cast members nominated for Tony Awards, including Kara Young, who won a Tony for the second year in a row.


Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, the playwright of Purpose, also won best revival of a play last year for Appropriate, starring Sarah Paulson.


	The play category was particularly stacked this year, however, as it also included Sanaz Toossi's English, which won the Pulitzer in 2023.

It's a very big summer for fans of Dean DeBlois' animated film gems who have also felt the burning desire to see classics like “Lilo & Stitch” and “How to Train Your Dragon” reimagined in live-action form. While the live-action version of his “Lilo & Stitch” continues to dominate the box office (even as this same critic believes it should be the death knell of such remakes, oopsie), DeBlois himself is back in the mix, making a live-action debut of his own with a new spin on his classic “How to Train Your Dragon.”

This one? Well, it's good enough to pull me back from the brink of demanding that all such remakes be burnt be fire. I will likely even happily turn out for its already-announced sequel, due in 2027. Mostly, what DeBlois and his team have done is capture the tone and whimsy of the 2010 animated hit, and pushed it gently into a live-action world that feels just as (if, oddly enough, not more so) plucked out of some family-friendly fairy tale.

Like the animated films, DeBlois' feature is based on the Cressida Cowell series of the same name, though DeBlois takes on sole screenwriting credit this go-round. Fans of the original animated film will likely feel some serious deja vu throughout the film's running time (just a touch over two hours, and it sure feels it in its first act), as it looks and moves and feels just like the first film (it's hard to not continue to impress this point, but let's try to move on from it).

 










DeBlois has, however, made a few canny changes. The island of Berk, so far off the map that no one really knows where it is, is still inhabited by the toughest of Viking warriors, with a tweak: these baddies moved there by choice. Culled from the best and bravest of all the tribes that the Vikings proper met on their travels (which means, yes, this fierce community includes people from all over the map), everyone who lives on Berk does so because they are fully committed to killing off the flying dragon scourge that has, for so long, bothered the island's human population.

Everyone, that is, except Hiccup (Mason Thames, recent star of “The Black Phone”). Despite his proud lineage (his father is the Berk's chief, Stoick the Vast, amusingly portrayed by Gerard Butler, who previously voiced the role in the animated films), Hiccup is kind of, well, a dork. He's clumsy, he's skinny, he's got bad timing with just about everything. No one (even his father, ouch) expects him to succeed in battle, which is bad enough, and that's without considering that his long-time crush Astrid (a delightful Nico Parker) is the toughest warrior of their generation. 

While Hiccup spends his days tripping around Goober's (Nick Frost) blacksmith workshop, everyone else his age (all characters imported directly from the first films, including the twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, Hiccup's rival Snoutlout, and potential pal Fishlegs) is getting ready to learn how to fight dragons. And, you know, be an actual member of this fierce Berkian society.

 










But Hiccup has a bit of a knack with engineering, and when he cooks up a double-barreled blaster meant to take down dragons, like the horrifying Night Fury, it seems his fortunes might have changed. Alas, during one night siege (silly enough to not scare the little ones, even as the entire village repeatedly goes up in flames), Hiccup aims his weapon at the shape of a Night Fury (no one, we're told repeatedly, as ever really seen one), shoots, and … what! maybe takes it down? When he goes searching in the forest for his catch, Hiccup is shocked to discover the absolutely cutest, cuddliest beastie the world has ever seen.

If everything and everyone in “How to Train Your Dragon” looks directly copied over from their animated counterparts, Toothless the Night Fury looks fully imported in, too cute and too “animated” to quite fit into this live-action world. While the character design has been elevated a bit, more scales and fiercer teeth, Toothless still sticks out amongst his brethren, all of whom look like “Game of Thrones” also-rans. This Night Fury? He's basically a big cat. Is that a feature or a bug? We can't be sure, but expect Universal to sell a whole hunk of new Toothless plushies in the coming weeks.

Also still the same: the overall messaging of the story, about how important it is to not only recognize our differences, but to celebrate them and use them to work together for the greater good. Everyone else in Berk doesn't see Hiccup's value. And Toothless? He's got an injury that keeps him from flying. In both of their communities, these outsiders aren't seen as being of use. But! Perhaps together! That could change! It's predictable, joyful Movie Messaging, and frankly, we all could use much more of it.

 










As Hiccup and Toothless bond, the would-be warrior learns more about the dragon world as a whole, enough to really give him a boost in his dragon-slaying lessons (much to Astrid's chagrin), and turning him into something of a celebrity. But what happens when the very raison d'être of his homeland (kill dragons) runs entirely against the thing he loves most in the world (flying with Toothless, care of cleverly made rig that allows them both to soar)? 

Well, you've seen the animated film. You know what happens, and while DeBlois might occasionally struggle to find the line between family-friendly entertainment and Viking-backed battles, that he can still find excitement and joy in this well-tread story is a testament to both his work and source material. No one needs a live-action remake, but ones this faithful and sweet are not the problem. 

Universal Pictures will release “How to Train Your Dragon” in theaters on Friday, June 13.

The 'Last Week Tonight' host is sharing his thoughts on the drama between the tech boss and the president that's playing out on social media.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


John Oliver didn't wait too long during the latest Last Week Tonight episode to turn his attention to the U.S., where he said “things have been chaotic.” Specifically, Donald Trump and Elon Musk‘s “war of words” on social media.


	A feud between the president and tech boss erupted days after Musk stepped down as head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and then openly criticized the Republican Party's One Big Beautiful Bill. The two men then proceeded to battle it out on their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), on Thursday, sharing a flurry of digital threats and insults directed toward each other.

	In one post, Trump claimed Musk had been “wearing thin, I asked him to leave,” before adding that “he just went CRAZY.” In response, Musk claimed with no evidence that the president was named in unreleased government files about the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “Have a nice day, DJT!” the tech titan added.

	“Setting aside that Trump being in the Epstein files is not a bombshell, it is a commonly held assumption,” Oliver quipped on Last Week Tonight about the public rift. “They've basically spent a full day fighting with big ‘Real Housewife energy.'”


	The British comedian then brought up Andy Cohen, who posted on X on Thursday, “LET ME HOST THE REUNION,” referencing the drama-filled Real Housewives reunion specials he typically hosts.


	Oliver said a reunion special “makes complete sense to me because at their core, these two men are real housewives. Both of them have hair that's expensive and wrong. Both have sketchy business ventures I don't fully understand. They both spend far too much time online, and if either of them isn't the center of attention for a single second, they will die.”

	











	“Honestly, the only thing that's missing is a messy in-person confrontation where Andy Cohen gets one of them to read a tweet and the other throws a daiquiri in his face,” Oliver joked before asking, “Why can't we have this?”


	While Trump and Musk had grown close over the past year, with the Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink CEO donating around $300 million to Trump's presidential campaign and Republican candidates ahead of the 2024 election, there now seems to be trouble in paradise.

Darren Criss also won his first Tony Award for 'Maybe Happy Ending' as did 'Succession' star Sarah Snook for 'The Picture of Dorian Gray.'


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Maybe Happy Ending, a musical about two robots falling in love, was the big winner at the Tony Awards Sunday, as the ceremony also awarded a number of firsts. 


	The musical took home the top prize of best musical, with Darren Criss winning his first Tony Award for leading the show, as well as four other Tonys, including best director of a musical. Nicole Scherzinger won her first Tony Award for her role as Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd. in one of the most hotly contested categories, beating out six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald.

	“Growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong. But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last,” Scherzinger said during her emotional acceptance speech.

Sunset Blvd. also won the Tony for best revival of a musical, for Jamie Lloyd's stripped-down reinterpretation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber classic. 


	Many of the races were particularly close this year, including best play, with Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' family drama Purpose taking home the trophy over Cole Escola's Oh, Mary! and John Proctor Is the Villain, starring Sadie Sink. 


	But Cole Escola won the Tony Award for best best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play, and the play's director Sam Pinkleton also took home a Tony. 


	Running to the stage in an outfit that paid homage to Bernadette Peters, Escola, who portrays Mary Todd Lincoln as a wannabe cabaret star, thanked the other nominees they had beat out in the category, including George Clooney. 

	











	“It's an honor to be in your company. And more than that, it's been a sincere pleasure spending time with you over these warm salads at all these luncheons,” Escola said. 


	In a celebrity filled season, Sarah Snook won the Tony for best performance by an actress in a leading role in a play for one-woman production of The Picture of Dorian Gray, in which she plays all 26 roles. The Succession star made her Broadway debut with the role, after performing the role in the West End. 


	“This means so much for a little Australian girl to be here on Broadway,” Snook said. “It is billed as a one-person show, and I don't feel alone any night that I do this show.” 


Eureka Day, a dark comedy about vaccinations, took home the Tony for best revival of a play. 


Kara Young also made history as the first Black performer to win two Tonys in a row, winning best featured actress in a play for her role as Aziza, a wayward friend thrown into the family drama of the Pulitzer-prize winning play Purpose. She has also been nominated four years in a row. 


	Natalia Venetia Belcon won best featured actress in a musical for her role as famed singer Omara Portuondo in Buena Vista Social Club, marking one of four wins the show, which was also up for best musical, took home. 


	Cynthia Erivo, who was this year's host, opened the ceremony with a backstage homage to Sunset Blvd., leading into a sung gospel number alongside the Broadway Inspirational Voices choir. Erivo, who won a Tony Award in 2016 for her role as Celie in A Color Purple, then took turns poking fun at the nominees in the audience, including Clooney, who she mentioned as a first-time nominee who was going places, and then herself. 

	











	“As they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property: ‘There's no place like home.' And Broadway has always been mine,” Erivo said.


	Erivo later greeted Oprah Winfrey in the audience and told her to look under her chair, under which she had placed a gift bag and items including candy and a model car. “You get a car,” she quipped. Winners who went too long in their speeches were played off by Erivo's singing. 


	Other starry names on Broadway, including Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, starring in Othello, and Kieran Culkin in Glengarry Glen Ross, were not nominated for Tony Awards and were not part of the ceremony. 


	Bryan Cranston, Allison Janney, Glenn Close, Jesse Eisenberg, Sara Bareilles, Jean Smart and Sarah Paulson were among the Tony Awards presenters. 


	Jak Malone won a Tony Award for best actor in a featured role in a musical for his roles in Operation Mincemeat, which includes a female secretary named Hester, a feat he accomplishes only with “simple adjustments to posture, voice and energy.” He was one of several nominees to hint at the current political environment in his speech. 


	“If you watched our show and found yourself believing Hester, then I am so glad to tell you that intentionally or otherwise, you might have just bid farewell to cynicism, to outdated ideas about that old binary and opened yourself up to a world that is already up there in glorious technical and isn't going away any time soon,” Malone said in his acceptance speech. 

	











	Michael Arden, who won a Tony for his direction of Maybe Happy Ending, also pointed to how “live theater confirms that no matter how different we may be from one another, we are all connected” and called on viewers to “Support the arts. Support artists. We need you now more than ever.”


	The broadcast featured musical performances by Death Becomes Her, Buena Vista Social Club, Just In Time, Sunset Blvd, Pirates! The Penzance, Maybe Happy Ending, Dead Outlaw, Flloyd Collins, Operation Mincemeat, Gypsy, Real Women Have Curves and a reunion of the original Hamilton cast, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr and Ariana DeBose and Jonathan Groff doing double duty performing with them and with Just In Time. 


	In the first half of the Tonys telecast, Stranger Things: The First Shadow largely swept the creative awards, taking home three design awards, while Maybe Happy Ending picked up two big musical awards, with writers Will Aronson and Hue Park winning best book of a musical and best original score. 


	Paul Tazewell won a Tony for best costume design of a musical for his designs on Death Becomes Her, in the musical's only win, after winning an Oscar for his costume designs on Wicked earlier this year. 


	Tony Award-winning actor Celia Keenan-Bolger received the Isabelle Stevenson Award for her advocacy work, including LGBTQ+ activism, and promoted Gavin Creel Fellowship, named after her late friend and beloved Broadway actor, which will provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors annually.

	











	Harvey Fierstein, a four-time Tony Award winner, received the lifetime achievement in theater award, for his work including Torch Song Trilogy, the 1982 play he wrote and starred in, which broke ground for its portrayal of gay culture, as well as writing the book for La Cage Aux Folles, Kinky Boots, Newsies and more. He received a standing ovation as he walked up and teared up before saying, “Don't make Mommy cry.”


	“What I find most humbling is the thought that somehow my journey means something to you,” Fierstein said.

The 78th Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall got off to a rousing start, as Oprah Winfrey blessed host Cynthia Erivo with a finger hold before the “Wicked” star took center stage to sing the original “Sometimes All You Need is a Song.” With the support of a choir, Erivo tipped her hat to the nominated movie stars (lyric: “Half of Hollywood did a play”), supplied powerhouse vocals, and brought the number to crescendo by getting the audience involved, briefly handing off the mic to Kristin Chenoweth, Aaron Tveit, and Adam Lambert, among others.

 










It was, indeed, a union of Broadway and Hollywood throughout the evening. During her opening monologue, Erivo noted that it was the most lucrative year in Broadway history (with reported ticket sales of $1.89 billion), “providing we don't run out of cast members from ‘Succession.'”

“Succession” star Sarah Snook was actually won the first Tony of the evening. In her Broadway debut, “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” Snook played 26 roles.
 










“It is billed as a one person show, and I don't feel alone any night that I do this show,” Snook said in her acceptance speech, shouting out her production's creative team.

Several of the nominated shows were, too, based off popular Hollywood films, including “Good Night, and Good Luck”, “Real Women Have Curls,” and “Death Becomes Her,” which used its cast performance to give a nod to Pride Month with the number “For the Gaze.” Several speeches paid homage to the LGBTQ+ community, as well, including Best Direction of a Musical winner Michael Arden.

“Growing up, I was called the F-word more times than I can remember, and now I'm a f*ggot with a Tony,” Arden said. “So, keep raising your voices, my friends. Keep loving and uplifting each other, standing up against intolerance any time you see it. And vote every chance you get.”

The original cast of “Hamilton” — including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Ariana DuBose, and Jonathan Groff — brought the house down with a 10th anniversary special “remix” medley.

Broadway's sparkle was cast liberally throughout the glittery festivities, and Erivo made several well-timed “Wicked” references. She also closed the show with a goosebump-inducing, revised version of “And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.”

 










But the true 11 o'clock number of the evening was the presentation of the highly anticipated Best Actress in a Musical category. Nicole Scherzinger won for her portrayal of Norma Desmond in “Sunset Blvd,” triumphing over Audra McDonald's turn as Rose in “Gypsy.” Glenn Close previously won for the same role in “Sunset Blvd.” in 1995.

“Growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong. But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last,” Scherzinger said in her acceptance speech.

“Sunset Blvd.” also won Best Revival of a Musical. Other winners included Darren Criss, who took home his first Tony Award for “Maybe Happy Endings,” which also won Best Musical. “Purpose” won Best Play, while Best Revival of Play went to “Eureka Day.” Cole Escola won Best Actor in a Play for their celebrated performance as Mary Todd Lincoln. Jak Malone (“Operation Mincemeat”), Natalie Venetia Belcon (“Buena Vista Social Club”), Francis Jue (“Yellow Face”), and Kara Young (“Purpose”) also took home acting prizes. Harvey Fierstein was presented with an Honorary Tony Award.

Among the presenters were Ben Stiller, Lea Salonga, Jean Smart, Samuel L. Jackson, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, and Sarah Paulson.

With video surveillance and social media at a fever pitch, the time for new takes on found footage is now, and you don't have to reinvent the smartphone to do it. “Man Finds Tape” uses a traditional lo-fi approach to an elevated horror concept when a strange presence starts zapping minds in the small town of Larkin, Texas.

Written and directed by Peter Hall and Paul Gandersman, the supernatural mystery follows siblings Lynn (Kelsey Pribilski) and Lucas Page (William Magnuson) through a playful reconsideration of the unreliable narrator. The filmmakers' background as novelists steers their world toward Stephen King territory, occasionally to its detriment. But in the end, their thoroughly imagined script pays off as a well-constructed monster movie — one that freshly challenges the sometimes-freeing, sometimes-suffocating subgenre and format.

Scary clips presented without context can be terrifying, but “Man Finds Tape” breaks new ground by tangling up its audience in a complex narrative told through dozens of perspectives. The pseudo-documentary is narrated by Lynn, whose self-directed interviews and childhood home videos reflect her deep care for the main subject, her brother. But only Lucas and a handful of the faux-film's other cinematographers are human.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Having moved away from her hometown long ago, Lynn makes it clear she doesn't believe Lucas' crazy theories about Larkin when they're talking on Zoom. When she does finally come to check on him, the Page's home security system shows Lynn discovering Lucas in a catatonic state. To explain how they got there, she'll use footage from her brother's viral YouTube series, “Man Finds Tape,” and old episodes from the faith-based talk show her parents, Holly (Akasha Villalobos) and Richard (Shane Brady), produced before they died.

The mysterious illness that killed the late Pages indirectly kicked off their son's decline. It'll take his sister's intervention years later to figure out how those pieces fit together, but after Lucas finds a bizarre tape hiding in the attic — labeled with his name — the amateur videographer wastes no time posting it on the internet. Like Lynn and his parents, Lucas has fun with the video project at first. Going viral like only “real” creepypasta stories can, the spine-tingling found footage shows Lucas sleeping as a kid. Who took it? And why?

That's not enough of a narrative hook to sustain an entire feature film, something the slippery but not unruly “Man Finds Tapes” was smart enough to know. Lynn arrives on the scene hoping to find answers. Instead, more questions spark and fly as the reluctant investigator grinds away at a mystery her brother couldn't solve. Reverend Endicott Carr (John Golson) was the star of “The Salvation Hour” back when the late Pages filmed it. Lucas had to apologize after publicly theorizing Carr was the voyeur in the video tape, so now both he and Lynn are stuck dodging legal action while trying to jog people's memories.

 










Keeping a steady clip and clocking in at a blissful running time, Hall and Gandersman discover two of their movie's best moment in car scenes. The bizarre blackouts are first explained with a bizarre hit-and-run that shook Larkin months earlier. The incident was caught on camera. It happened in broad daylight. And yet, there were seemingly with no witnesses to this man's tragic death. Watching grainy storefront footage of the intersection, Lucas and Lynn begin their detective work realizing someone else fell asleep at the wheel.

We get a more intimate understanding of Lucas, and a better look at the ingenuity of these filmmakers, during a second crash scene. It's shot entirely from the floor up on a “dropped” smartphone and relies on ambient noise to sell a calamity the driver isn't awake to see coming. Wendy Parker (Nell Kessler) is Lucas' girlfriend and — wait for it — Reverend Carr's surrogate. She's also the first of many in a wacky cast of local characters the Page siblings will have to interview on their quest to understand what is making everyone pass out. Winston Boon (Graham Skipper) is the first of many to nod off mid-conversation. It's a production challenge Lynn mostly ignores and a clever textural decision that will make you wonder if the narrator is still with us.

 










Comingling Reddit posts, text messages, 9-1-1 calls, and more, “Man Finds Tape” mixes several types of media before giving its villain a satisfying physical form. Aptly credited, The Stranger (Brian Villalobos) is only part of that problem and not the centerpiece practical effects portion of this film that monster fans should look forward to. How Larkin's unseen foe goes about manipulating minds without being seen proves key to protecting the town. Figuring out what its victims can — or won't — remember is half the fun, and even somewhat lacking in personality, Lynn and Lucas sell their good nature successfully.

Heavy exposition from The Stranger, slightly evocative of the neo-western “Dark Tower” books written by King, give away the debut directors as authors. Balanced with enough ‘80s flair, that's not a bad thing overall. A pleasant combination that doesn't break the mold but nonetheless festers with originality, “Man Finds Tape” strikes a unique seriocomic tone. One minute, you're leaning in to catch hints like you're watching “Blair Witch.” The next minutes, you're digesting motifs evocative of everything from “Slither” to “The Matrix.”

That chunkiness outstays its welcome by about fifteen minutes, and even bloated, the climax never gets as action, sci-fi, or fantasy heavy as you might hope. Still, Hall and Gandersman sell themselves as indie storytellers to watch through a combination of distinctly modern POVs and familiar horror tropes. Suffice to say, the found footage mark “Shelby Oaks” swung for but missed gets hit squarely here. That awkward effort, prematurely pushed by Neon as its big follow-up to “Longlegs,” won't release until later this year. It also raises a new question: Can “Man Finds Tape” come out before then?

 










From XYZ Films, “Man Finds Tape” had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on Sunday, June 8. It is currently seeking distribution.

Dennis Quaid, Jacob Tremblay and Martha Plimpton also appear in the Tribeca world premiere directed by Christian Swegal.  


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	It's been a particular pleasure to watch the blossoming of Nick Offerman's acting career in recent years. The actor, who rose to fame with his hilariously droll performance as Ron Swanson in the hit series Parks and Recreation, has never stopped working. But his talent has really risen to the fore lately, especially with his heartbreaking, Emmy-winning guest appearance in HBO's The Last of Us. 


	Now, with Christian Swegal's feature debut Sovereign — receiving is world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival before its theatrical release on July 11 — he's been given his meatiest film role to date. And boy, does he run with it.

The Bottom Line

	
	Topical and disturbing.
	



Venue: Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight Narrative)Cast: Nick Offerman, Jacob Tremblay, Dennis Quaid, Martha Plimpton, Thomas Mann, Nancy TravisDirector-screenwriter: Christian Swegal

									Rated R,
								1 hour 40 minutes			






	He's playing a role for which he has some previous experience. In Parks and Rec, his character was an anti-government libertarian. But what he played for comedy then is now deadly serious in this drama inspired by real-life events. The film, set in Arkansas in 2010, tells the story of Jerry Kane, a self-described “sovereign citizen” who proselyted against laws and governmental authority via appearances on right-wing radio talk shows and traveling around the Midwest delivering seminars about property rights and avoiding taxes. It's as if Ron Swanson had gone fully around the bend.


	A widowed, unemployed roofer, Jerry constantly faces eviction and home-schools his teenage son Joe (Jacob Tremblay, Room). He's a loving but disciplinary father, hectoring his son to say his prayers every night and reminding him, “Don't forget J.C.” Like many others of his ilk, he fervently believes in gun rights, illegally owning an AR-15 that gets him into trouble when he and his son are pulled over for a routine traffic stop.

	











	He's promptly arrested, with Joe being temporarily placed in a juvenile home, where he begins to feel some relief from his father's relentless intensity. The local police chief, John (Dennis Quaid, infusing his portrayal with low-key gravitas), understatedly tells Joe, “It sounds to me like your dad doesn't like the government so much. He has some…interesting ideas.” When Jerry is bailed out several days later by his on-and-off girlfriend Lesley Anne (Martha Plimpton, warmly affecting), he's even more extremist than before, threatening to sue the cop who arrested him, refusing to recognize the authority of the court, and walking out of the courtroom during his trial.


	Director-screenwriter Swegal intercuts the story of Jerry and his son with scenes involving the police chief and his grown son Adam (Thomas Mann), who's training to be in the force. Their relationship is loving but tense, with John constantly lambasting his son for such things as picking up his newborn baby whenever he cries. For a long while it's hard to understand why the narrative is split in such separate directions, until the stories fatefully intertwine in the film's shattering climax.


	Timelier than ever in its portrait of a radicalized margin of society rebelling against governmental authority, Sovereign might have benefited from a little more backstory as to what set Jerry on his non-conformist path. But it nonetheless works well on its own terms, especially in its depiction of the complicated relationships between both fathers and their sons.

	











	Offerman is simply terrific, supplying the outsized charisma necessary to make understandable Jerry's hold over vulnerable people while conveying the humanity that explains why his son and girlfriend are loyal to him. His character's tough-love approach is effectively dramatized in a digressive but powerful scene in which he gently but firmly forces Lesley Anne to confront her terrifying fear of horses. Tremblay, displaying a compellingly intense screen presence, is equally effective as the son who loves his troubled father enough to tragically follow in his footsteps.


	Also featuring an unfortunately underutilized (but always welcome) Nancy Travis, Sovereign benefits greatly from its empathetic, non-exploitative approach to its controversial subject matter. It's uncomfortable but necessary viewing.

New images of a young star, 2MASSJ1612, could have captured the birth of a giant gas planet larger than Jupiter.

Researchers have captured a mesmerizing image of what they believe to be a giant planet forming in the orbit of a young star, according to a new study.

The image, taken with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, shows the star surrounded by an eye-shaped disk of swirling gas and dust. A dark ring within the disk suggests that the gravity of a newborn planet, likely a gas giant, is accumulating material as it carves a path around the star.

"We are talking about a fairly massive planet here, a few times the mass of Jupiter most likely," study lead-author Christian Ginski, a lecturer in the physics unit at the University of Galway in Ireland, told Live Science in an email. "It clears out a gap as it orbits because material falls down onto the planet. One might almost think of the planet like a hoover in that sense sucking up all the dust."

This could be a rare example of a planet detected while still in its infancy. Ginski and his colleagues released a simulation of the potential giant exoplanet within the disk and hope to confirm its presence using the James Webb Space Telescope in the coming months.

The researchers posted their findings Monday (June 9) to the preprint database arXiv, with the paper accepted for future publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Ginski and his colleagues are trying to learn more about the diversity of planetary systems and the forces needed to create a solar system similar to our own. They do this by seeking out young stars, which could be actively giving birth to new planets. Ginski noted that while researchers have detected several thousand planets around distant stars, these are all quite old.

"We are basically looking at the meal after it is fully cooked," he said. "Young planets inside their forming disk help us to understand all the ingredients and how they interact with each other. So far we only have 1 confirmed such planet in its infancy and 2-3 more candidates which are not fully conf[i]rmed yet."

The young star at the center of the new image is named 2MASSJ16120668-3010270, or 2MASSJ1612 for short, and is located 430 light-years from our solar system. A 2024 study noted the presence of a gap in the star's disk, so researchers already suspected that there could be a planet forming there.



In the new study, 2MASSJ1612 was viewed in scattered near-infrared light for the first time, revealing previously unseen details, including two spiral arms emanating from the center of its disk. Ginski explained that the arms form because the planet is perturbing, or altering the disk, as it moves, creating what are known as density waves. He likened this effect to the ripples created by throwing a stone in a pond.

"The stone is perturbing the water, sending out waves, somewhat similar to the planet in the disk," Ginski said. "Now think about the stone skipping over the water instead of just plunging into it. Ever more complex wave pattern are the result. In the disk, where the planet circles around the star, this leads eventually to the formation of these spiral patterns."

Ginski noted that he has observed around 100 young star systems and that researchers typically find either the carved-out ring or the spiral structures, but in this case, the images revealed both — as theoretical models of planet formation predict. He said he felt like "a kid on Christmas morning" when he first saw the images.

"Basically it appears we may be looking at an absolute textbook case here," Ginski said. "So that makes us think that we can predict what kind of planet is in this disk, and we think it should be one that we can actually take an image of with the right equipment (which is why we secured follow-up time at the James Webb Space Telescope)."

				The Pentagon deliberately spread UFO myths to mask classified weapons programs like the F-117 stealth fighter. False evidence included doctored photos and fake alien craft stories.			


				Air Force officers were inducted into a fake reverse-engineering program called “Yankee Blue” as part of a decades-long hazing ritual. A 2023 Defense Department memo ordered the practice to stop.			


				A 2024 Pentagon report omitted findings about internal disinformation, including pranks and fake documents. A second, more complete volume is expected in late 2025.			

The Pentagon knowingly promoted UFO myths for decades to mask secret weapons development programs, especially at classified sites like Area 51. A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that military officials planted false evidence, including doctored photographs, to divert attention from stealth aircraft testing.

In one instance during the 1980s, an Air Force colonel gave fake “flying saucer” photos to a bar owner near Area 51. The hoax fed speculation that the military was experimenting with alien technology, when in fact, they were conducting stealth fighter operations.

A congressionally mandated 2024 report by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) found no credible evidence of alien spacecraft or reverse-engineering programs. However, the report also excluded key findings that revealed the military's role in spreading disinformation to the public.

According to the Journal, the Air Force pushed to omit sensitive details that could expose classified programs or damage careers. The Defense Department now says a second report, expected later in 2025, will include findings related to false documents and events used to perpetuate the UFO narrative.

As part of classified program briefings, the military sometimes initiated new officers into what appeared to be a top-secret project called “Yankee Blue,” which claimed to involve reverse-engineering alien technology. They showed officers staged photos of flying saucers and swore them to secrecy — often without revealing the fabrication.

What began as a loyalty test or prank evolved into a decades-long ritual. Some officers carried the story into retirement, repeating it even during official investigations. AARO uncovered the practice in 2023, prompting the Secretary of Defense to issue a memo ordering it to stop, calling it a form of hazing.

AARO recorded 757 sightings between May 2023 and May 2024, a sharp rise from prior years. Investigators later identified most of the sightings as drones, birds, weather balloons or satellite reflections.

Analysts determined that a widely circulated 2015 video, showing a fast-moving sphere, actually captured a misidentified object distorted by camera angle and the relative speed of a jet.

Congress has continued to press for transparency, forming a caucus to investigate UAPs or unidentified anomalous phenomena. Lawmakers are now demanding to know which agencies have participated in crash retrieval efforts.

The Defense Department says it will release a follow-up report to clarify the role internal disinformation played in shaping public and military perceptions of extraterrestrial contact.

An osprey flying over Myrtle Beach dropped the small shark from a tree after being harassed by crows.

A hammerhead shark recently crashed down on Splinter City Disc Golf Course in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. While waterspouts can pull fish from the sea and drop them over land, the culprit was a more common fish foe: an osprey (Pandion haliaetus) that had lost its lunch.

The unusual event took place on May 18 near the 11th hole of the wooded course near the ocean.

"It's not uncommon to see an osprey carrying something, but you take note because it's still really cool to see," Jonathan Marlowe, who witnessed the hammerhead fall as he was playing disc golf, told Garden & Gun magazine. "I thought it would be a random fish."

Instead, it was a small, dead hammerhead shark, easily identifiable by its wide, mallet-shaped cranial structure known as a cephalofoil.

Also known as "fish hawks," ospreys are excellent aquatic hunters and the only raptors with feet designed to catch slippery prey. But they tend to feed on fish less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long, and the hammerhead found on the golf course appears to be longer than a foot.

It's likely the osprey carried the fish at least half a mile (800 meters) from the ocean before losing its grip. Marlowe said two crows chased the osprey into a tree, where it dropped the hammerhead onto the ground below. Crows and other smaller birds are known to use a technique called mobbing to protect their territories during breeding season by teaming up to ward off predators.

According to posts on the Myrtle Beach Disc Golf Facebook page, wildlife such as snakes, raccoons, and alligators are common sights on local courses. But seeing a shark in the woods might just be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.



"We couldn't believe it and kept asking ourselves, 'did that really just happen?'" Marlowe said, who left the hammerhead behind in the hopes that the raptor might return and make a meal out of it.

Worldwide, there are 10 known species of hammerhead shark, and several populate the Atlantic Ocean along the coast of the southern United States.

A survey by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources that ran from 2013 to 2016 detected three types of hammerheads — bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) — in coastal waters off South Carolina and Georgia. And in 2013, a new, rare species was discovered in the same area. Named the Carolina hammerhead (Sphyrna gilbert), the fish look a lot like scalloped hammerheads but are genetically different. It is unclear which of these species fell from the sky in Myrtle Beach.

In what makes separating facts from fiction difficult, it has now emerged that the US military misled the public and even its own personnel about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) for decades.

The revelation has come at a time when the issue of UFOs, now formally called unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), has generated great interest in recent years, including of lawmakers who have held hearings on the subjects.

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) of the US Department of Defense (DoD) has found that the US military misled the public and its own personnel, including officers, with myths of UFOs to hide actual top-secret projects, according to Wall Street Journal.

In recent years, several stories about UFOs have gained widespread attention, such as stories about Area 51 military base, the story of orb-like UFOs that US military pilots have spotted, and mysterious sightings around military bases. The issue has also become politicised as far-right Republicans have accused the purported ‘deep state' of hiding UFO-related truth from public and even the government.

The truth, it has emerged, has been much banal.

The Journal has reported that many popular stories about UFOs, that grew into a whole lore over decades, were planted by the US military to keep top-secret military programmes under wraps.

For example, in 1980s, a US Air Force colonel gave photos of what were dubbed as flying saucers to a pub-owner near the Area 51 base who then put those up in the pub. That led to the development of the lore about alien UFOs at Area 51. In reality, the doctored photographs were intentionally planted to create the myth of alien UFOs to hide the fact that the US government was developing top-secret fighter planes Area 51.

The alien UFO lore meant that whenever someone saw a strange aircraft in the area, it was believed to be an alien aircraft and dismissed as a rumour. In reality, those alien UFOs were stealth fighters under development!

The report said that a host of soldiers and officers were told that they were part of projects involving aliens and were made to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This meant that even many people within the government thought they were working in alien-related programmes when they were not!

On another occasion, the US government conducted a secret test involving electromagnetic pulse to test the security of one of its nuclear missile installations. But the senior leadership never told personnel stationed at the base about the test. This meant that personnel stationed at the base came under the false impression that their base came under an alien attack. Their impression and distrust of the government has lasted to this day.

A two-day UFO Conference in Fairborn brought extraterrestrial aficionados and lifelong paranormal investigators together at the Dayton Holiday Inn. Attending the event were some of the nation's most popular presenters on topics as diverse as Roswell and ancient aliens. 

With Fairborn Mayor Dan Kirkpatrick and state Rep. Brian Lampton, R-Beavercreek, welcoming visitors to the city, the weekend-long event included several guest speakers. 

Headlining the event was Donald Schmitt, author of numerous books on the Roswell Incident. Before him, Thomas Wertman, state director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), set the stage by walking the audience through the work he does investigating reported UFO sightings. 





“Since 2008, I have done 896 investigations in the US; 239 in Canada, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and other countries out there, and there's others I did that I didn't count on the list. But I just got fascinated with the subject out there,” Wertman said. 

The former educator described the incident that first inspired him to research UFOs. For him, it was a chance encounter with what he described as a “disc” while a teenager in the 1960s.



“I look up and there in the trees I see this silver disc hovering right there. It was the size of a car, low enough to hit the trees. And as we're walking its following us,” Wertman explained, describing the incident that occurred in rural South Carolina. 

Wertman told a captivated audience that he would go on to dive deep into the subject, including reading books by broadcaster Frank Edwards. Years later, he joined MUFON as an investigator.





With a graph created using data from MUFON, Wertman demonstrated how spikes in UFO reports can sometimes be driven by TV shows. In one case, UFO sightings in Ohio jumped significantly the year Hangar 1: The UFO Files began airing. 

According to Wertman, MUFON classifies investigated sightings under several categories ranging from manmade identified flying objects such as planes to hoaxes. Investigations are typically carried out using the most accessible technology available. 

“I have tools that investigators fifty years ago would have loved to have,” Wertman stated. “A witness calls a report in I can go on Google Earth, put the address in and review the terrain before I ever go out there.”

Other applications used include Stellarium and LiveATC. Through them, the MUFON state director is able to gather evidence that can at times provide rational explanations to reported sightings. 

“I've got the ability to pull up flight data. I can go back about two-and-a-half to three years of flight data. I can also import that flight data into Google Earth to get three dimensional perspectives of what I was looking at,” he said. 

During his presentation, Wertman shared data collected by MUFON in 2023 that showed California led the nation in the number of UFO cases reported at 729 that year. Florida was second with 504 cases while Ohio was fifth at 299 cases during the same period. According to Wertman, the dominance of the two coastal states is due to their weather, with residents of California and Florida spending more time outdoors. 

“I tell people honestly 70, 80, 90 percent I can probably explain. It goes back to something that you can find data behind to support your opinion. But then there's that 10-20 percent, that's what I really want to go after.”

Schmitt was given a rockstar welcome before recounting his efforts to investigate the Roswell incident of 1947. 

“I've actually interviewed over 600 witnesses either directly or indirectly involved with what happened in New Mexico, what started all this back in 1947,” he said to an enamored audience. 

Other speakers for the day included author Ben Moss and Mike Bara from the TV show “Ancient Aliens” who attended via Zoom. 





For fans of anything extraterrestrial the conference proved to be a veritable buffet of ufology. While there wasn't much for skeptics, it was a rare occasion where believers in cover-ups and alien abductions could confer in real life.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — As Louisiana Rep. Kimberly Landry Coates stood before her colleagues in the state's Legislature she warned that the bill she was presenting might “seem strange” or even crazy.

Some lawmakers laughed with disbelief and others listened intently, as Coates described situations that are often noted in discussions of “chemtrails” — a decades-old conspiracy theory that posits the white lines left behind by aircraft in the sky are releasing chemicals for any number of reasons, some of them nefarious. As she urged lawmakers to ban the unsubstantiated practice, she told skeptics to “start looking up” at the sky.

“I'm really worried about what is going on above us and what is happening, and we as Louisiana citizens did not give anyone the right to do this above us,” the Republican said.

Louisiana is the latest state taking inspiration from a wide-ranging conspiratorial narrative, mixing it with facts, to create legislation. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a similar measure into law last year and one in Florida has passed both the House and the Senate. More than a dozen other states, from New York to Arizona, have introduced their own legislation. 

Such bills being crafted is indicative of how misinformation is moving beyond the online world and into public policy. Elevating unsubstantiated theories or outright falsehoods into the legislative arena not only erodes democratic processes, according to experts, it provides credibility where there is none and takes away resources from actual issues that need to be addressed.

“Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signaling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” said Donnell Probst, interim executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.




Louisiana's bill, which is awaiting Republican Gov. Jeff Landry's signature, prohibits anyone from “intentionally” injecting, releasing, applying or dispersing chemicals into the atmosphere with the purpose of affecting the “temperature, weather, climate, or intensity of sunlight.” It also requires the Department of Environmental Quality to collect reports from anyone who believes they have observed such activities. 

While some lawmakers have targeted real weather modification techniques that are not widespread or still in their infancy, others have pointed to dubious evidence to support legislation.

Discussion about weather control and banning “chemtrails” has been hoisted into the spotlight by high-profile political officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Recently, Marla Maples, the ex-wife of President Donald Trump, spoke in support of Florida's legislation. She said she was motivated to “start digging” after seeing a rise in Alzheimer's.

Asked jokingly by a Democratic state senator if she knew anyone in the federal government who could help on the issue, Maples smiled and said, “I sure do.”

Chemtrail conspiracy theories, which have been widely debunked and include a myriad of claims, are not new. The publication of a 1996 Air Force report on the possible future benefits of weather modification is often cited as an early driver of the narrative.

Some say that evidence of the claims is happening right before the publics' eyes, alleging that the white streaks stretching behind aircrafts reveal chemicals being spread in the air, for everything from climate manipulation to mind control. 

Ken Leppert, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisiana Monroe, said the streaks are actually primarily composed of water and that there is “no malicious intent behind” the thin clouds. He says the streaks are formed as exhaust is emitted from aircrafts, when the humidity is high and air temperature is low, and that ship engines produce the same phenomenon.

A fact sheet about contrails, published by multiple government agencies including NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, explains that the streaks left behind by planes do not pose health risks to humans. However, the trails, which have been produced since the earliest days of jet aviation, do impact the cloudiness of Earth's atmosphere and can therefore affect atmospheric temperature and climate. 

Scientists have overwhelmingly agreed that data or evidence cited as proof of chemtrails “could be explained through other factors, including well-understood physics and chemistry associated with aircraft contrails and atmospheric aerosols,” according to a 2016 survey published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. In the survey of 77 chemists and geochemists, 76 said they were not aware of evidence proving the existence of a secret large-scale atmospheric program.

“It's pure myth and conspiracy,” Leppert said. 

While many of the arguments lawmakers have used to support the chemtrails narrative are not based in fact, others misrepresent actual scientific endeavors, such as cloud seeding; a process by which an artificial material — usually silver iodide — is used to induce precipitation or to clear fog.

“It's maybe really weak control of the weather, but it's not like we're going to move this cloud here, move this hurricane here, or anything like that,” Leppert said.

Parker Cardwell, an employee of a California-based cloud seeding company called Rainmaker, testified before lawmakers in Louisiana and asked that an amendment be made to the legislation to avoid impacts to the industry. 

The practice is an imprecise undertaking with mixed results that isn't widely used, especially in Louisiana, which has significant natural rainfall. According to Louisiana's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, a cloud seeding permit or license has never been issued in the state.

While presenting Louisiana's bill last week, Coates said her research found charts and graphics from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on spraying the air with heavy metals to reflect sunlight back into space to cool the Earth.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy, with support from NOAA, to develop an initial governance framework and research plan related to solar radiation modification, or SRM. A resulting report, which Coates holds up in the House session, focuses on possible future actions and does not reflect decisions that had already been made.

SRM “refers to deliberate, large-scale actions intended to decrease global average surface temperatures by increasing the reflection of sunlight away from the Earth,” according to NOAA. It is a type of geoengineering. Research into the viability of many methods and potential unintended consequences is ongoing, but none have actually been deployed.

In recent years, misinformation and conspiratorial narratives have become more common during the debates and committee testimonies that are a part of Louisiana's lawmaking process.

And while legislators say Louisiana's new bill doesn't really have teeth, opponents say it still takes away time and focus from important work and more pressing topics. 

State Rep. Denise Marcelle, a Democrat who opposed Louisiana's bill, pointed to other issues ailing the state, which has some of the highest incarceration, poverty, crime, and maternal mortality rates.

“I just feel like we owe the people of Louisiana much more than to be talking about things that I don't see and that aren't real,” she said.
