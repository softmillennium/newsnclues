                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, has ignited a firestorm online after bluntly stating that current WTA stars like Iga Świątek and Coco Gauff are yet to reach the “superstar” status once held by the likes of Serena Williams. In a follow-up video addressing the backlash, Mouratoglou didn't walk back his comments. Instead, he doubled down, emphasizing that star power, not just ranking, dictates which players command primetime attention and fill up stadiums. The comments come during heightened debate over gender inequality at Roland Garros, where only men's matches were slotted into the coveted night session throughout this year's tournament. These prime-time matches, starting at 8:15 p.m. local time, are billed as marquee events, but the absence of female players has fueled criticism. In an attempt to shift the narrative, Mouratoglou released a video titled “Are Night Sessions Really Gender-Biased?” where he attempted to explain the rationale behind the French Open's programming decisions. READ MORE: Naomi Osaka's Coach Patrick Mouratoglou Boldly Claims Coco Gauff, Iga Świątek Are Not ‘Superstars' Amid French Open Scheduling Debate In a detailed explanation in his latest follow-up video posted to his Instagram account, Mouratoglou responded to the criticism head-on. He argued that the term “superstar” transcends athletic dominance or Grand Slam victories. “I explained that women's tennis at the moment lacks superstars.” He made it clear that his comments weren't meant as an insult to players like Świątek and Gauff but rather as an observation on their current cultural impact. In terms of aura, she's higher than anyone at the moment. “I said that there has been huge superstars in women's tennis. I'm thinking about Serena, Venus [Williams], [Maria] Sharapova. Using past examples, Mouratoglou emphasized the difference between athletic excellence and mainstream recognition. He also mentioned a lesser-known example from Sweden: “When we went to Bastad in Sweden with Serena, the year before the final wasn't sold out. Mouratoglou illustrated what he called “the superstar effect,” stating, “Superstars fill up stadiums. There are people who step onto the court, and they take it over. Those people are not tennis fans, but they know Serena. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Second placed Italy's Jannik Sinner reacts after the final match of the French Tennis Open against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Sunday, June 8, 2025. The takeaways from Carlos Alcaraz's fifth-set tiebreaker victory over Jannik Sinner in the riveting and record-breaking French Open men's final were multiple and significant. Let's start with this: Anyone worried about how men's tennis would survive in the post-Big Three era can rest easy. Alcaraz and Sinner produced 5 1/2 hours of evidence Sunday that the game is in good hands — and that their rivalry will be, and perhaps already is, a transcendent one. Take it from no less an authority than Roger Federer. The retired owner of 20 Grand Slam titles, and rival of Rafael Nadal (22 majors) and Novak Djokovic (24), began a post on social media by declaring, “3 winners in Paris today,” then listed Alcaraz, Sinner and “the beautiful game of tennis. “Hopefully not the last time,” Alcaraz said. It would be shocking if there weren't many more of these to come — perhaps as soon as at Wimbledon, where play begins on June 30 and No. 1 Sinner from two sets down, then three championship points down, to win 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) was unprecedented at Roland-Garros. Alcaraz's coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, described his guy's best trait this way: “His strength is (to) keep believing all the time, until the last ball is gone.” Alcaraz's five Grand Slam titles at 22 — that's the age at which Nadal, Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras also got to five; no one's done it younger — show how special he is. So does the Spaniard's 5-0 record in major finals, a career start surpassed among men only by Federer's 7-0. Tuesday marks a full year that he has been ranked No. He has reached the finals of his last eight tournaments, a run last accomplished by Djokovic a decade ago. He has won 47 of his last 50 matches. Notably, all three of those losses came against — yes, you guessed it — Alcaraz. That hearkens back to the days when Federer would beat everyone other than Nadal. Sinner had claimed 31 Slam sets in a row right up until the moment he was up 2-0 against Alcaraz. What was unmistakable to anyone watching in-person at Court Philippe-Chatrier or following along from afar on TV is that Alcaraz vs. Sinner is a must-see. “I'm happy to be part of this,” the 23-year-old Italian said. As with any great rivalry — think Evert vs. Navratilova or Borg vs. McEnroe or Federer vs. Nadal, no first names needed — Alcaraz vs. Sinner provides a clash of excellence and a study in contrasts. Alcaraz displays emotion, pumping his fists, pointing to an ear to ask for more noise, yelling “Vamos!” Sinner is rather contained. Sinner's long limbs get him to nearly every ball. Alcaraz's motor reaches speeds no one can equal. Both hammer groundstrokes that leave opponents exasperated and spectators gasping. Sinner has never won a match that lasted four hours. When Sinner returned from a three-month doping ban last month, he introduced a new, angled return stance. Alcaraz tweaked his serve and backhand technique. Who knows what heights each can reach? During an interview with The Associated Press in December 2019, Federer predicted someone would win major after major the way he, Nadal and Djokovic did. Just didn't know there would be a Big Two doing it. “It's going to happen, inevitably,” Federer said. “And it's almost not going to be that hard, maybe ... because the players will have seen what we did. And they didn't see just one guy doing it, once every 30 years. They saw like three guys doing it, in the shortest period of time. AP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alcaraz beat Sinner in the Italian Open final last month, and repeated that feat in the French Open final at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Sinner is taking a break following his final loss at the clay court Grand Slam, in which he gave up a two-set lead against his opponent. Sinner does, however, remain top of the ATP Tour rankings after their latest battle, which took five hours and 29 minutes. Alcaraz now has a phenomenal 20 career titles at the age of 22, with 23-year-old Sinner just one behind on 19. They don't look like slowing down anytime soon, but perhaps there are a small number of players who could threaten their expected dominance in the near future. But he is making bigger moves on the ATP Tour, having just risen one spot to a career-high rank of world number four. READ MORE: Aryna Sabalenka explains why she was cheering on Jack Draper to beat Alexander Bublik in the fourth set at Roland Garros His big-hitting is already an issue for a long list of his rivals, and could pose a real threat to Sinner and Alcaraz in the years to come. Like Draper, Lorenzo Musetti has also now secured a new career-high rank after impressing at the French Open. Musetti has helped Italian tennis reach a whole new level in recent times, but he will now be eager to move out of Sinner's shadow and into the limelight. Shelton gave Alcaraz big trouble in Paris before ultimately failing to progress, having done the same to Sinner in their 2025 Australian Open semi-final. There is, however, one rising star on the ATP Tour who may just have a better chance of competing with Sinner and Alcaraz than the three aforementioned hopefuls. Joao Fonseca is only 18 years old, but currently occupies a career-high rank of 57 on the ATP Tour, having just risen eight places. READ MORE: Coco Gauff says what she thinks of Joao Fonseca as a tennis player after his rise on the ATP Tour It took a top display from fifth seed Draper to send him out of the clay court Grand Slam, with Fonseca having previously knocked out 30th seed Hubert Hurkacz. That superb victory was reminiscent of his 2025 Australian Open appearance, where he knocked out ninth seed Andrey Rublev in round one. He is only going to get better, and could pose a real threat to the leading two players in men's tennis sooner rather than later. Plenty of others will, however, also be keen to have their say on the matter, with the futures of Jakub Mensik and Arthur Fils also looking very promising.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Spectators had been queuing for an hour outside Court One in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Katie Boulter and Emma Raducanu. One immaculately-dressed lady, a parody of Queen's genteel West Kensington surroundings, complained that she had bought tickets for the Andy Murray Arena in the expectation that Britain's top two female singles players would be in action there, and seemed baffled that she couldn't access the smaller court they had in fact been assigned. Those who had secured tickets for the small, intimate Court One enjoyed the sight of a fired-up Raducanu and Boulter securing their first win of the grass-court season, and their first as a somewhat surprising doubles pairing. This was a partnership that had been some time in the making. 1, has a wealth of experience in doubles, most recently teaming up with Daria Kasatkina at the Madrid Open, while she partnered close friend Jodie Burrage at the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers in April. That match indicated the combined firepower of two singles players can overwhelm even a team of doubles specialists; so it proved again today. But for Raducanu this was something of a journey into the unknown, having only played doubles once previously, alongside Denmark's Clara Tauson at the Washington Open in 2022. The 22-year-old has been managing a series of back spasms that have affected her for much of the spring, but said afterwards it felt “in good shape”, and she fortunately did not look affected as the pair wrapped up victory in an hour and 11 minutes. The decision to maximise time on grass has an added edge this year, with both players hunting a seeded spot at Wimbledon. 34, has the advantage over Raducanu, ranked three places below her. 1 spot, too, although Boulter in particular has downplayed it. Fun as this match evidently was for both players, it may also have been a case of keeping your friends close, and your enemies closer. Enemies in a strictly professional sense: the pair were all smiles as they walked out, and their similar on-court personalities – both cut positive, pumped-up figures – matched well. But Xiang and Wu fought back, imposing themselves in net exchanges. The 5'3” Xiang proved masterful at overheads despite her diminutive size. Raducanu hammered a superb forehand down the line to get out of trouble in a tricky service game for 3-1, and her serve came under pressure again at 4-3, when their opponents levelled proceedings after Boulter fired long.

Break point up at 5-2, the Brits played a point that summed up their partnership: Boulter went toe-to-toe with Wu in an excellent, lengthy baseline exchange, before Raducanu sealed the break with a sweet forehand volley into the open court. “I feel like if one of us hits a good ball, we're both capitalising on that. So naturally I already feel a lot more confident that Emma is going to put the ball away if I've hit a good shot,” Boulter said afterwards. Raducanu said afterwards that it was important to “put ourselves in the best position possible” ahead of the Billie Jean King Cup, giving captain Anne Keothavong a wealth of options for doubles teams. (Burrage and Sonay Kartal – the latter up to world No. Britain's top two singles players have plenty of pressure on their shoulders at the best of times, but particularly as the grass season builds. All while keeping an eye on their biggest rival for the No. No plans have yet been made to continue playing together at Wimbledon, Raducanu said. But a grinning Boulter had other plans: “Scrap what she said, we're going for the Wimbledon title.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis star Coco Gauff won the French Open women's singles title on Saturday, becoming the first American since Serena Williams in 2015 to claim the trophy. She defeated top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in three sets. "That first match point was crazy because she shanked it and I thought it was going out, so I kind of felt my heart rate spike up and kind of getting ready to celebrate, and the ball went in. After her thrilling victory, Gauff wrote on Instagram, "I learned having doubt enter your head is impossible to escape, but not impossible to overcome." "I realize that I just try to redirect those into positive thoughts, even if you don't truly believe them. But eventually, when those moments are tough and you don't know your back is against the wall, you don't know where to lean on, you try to lean on the positivity and the belief," Gauff said. "I think that's what carried me through that match and honestly throughout the whole tournament." Sabalenka told reporters she believed Gauff won because she made so many errors due to the windy conditions that made it challenging. "I was a little bit surprised, but at the end of the day, it was tough conditions and a tough match," Gauff said, adding that growing up in Florida, she played in the wind often. "I know that when I play on a windy day, you're not going to win by hitting winners, you're not going to win by playing pretty tennis because the ball is moving, your footwork, everything … feels like you're in space and you don't know what is happening," Gauff said. "Honestly and also when you're playing Aryna, she's such a tough hitter, so you know she's going to hit winners. Sabalenka has since clarified her comments and praised Gauff for her win, saying in an Instagram story that her opponent was the "better player" and "fully deserved to win." "As I got older and realized like I worked so hard off the court and on the court to be where I belong, and there's nothing easy. I had to go out and win seven matches like everyone else does. … Especially having consistent results, I think I prove that more and more each tournament," she said. Most of all, she's grateful for her family's support through everything. "Having that support system is so important, especially playing tennis and being on tour since I was 15 and still developing. Up next, Gauff said she's preparing for Wimbledon. Kristi Noem says "we are not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen" amid L.A. crackdown</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolas Jarry channeled his fighting spirit to a much-needed win Monday at the Libema Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, where he claimed his first Top-50 win since January. Jarry trailed by a set and a break and saved four break points at 4-4 in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, before prevailing after two hours, 30 minutes. 150 in the PIF ATP Rankings after a topsy-turvy start to the season, during which he has posted a 6-12 record. The Chilean boasts a career-high World No. 16, but has been unable to defend recent points, notably at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome, where he reached the final last year before falling in the second round last month. JARRY 🥵@NicoJarry digs deep to knock out No. Gabriel Diallo scored his first tour-level win on grass by moving past Aleksandar Vukic 7-5, 7-6(2) and setting a second-round meeting with two-time finalist Jordan Thompson. “Two finals is heartbreaking, so hopefully I can just keep going like I did today, and give myself another chance,” Thompson said when asked if it was too early to start thinking of another appearance in the championship match. Nuno Borges also advanced to the second round on Monday in s-Hertogenbosch, where he defeated #NextGenATP player Nishesh Basavareddy 7-6(2), 6-2. The seventh seed will next face Finnish wild card Otto Virtanen or Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry. The ATP has designated Week 24 (featuring ‘s-Hertogenbosch and Stuttgart) and Week 45 (Metz and Belgrade) as additional eligible weeks for Next Gen entry at the ATP 250 level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OAKMONT, Pa. — The U.S. Open long has been regarded the toughest test in golf, and this year it returns to what is arguably the toughest course in America. Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh is the talk of the 125th U.S. Open, a course built in 1903 that is more about being feared than being fair. Scottie Scheffler shot 69 in his U.S. Open debut as a Texas teenager. Now he's the favorite as he comes to Oakmont having won three of his last four tournaments, including the PGA Championship. Here is a look at what you need to know leading up to the U.S. Open: Golf's second-oldest championship — it dates to 1895 — starts Thursday at 6:45 a.m. Players in groups of three will start on the first and 10th tees, morning and afternoon. The biggest names typically start on No. 10 in the morning or on No. 1 in the afternoon to get peak TV coverage. NBC and its platforms get their first major of the year, and there is wall-to-wall coverage of the U.S. Open. Thursday starts on USA Network from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Peacock takes over until 8 p.m. Friday starts on Peacock at 6:30 a.m. until 1 p.m., and then NBC goes until 8 p.m. The final round Sunday starts at 9 a.m. until noon on USA Network, and NBC takes over until the end. Next in line is defending U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau . Rory McIlroy was the second favorite on the BetMGM Sportsbook money line last week at 700. They are followed by Xander Schauffele at 2200. Phil Mickelson needs the U.S. Open to complete the career Grand Slam and this likely is his last appearance. Scottie Scheffler is being compared to Tiger Woods based on modern statistics. He is being compared to Jack Nicklaus for the way he plays the game from tee-to-green with minimal mistakes. He has won three of his last four starts going into Oakmont. There was thought the Masters title would give him freedom because he had gone 11 years without any major. Xander Schauffele is coming off a year in which he won two majors. He was out with two months because of a rib injury. But he plays this major well. Schauffele has played the U.S. Open eight times and only once has finished outside the top 10. Not to be overlooked is Bryson DeChambeau as the defending champion. He loves brute tests like Oakmont. Opens at Winged Foot and Pinehurst No. The U.S. Open trophy doesn't have a name. The prize money hasn't been announced yet, but it was $21.5 million last year, with $4.3 million going to the winner. That was in 2008, when Tiger Woods famously made a 12-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to force an 18-hole Monday playoff against Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines. That took 19 holes for Woods to win. That has not been used yet. There's been a lot of rain in the last week that has softened the course. The weekday rounds should be reasonably dry. McIlroy had the lead late in the round but bogeyed three of his last four holes. That included missing a 30-inch par putt on the 16th hole and a par putt just inside 4 feet on the last hole. McIlroy left without talking to the media. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her latest Sky Sports column, Gigi Salmon reflects on an incredible French Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, while also speaking about her meeting with Coco Gauff's parents Candi and Corey after her maiden triumph at Roland-Garros. She also discusses whether Britain is becoming a clay nation and Novak Djokovic's poignant wave to the crowd in what could be his last appearance at the clay-court Grand Slam. 'Where were you when…' A question that will be asked with regularity when it comes to the men's final at Roland-Garros which set a new record for the longest final in the tournament's history, pushed the players in question up to and way beyond their limits, left spectators speechless and led me to say in commentary: "I love tennis" - something I don't normally say out loud on air! I had the honour of commentating on one of the best matches I have ever seen live, for Radio RG [Roland-Garros], and possibly the greatest Grand Slam final. A first Grand Slam final meeting between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the first of many, a 12th meeting overall and, if we're honest, the final most people wanted to see. Alcaraz, 22, has now won five Slam finals from five finals, after saving three championship points on his serve and doing something that he has never done before, coming from two sets to love down. For his part, world No 1 Sinner recovered from not converting those championship points and then from being an early break down in the fifth to take us the distance in what is only his second tournament back after returning from his three-month suspension. Many legends of the game were finding it hard to put into words what they had witnessed. When I asked tournament director Amelie Mauresmo how she felt, she replied 'speechless', before adding that she would be reflecting on a successful two weeks with a nice glass of red wine! The atmosphere on Sunday backstage was in stark contrast to Saturday which was buzzing in the aftermath of Coco Gauff's second Grand Slam title and her first in Paris. After the match, Daniela Hantuchova and I spent time chatting with Gauff's parents Candi and Corey, full of pride for their daughter and how she handled everything, remembering she is still only 21. Dad Corey for a while now hasn't sat in the box as his living and breathing every point became unmanageable in the box and in his own words: 'I don't handle it well, that's why I don't sit in the box, I bring too much negative energy, I struggle all the way through - I find a corner and I stay in it.' He also said that her mental strength comes from her faith and having great 'spiritual strength', going on to say: 'I have great belief in myself and it can be contagious. Gauff's coach JC Faurel said that any coach who tells you they are calm in the box are lying and that he was a mess inside, while Matt Daley who joined the team last year praised Gauff for being willing to make tweaks and changes during matches. Someone posed the question recently, 'is Britain becoming a clay nation,' a strong statement and while some good inroads are being made, we're still a long way from putting the red dirt at the top of the list of British players favourite surface. But no one was picking him to win the title and to seriously challenge the likes of Alcaraz and Sinner on clay would have been very tough and he would fall in the fourth round to Alexander Bublik who played the match of his life! It's not to say Jack can't or won't in the future, all the signs look great and there's so much to take away from the last few months. Cam Norrie had an excellent run to the fourth round, ultimately falling to Novak Djokovic, his first-round win over former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev in five sets and nearly four hours was fantastic and having had a tough 18 months of so, there's a lot for Cam to take on to the grass including a boost in his ranking. While Jacob Fearnley continues to rack up firsts, picking up his first French Open wins and going down to Norrie in the third round. On the women's side, all three made it through to the second round with Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal winning their first French Open matches and for Emma Raducanu she had the misfortune to run into a revived Iga Swiatek in round two. There was, though, a title and four finals to celebrate, with Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid winning their 23rd Grand Slam doubles title together and their six successive French Open doubles title with Hewett regrouping from losing the men's wheelchair singles title earlier in the day to the world No 1 Tokito Odo. So in conclusion are we becoming a clay nation? Are we starting to enjoy it a bit more? He was asked in his post-match press conference if that was him saying goodbye to which he replied: "This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? That's all I can say for the moment." Sensible words from a 38-year-old who will be 39 when the French Open rolls around in 2026. If he secures Grand Slam title No 25, does he do a mic drop having achieved everything there is to achieve in the sport? He still has Wimbledon and the US Open to come this year and will the body continue to play ball, that ultimately led to Nadal walking away when he did. What a couple of weeks it has been in the French Capital, ending with a match that has transcended tennis. On my flight back this morning it was the main topic of conversation among the other passengers, a mix of tennis fans and those who just happened to come across it and then couldn't look away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Murray has claimed Jack Draper is “right in the mix” with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner to win future Grand Slams. Andre Agassi claimed the Spaniard combines the best attributes of Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal - and will be even more dangerous at Wimbledon. And fellow TNT Sports analyst John McEnroe backed Alcaraz and Sinner to have beaten Rafa Nadal “at his best” following their epic final in Paris. Speaking at Queen's Club, Murray was full of praise for the two young stars who have won the last six Grand Slam titles "They're both brilliant athletes and very different personalities, which I think for fans is really exciting," he told BBC Sport. "Moving forward, men's tennis is in a great place. People always worry at the end of a generation of players what's going to happen with the sport next, but generally sports continue to evolve and, in most cases, improve. From what I've been told, it was one of the best finals for a long time. "Jack's right in the mix just now and doing extremely well. But Murray cautioned against recency bias after the first-ever Gen Z final between two men born this century. Alcaraz now has five Grand Slams and Sinner, 23, is still on three. Novak Djokovic (24), Nadal (22) and Roger Federer's (20) shared 66 Grand Slam singles titles as they dominated the sport for over a decade. And three-time Major winner Murray said: "The sport's in a really good place but it's important not to forget what the guys have done before them, what Roger, Rafa and Novak have done,. "Winning 20-plus majors is something exceptional and it's easy in today's age to forget a little bit about that. I saw some pundits saying if [Alcaraz and Sinner] went on court against Rafa at the French Open, they would be favourites going into that match with Rafa in his prime. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. "Alcaraz and Sinner are on the path to being two of the best, no doubt about that, but it takes time to build what Roger, Rafa, and Novak had. After saving three match points against Sinner, Alcaraz's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero claimed: “I think he was born to play these kinds of moments. Ferrero added: “Jannik is a great champion, he'll go all out at Wimbledon. We're leaving with a two-Grand Slam advantage over him. Alcaraz, who celebrated last year's French Open win in Ibiza, is scheduled to play the HSBC Championships at Queen's Club starting on Monday. Sinner said: “I'll prepare to play on grass in Halle before Wimbledon, the next goal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How long will it be before Billie-Jean King comes out and says that the extraordinary 2025 French Open Men's Singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will shorten their careers by at least a year? That was what BJK famously said of the 2012 Australian Open final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, the longest ever men's Major Singles Final (at just under six hours), so it is only logical that she would say the same of yesterday's classic, which was the second longest ever men's Major Singles final (at just under five and a half hours). Yesterday's French Open Final was so incredible that many tennis analysts, including The Tennis Podcast and indeed LWOT itself, are genuinely asking whether it was the greatest tennis match ever. That is probably a classic example of recency bias, whereby the most recent example of greatness in sport or art is immediately hailed as the greatest ever. Yet the 2025 French Open Men's Singles final was undeniably a great match, certainly taking its place in the top five of the greatest men's finals ever, alongside Federer v Nadal at Wimbledon in 2008, the aforementioned Djokovic v Nadal in Melbourne in 2012, Borg v McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1980 (a match so good that the greatest film about tennis, Borg vs McEnroe (2017), was made about it) and Djokovic v Federer at Wimbledon in 2019. As undoubtedly the greatest ever French Open men's final, it easily merits its place even in such stellar company. The only thing that let Alcaraz-Sinner 2025 down was its ending, which is why it probably only ranks as fifth in the greatest finals ever rather than as number one. It may have featured the first ever 10-point match tiebreak to decide a Major title (the Covid-ravaged 2020 US Open Men's final between Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev was decided by a regular tiebreak, with Thiem winning it 8-6), but that was actually the worst thing about the final, because it was so lop-sided. Alcaraz almost literally sprinted into a seven-point lead and eventually won it 10-2, albeit with the very last shot being a characteristic flash of Alcaraz brilliance. Indeed, so (relatively) disappointing was the match tiebreak that it supported the argument that Grand Slam finals should only be settled with a match tiebreak after it goes to 12-12 in the final set, i.e. after the two players have effectively played the equivalent of an extra set to try and divide them. The endings in 1980 and 2008, with Borg and Nadal finally breaking their opponent's serve after a truly epic contest, mean that they will live even longer in the memory than the ultimately disappointing match tie-break in 2025. Nevertheless, even allowing for the (relative) damp squib of its ending, Alcaraz v Sinner 2025 was unarguably a great tennis match – indeed, one of the greatest tennis matches ever – and a reminder that all the greatest tennis matches ever are five-setters. It is simply not possible to display the epic levels of endurance, both physical and mental, that both Alcaraz and Sinner demonstrated in a three-set match. For example, Russell Fuller, the BBC's Tennis Correspondent, has increasingly suggested that at the Majors both men and women should play three-set matches up until the quarter-finals and then they should both play five-set matches thereafter. It is because men have to play seven five-set matches to win a Major that it remains not only the ultimate challenge in tennis but arguably the ultimate challenge in all of sport. No one to sit there and tell you what to do… This is as good as it gets guys.” Fish is absolutely right: a five-set Major final is “as good as it gets”, not just in tennis but in all of sport. In the increasingly frenetic 21st-century, in which we are often told that human beings (and not just young ones) have an attention span that is greatly reduced from what it was in the past, other sports and indeed arts have attempted to reduce the amount of time they take, but invariably with negative results. First-class or five-day cricket might just be the greatest team sport ever invented and it is certainly the most complex, because it unfolds over a considerable period of time and therefore allows for numerous changes in momentum during that time. By contrast, 20-20 or T20 cricket, in which teams play for just 20 overs each for about three hours, is a vastly reduced form of cricket (and not just in time) that is usually just a “hit-it” game more comparable to baseball or even rounders than first-class cricket. And the same is true of art forms. The greatest examples of any art form – Shakespeare's plays, Tolstoy's novels, Francis Ford Coppola's first two Godfather films or David Simon's The Wire in television – are inevitably, indeed necessarily, long. At its best, as proven again triumphantly by Alcaraz and Sinner yesterday in Paris, five-set tennis is every bit as epic as a Shakespeare play, a Tolstoy novel or a Coppola film. It is a five-act drama that seems to encompass almost the entirety of human existence, or at least the entirety of human emotion. And any attempt to end it would be utterly foolhardy – a wilful destruction of the very greatest sporting encounter that has ever been created.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took 5 1/2 hours, but on Sunday, Carlos Alcaraz won the French Open for the second straight year. Alcaraz earned the win after dropping the first two sets, defeating Sinner after five sets and three tiebreaks. 2 seeds against one another in what is sure to become an instant classic. "I'm pretty sure you're going to be a champion, not once, but many many times," Alcaraz said of Sinner after the match. "It's a privilege to share the court with you in every tournament, making history with you." Sinner, who had an early lead, failed to capitalize on three championship points in the fourth set before Alcaraz forced a deciding set. In the fifth set, it was Sinner who completed the unlikely comeback from a break down to force a third tiebreak. The young Spaniard defeated Sinner 10-2 in the fifth set tiebreak to win his fifth Grand Slam title. At age 22, he becomes the third-youngest man to win five major titles, trailing only Bjorn Borg and Rafael Nadal. But both seemed to get a second in the final set, with it all leading up to the thrilling ending. Alcaraz, who is famous for his ability to win marathon contests, is now 13-1 in five-set matches. Sinner, meanwhile, moves to 0-7 in matches that go past the four-hour mark. Alcaraz got on a roll to eventually tie Sinner at 5-5. Sinner then took the next game, but Alcaraz held on for an uncontested service game to force a tiebreak, which Sinner eventually won with some difficulty. The third set was all Alcaraz to start. He had briefly lost the goodwill of the crowd before pulling them right back in with multiple excellent points. Though Sinner launched a late comeback of his own to keep the set alive, Alcaraz held on for a 6-4 win in a sequence that mirrored the first set. But Sinner managed to get a second wind, breaking back late in the set to force yet another tiebreak. And in the end, Alcaraz was victorious after a dominant tiebreaker victory.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the longest French Open final – and the second longest grand slam final – in history, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner showed once again that tennis' future is in safe hands. Related article Roland Garros: A visual guide to the iconic clay court grand slam With Novak Djokovic in the twilight of his career and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal already hanging up their rackets, it would be entirely natural for fans to worry about the considerable void the three greatest players of all time will leave behind them. But as Alcaraz and Sinner crushed groundstrokes at each other on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros, displayed pinpoint precision with deft drop shots and volleys, and chased down each shot with a fierce determination, nobody was thinking about the Big Three and whether their sizeable shoes still needed filling. Instead, it was one of those special sporting moments in which everyone watching knew they were witnessing history. That Alcaraz ended up the victor – improbably coming back from two sets down for the first time and saving three championship points to eventually win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) – was largely immaterial to the final spectacle; Sinner winning that final-set championship tiebreak wouldn't have made the match any less remarkable. Even before Sunday's epic final, John McEnroe was so impressed with what he had seen from the pair in Paris that he made the case, though admitted it sounded “semi crazy to say,” that either Alcaraz or Sinner would beat the Big Three at their peak. “You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Rafael Nadal on clay, you know, he won this 14 times – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favored to beat Nadal, at his best,” he told TNT Sports. “Now, do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible – there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen. Related video Roland Garros: Why is clay the most difficult surface to play on? “But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.” There is no doubt that an intense rivalry can elevate and even transcend a sport, and tennis has been blessed with no shortage of great rivalries over the past two decades. They are now singular events that beg the question: “Where were you when…?” We could now be seeing the blossoming of tennis' next great rivalry, with the head-to-head between Alcaraz and Sinner now at an intriguing crossroads. Alcaraz leads 8-4 but, crucially, has now won five matches in a row against Sinner and currently appears to have the world No. “To put it into words is really difficult,” he told Eurosport's Lesly Boitrelle and Àlex Corretja. “Being two sets to love down against the No. “It's my first time coming back from two sets to love down. Honestly, I just poured my heart into it, I just tried to keep going, not think about the result and just play my best tennis in the third and fourth, and then the fifth. “The fifth set was just not giving up, it was just fighting and thinking point after point, and at the end of the fifth I was just playing with heart.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon will be shown on a new TV channel for the first time having been covered by the BBC for 88 years. This is courtesy of a stipulation in Ofcom's Listed Events regulations, which permits 'secondary broadcasters' at major sporting tournaments. This year's tournament runs from Monday June 30 to Sunday July 13 and costs the BBC around £60million per year. But a new broadcaster will have rights to show highlights in 2025. TNT Sports will assume the five-year deal that was originally signed by Eurosport in May last year after it bought Eurosport - which disappeared from UK viewers' screens back in February. The BBC have broadcast events at Wimbledon since 1937, when matches from Centre Court were shown up to half an hour each day. Coverage will come across BBC1 and BBC2, with all matches shown on BBC iPlayer, in addition to updates via radio, online and its app. Carlos Alcaraz will be seeking a third successive Wimbledon title after beating Novak Djokovic in each of the previous two finals on Centre Court. But it is his rival Alcaraz who will come into the tournament as favourite after his astonishing comeback victory over Jannik Sinner to lift the French Open title at Roland-Garros on Sunday. At one stage, the Spaniard was two sets down and had to save three championship points before completing an almighty fightback to win his fifth Grand Slam.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has admitted to being a little jealous of the ATP Tour for being able to play at the Queen's Club. The Queen's Club is already known for its highly regarded men's tournament - a consistent winner of the best ATP 500 accolade - and now female players are eagerly seizing their chance to shine. Keys found it too tempting to resist the WTA 500 at Queen's, especially given that her friend and ex-tennis pro Laura Robson is leading the event as tournament director. She admitted to pangs of jealousy each time her ATP friends played the west London leg of the tour. She said: "Obviously, when Laura asked for me to play the tournament, it was a pretty quick yes. I'm happy to be here, and I've always loved the grass swing, so to start here for the first time in many, many years is really fun." She added: "I've always heard amazing things about the tournament and I've always been pretty jealous because the guys just rave about how great it is here and they love playing here. Zheng, meanwhile, also admitted that her grass-court experience is limited, and that she has never made it to a quarter-final on the surface. 5 couldn't resist joining the historic first women's event at Queen's Club as the WTA Tour graces its lawns. "It's amazing for us that we can start first and we have the experience to play on such beautiful grass. I think it's a very classic, old, traditional place, and it's a special club because you have all the neighbourhood around, which is an amazing design from a long, long time ago." Donna Vekic, a grass-court aficionado who stormed into the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, has also always dreamt of the ladies taking centre stage at the iconic venue. The Croatian ace said: "It's very historical and this club, when I watch the men's tournament, it's always amazing and I always wished that we had a chance to play and now we do, so I'm very excited to be playing here." But perhaps no one is more thrilled than Britain's own tennis stars, who've grown up with eyes glued to the ATP event and are now set to dazzle their home crowd at this esteemed tournament. But it was great seeing the guys play here, of course. But now to be back here and competing is a different feel for sure. But I think it is also really good to switch off and just to have comforts everywhere." 1 Katie Boulter added: "I've actually always said to myself, I wish there was a women's event here, I wish I got the chance to play on this court, because you can feel the history and you can feel how incredible it is."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz produced a comeback for the ages to defeat Jannik Sinner and take the 2025 French Open final in a six-hour instant classic in Paris. Alcaraz, 22, defended his title by coming back from two sets down and saving three championship points to win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). 1 and slight favorite Sinner started strongly on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and Alcaraz went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak at sunny Roland Garros. Alcaraz won three breaks in the third set and won a dramatic tiebreak to level the match before he went 7-0 up in the championship breaker with some celestial tennis and sealed his triumph with a laser forehand. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic You may have heard already — but we have our own tennis podcast at The Athletic these days. The Tennis Podcast is now part of our audio stable. Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts have been podcasting after every day of this year's French Open. And they will do so again today, following that unbelievable marathon of a men's final. Sinner's tennis is often compared to Djokovic, but there's something about his mentality that also resembles the 24-time Grand Slam champion. Like Djokovic, Sinner is extremely adept at shrugging off disappointment to lock back in. Curiously, the clock ticked beyond three hours and 50 minutes while Sinner was serving for the match, which made the fact that Alcaraz had kept things competitive in the face of a second-set rout a couple of hours earlier significant. He went down 0-2, then up 4-2, conjuring memories of the Beijing Open final last fall, when Sinner led a tiebreak 3-0 before Alcaraz won it 7-3. From there, Sinner was at the point that his sprint for the line had been designed to avoid. Again, it proved the point of no return. Not just his variety, Alcaraz can maneuver the ball and change the cadence of a match like no other elite player. So perhaps Sinner's greatest achievement Sunday was stopping that from happening for large swathes of the match. For the first two sets, Sinner's consistent hitting and aggressive court position prevented Alcaraz from getting on top of the rallies and bringing his lethal drop shot regularly into play. By the fourth and fifth, Alcaraz took over. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic Ask any player who has done it on the biggest stages in tennis. So much of beating Alcaraz lies in finding a way to snuff out the surges that he uses to steamroll an opponent, whether he's ahead or behind. On Sunday, the first surge came an hour and three-quarters into a match that had turned into one-way traffic for Sinner, who was serving for a two-set lead at 5-3. Sinner got to this match by snuffing out a similar surge form Novak Djokovic in the second set Friday night. Sinner played clinical tennis and smote the danger. In the seventh game of the fourth set, Sinner shut down any ideas Alcaraz might have had that this would go the distance and looked to be on his way. Sinner pushed it to a tiebreak, but after falling down 0-2, Alcaraz cranked out a couple of aces on his way to winning seven of the last eight points. Sinner did find a way to stifle it Until the one last Alcaraz rise that proved impossible to quell. He's got the bigger serve and induces more errors on return than most top players and more easy second shots as well. Even as Alcaraz wiped out Sinner's two-set lead in his stirring comeback, Sinner's advantage in the short points held firm. It's no coincidence that during the peak of his domination, he was winning 66 percent of points on his first serve, compared with a little under 60 percent for Alcaraz. These two players are a level above the rest of the tour, evenly matched rivals in their own galaxy. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic Tennis fans will be watching tapes of five points from the 2025 French Open final 25 years from now. The match seemed so lost, it was almost silly to consider what might happen when Alcaraz stepped to the line to serve at 0-40, 3-5 in the fourth set. The celebration in Italy was about to explode. He went long with a ground stroke. Two more match points and then a chance to serve it out. Then he tried to jump on a second serve, and sent the backhand long. On the next point, Sinner seized control, setting up a kill shot, but it went into the net. Alcaraz had his lifeline and whipped up the crowd, promising them more tennis if they could carry him to this most unlikely rise from the abyss. When he was taken to the fifth-set tiebreak, it looked as if he had wasted his resurrection. Instead, the Spaniard produced a tidal wave that surpassed even his great escape. Having fended off three match points, Alcaraz found himself in the position Sinner had been: serving at 5-4 for the French Open title. This final was surely going to get a conclusion at last. Court Philippe-Chatrier was stunned, and from there the match descended into a stunning psychodrama that enshrined this young sporting rivalry's place in the global sporting world. None of this had seemed possible at the start of the set, when Sinner could barely move. The tiebreak ended a three-game drama that transposed into one of the great surges of Alcaraz's career. It may prove to be one of his greatest. After all the tension, Alcaraz found his ceiling, which is peerless in the sport and borderline unplayable. There was time for one final miracle – a running forehand down the line that was too ridiculous for words. Alcaraz collapsed into the clay, a champion again. Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic He added: “I feel the same (that winning was a miracle). My grandfather, I'm pretty sure he was watching from home. I hope he is proud of my performance. “I tried not to think about anything else, just to go point after point with a positive mind, with everything I had inside. “It was very difficult in some moments but I'm proud and very happy about how I dealt with everything today. To say it was one of the best finals in the history of a Grand Slam is really high status. “I have to say there have been more or better finals, Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final. “I'm really happy, especially for Samu, his first Grand Slam as a coach. He added: “Yeah, it was honestly amazing. To put into words is really difficult. Being two sets down against the world No. The first match I came back from two sets down. “I just put my heart into it, tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result, just putting my tennis on. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. “Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us. “To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.”</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A match that will be remembered for the rest of time, Carlos Alcaraz inflicted a first Grand Slam final defeat on Jannik Sinner after a truly miraculous and barely believable 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-3, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) victory over his Italian opponent, winning his second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam crown. He had never come back from two sets down before, and Sinner was playing at a scarily high level. However, he dug as deep as he possibly could, saving three championship points in the process, as he reigned victorious in a five-hour and 29-minute thriller - the longest final in Roland Garros history and the second longest in Slam history. Sinner will be absolutely devastated after missing those golden chances in the fourth set, but Alcaraz has this freakish ability to just produce top gear and reach otherworldly levels when he really needs to. His performance in the final set tiebreak was a sight to behold, as he raced to a 7-0 lead with perfect tennis. It will go down as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time, and this new modern-day rivalry is truly blossoming. Alcaraz has now beaten Sinner five times in a row, and the world number one will be desperately trying to work out a way to beat this martian. However, he should take heart in the fact that he was so close to winning on a surface he has struggled on against an opponent whose favourite surface is clay. Who is for a rematch at Wimbledon next month? Meanwhile, over on the women's side of the tournament, American Coco Gauff capped off a fine clay-court season with a dramatic 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the final, winning her second Grand Slam and her first here in Paris. It was a tough match to watch, and in typical Gauff fashion, she didn't play the best tennis throughout the tournament, yet she keeps finding ways to win. At 21 years old, she is forging a superb career for herself on the court, and she carries herself magnificently off it. "It was really honestly the worst tennis I've played in the last, I don't know, in the last I don't know how many months,” she said. “Today was just, yeah, I mean, honestly sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. “I don't know, I think if Iga would win against me the other day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did, that hurts.” Stefanos Tsitsipas' torrid form just shows no sign of slowing down. Following his defeat, Tsitsipas announced the high-profile appointment of former player Goran Ivanisevic as his new coach - the man who helped Novak Djokovic to nine Grand Slam titles. Another player who has reached the final at this tournament - on two occasions - Casper Ruud also fell in the second round in shock fashion to Nuno Borges. The Norwegian seemed to be struggling with injury, but it was still a massively disappointing result for him, and he has also dropped down to 16th in the world as a result. To see such an incredible fighter like Navarro succumb to a loss like this was a major shock, but all credit to her Spanish opponent, who played some brilliant tennis. Nadal won a staggering 14 French Open crowns, and they wanted to celebrate him in style. With the crowd all donning orange shirts to represent the colour of the clay, Nadal cut an emotional figure as he gave a speech and a highlight reel was played of his greatest moment. Last but not least, the French Open unveiled a plaque with Nadal's footprint right next to the court on Philippe-Chatrier, making him a permanent fixture at his favourite venue. Nadal couldn't contain his emotions as this was revealed, capping off a magnificent ceremony and moment. There were some absolutely magnificent rallies on the claycourts of Paris this fortnight, with players forced to battle and dig deep to win points. Holger Rune produced a jaw-dropping around-the-net shot, Djokovic rolled back the years to win a mesmerising 41-shot rally against Alexander Zverev, while Gauff showcased her never-say-die attitude and brilliant backhand to steal a point against Sabalenka in the final. In London, Queen's Club welcomes back a women's tournament for the first time in 50 years, which is sure to be a fantastic occasion. Qinwen Zheng, Keys, Navarro and Elena Rybakina are the top seeds. Over in Hertogenbosch, Liudmila Samsonova and Ekaterina Alexandrova are the top seeds, while Daniil Medvedev and Ugo Humbert headline the men's tournament. Finally, there is a heavyweight cast in Stuttgart, with Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime leading the way.</p>
