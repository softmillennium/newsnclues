                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA's President Gianni Infantino claimed earlier this year that “America will welcome the world” for next year's tournament, which will be shared across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Infantino said: “America will welcome the world. However, this past weekend has seen protests develop against the government, and clashes between protestors and the authorities. During an event in New York City to mark a year out from the 2026 tournament, host city officials were forced to address concerns that the current political environment may dissuade visitors from travelling to the United States. The administration last week imposed wide-ranging travel bans against over a dozen countries. Speaking in New York City, the Philadelphia host city executive Meg Kane said: “For us as host cities, we recognize that our charge as host cities is to be prepared to welcome whomever is in our city and to make them feel welcome when they are there. There are going to be geo-political issues that we don't even know right now that are going to affect the tournament next year. “We do not play a role necessarily in what is happening in terms of the decisions that are made. What we can say is that the current administration — while there are certain situations that we are watching, that we are certainly monitoring closely — has been extremely supportive of the World Cup.” “It has to be recognized both now in the second term under President Trump — but also in the first term when President Trump was in power when the letters of intent were signed – how important FIFA World Cup is to elevating the nation and how important it is to sporting side. We allow for FIFA to continue having constructive conversations with the administration around visas, around workforce, around tourism, and that we will be prepared for whatever comes our way.” Speaking to The Athletic, Jason Krutzsch, Vice President, Marketing & Communications for the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, said: “We're actively monitoring. Asked to explain what monitoring actually entails, he added: “We're all learning about it right now just how it's all unfolding and we're gonna use the information and figure out how to work across all the cities to deliver the most exceptional experience that we can next year. Meg said it on the stage to just really focus on (the fact that) people are coming and we need to be prepared for that, and we're going to be prepared for whoever is wanting to come. Our markets will be prepared to welcome them with open arms and deliver an exceptional experience.” He primarily covers soccer for The Athletic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Landon Donovan took aim at Christian Pulisic and the U.S. men's national team for missing out on this summer's Gold Cup. The USMNT legend was part of Fox's broadcast for the 2025 Nations League final that ended with Portugal stunning Spain in a penalty shootout. “This is what it means to represent your country. This is what it means,” Donovan said postgame as pictures of an emotional Ronaldo played on the broadcast. “If you don't want to take this—as a professional soccer player, as someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey—seriously and responsibly, then don't come in. And I can help but think about some of our guys who are on vacation right now, not wanting to play in Gold Cup. Donovan's comments come just days after the USMNT announced its 2025 Gold Cup roster that featured notable absentees including Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Folarin Balogun, Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna are also missing out on the tournament to compete in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup with their respective teams. Pulisic, in particular, has come under fire for opting out of the competition to prioritize his rest and recovery after his career-best season for AC Milan. Amid the recent criticism, McKennie jumped to Pulisic's defense. None of us want to lose games,” McKennie told USA TODAY Sports. And for me, it's a little bit, I won't say sad, but as a former national team player, I think as a national team player pool—previous, present—I think it's more about trying to build or even say something like that to a person directly rather than putting it out there. “That's just my opinion because we've all been through those moments, even when comments about us losing the Nations League were made by many players from before, but they've had the same thing on a bigger stage with not qualifying for the World Cup.” Pulisic's father, Mark, also posted a response on Instagram which his son liked further calling out Donovan via an AI chatbot's response. “This guy is talking about commitment,” the caption read. Pochettino will hope the Stars and Stripes can snap their three-game losing streak ahead of the tournament, even without his superstars available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a slow start featuring disappointing results in Pochettino's young tenure in the U.S., it certainly feels like the USMNT is heading in one direction, and it's not a positive one. It was a match that didn't really matter, especially when the squad's core group of Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Tim Weah, and Pulisic aren't on the 26-man roster and don't plan to be in the immediate future for various reasons. Landon Donovan Calls Out USMNT After Pathetic Performances Against Panama, Canada Dest and Robinson are rehabbing significant knee injuries, but Pulisic is skipping out on international duty due to fatigue from a very busy schedule with AC Milan. The face of U.S. soccer choosing to not represent his country is a tough look in general, but even more so with the 2026 World Cup being hosted in North America in just over a year's time. Most realize that, but maybe no one more than Donovan, who let his feelings be heard during FOX Sports' UEFA Nations League Final broadcast over the weekend. "This is what it means to represent your country," Donovan said after Portugal beat Spain in penalties. And if you don't want to take this as a professional soccer player, as someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in. (Cristiano Ronaldo)'s 40 years old, and he's played a long ass season. Hurt himself in the process, and I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. Donovan did not name any names, but it was undoubtedly a not-so-subtle jab at Pulisic and the like. To be fair, Pulisic opting out of playing in the underwhelming Gold Cup that the USMNT typically takes rather lightly would not be as big of a deal if it weren't months out from the 2026 World Cup. Nevertheless, Pulisic's father, Mark, brought up some old receipts about Donovan thanks to an assist from ChatGPT. Mark asked ChatGPT why Donovan took a sabbatical from the sport altogether at the end of 2012 through March 2013. He posted a screenshot on Instagram highlighting the fact that Donovan took his break due to fatigue as well, and the post was liked by Christian. It's easy to see Mark Pulisic's logic here as he's blatantly calling Donovan a hypocrite, but Donovan was already a more-than-proven player on the International stage with more than 10 years representing the red, white, and blue on his resume. Donovan, whether you think it's his place or not to do so, is trying to spark some sort of fire within this USMNT, which should be welcomed by all, given the non-existent history U.S. men's soccer has.

Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content. Group L qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continues Monday with a key clash between Croatia and Czechia. Croatia, which joined qualifying later due to UEFA Nations League obligations, has played just once so far but made a strong statement with a dominant victory. With Montenegro (currently in second place) idle this matchday, a win on Monday would allow Croatia to jump into second and tighten the race at the top. It opened play with a surprisingly close 2-1 win over the Faroe Islands, needing a late goal from Patrik Schick to secure the victory. Since then, they've found their rhythm, cruising past Gibraltar 4-0 and controlling the match in a 2-0 win over Montenegro on June 6. Croatia, which didn't play in the first window due to UEFA Nations League commitments, finally joined the qualifiers earlier this week and made an immediate impact with a dominant 7-0 win over Gibraltar. Five of those goals came in the second half, as Gibraltar simply couldn't hold off Croatia's relentless attack. For Croatia, it's about building momentum toward another deep World Cup run, after all, they finished second in 2018 and third in 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this mailbag edition of Jonathan Wilson's newsletter, he answers questions about inverted wingers, favorite jerseys and more Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson here We're now a year-ish from the World Cup. The tournament is still dominated by European and South American teams. But which continent without a winner (Asia, Africa, Central and North America and, I guess, Oceania) has the best chance of lifting the trophy first? On one hand, extending the tournament so the winner will have to get through eight games rather than seven probably makes shocks less likely, but on the other hand an extra knockout round adds another layer of randomness. Even with four knockout rounds, most champions usually had at least one game of significant jeopardy – a win on penalties, or an edgy one-goal victory after extra-time. Between 2006 and 2018, 13 of 16 semi-finalists in the World Cup were European. Add a wealthy league in which the best of a nation's youth can gain an exceptional and immediate education and the advantage enjoyed by western Europe is clear. Africa has the talent but its football – and this is obviously a generalisation – is beset by poverty and corruption. Morocco showed their capacity in Qatar, and if, say, Nigeria or Senegal managed to find an enlightened coach who could bypass all the political issues at the same time they had a gifted generation, there's no reason there couldn't be an African winner – although it doesn't feel imminent. Asia, perhaps, is most likely, although we're probably only talking about three countries at the moment. Japan and South Korea have been regular World Cup qualifiers, their level has improved dramatically, there is money to invest, a deep-rooted passion for the game, and their players are increasingly gaining experience at the best clubs. We're yet to see what impact all the Saudi PIF's investment in football will have, but money, a political will to succeed, an improving league must give them at least an outside chance with home advantage in eight years. I was talking to a friend about this on the way to the Championship play-off final, looking at the masses of red-and-white all around while we were both wearing very neutral check shirts. We wondered whether it's because in our formative years of going to games, away games especially, in the late 80s and early 90s, it was useful to be able to blend into the background if any violence kicked off. I don't think you can separate the two. So Pep Guardiola, for instance, was in effect asked to devise his ideal environment at Manchester City, and the result was six league titles in seven seasons. What was necessary was the money to buy a squad good enough, but also owners prepared to let a sporting director and manager put together a coherent side free from the egos of the celebrities they had previously been burdened with. It's probably my age – I've watched football for nearly 70 years – but I really miss old-fashioned wingers, playing on the “correct” wing, beating their defender on the outside and providing crosses for their fellow attackers. The case for inverted wingers seems to be that coming “inside” on to their stronger foot increases their chances of shooting and scoring. It's now de rigueur for wingers to be inverted. Does the likelihood of inverted wingers scoring goals by coming inside really compensate for the fewer effective crosses they make for their fellow attackers? Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer I agree that there remains something aesthetically very pleasing about a centre-forward meeting an outswinging cross with a header – Alexander Isak's goal from Anthony Gordon's cross for Newcastle against Arsenal last season, for instance – but I suspect that ship has sailed. Herbert Chapman was arguing that a focus on wingers crossing for forwards was inefficient 100 years ago, and most modern theory seems to agree with him. The preference now is either for wide players cutting infield – Peter Taylor was a pioneer in England, but Dennis Tueart and others did it as well – or to work the ball to the goalline for a low cutback – the classic Manchester City goal of a couple of seasons ago. A full-back could go inside, as say Trent Alexander-Arnold or João Cancelo do, but that is relatively rare and if the full-back is going on the outside, the wide forward has go inside to create space for him. He left Liverpool in 1977 for Hamburg, where he won the league in 1978-79 and was twice named European Footballer of the Year. He also marketed himself with an eagerness unusual in English players of the time, becoming a bona fide celebrity. And, on 9 June 1979, he released his second, but by some distance his most successful single, Head Over Heels in Love. His first single, It Ain't Easy, had been released in 1972, just a year after he'd moved to Liverpool from Scunthorpe and made very little impression. And this is where those of a nervous disposition should look away. Keegan gave a preview of the song on Das Aktuelle Sport-Studio. His German seems very good, but that thought soon fades as he gets to the performance … This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Landon Donovan's latest criticism of Christian Pulisic appears to have hit a nerve within the AC Milan star's family, with his dad Mark now having come out swinging. U.S. Men's National Team legend Donovan called out “players who chose to skip the Gold Cup,” with Christian being the highest profile player to have done so, during FOX Sports' broadcast of Portugal's recent Nations League Final triumph over Spain. After Cristiano Ronaldo helped his side secure the title on penalties following a 2-2 draw, Donovan cited the former Real Madrid star's passion as an example of what he felt was missing from the current USMNT, which lost 2-1 to Turkey on Saturday. "This is what it means to represent your country," Donovan said. And I can't help but think about some of our (USMNT) guys on vacation right now not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. While Donovan may not have named Christian, he has previously been critical of the Milan midfielder's request for a summer break, and it seems clear this latest dig was likely at least partially aimed at the 26-year-old. But it appears that Christian's inner circle has heard enough, with his dad Mark having taken to social media to fire back at Donovan. In a post on Instagram, he shared a screenshot seemingly asking an AI chat why Donovan previously took a sabbatical, seemingly in reference to his break from international soccer in early 2013. “Landon Donovan took his sabbatical because he was feeling both physically and mentally exhausted after years of intense competition and the pressure that comes with being a top athlete,” the response read. “He'd been playing professionally from a young age and had participated in multiple World Cups, so he felt the need to step back and take some time for himself. Mark captioned this screenshot, “This guy is .. talking about commitment.. look in the mirror + grow a pair and call names out or are you afraid next time you want an interview you will get rejected again.” What's more, Christian then appeared to ‘like' the post. As for Donovan, he recently opened up on his Unfiltered Soccer podcast, which he co-hosts with Tim Howard, on exactly what drove his decision to take a break in 2013, admitting that he was close to a “breakdown.” Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And this time, Christian Pulisic's father, Mark, is getting involved. Pulisic — who was coming off a career year at AC Milan — had asked head coach Mauricio Pochettino to leave him off the Gold Cup roster in order to rest and recover this summer. It is also the last remaining extended training camp together. And with a new coach trying to implement his system, it was a terrible look for Pulisic to ask for it off. On Sunday, Landon Donovan watched as a 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo helped lead Portugal to a UEFA Nations League title — a newer tournament with little prestige relative to other UEFA events. But the fact that the top Spain and Portugal players were willing to play for their national teams in that when USMNT players opted to skip the Gold Cup — well, it had Donovan frustrated. Hurt himself in the process, and I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It was an obvious swipe at Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Antonee Robinson who all are skipping the Gold Cup without injuries or Club World Cup obligations. Mark Pulisic saw those comments, and he put together the most Soccer Dad response. The post was liked by Christian as well. Back then, Donovan wanted time away from the game to focus on his mental health. He had already played a major role in three World Cup runs for the USMNT, but then-head coach Jurgen Klinsmann held the absence against Donovan and left him off the 2014 World Cup roster. Donovan notably did not skip out on his team during the last competitive opportunity before a World Cup. Pulisic's situation is entirely different, and it was yet another poor display from a USMNT parent to use the sabbatical against Donovan. And judging from the "like," Christian doesn't recognize that difference either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid continue their season into June and July, without much rest, and a ton of injuries still lingering. If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. These observations — where I look at Real Madrid's history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. There is more football now than ever — with seemingly no end in sight. If anything, the number of games will increase before they decrease. It's unclear what pre-season looks like after the Club World Cup, especially for teams that make it far in the tournament. The Premier League has rejected a request from teams to delay the start of next season in order to incorporate more rest and preparation. Per club sources, Real Madrid will not plan any pre-season games after the Club World Cup, stating “there is no time.” (There is a small chance this could change, but it's unlikely, and in the club's words, “it's too difficult”). By Spring time every year, the pre-season schedule is made public. The tournament wraps up mid-July, which is usually long before any pre-season even begins. Part of scrapping pre-season games may come down to how seriously Real Madrid, and, other teams, will take the Club World Cup. What is seen as an annoying ‘extra' tournament, will likely go down as a big success, despite our complaints about the unnecessary amount of football on the calendar. SUBSCRIBE: The Managing Madrid Podcast on YouTube If Real Madrid bounce from the tournament early (unlikely if they bring their A-team and A-game against inferior teams on paper), the club may arrange some last minute pre-season games, probably behind closed doors, within Spain before the season starts to get the blood pumping again before the 2025 - 2026 season gets underway. It will be a far-cry from pre-arranged tournaments with advanced ticket sales. Last summer, most of Real Madrid's team barely had a pre-season, and some didn't have one at all. Last pre-season in the USA, during the Soccer Champions Tour, Real Madrid filled their team sheets with Castilla players. Nothing wrong with that — in fact it's welcome. Some, like Mbappe, didn't join at all. Don't be surprised if the remaining rare summers where nothing is planned, FIFA or UEFA will eventually figure out a way to add something — introducing a revolving tournament every summer. FIFA or UEFA could work with teams to decrease games, but there is too much money involved, and the financial implications of gutting games from the calendar don't reflect well on the bottom line for executives higher up (and ‘smaller clubs' are generally ok with so many games that reward them financially. They need the money and relevancy more than big clubs do). Offering / securing bigger TV deals to compensate for less games will likely mean the consumer will pay more for their package. But are bigger squads, a dilution of stars, more games, and just a higher quantity of everything actually good for the sport overall? Football is heading into uncharted territory when it comes to dealing with such an astronomical number of ACL injuries. More games, more fatigue, and less time to recover can contribute to the rise of season-ending blows. No one knows this better than Real Madrid. When Real Madrid lost all three of Eder Militao, David Alaba, and Thibaut Courtois early in the 2023 - 2024 season, Carlo Ancelotti said it was “unprecedented” in his coaching career. This season alone, Real Madrid lost Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao (again), and Joan Martinez to ACL tears. Fielding any sort of ‘Once de Gala' — especially over a the course of more than a couple games — has proven to be impossible in the last couple years. Xabi Alonso won't have that luxury for months, literally. He will be without several important players due to injury this Club World Cup. Even if everyone returns before the season starts, Alonso will lose Jude Bellingham as the Englishman recovers from shoulder surgery. (The club has placed a big bet on winning the Club World Cup by delaying Bellingham's shoulder surgery. Speaking to club sources over the past year, there was always a dilemma on how to deal with Bellingham's surgery. He could potentially avoid the surgery altogether and play through the pain with a shoulder strap, but it affects his mobility and performance greatly. Had the surgery been done in May, he would've been back for the start of next season. Real Madrid's first three games in the Club World Cup are against teams they should beat with or without Bellingham — so really they're prioritizing a handful of knockout games over 10-12 La Liga games next season.) “Constantly adding international matches and competitions has broken the calendar,” Jerome Perlemuter, General Secretary at World Leagues Association said in September. “We only have 365 days in a year, which means very simply that if you keep adding matches, at some point there is no more space – national leagues cannot organise their competitions properly anymore and players pay for it with injuries.” This is one of those seemingly unfixable problems. But it's almost impossible with so many hands in the pot: FIFA, UEFA, Leagues, Federations — they all have their own set of fixtures they want to vomit on the calendar in return for financial gains. “It's important to remember FIFA organize about only 1% of the footballing calendar,” a spokesperson from FIFA told me for this story. “We are always looking at ways to work with teams and players and have conversations about maximizing players' health.” “Those leagues apparently prefer a calendar filled with friendlies and summer tours, often involving extensive global travel.” But others argue that FIFA can still step in to regulate, and, unlike UEFA, have taken an authoritative, rather than collaborative approach. “But the difference is that UEFA had a strong consultation with all the stakeholders — leagues included — and decided on a reform in the format of club competitions after a long discussion. “FIFA imposed their new format and competitions without any discussion, consultation and without accepting to have any form of relationship with the other competitions organisers.” You will never have a perfect solution to keep everyone happy. Smaller teams don't have the same complaints about their stars being worked into the ground, nor can they afford to say no to additional games. Could European football adapt an NFL model? The NFL has a short blitz of games (17 games, around five months), and generates an astronomical amount of money. They bring in a considerable amount through TV deals. Real Madrid's pre-season planning dilemma won't be unique to them alone. Every team will have to endure the grind. PSG and Inter, the two Champions League Finalists Real Madrid may have to go through to win this summer's tournament, just finished their season May 31st. PSG had nine players featuring in the UEFA Nations League Semi-finals, to varying degrees. But as things stand, despite all the struggles in maintaining squad health amid a wild calendar, there is some optimism with regards to the squad heading to the USA this Saturday. Eder Militao, Dani Carvajal, and David Alaba completed part of the training in Xabi Alonso's first session as a Real Madrid manager. Antonio Rüdiger is making a push to return in time — though things look more grim for Eduardo Camavinga as of now. Real Madrid should have enough in the tank to win their first three games. (Don't quote me on this, but the bracket could shake-out this way or not, football is wildly unpredictable — regardless of the path, it's going to be fun if Real Madrid keep advancing.) Once Real Madrid return from the USA — and we are far away from knowing the timeline or the state of the team at that time — Alonso will have a unique situation where he has a month plus change to work with his squad in training, with no pre-season games, before the 2025 - 2026 season kicks off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Men's National Team standout Weston McKennie defended teammate Christian Pulisic on Monday after Landon Donovan made indirect comments toward the current captain. While commentating Portugal's celebration after the team won the UEFA Nations League final Sunday on Fox Sports, Donovan said, “This is what it means to represent your country. … I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup. While Donovan didn't name Pulisic, it's clear the former USMNT captain was referring to the latest one. Donovan, himself, also took a brief sabbatical from the team in 2013. None of us want to lose games," McKennie told USA TODAY Sports on Monday, from Juventus headquarters in Italy preparing for the Club World Cup. And for me, it's a little bit, I won't say sad, but as a former national team player, I think as a national team player pool – previous, present – I think it's more about trying to build or even say something like that to a person directly rather than putting it out there. “That's just my opinion because we've all been through those moments, even when comments about us losing the Nations League were made by many players from before, but they've had the same thing on a bigger stage with not qualifying for the World Cup.” McKennie is also not participating with the USMNT this summer to help Juventus compete in the FIFA Club World Cup. Juventus is in Group G of the tournament and will play Al Ain (United Arab Emirates) on June 18 in Washington D.C., Wydad AC (Morrocco) on June 22 in Philadelphia, and Manchester City (England) on June 26 in Orlando during the group stage. Still, McKennie is keeping an eye on his teammates with the national team led by new coach Mauricio Pochettino. The USMNT lost a friendly to Turkey 2-1 on June 7 in East Hartford, Connecticut. McKennie believes the USMNT has a good group of players who are ambitious with room to grow before World Cup 2026, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. He believes the team needs to find its identity by practicing in a competitive environment. You sacrifice for each other,” McKennie said. “I think with the group that we have and some of the players that have been there a little bit longer, including myself, need to start not thinking that we're young anymore. But now we have a lot more talent. As for Donovan's comments, McKennie sided with Pulisic while reiterating their desire to suit up for the national team because of its significance. “Obviously, like I said before, none of us take for granted that we get to represent a national team because it's one of the biggest honors that we can have in the sport of football. But obviously, if you don't feel like your body is in the right condition, and you don't feel like your body is in the best form or shape or whatever, to be able to do that at 100%, and you feel like you're risking injury, then it's better to let someone else go in that is completely 100%.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal successfully lifted the UEFA Nations League trophy after beating Spain via a penalty shootout in a thrilling final match. Drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams failed to win it during extra time, but Roberto Martinez's men held their nerves during the shootout. Selecao das Quinas were determined to put on another strong display after beating Germany in the semifinal stage. However, they were facing a much tougher task from the hungry and determined Spain outfit. Despite Portugal's determination, it was La Furia Roja that got things under control early on as they went 1-0 up through Martin Zubimendi. Spain raised their game again and regained their advantage just before half half-time break, this time from Mikel Oyarzabal's goal. In the second half, Portugal managed to improve their performance further and got back on level terms once again, thanks to Ronaldo's equaliser. After drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams continued to look for that important winning goal during extra time, but neither was successful. After a pretty tight shootout, it was Alvaro Morata, who cost Spain the game as it was his missed spot kick that sealed the deal for Portugal. Martinez's men got all of their penalties spot on, including Ruben Neves' decisive fifth kick, which made it 5-3.</p>
