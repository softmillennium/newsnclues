READ MORE: ‘I'm not done with F1 yet' – Bottas admits Cadillac ‘a very interesting project' as he provides update on future plans Assessing whether the Milton Keynes-based outfit could be an option, Bottas said: “I don't know if they look outside their academy. I just wonder if that car, to be driven fast, needs a driver with experience. READ MORE: Horner vows to give Tsunoda time at Red Bull after 'flashes of performance' In terms of whether he spoke with Red Bull about racing for them in 2025, the 10-time race winner added: “It was put down quite quickly because I think there's certain persons or a person within the Red Bull organisation that for some reason is not a big fan of mine, but that's life.” Another possibility could be Alpine, with two drivers – Jack Doohan and Franco Colapinto – having already filled the seat alongside Pierre Gasly in 2025 as the squad continue to assess their options. “They're on their second driver this year and I think the next races will show how that goes. Again, I think on a struggle street, let's say, experience can always help. READ MORE: Sweary outbursts, emotional celebrations and cheeky jokes – 12 of the most memorable team radio messages Alpine were another team that Bottas spoke to regarding the chances of racing for them in 2025, but the Finnish driver suggested that the talks did not progress to a serious level as he expected to be staying with Kick Sauber ahead of their transition into Audi in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bottas assesses chances of racing for Red Bull or Alpine as he weighs up future options Heading to a track that has often provided drama, there are plenty of unanswered questions arriving in Montreal. READ MORE: Verstappen admits Russell contact ‘shouldn't have happened' in Spanish GP as Dutch driver nears race ban threshold Then it all started to go wrong, with a late Safety Car undoing all of the good work, as Red Bull only had new hard tyres that they could fit to Verstappen's car, and he soon started slipping through the field. Stroll was advised not to race by his medical team having been suffering from pain in his right hand and wrist, with a statement from Aston Martin stating the belief that the discomfort is related to a procedure he underwent following a cycling accident in pre-season training back in 2023. It remains to be seen if Stroll will compete on home soil after missing the last race in Spain Stroll did race through the pain in Bahrain in 2023 despite still recovering from his injuries, and was described as feeling pain again over the past six weeks, so he's previously shown his level of determination to drive, but if Montreal comes too soon then Aston Martin will have to look to their reserve options – led by Felipe Drugovich – or bring in an experienced replacement at short notice. While there was plenty going on behind them, the two McLaren drivers were largely untroubled despite Red Bull's attempts in Spain, and it was Oscar Piastri who came out on top with his fifth victory of the season. READ MORE: Stella gives his take on Piastri's ‘cheeky' comment and how McLaren will manage intra-team fight going forward McLaren have repeatedly said they are aware that at some stage the battle is going to lead to a clash on track, but so far the two drivers have kept it clean. READ MORE: ‘I would have sunk without his guidance' – Vowles and Cowell explain how much they learned from Wolff about being a team boss Of course there are no guarantees what the weather is going to do this weekend, and we have seen very warm races in Montreal, too, but for now it's looking like being on the cooler side and that should still play to Mercedes' strengths. A year ago, George Russell was on pole position in Canada – setting an identical lap time to Max Verstappen but starting from pole because he set it first – as the top seven cars in Qualifying were covered by just 0.28s. Mercedes are hoping for another strong weekend, and the chance to hit straight back at Ferrari having slipped to third behind Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship last time out.
