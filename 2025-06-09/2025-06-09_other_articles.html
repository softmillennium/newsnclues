When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. "We are talking about a fairly massive planet here, a few times the mass of Jupiter most likely," study lead-author Christian Ginski, a lecturer in the physics unit at the University of Galway in Ireland, told Live Science in an email. One might almost think of the planet like a hoover in that sense sucking up all the dust." Related: Ginormous planet discovered around tiny red star challenges our understanding of solar systems They do this by seeking out young stars, which could be actively giving birth to new planets. Ginski noted that while researchers have detected several thousand planets around distant stars, these are all quite old.

"Young planets inside their forming disk help us to understand all the ingredients and how they interact with each other. So far we only have 1 confirmed such planet in its infancy and 2-3 more candidates which are not fully conf[i]rmed yet." In the new study, 2MASSJ1612 was viewed in scattered near-infrared light for the first time, revealing previously unseen details, including two spiral arms emanating from the center of its disk. —James Webb telescope spots 'groundbreaking' molecule in scorching clouds of giant 'hell planet' —James Webb telescope discovers frozen water around a distant, sunlike star —Scientists reveal 'most promising yet' signs of alien life on planet K2-18b Ever more complex wave pattern are the result. Ginski noted that he has observed around 100 young star systems and that researchers typically find either the carved-out ring or the spiral structures, but in this case, the images revealed both — as theoretical models of planet formation predict. "Basically it appears we may be looking at an absolute textbook case here," Ginski said. "So that makes us think that we can predict what kind of planet is in this disk, and we think it should be one that we can actually take an image of with the right equipment (which is why we secured follow-up time at the James Webb Space Telescope)."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 2024 Pentagon report omitted findings about internal disinformation, including pranks and fake documents. The Pentagon knowingly promoted UFO myths for decades to mask secret weapons development programs, especially at classified sites like Area 51. A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that military officials planted false evidence, including doctored photographs, to divert attention from stealth aircraft testing. In one instance during the 1980s, an Air Force colonel gave fake “flying saucer” photos to a bar owner near Area 51. A congressionally mandated 2024 report by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) found no credible evidence of alien spacecraft or reverse-engineering programs. As part of classified program briefings, the military sometimes initiated new officers into what appeared to be a top-secret project called “Yankee Blue,” which claimed to involve reverse-engineering alien technology. They showed officers staged photos of flying saucers and swore them to secrecy — often without revealing the fabrication. Some officers carried the story into retirement, repeating it even during official investigations. Investigators later identified most of the sightings as drones, birds, weather balloons or satellite reflections. Lawmakers are now demanding to know which agencies have participated in crash retrieval efforts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An osprey flying over Myrtle Beach dropped the small shark from a tree after being harassed by crows. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A hammerhead shark recently crashed down on Splinter City Disc Golf Course in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. While waterspouts can pull fish from the sea and drop them over land, the culprit was a more common fish foe: an osprey (Pandion haliaetus) that had lost its lunch. "It's not uncommon to see an osprey carrying something, but you take note because it's still really cool to see," Jonathan Marlowe, who witnessed the hammerhead fall as he was playing disc golf, told Garden & Gun magazine. Instead, it was a small, dead hammerhead shark, easily identifiable by its wide, mallet-shaped cranial structure known as a cephalofoil. Also known as "fish hawks," ospreys are excellent aquatic hunters and the only raptors with feet designed to catch slippery prey. But they tend to feed on fish less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) long, and the hammerhead found on the golf course appears to be longer than a foot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In what makes separating facts from fiction difficult, it has now emerged that the US military misled the public and even its own personnel about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) for decades. The revelation has come at a time when the issue of UFOs, now formally called unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), has generated great interest in recent years, including of lawmakers who have held hearings on the subjects. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) of the US Department of Defense (DoD) has found that the US military misled the public and its own personnel, including officers, with myths of UFOs to hide actual top-secret projects, according to Wall Street Journal. In recent years, several stories about UFOs have gained widespread attention, such as stories about Area 51 military base, the story of orb-like UFOs that US military pilots have spotted, and mysterious sightings around military bases. The Journal has reported that many popular stories about UFOs, that grew into a whole lore over decades, were planted by the US military to keep top-secret military programmes under wraps. For example, in 1980s, a US Air Force colonel gave photos of what were dubbed as flying saucers to a pub-owner near the Area 51 base who then put those up in the pub. The alien UFO lore meant that whenever someone saw a strange aircraft in the area, it was believed to be an alien aircraft and dismissed as a rumour. In reality, those alien UFOs were stealth fighters under development! This meant that even many people within the government thought they were working in alien-related programmes when they were not! On another occasion, the US government conducted a secret test involving electromagnetic pulse to test the security of one of its nuclear missile installations. This meant that personnel stationed at the base came under the false impression that their base came under an alien attack. Their impression and distrust of the government has lasted to this day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A two-day UFO Conference in Fairborn brought extraterrestrial aficionados and lifelong paranormal investigators together at the Dayton Holiday Inn. Attending the event were some of the nation's most popular presenters on topics as diverse as Roswell and ancient aliens. With Fairborn Mayor Dan Kirkpatrick and state Rep. Brian Lampton, R-Beavercreek, welcoming visitors to the city, the weekend-long event included several guest speakers. “Since 2008, I have done 896 investigations in the US; 239 in Canada, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and other countries out there, and there's others I did that I didn't count on the list. But I just got fascinated with the subject out there,” Wertman said. And as we're walking its following us,” Wertman explained, describing the incident that occurred in rural South Carolina. Wertman told a captivated audience that he would go on to dive deep into the subject, including reading books by broadcaster Frank Edwards. With a graph created using data from MUFON, Wertman demonstrated how spikes in UFO reports can sometimes be driven by TV shows. According to Wertman, MUFON classifies investigated sightings under several categories ranging from manmade identified flying objects such as planes to hoaxes. Investigations are typically carried out using the most accessible technology available. “A witness calls a report in I can go on Google Earth, put the address in and review the terrain before I ever go out there.” Through them, the MUFON state director is able to gather evidence that can at times provide rational explanations to reported sightings. “I've got the ability to pull up flight data. I can go back about two-and-a-half to three years of flight data. I can also import that flight data into Google Earth to get three dimensional perspectives of what I was looking at,” he said. During his presentation, Wertman shared data collected by MUFON in 2023 that showed California led the nation in the number of UFO cases reported at 729 that year. According to Wertman, the dominance of the two coastal states is due to their weather, with residents of California and Florida spending more time outdoors. Schmitt was given a rockstar welcome before recounting his efforts to investigate the Roswell incident of 1947. “I've actually interviewed over 600 witnesses either directly or indirectly involved with what happened in New Mexico, what started all this back in 1947,” he said to an enamored audience. Other speakers for the day included author Ben Moss and Mike Bara from the TV show “Ancient Aliens” who attended via Zoom. While there wasn't much for skeptics, it was a rare occasion where believers in cover-ups and alien abductions could confer in real life.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(AP) — As Louisiana Rep. Kimberly Landry Coates stood before her colleagues in the state's Legislature she warned that the bill she was presenting might “seem strange” or even crazy. Some lawmakers laughed with disbelief and others listened intently, as Coates described situations that are often noted in discussions of “chemtrails” — a decades-old conspiracy theory that posits the white lines left behind by aircraft in the sky are releasing chemicals for any number of reasons, some of them nefarious. As she urged lawmakers to ban the unsubstantiated practice, she told skeptics to “start looking up” at the sky. “I'm really worried about what is going on above us and what is happening, and we as Louisiana citizens did not give anyone the right to do this above us,” the Republican said. Louisiana is the latest state taking inspiration from a wide-ranging conspiratorial narrative, mixing it with facts, to create legislation. Bill Lee signed a similar measure into law last year and one in Florida has passed both the House and the Senate. More than a dozen other states, from New York to Arizona, have introduced their own legislation. Elevating unsubstantiated theories or outright falsehoods into the legislative arena not only erodes democratic processes, according to experts, it provides credibility where there is none and takes away resources from actual issues that need to be addressed. “Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signaling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” said Donnell Probst, interim executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education. Jeff Landry's signature, prohibits anyone from “intentionally” injecting, releasing, applying or dispersing chemicals into the atmosphere with the purpose of affecting the “temperature, weather, climate, or intensity of sunlight.” It also requires the Department of Environmental Quality to collect reports from anyone who believes they have observed such activities. While some lawmakers have targeted real weather modification techniques that are not widespread or still in their infancy, others have pointed to dubious evidence to support legislation. Discussion about weather control and banning “chemtrails” has been hoisted into the spotlight by high-profile political officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Asked jokingly by a Democratic state senator if she knew anyone in the federal government who could help on the issue, Maples smiled and said, “I sure do.” Chemtrail conspiracy theories, which have been widely debunked and include a myriad of claims, are not new. Ken Leppert, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisiana Monroe, said the streaks are actually primarily composed of water and that there is “no malicious intent behind” the thin clouds. He says the streaks are formed as exhaust is emitted from aircrafts, when the humidity is high and air temperature is low, and that ship engines produce the same phenomenon. A fact sheet about contrails, published by multiple government agencies including NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, explains that the streaks left behind by planes do not pose health risks to humans. Scientists have overwhelmingly agreed that data or evidence cited as proof of chemtrails “could be explained through other factors, including well-understood physics and chemistry associated with aircraft contrails and atmospheric aerosols,” according to a 2016 survey published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. While many of the arguments lawmakers have used to support the chemtrails narrative are not based in fact, others misrepresent actual scientific endeavors, such as cloud seeding; a process by which an artificial material — usually silver iodide — is used to induce precipitation or to clear fog. “It's maybe really weak control of the weather, but it's not like we're going to move this cloud here, move this hurricane here, or anything like that,” Leppert said. Parker Cardwell, an employee of a California-based cloud seeding company called Rainmaker, testified before lawmakers in Louisiana and asked that an amendment be made to the legislation to avoid impacts to the industry. The practice is an imprecise undertaking with mixed results that isn't widely used, especially in Louisiana, which has significant natural rainfall. According to Louisiana's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, a cloud seeding permit or license has never been issued in the state. While presenting Louisiana's bill last week, Coates said her research found charts and graphics from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on spraying the air with heavy metals to reflect sunlight back into space to cool the Earth. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy, with support from NOAA, to develop an initial governance framework and research plan related to solar radiation modification, or SRM. A resulting report, which Coates holds up in the House session, focuses on possible future actions and does not reflect decisions that had already been made. Research into the viability of many methods and potential unintended consequences is ongoing, but none have actually been deployed. In recent years, misinformation and conspiratorial narratives have become more common during the debates and committee testimonies that are a part of Louisiana's lawmaking process. State Rep. Denise Marcelle, a Democrat who opposed Louisiana's bill, pointed to other issues ailing the state, which has some of the highest incarceration, poverty, crime, and maternal mortality rates. “I just feel like we owe the people of Louisiana much more than to be talking about things that I don't see and that aren't real,” she said. Associated Press writers Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida, and Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota, contributed to this story.</p>
