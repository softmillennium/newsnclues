                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US owes Afghans a huge debt, but instead of starting to repair decades of harm, Trump is banning them from the US. During Donald Trump's first term, the Afghan American community dodged a bullet. The new “Muslim ban 2.0,” the successor to Trump's original Muslim ban, went into effect today, with 12 countries on its list, including Afghanistan. When President Trump began his second term in office on January 20, he issued an executive order asking for a 60-day review of vetting requirements for certain nationalities. ET on June 9, Afghans are now barred from entering the U.S. This news comes as most of our community celebrates Eid-al-Adha and many Muslims around the world finish the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. While some of this policy is framed as legal language in the name of “national security,” it is clear that this masking was done in an attempt to help the order pass challenges in the courts. Despite its narrow exception for Special Immigrant Visa holders, this policy is clearly a sweeping expression of racism and anti-Muslim prejudice. This was followed by USAID-funded school textbooks in Dari and Pashto produced by the University of Nebraska that taught young Afghan students violence in refugee camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan. During this 20-year war, the U.S. funded endemic corruption, backed notorious human rights violators and helped build an aid-reliant government that was essentially a house of cards. This 40-year history means that the U.S. owes Afghans and Afghan Americans a huge debt. Instead of repaying this debt and undoing the harm it has caused over four decades, Muslim ban 2.0 has been yet another deep betrayal and abandonment. That is not even to talk about the continued deportations of Afghans by the Pakistani and Iranian governments or the fact that Afghanistan is enduring a humanitarian crisis in which millions of people do not have access to more than one meal a day, a situation caused and exacerbated by U.S. sanctions policy. This decision also is a de facto partnership with an awful regime that targets, detains, rapes, and extrajudicially kills Afghans, especially ones who are queer, women, or from other marginalized communities like Hazaras. This order will deeply impact those who have already arrived since 2021, fleeing the conditions in Afghanistan that made them seek safety here in the first place. They are pillars and leaders of their respective communities, from San Diego to small towns in Vermont. I'd often come across newly arrived Afghan families at major airports, on their anxious new journey to some city somewhere in the U.S. I'd say a quick “salaam,” or “peace be upon you” in Arabic, commonly used by Afghans, and wish them best of luck on their new life here, a journey they were forced to make by U.S. policy and did not choose. While displacement is horrible, there was the beautiful sight of an Afghan speaking my native tongue in random places anywhere I went. Allowing Afghans to seek safety and build a new home, to us, is a form of reparative policy for all the harm the U.S. has caused us over four long decades. It is guaranteed that others will be targeted, detained, and possibly deported. Afghan women and girls are disproportionately impacted by this new ban, due to the horrid conditions for them in Afghanistan. Some have already been deported under the Trump administration to third countries like Costa Rica or Panama. If an empire like the U.S. — whose power stretches around the world and which brags about being exceptional every day — does not want refugees, why won't it stop waging wars and bombing countries like Afghanistan? The truth, however, is that the entire world has turned its back on Afghan refugees — and nowhere is safe for us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It casts the military in a terrible light – it's that man on horseback, who really doesn't want to be there, out in front of American citizens.” “We are headed towards the invocation of the Insurrection Act, which will provide a legal basis for inappropriate activity,” he said. The largely peaceful protests in LA against Trump's deportation efforts have entered their fourth day. National guard troops began arriving in the city on Sunday, with authorisation to protect federal personnel and buildings but not to engage in law enforcement activities. Trump's move in the absence of a genuine civil emergency has sent alarm through military circles, which have long prided themselves on being above politics. “This deployment was made counter to what the governor wanted, so it seems like a political forcing – a forced use of the military by Trump because he can,” said a retired senior US army officer who requested anonymity in order to preserve their lifelong non-partisanship. It says that regular military troops, as well as national guard forces, can be employed by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to protect federal functions anywhere in the country where protests are occurring. It says that troops can be sent to “locations where protest against [federal] functions are occurring, or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments”. On Sunday, Trump signaled that LA was just the start of a much wider deployment. “We're gonna have troops everywhere,” he said. Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran who is CEO of Vet Voice Foundation which advocates for veterans and military families participating in American democracy, said that the executive order was an invitation to Hegseth to “mobilise as many troops as he wants anywhere within the US. Geoffrey DeWeese, a former US army judge advocate who is now a legal director within the National Institute of Military Justice, expressed concern about how the national guard would be used in LA. Under the memo, they can act as protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, which potentially means that troops could accompany Ice in immigration deportation raids on homes and businesses. “Ice and the national guard are [both] wearing camouflage, carrying automatic weapons – so how do civilians differentiate them? Military and constitutional experts who were convened by the law and policy institute the Brennan Center last summer to wargame what Trump might do in a second administration predicted precisely the current train of events. Trump himself made no attempt to disguise his intentions, repeatedly telling his supporters during last year's election campaign that if re-elected he would use the military against “the enemy within”. Concerns about the deployment have been heightened by Trump's previous actions which already pointed towards a politicisation of the armed services. In February he fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and several other top brass without giving just cause. There are also worries about Trump's upcoming military parade to be staged in Washington DC on 14 June to mark the 250th anniversary of the US army. She added that while the military celebrated its birthdays, street parades were avoided “because that is the action of a dictator. This is all in line with how Trump views the military as a tool at his personal disposal, not as a professional fighting force made up of men and women whose oath is to the constitution.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety.” Hundreds of workers at the National Institutes of Health on Monday openly protested the Trump administration's cuts to the agency and consequences for human lives, writing in a sharply worded letter that its actions are causing “a dramatic reduction in life-saving research.” In a June 9 letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.” The letter is an extraordinary rebuke of the Trump administration's actions against the NIH, which include: terminating hundreds of grants funding scientific and biomedical research; firing more than 1,000 employees this year; and moving to end billions in funds to partner institutions overseas, a move current and former NIH workers say will harm research on rare cancers and infectious diseases, as well as research that aims to minimize tobacco use and related chronic illnesses, among other areas. “These policies are preventing us from delivering on the promise we made to them and honoring the commitment that they made, and putting them at risk,” she said. The workers wrote that they hope Bhattacharya welcomes their criticisms given his vows to prioritize “academic freedom” and to respect dissenting views as leader of the NIH, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Bhattacharya's declaration advocated against lockdown measures and proposed that widespread immunity against covid could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected with the virus and instituting protective measures only for medically vulnerable people. It was criticized at the time by Francis Collins, then-director of the NIH, who called Bhattacharya and his co-authors “fringe epidemiologists,” according to emails the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. In their letter, NIH workers demanded that Bhattacharya restore grants that were “delayed or terminated for political reasons.” Those grants funded a range of projects, including those addressing Alzheimer's disease, ways to boost vaccination rates, and efforts to combat health disparities or health misinformation. “Academic freedom should not be applied selectively based on political ideology. The funding terminations, they said, “throw away years of hard work and millions of dollars,” “risk participant health,” and “damage hard-earned public trust, counter to your stated goal to improve trust in NIH.” Its work has led to countless scientific discoveries that have helped improve health and save lives around the globe. An April 3 deposition by NIH official Michelle Bulls said Rachel Riley, a senior adviser at HHS who is part of the Department of Government Efficiency created by executive order, provided NIH officials lists of grants to terminate and language for termination notices. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, led DOGE through May. She said the current administration's policies are “definitely unethical and very likely illegal,” listing a string of developments  in recent months. They include terminating studies early and putting participating patients at risk because they have had to abruptly stop taking medications, and holding up research that would predominantly or exclusively recruit participants from minority races and ethnicities, who have historically been underrepresented in medical research. “And, as a matter of fact, studies that over-recruit from white people have been allowed to go forward.” The NIH workers also demanded that Bhattacharya reinstate workers who were dismissed under recent mass firings and allow research that is done in partnership with institutions in foreign countries “to continue without disruption.” The NIH works with organizations around the globe to combat major public health issues, including types of cancer, tobacco-related illnesses, and HIV. In addition to the firing of probationary workers, NIH fired 1,200 civil servants as part of a rapid “reduction in force” at federal health agencies. During a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff, a recording of which was obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the decisions about RIFs “happened before I got here. I actually don't have any transparency into how those decisions were made.” Other workers have been fired since Bhattacharya took the helm — nearly all the National Cancer Institute's communications staff were fired in early May, three former employees told KFF Health News. Garrett said he retired early from the cancer institute because of concerns about political interference. Career officials routinely work under both Republican and Democratic presidents. It is par for the course for their priorities and assignments to evolve when a new president, Cabinet secretaries, and other political appointees take over. This time, workers said the upheaval and harm done to the NIH is so extensive that they felt they had no choice but to protest. In 11 years at NIH, Norton said, “I've never seen anything that comes anywhere near this.” In the June 9 letter, the workers said, “Many have raised these concerns to NIH leadership, yet we remain pressured to implement harmful measures.” “It's not about our jobs,” said one NIH worker who signed the letter anonymously.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics of the definition say it is designed to protect Israel by punishing legitimate criticism. The move comes two weeks ahead of the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where a number of high profile candidates are running against Adams. Support for Israel and the city's Jewish population has become a key issue, with the frontrunners holding starkly different views on Israel's war on Gaza. Adams, a deeply unpopular first-term mayor whose time in office has been blighted by accusations of accepting bribes, has positioned himself as a staunch defender of Israel as he seeks to win election. He referenced the recent murder of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington and the attack on a crowd of people in Colorado who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza before signing the order. “Since Hamas' terror attacks on October 7 2023, we have seen this hateful rhetoric become normalized on our campuses, in our communities, and online as antisemitic propaganda far too often masquerades as ‘activism'. When Jewish New Yorkers make up 11% of the population but more than half of all hate crimes, we know this moment demands bold, decisive action to crack down on anti-Jewish hatred,” Adams said. His main rivals are Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned in 2021 amid accusations of sexual harassment, and Zohran Mamdani, a New York state representative. Last year, Cuomo joined Benjamin Netanyahu's legal defense team after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has long been outspoken on Palestinian rights, has described the situation in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 50,000 people, as “genocide” and said he would have Netanyahu arrested if he came to the city. Adams signed the executive order at a synagogue in Manhattan on Sunday. He then sat for a discussion with Phil McGraw, a television personality and Trump supporter, about the threat of antisemitism, in which he criticized anti-Israel demonstrations at universities.</p>

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed the strike, saying Ukrainian drone units, in coordination with other units, targeted VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro in Cheboksary overnight as part of efforts to degrade Russia's capacity to produce air attack systems. The targeted facilities are part of Russia's military-industrial complex and produce adaptive Kometa antennas, used in Shahed-type attack drones, planning and correction modules for guided aerial bombs (KAB), and other precision-guided weapons, the General Staff said. VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute that specializes in developing electronic warfare (EW) systems, including the Kometa antenna, used to jam satellite, radio, and radar signals. The "responsible decision was made to temporarily suspend production to ensure the safety of employees," he said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. One video, published by the Russian independent news outlet Astra, shows a drone approaching the target and making impact, causing another explosion. VNIIR-Progress is a major research and development institute for Russian EW systems. It produces the Kometa antenna, which Russia uses to make its bombs more accurate and less vulnerable to Ukrainian interference. In recent days, Ukraine has launched a number of strikes against military facilities in Russia, including missile bases and airfields. The most audacious and high-profile attack came on June 1, when Ukraine carried out Operation Spiderweb — a mass drone strike that simultaneously targeted four major Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 planes. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on June 9 that air defense units had intercepted 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the country. Overnight drone strikes reportedly triggered flight restrictions at airports in Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov, and Tambov. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. More than 20,000 people chose to stand behind us. We're deeply grateful and overwhelmed with your support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Dissent,” he said, “is the very essence of science.” In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter – and their careers on the line. Opinion: The chaos in America's scientific community could be Canada's gain The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. The White House defended its approach to federal research. “In recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized health care and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,” spokesman Kush Desai said. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says. It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants. U.S. National Institutes of Health pulls funding for UBC research on HIV and women At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. “I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,” Norton told the Associated Press. The signers said they modelled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October, 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School. His declaration drew together like-minded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH. “He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,” said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration. But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. “So much of it is gone – my work,” she said. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. But that won't happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants. Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centres gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants. The letter asserts that “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the US by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement. The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the US and don't hold a valid visa. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the US even after the ban takes effect. What exactly is Trump's new travel ban about? During Trump's first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy. No such disruption was immediately discernible at Los Angeles International Airport in the hours after the new ban took effect. “I have family in Haiti, so it's pretty upsetting to see and hear,” Louis-Juste, 23, said of the travel ban. “I don't think it's a good thing. Freeways blocked, cars on fire: LA protests against immigration raids and National Guard deployment Trump said this time that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. He relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the US after their visas expired. Trump's proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries. Trump also tied the new ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The ban was quickly denounced by groups that provide aid and resettlement help to refugees. “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a nonprofit international relief organization. The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. Trump suspended refugee resettlement his first day in office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The need to diversify Canadian trade continues. American tariffs on Canadian goods spotlight concentration risk: 75 per cent of this country's exports go to the U.S. That risk's sharp point cut through recent Statistics Canada data showing that “Canadian exports cratered in April and the trade deficit soared to a record high.” Mounting U.S. national debt (US$36.2-trillion) that President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will exacerbate is causing bond markets to flash red. An American fiscal crisis will weaken U.S. demand for Canadian imports down the road. During the Canadian federal election campaign, Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals had proposals to help businesses “diversify away from the U.S.” and soften the ebbs in trade flows caused by American political and economic instability. Barbecue maker Napoleon has always been proud to be made-in-Canada. But a closer look shows the harsh reality of manufacturing at home A lot like a business case study that documents the rise of one of this country's earliest industrial triumphs that put “Made in Canada” on the world's manufacturing map. In the lead-up to Canadian Confederation in 1867, the U.S. had abrogated a free-trade deal and imposed new tariffs. Canadian businesses and farmers were compelled to figure out how to manage increased costs while seeking new markets, both internal and external. Thus began a quest to find, build and innovate new technologies that would transform farming from an arduous, subsistence exercise to one that generated prosperity and nation-building growth. Yet they also long spent time and money exploring the innovations emerging across Lake Ontario in places such as New York state, where a much larger and wealthier market fostered technological successes and failures at a rapid pace. The made-in-Canada tools that are helping make ‘buy Canadian' more convenient They bought farm implements and tools from the U.S., reverse engineered them and then licensed the best ones for use in Canada, which they would then produce, honing their manufacturing capacity in the process. At the same time, they learned to market and took advantage of new railway building in Canada to expand their customer base. The company won critical acclaim for its harvesting equipment at home and soon found itself representing Canada at the 1867 International Exhibition in France. There, it walked away with two gold medals: one in marketing for its display and the other, importantly, in recognition of the superior performance of Massey harvesters. From gold medals to foreign sales, Massey reapers and mowers found markets. Twenty years later, Massey equipment was being sold in Europe, Britain, Turkey, Russia, South America, Jamaica and most British colonies. Massey farm machinery and tools were made in factories in Ontario and shipped overseas using steam-powered ships with corkscrew propellers that opened global markets. Through market diversification, the company built economies of scale, mitigated the seasonality associated with selling only in Canada, widened its field of learning to global customers and suppliers, and refined its ability to win business in the face of strong competition that further supported research and development of their own products at home. Rather than compete against their American counterparts in the U.S., the Masseys made the critical decision to learn as much as they could from American enterprise and know-how, add their own innovations and expertise, and use the outcome to beat brash U.S. competitors at their own game on the global stage and in Canada itself. Only after that, in 1910, did they enter the U.S. market. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

MOSCOW, June 9. /TASS/. Russia consistently defends the principles of sovereign development and respects the cultural and civilizational identity of peoples, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a message of greetings to participants, organizers, and guests of the 28th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF).

This year, the forum will be held under the theme, "Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World," Putin stated. " "Russia consistently upholds the principles of sovereign development and respect for the cultural and civilizational identity of nations and peoples," the Russian leader noted.

This year, the SPIEF will take place at the EXPOFORUM Convention and Exhibition Centre in St. Petersburg on June 18-21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS. According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva. Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia. SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system. Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder." Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war. Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White British children are currently a minority in one in four schools across England, The Telegraph has reported, citing government records. The report, published on Saturday, was based on the results of school census data collected from more than 21,500 educational institutions across the country in early 2025. According to the figures, in 72 English schools there are no white children at all, while in 454 schools they make up less than 2% of the pupils. At Rockwood Academy in Birmingham, none of the 1,084 students were recorded in the census as “white British,” while there were only 12 out of 2,779 attending Loxford School in the London borough of Redbridge, The Telegraph reported. The “demographic shift” is most visible in cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford, and Leicester, the paper said. In Newham and Harrow, there are only 5% and 7% of white children, respectively, the report said. Last week, a report came out forecasting that white British people will become a minority in the UK population in the early 2060s. The author of the study, Buckingham University Professor Matt Goodwin, said that his predictions raise “profound questions about the capacity of the UK state to both absorb and manage this scale of demographic change.” Goodwin stressed that they are certain to provoke a “considerable degree of anxiety, concern and political opposition” among many voters, which “need to be… addressed if the UK is to avoid considerable political turbulence and polarization in the years and decades ahead.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat. “We know that it's a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday. “But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.” Katz warned the ship that “you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.” Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday. “We are still on our way to Gaza. There's no turning back, and we're hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said. After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again. But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine. For all of us,” she said. “From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement. Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said. The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta. An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated Irish actor Liam Cunningham was onboard the Madleen. The FFC has confirmed he is not onboard.</p>

ATAMI, Shizuoka — Princess Akiko of Mikasa stressed the importance of cultivating fertile soil for traditional Japanese culture to live on without the need for protection, during a recent event that kicked off the World Forum on Japanese Culture. In the first session, Princess Akiko delivered a speech titled “Japanese Art: Untold Stories,” in which she said that traditional Japanese culture will become “a thing of the past” unless it is incorporated into modern society and people make use of it. “Culture should come alive in our everyday lives,” she said. That realization led her to study Japanese art and eventually launch “Shinyusha,” an initiative that provides children with opportunities to experience authentic Japanese culture through workshops. Topics include making Japanese tea in a traditional manner and wearing kimono — practices that are no longer common in everyday Japanese life. She called for a “bottom-up style” of cultural preservation, in which each person naturally strives to protect their culture, rather than a “top-down style,” in which authorities choose what to keep and protect. “What we can do now is use our own efforts to build a future for preserving our precious Japanese culture.” He said Japanese culture has been nurtured through finding harmony between nature and people, while in the West, culture and science have developed through efforts to overcome nature. A similar point was addressed in the discussion that followed involving four experts: Kawai; Kazumi Murose, a lacquer artist designated as a living national treasure; Harvard University Prof. Yukio Lippit; and Tokugo Uchida, director of the MOA museum. Lippit said culture is not something each country should discuss independently, and that common values are important for getting even people overseas to feel like they want to carry on Japanese cultural heritage. Leading figures in traditional arts, traditional crafts, science and other fields are invited to speak, providing various perspectives on Japanese culture. Recordings of the forum's lectures and discussions will be made open to the public in multiple languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese and Thai. The recordings are planned to be made available online through about 20 institutions in 10 countries, such as the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University. The third session is scheduled to be held in August and will feature Ryoji Noyori, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, and Seiichi Kondo, a former director general of the Cultural Affairs Agency, as speakers. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Emily Kilcrease is a Senior Fellow and Director of the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. From 2019 to 2021, first in the Trump administration and then in the Biden administration, she was Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Investment. Geoffrey Gertz is a Senior Fellow in the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. From 2022 to 2023, he was Director for International Economics on the U.S. National Security Council. On April 2, a day he dubbed “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced a sweeping new program of tariffs intended to rebalance U.S. trade. Trump's tariff rates were shockingly high, triggering a stock market selloff and a flight away from U.S. assets, rare rebukes from some Republicans in Congress, and diplomatic outrage around the world. The U.S.-led global trading order, constructed over eight decades following World War II, has frayed. But there is no going back to a time when the United States championed ever freer trade. Although many of the targets of Trump's tariffs, including businesses and foreign states, may pine for such a world, structural geopolitical changes have made it untenable. Many countries are dependent on the U.S. market, and few see China as a viable alternative. Most major economies will seek accommodation with the United States, even after being beaten up by heavy U.S. tariffs. Washington can therefore leverage its trade wars to achieve a productive restructuring of the international economic system. To do so, however, the Trump administration must look beyond securing simple, short-term wins—such as one-off purchase agreements of U.S. commodities or temporary tariff truces—and cease bullying the United States' trade partners. It must instead build a new set of rules and norms that facilitate integration among like-minded states and that disentangle them from adversarial ones, especially China. A better path is possible, one that leads to gains for the United States and its allies. But they need to leverage the current chaos, rather than letting it consume them. In the aftermath of World War II, the United States led a process to create a set of economic rules that promoted an open, multilateral trading order. It set up institutions to help govern commerce, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, later, the World Trade Organization. The resulting system, which favored openness and integration, was well suited to a geopolitical era marked by American hegemony. Washington viewed the rules-based economic order as vital to its own prosperity and strategic interests, and it had every reason to uphold it. As of last year, China is the world's largest trading nation in terms of goods, having clawed its way up by diverging from market principles and creating enormous friction in the global economic order. Many countries, including the United States, practice industrial policy, but China's systemic abuse of the open trading system is in a category by itself. Meanwhile, new shocks and crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted vulnerabilities associated with deep economic interdependence. Rather than a unipolar order premised on U.S. leadership, the global economic landscape is now characterized by emerging alternative power centers and, for many countries, a privileging of security concerns over economic efficiencies. At its core, the current trading system prioritizes nondiscrimination and the “most favored nation” principle that trading partners should treat each other alike. But economic and national security concerns differ by trading partner: trade with close allies can strengthen a country's security, while trade with adversaries can make it more vulnerable. It thus makes little sense to require countries to treat all trade partners as “most favored.” The trading system allows members to break with this universalist ethos on national security grounds, but it provides little guidance on what conditions must be met to take advantage of this exception. In the past, this mattered little as states acted with a presumption of openness and minimal restrictions. But over the last decade, increasing geopolitical competition has compelled more and more countries to impose export controls, sanctions, and other economic restrictions on trading partners. Such recurring deviations from the rules, even when justified, have bred disorder and uncertainty. Against this backdrop, Trump has turned the United States into a revisionist power seeking to shatter what remains of the economic order. But there is still an opportunity to wrest a positive outcome from the current tumult. The president's willingness to take bold action has set in motion ambitious trade negotiations, which normally proceed at a snail's pace. Participants included experienced trade negotiators from the United States and several foreign capitals, as well as regional experts and security analysts. Teams representing traditional U.S. trade partners such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe bristled at Washington's bullying. In fact, many agreed to align with the U.S. team on counter-China measures. Rather than pursuing deeper integration with China, many countries are scrambling to ensure that the incipient trade war does not bring a flood of cheap Chinese exports into their markets. Multiple contingencies could propel the world trading system in a different direction. Foreign governments, for example, might face intense domestic political pressure to push back against the United States. Even in the absence of popular outrage, U.S. provocations on nontrade issues could tank any talks. To achieve a positive outcome, Trump will have to prioritize good-faith trade negotiations and tamp down the more chaotic aspects of his trade policy, such as imposing tariffs so extreme that he is forced to roll them back once it becomes painfully obvious that they are unsustainable. If the Trump administration hopes to salvage a victory from its trade wars, Washington must use tariffs as leverage in pursuit of clear and achievable trade objectives rather than as a blunt tool wielded in pursuit of myriad and mutually incompatible ones. After all the chaos Trump has unleashed, foreign governments rightfully worry that a U.S. promise to lift tariffs today will not protect them tomorrow. There is no simple solution to the credibility problem. The Trump administration came to power determined to demonstrate that it would be a disruptive force not bound by existing norms, and it has done just that. The president's early moves to impose tariffs primarily relied on emergency powers, since these allow for speedy action unencumbered by routine democratic processes (such as soliciting public comment on the potential impact of his policies). This erratic approach has already led to outcomes that are plainly ridiculous, such as the administration's punitive tariffs on the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited largely by penguins. Actions that were meant to seem aggressive have instead come off as uninformed and unsustainable. But the Trump administration can still improve U.S. credibility, if not rescue it entirely, by bringing more order and predictability into the trade policymaking process. Trade policy, after all, does not need to be this chaotic. The president has a variety of legal avenues to pursue his objectives. These mechanisms require fact-based investigations by the administration and input from the public, which are at odds with Trump's unilateral style. But they give the government a chance to uncover and address unintended consequences. The slow and steady pace of these trade tools also affords the private sector time to prepare and adjust rather than throw their supply chains into disarray overnight. Washington must also clarify what it expects of allies. Trump may believe that keeping trade partners on their toes is a smart negotiating strategy. But the chaos unleashed by his trade policies is already bumping up against external constraints. Such backlash could nudge the administration toward a more moderate path. Congress, too, may opt to rein in some of the executive's tariff authorities. American consumers are souring on the president's tariff obsession and anticipating higher inflation. And if government bond holders panic again, as they did in April, Trump may once more be forced to announce a tariff pause. The Trump administration would be wise to get ahead of these mounting external pressures by adopting a more predictable approach. Continually rejiggering the tariffs signals incoherence, perhaps even weakness, to allies and adversaries alike. At present, the administration appears focused on negotiating shallow “framework agreements,” which provide some partial relief from tariffs in return for modest trade concessions and purchase agreements but gesture only vaguely at possible future cooperation. There is an alternative, even more worrisome path the trade wars could take. After tearing up the existing global trade rules, the United States could advance a more nakedly transactional approach in its international economic relations, eschewing any rules or shared norms that might constrain U.S. action. As the world's largest economy turns inward and adopts beggar-thy-neighbor policies, other countries would respond in kind, adopting regressive protectionist policies, as happened during the Great Depression. The starting point should be relaxing the principle of nondiscrimination and accepting that trade policy will differentiate among trade partners and allow democracies to favor one another. Indeed, this would simply reflect the fact that the United States already treats China, its principal geopolitical adversary, differently from other trading partners. The United States should continue to trade with China in low-end manufacturing, agriculture, and a handful of other areas. But in more strategic sectors, such as chips and pharmaceuticals, Trump should prioritize “de-risking” from China, as he did in his first term. Additionally, Washington should make significant investments in domestic manufacturing and research and design, coordinating with other major economies wherever possible. Should China and the United States partially decouple, Americans could feel some economic pain. Doing so will help the United States and its partners replace what has been lost and scale up production in sectors essential to a strong defense, technology, and innovation base—which will be required for long-term competition with China. To that end, they should coordinate their use of export controls, investment screening, and data security measures. They will also need to address China's overcapacity and unfair trade practices in key industries, such as steel and aluminum. These steps will help build shared expectations about when trade and investment restrictions are legitimate for national security concerns, fostering predictability and stability in the new economic security order. Ultimately, Trump should aim for a future order made up of the following concentric circles: deep economic and security integration for close allies and partners; predictable, rules-based exchange among most countries; and careful de-risking from competitors. Such an order would provide a more stable framework for the world as it is. The United States' trading partners correctly fear that Trump is breaking an economic order that cannot be rebuilt, and their near-term objective is tariff relief. They must see this as an opportunity to work alongside the United States in building a new architecture that addresses their shared challenges. Whether they like it or not, geopolitics has shifted in ways that make the previous rules-based order unsustainable. Trump's shock to the system may not be pretty. But it could open the way for a much better system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. WILL FREEMAN is Fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. They suspected that it had been a cartel training camp and might hold clues about the fates of their children, whom many believed to have been kidnapped or forcibly recruited by the cartels. But once they arrived, they discovered something far worse: what appeared to be three crematoriums littered with bone fragments and hundreds of pairs of shoes, some of them identical to the ones their children had been wearing when they went missing. In March, after news of the discovery spread, Mexico's attorney general's office organized an official visit for reporters and parent collectives. Even worse, authorities may have known about the ranch before they intervened in September 2024. According to the newspaper El País, Virgina Garay, whom I met while she was searching for her missing son, had alerted authorities to the suspicious site in 2021 after receiving an anonymous tip and visiting the area. These are not isolated events; they happen because state officials in Mexico protect organized crime—not occasionally but routinely, at various levels of government. Often, officials face a simple calculus: they are more likely to profit than be punished for colluding with cartels. Since taking office in October 2024, Sheinbaum has taken a harder line on organized crime, increasing seizures of drugs and guns and arrests of suspected cartel operators. But with their political and judicial protection networks still intact, any criminal groups that are weakened by the president's current strategy may simply be replaced by new ones. Criminal-political networks will continue dividing the country into private fiefdoms, with politics, justice, and the legal economy reduced to arenas of lawless competition. To truly reduce the cartels' corrosive power, Sheinbaum should pursue their protectors. Although fully dismantling the judicial and political protection networks that have underpinned Mexican organized crime for decades in just six years is likely impossible—they are too vast and numerous for any president to eliminate in one term—she has it in her power to make an example of the worst offenders and at least deter collusion. If Sheinbaum begins holding public officials accountable, she may alienate powerful members of her party, the National Regeneration Movement, known as Morena, some of whom allegedly benefit from these relationships. The Trump administration, however, can offer Sheinbaum valuable political cover—and incentives to act. It has referred to an “alliance” between the Mexican state and cartels and clearly grasps that the Mexican authorities are not dismantling these pacts on their own. Although tactics such as U.S. drone strikes will do little to weaken the cartels, U.S. pressure could help generate the political will in Mexico to finally begin punishing collusion. If it succeeds in striking this balance, Sheinbaum could begin meaningfully and durably weakening the cartels—not just temporarily disrupting their operations. After a nearly two-decade period in which 275,000 Mexicans have been killed by organized crime and one million Americans have died from drug overdoses, it's time. Although Sheinbaum won the election as an AMLO disciple, she quickly broke with the former president's hands-off security strategy, known as “hugs not bullets.” This was a significant shift for Morena, which, despite its popularity has always been weak on security. He recruited and defended politicians with alleged criminal ties, and he even pressed the first Trump administration to return a top Mexican army general who had been arrested in the United States on drug smuggling charges. Trump complied, and Mexico's attorney general dropped all charges on his return to the country. AMLO also spent big on cash transfers that boosted Morena's support while cutting funding for state and local police forces. And he spoke as if belonging to the party was in itself a guarantee that politicians would not collude with criminals. The result was that Morena became hegemonic—a genuinely popular big-tent party that oversaw rising wages and the exit of five million Mexicans from poverty. Even in Morena bastions such as AMLO's southern home state of Tabasco, voters I spoke with expressed frustration with their Morena governor for overseeing rising cartel violence. This helps explain why Sheinbaum, despite loyally carrying forward other AMLO initiatives such as judicial reform, immediately pivoted on security. Sheinbaum's government claims these tactics are already pacifying the country, with homicides officially down almost 25 percent since September. Journalists, however, have pointed out that disappearances have increased, which suggests that criminal groups may simply be hiding their violence more effectively. The share of Mexicans who report feeling unsafe, at 62 percent, has barely budged in the last year, and just under a third of Mexicans expect their cities to get safer this year. Still, nearly half of Mexicans approve of the government's new security policy, close to double the percentage who felt that way when Sheinbaum started. As mayor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023, Sheinbaum and her public security secretary, Omar García Harfuch, achieved a steep drop in crime by increasing the use of intelligence and promoting closer cooperation among security policymakers, prosecutors, and the Mexico City police. This has been a major hindrance to fighting cartels. Now Sheinbaum and Harfuch are attempting to fix this disjointed system. They are passing laws to centralize intelligence collection and analysis and are consolidating the power of the federal public security ministry, which Harfuch leads, to coordinate policy across agencies. In November, a constitutional amendment gave Harfuch's ministry the power to conduct police investigations. Proposed secondary laws would give the federal security minister access to nationwide data on prison inmates, arrests, vehicles, fingerprints, criminal records, and cellphone accounts linked to users' biometric data, and require municipalities and states to share this information upward. The problem, of course, is that if Sheinbaum and Harfuch succeed in these reforms, several other institutions are bound to lose authority, resources, and control. According to reporting by El País, General Ricardo Trevilla, Mexico's national defense secretary, is lobbying Morena lawmakers not to pass the remaining legislation when it comes up for a vote in mid-June or July. Even if these reforms succeed, others threaten to limit the scope of any anti-impunity efforts—none more so than Mexico's recently implemented judicial reform. Several candidates with alleged ties to organized crime, including one who spent time in U.S. prison for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Texas, made it past candidate screening commissions, which were dominated by Morena, and onto the ballot. Now that judges are vulnerable to electoral pressures, many fear that they will be less likely to sentence powerful crime bosses and their protectors. Mexico's 2025 budget reduced security spending by 36 percent—even though state police in half of Mexican states make less than minimum wage. The slimmed-down budget compensated for electorally motivated last-minute spending by AMLO that pushed Mexico's fiscal deficit to a record 5.7 percent of GDP in late 2024. Generating more revenue is likely crucial to transform Mexico's security situation. But the country's tax revenue as a share of GDP is among the lowest in Latin America, and Sheinbaum has for now ruled out higher taxes, forcing her to reconcile social programs and other spending with Mexico's security needs. But Sheinbaum's biggest challenge of all remains finding the political will to address corruption inside Morena. On the one hand, on Sheinbaum's watch, the attorney general has begun investigating a former Morena governor and a handful of Morena local officials for alleged criminal wrongdoing. These probes center on relatively minor figures, but they are nevertheless a marked change from the all-too-permissive tone set by AMLO. Sheinbaum also addressed a letter to Morena members in which she insisted that “there cannot be any collusion with crime—whether organized or white-collar.” She also secured passage of a law against nepotism in politics, which may weaken some existing corruption networks. On the other hand, Sheinbaum told a reporter, “There are no ties between Morena and crime.” And although she called for a thorough investigation into whether state prosecutors in Jalisco mismanaged the Teuchitlán case, she also defensively insisted that “there is no forced disappearance by the state” in Mexico—this despite the United Nations calling disappearances “generalized and systematic.” The reason for Sheinbaum's caution is likely twofold: the damage that public exposure of criminal collusion could do to Morena's image, and her fear that she could lose control over her party to internal rivals. Given the pushback Sheinbaum may face from party heavyweights, the army, prosecutors, and even AMLO himself, she may decide that none of this is worth it—that disrupting the status quo of widespread impunity is too risky. There is, however, one external factor that could increase her resolve to act: the United States. The United States has more leverage over Mexico now than at any time in recent years. The Trump administration must resist the temptation to focus on showy public-facing policies, such as unilateral drone strikes, which would practically force Sheinbaum to reduce cooperation in defense of Mexican sovereignty. Understandably, the Trump administration may wish to avoid anything that sounds like futile justice sector reform. The United States spent over $400 million supporting a decadelong transition to a new criminal justice system in Mexico, as part of the Mérida Initiative, only for Morena to clear large parts of that system away in its recent judicial reform. For instance, the administration has already revoked visas of Mexican politicians allegedly linked to crime, and according to an unnamed U.S. official interviewed by ProPublica, Washington is currently developing a longer list of such politicians eligible for sanctions. Many cartel leaders are also now in U.S. federal custody and facing charges; they presumably have knowledge of official corruption that they will share with U.S. federal prosecutors to strike plea deals. As the United States gathers more information about how the state-crime pacts really operate and makes some of this information public, it will strengthen Sheinbaum's incentive to act. The Trump administration, however, should not overestimate Sheinbaum's control over Morena. Curbing impunity for colluding with crime will be a long, incremental process, extending beyond any one six-year term. If Trump and Sheinbaum miss this opportunity, and the penalties for official collusion with crime remain as low as they are today, the outcome is all but certain: more drug overdose deaths in the United States, and more tragic cases like Teuchitlán in Mexico.

TOKYO (AP) — An explosion at a storage site for unexploded ordnance at a U.S. military base on Japan's southern island of Okinawa injured four Japan's Self-Defense Forces soldiers, though the injuries are not life-threatening, officials said Monday. The four soldiers sustained finger injuries while working at a facility that belongs to Okinawa prefecture and temporarily stores unexploded ordnance, mostly from wartime and found on the island, local officials said. Prefectural officials said the injuries were not life-threatening, but no other details were immediately known. It said no U.S. servicemembers were involved in the incident. Hundreds of tons of unexploded wartime bombs, many of them dropped by the U.S. military, remain buried around Japan and are sometimes dug up at construction sites and elsewhere. Many of them are still found on Okinawa, where about 1,856 tons of unexploded U.S. bombs are believed to remain. In October, an unexploded wartime U.S. bomb exploded at a commercial airport in southern Japan, causing a large crater and suspending dozens of flights.

WASHINGTON, June 9. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio stumbled while ascending the ramp before departing from the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, according to a Fox News broadcast.

The president stepped off the plane and stumbled about halfway up the ramp but quickly regained his balance. Before boarding the aircraft, he turned and waved to journalists.

Rubio, who followed Trump up the ramp, also stumbled.

Trump had spent the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and is now at his country residence in Camp David, Maryland, according to journalists from his press pool.

Trump has repeatedly drawn attention to similar stumbles by his predecessor, Joe Biden, citing them as evidence of Biden's deteriorating condition and inability to lead the country.</p>
