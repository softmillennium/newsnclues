                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visa pilot demonstrates potential of eliminating intermediaries with blockchain, drastically reducing cross-border transaction times. Visa and Chainlink have completed a key milestone in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) e-HKD+ Pilot Programme, successfully testing a cross-border blockchain transaction using central bank digital currency (CBDC) and stablecoins. The trial, conducted in partnership with ANZ, ChinaAMC, and Fidelity International, is one of the first real-world simulations of programmable money being used for cross-border investment in tokenized assets. The test used Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect ANZ's private blockchain, DASChain, with Ethereum's (ETH) public testnet. This enabled an Australian investor to exchange an AUD-backed stablecoin (A$DC) for e-HKD and use the digital Hong Kong dollar to purchase a tokenized money market fund (MMF) offered by asset managers in Hong Kong. Visa's Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) powered the creation and movement of digital money, while Chainlink CCIP coordinated smart contracts for payment-versus-payment (PvP) and delivery-versus-payment (DvP) flows. The simulation shows how investors in Australia could use either a CBDC or stablecoin to directly invest in Hong Kong-based funds, removing intermediaries, reducing wait times, and increasing transparency. With tokenized asset markets projected to exceed $2 trillion by 2030, the HKMA's pilot reflects a growing global push to modernize capital markets through digital infrastructure. The e-HKD+ initiative expands on earlier phases to include tokenized bank deposits and programmable payments across both public and permissioned blockchains. Fidelity and ChinaAMC, who have issued tokenized funds in previous initiatives, highlighted how programmable digital money could improve fund issuance, reduce operational friction, and reach broader investor bases. ANZ's participation, including its A$DC stablecoin and role in FX conversion, further illustrates how traditional banks are integrating digital assets into cross-border finance. The pilot will now enter its next phase, with end-to-end transaction testing and performance evaluation across compliance, speed, and interoperability. The results are expected to inform regulatory frameworks and set standards for future use of CBDCs and stablecoins in global financial markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Avoids Death Cross, Ethereum Stabilizes and Fartcoin Defies Gravity: Analysis Technical analysis of crypto assets can be hard—but we're here to try and make it a little easier for you. Today, we're starting with a near-death-cross experience for Bitcoin, Ethereum finding its footing despite bearish signals, and Fartcoin (yes, Fartcoin) showing strength among alts. Cryptocurrency markets showed signs of life Monday after a prolonged 13-day correction that tested investor resolve. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.34% to 19,674.07, maintaining its position near record territory despite lingering inflation concerns and Federal Reserve uncertainty. The Fear & Greed Index, which as the name implies measures investor sentiment based on how fearful or greedy they might be acting, stood at 62 points, placing market sentiment in slightly bullish territory after weeks of extreme readings. Bitcoin is trading at $108,313 on Monday, stabilizing after shedding nearly 10% during its recent correction. This confirms a medium-term bullish outlook that was able to avoid a death cross in late May and makes it easier to see the short-term moving averages as a good price support zone—if prices go down, it would be a bit hard for them to crash below $100K, which is where the current EMA line is. Bitcoin's Volume Profile Visible Range, often abbreviated as “VPVR,” highlighted a high-volume node between $92,000 and $96,000, establishing a critical support zone where significant trading occurred. This concentration of volume acts as a magnet for price, making it difficult for Bitcoin to fall below this range without substantial selling pressure. Bitcoin's Average Directional Index, or ADX, stands at 19, suggesting the previous downtrend is now weakening. The declining ADX can therefore be interpreted as exhaustion in selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at a neutral 58, sitting comfortably between oversold (below 30) and overbought (above 70) conditions. This positioning leaves room for upward movement without triggering technical sell signals that often accompany overheated markets. For those into fundamentals, Bitcoin treasuries are all the rage right now: Paris-based Blockchain Group raised $340 million specifically to expand Bitcoin holdings, the company announced Monday, and Brazilian startup Meliuz announced a share offering to fund additional Bitcoin purchases for its treasury last week. They're yet another sign that global firms are following Strategy's playbook of accumulating BTC. Meanwhile, Ethereum is changing hands at $2,567, demonstrating strength after testing the psychologically important $2,500 support level. The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators show mixed signals, with basically everything depending on whether that zone remains a strong support or not. No buy or sell recommendations can be made based on technical analysis right now, at least for a short time frame. Fartcoin rocketed 12.55% higher to $1.16, bringing its market capitalization to $1.12 billion and securing the 66th position among crypto peers in the market cap rankings. The meme token's technical indicators flashed uniformly bullish signals. Rising ADX during price advances validates the move's legitimacy rather than indicating a mere oversold bounce. This pattern typically precedes explosive moves as compressed volatility releases. The coin's actual listing on Coinbase, though, remains pending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tsunami of new bitcoin BTC$108,577.48 treasury companies — firms that almost exclusively dedicate themselves to accumulating bitcoin — is flooding the market. “The most important metric for a bitcoin treasury is the premium it trades at relative to its underlying net assets, including any operating company,” Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at bitcoin financial firm NYDIG, wrote in a June 6 report. “It's this premium that allows these companies to convert stock for bitcoins, effectively acting as a money changer converting shares for bitcoins,” Cipolaro said. One of the most popular metrics, mNAV, measures a company's valuation to its net asset value — in these cases, their bitcoin treasuries. An mNAV above 1.0 signals that investors are interested in paying a premium for exposure to the stock relative to its bitcoin stash; however, an mNAV below 1.0 means the equity is now worth less than the company's holdings. But mNAV alone is “woefully deficient” to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these firms, Cipolaro said. The research report made use of other metrics such as NAV, mNAV measured by market capitalization, mNAV by enterprise value, and equity premium to NAV to provide a more complex picture. Alas, both SMLR and DJT are little-changed on Monday even as bitcoin climbs to $108,500 versus Friday evening's $105,000 level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price pushed through a critical overhead resistance level, possibly opening the door to new all-time highs. Bitcoin opened the week with strength as bulls target new highs in BTC and altcoins. Many major altcoins are stuck in a range, but HYPE is showing signs of strength. Bitcoin (BTC) made a solid start to the week, sprinting toward the overhead resistance zone of $109,588 to $111,980. Trader Cas Abbe said in a post on X that Bitcoin is likely to witness a big move, possibly above $109,000 to $110,000. Abbe noted that $15.11 billion in shorts would be liquidated if Bitcoin soars 10% from the current levels. On the other hand, a 10% down move risks liquidation of $9.58 billion in long positions. Although most analysts believe Bitcoin's long-term trajectory is up, some anticipate a short-term dip before the uptrend resumes. Private wealth manager Swissblock anticipates a drop to $104,000, while analyst Mickybull Crypto expects a fall to $101,500. Could buyers propel Bitcoin above the all-time high of $111,980, pulling altcoins higher? The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week, and the bulls are trying to build upon the momentum on June 9. The move higher may not be easy as the sellers are expected to defend the 6,000 to 6,147 zone with all their might. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA, opening the gates for a fall to 5,767. Buyers are trying to start a recovery in the US Dollar Index (DXY) but are facing selling near the 20-day EMA (99.49). This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average (100.30). The price action of the past few days has formed an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline near $112,700. Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bears are active at higher levels. The BTC/USDT pair could then plunge to solid support at $100,000. The bulls are expected to defend the $100,000 level with all their might because a break below it may deepen the pullback to $93,000. Ether (ETH) has been consolidating between $2,323 and $2,738 for the past few days, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. This is a critical resistance for the bears to defend because if the level gets taken out, the pair could soar to $3,000 and then to $3,153. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it suggests that the bears are trying to take charge. The pair could then collapse to $2,111. XRP (XRP) has been range-bound between $2 and $2.65 for the past several days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the vital support at $1.61. BNB (BNB) has been oscillating between $693 and $634 for the past few days, signaling buying near the support and selling close to the overhead resistance. The pair could then rally to $732. Sellers are likely to have other plans. If that happens, the pair could plummet to $580. Solana (SOL) turned up from the $140 support on June 5, but the recovery is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA ($158). If they succeed, the pair could tumble to $123 and subsequently to the solid support at $110. Related: XRP price will hit $25 if ETF approved, then crash 90%, new analysis says Buyers are expected to mount a strong defense at the $0.14 level, keeping the DOGE/USDT pair inside the range for some more time. An up move could begin after buyers propel the pair above $0.26. Cardano's (ADA) recovery is facing resistance near the 20-day EMA ($0.69), indicating that the bears are selling on rallies. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $0.50 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $0.40. Buyers will have to drive the price above the moving averages to gain strength. The pair may then climb to the downtrend line, which is a critical level to watch out for. A break and close above the downtrend line suggests the start of a new up move to $1.02. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the triangle. That suggests the break above the triangle may have been a bull trap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chainlink (LINK) played a pivotal role in a successful pilot program that facilitated the exchange of two central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol enabled seamless transactions. This integration was key in demonstrating how blockchain-based infrastructure can enhance the efficiency and security of international payments. Chainlink's protocol effectively bridged the gap between different blockchain networks, providing a seamless experience for all parties involved. Visa, Fidelity International, ANZ, and China Asset Management Company participated in the transaction framework. Each of these players contributed to the pilot's execution and success, reinforcing the growing collaboration between traditional finance and decentralized technologies. This partnership highlights how established financial players are beginning to adopt and integrate blockchain and digital currency solutions into their existing systems. This pilot also comes when traditional financial institutions show increasing interest in blockchain and Web3 technologies. Recently, JP Morgan concluded its first transaction on a public chain, signaling a deeper commitment to the Web3 space. Using Chainlink's technology to connect private and public networks, JP Morgan's transaction with tokenized U.S. Treasuries on Ondo Finance demonstrates how blockchain is reshaping traditional finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, apparently benefiting from easing trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which reflected the digital currency's growing recognition as a store of value. As of April 28, more than 70 publicly listed companies, including the likes of MicroStrategy MSTR and Marathon Digital MARA, hold 720,728 bitcoins worth $68.5 billion.Bitcoin is now trading above $105,000, lower than the all-time high, but much higher than the $76,000 it registered in early April. The liberal policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have been benefiting Bitcoin and other crypto assets. An executive order by President Trump that directed a working group to study and propose changes to cryptocurrency regulations bodes well for crypto enthusiasts. In March, President Trump announced the creation of a crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, which augurs well for cryptocurrency miners, including BIT Mining Limited BTCM and exchanges like CME Group CME.Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain technology, which comprises complex cryptography and software that creates an immutable and decentralized database.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deutsche Bank is actively exploring tokenized deposit options and considering launching its own stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday. Behzad explained that banks have numerous pathways into the stablecoin market, ranging from serving as reserve managers to issuing their own digital currencies, either independently or through industry consortiums. While Deutsche Bank hasn't yet announced its own tokenized deposit solution, the German institution participated in trials with UBS last year involving single bank tokens and continues evaluating whether to launch a stablecoin independently or join existing industry efforts. The bank's exploration comes as several major financial institutions have already moved into tokenized deposits. Citi, HSBC, JP Morgan and UBS have all launched single bank solutions, while Deutsche Bank has been participating in collaborative initiatives. These include the Partior cross border payments platform alongside DBS, JPMorgan, and Standard Chartered, as well as multi bank tokenized deposit experiments in Germany through the commercial bank money token initiative. Deutsche Bank already has some exposure to stablecoin development through its asset management division DWS, which partnered with Galaxy Digital and Flow Traders to create the AllUnity stablecoin joint venture. The bank has also expanded its services to cryptocurrency firms, positioning itself within the growing digital asset ecosystem. The broader banking sector shows increasing interest in stablecoins, with Société Générale's FORGE becoming the first systemically important bank subsidiary to launch one. Santander is reportedly considering its own stablecoin, Standard Chartered has announced development plans, and discussions continue around a potential joint stablecoin among US banks.</p>

Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC). “Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy's hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it's becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Andrea Salinas had “slayed the Crypto beast,” Gallego, D-Arizona, wrote in November 2022. His word choice from three years ago might suggest a hostility to Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency king whose PAC spent millions to boost Salinas' opponent in her Democratic primary before making news for the collapse of his company. Last year, groups aligned with the industry spent $10 million supporting Gallego's Senate campaign. This year, Marc Andreessen, a billionaire venture capitalist who is one of the biggest advocates for cryptocurrencies, headlined a fundraiser for Gallego's affiliated campaign funds. He is the top-ranking Democrat on a Senate subcommittee overseeing digital currency issues and embodies a recent embrace of an industry that many Democrats — and even President Donald Trump — had once viewed with wariness. But Trump has dropped his reticence on an industry he once called “a scam” and has already pocketed billions from his family's own business interests in crypto. Gallego has delayed that triumph, at least for the moment. He has said he and other Democrats working on the bill want to ensure the measure contains safeguards against money laundering and protects national security. Selkis, a self-described member of the “crypto political machine,” pointed to the millions of dollars in backing Democrats like Gallego had received in 2024. On the other end, Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said Gallego is further empowering an industry with a bill that will destabilize financial markets and hurt his own party. “The Democrats in support of this bill are essentially putting our economy at risk and filling the pockets of an industry that is going to spend enormous amounts of money against them in 2026,” Frayer said in an interview. The stablecoin bill would stand to create a regulatory framework for a payment system that to this point has gone unchecked by government. Relatively few people currently use cryptocurrency, but especially with a White House that markets it, that could change dramatically in the near term. Critics of the bill see it as treating crypto vendors too differently than banks. Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, teaches financial stability regulation and worked with a congressional commission to identify the causes of the 2008 Wall Street crisis. “Isn't it great for helping people who have been previously locked out of the financial system? “The reality, just to shatter that narrative, is that it's essentially the same kind of story that was being told about some private mortgages in the lead-up to 2008, where people who have been previously excluded from financial opportunities are being offered something really quite predatory.” “The key in 2022 why most people didn't even notice was that the crypto industry was not integrated with traditional finance,” she said. … But for people who had never invested in crypto, unless they were following the news, they wouldn't have known that anything had happened.” Bankman-Fried, the soon-to-be indicted billionaire entrepreneur who founded FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and his allies poured more than $10 million into the race in support of little-known Carrick Flynn. Flynn, 35 at the time, worked in artificial intelligence in Washington, D.C., until the COVID-19 pandemic, when he moved back to his native Oregon and ran for Congress. That's when Gallego congratulated Salinas for slaying “the Crypto beast.” Three days before Gallego did, Bankman-Fried's FTX faced a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy. The implosion of FTX rattled cryptocurrency markets and put a glaring spotlight on Bankman-Fried. A legal resident of the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried had discussed personally paying off that country's $11 billion national debt. Soon after the downfall of FTX, a bipartisan trio of senators questioned California-based Silvergate Bank about its significant relations to the crypto industry. At the same time, then-President Joe Biden's proposed federal budget reflected a sense common among Democrats that crypto didn't need oversight breaks. But by then, some congressional Democrats sought a rapprochement. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, has been a crypto advocate for years and tried to smooth industry relations with the Biden White House in a private meeting in July 2024. After Biden dropped out of the race, Khanna convened a similar meeting weeks later that included a representative for Vice President Kamala Harris and billionaire Mark Cuban, another left-leaning crypto fan. That ended with industry executives “lashing out” at the White House team, according to an account by Fox Business citing unnamed sources. Trump had completed a personal reversal on the issue long before that. In 2021, he told Fox Business that “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. By contrast, the Democratic platform didn't mention crypto at all. Stand with Crypto, an industry group, provides grades on members of Congress. Three weeks later, Gallego's written answers to Stand with Crypto's questions helped him win the support of the industry during his Senate campaign. “I know firsthand that when Congress fails to keep up with our adversaries and competitors, we are putting our nation's security and economic growth at risk,” Gallego wrote in his only answer that went beyond yes or no. We must also provide regulatory clarity that promotes safe, responsible use of technology for investors, consumers, businesses, and everyday Arizonans.” One of the questions involved whether he would support something like a 2023 House bill that was an earlier attempt to create a stablecoin regulatory framework. That bill, dubbed the “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” got almost no traction when Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, introduced it in July 2023. It never got a vote in the House and only picked up one co-sponsor, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-New York. In July 2024, Gallego was one of 21 House Democrats to vote with almost every House Republican to override Biden's veto of the measure affecting SEC rules on crypto. Gallego's more crypto-friendly rhetoric helped convince a super PAC supportive of crypto to back Gallego over Republican Kari Lake in their Senate contest. Over a three-week span beginning in August 2024, Protect Progress, a political-action committee funded by people with ties to the crypto industry, spent $10 million in support of Gallego's candidacy. The ads played up Gallego's biography as a combat veteran. His platoon commander in the Iraq War, a Republican, recalled an ambush attack and praised Gallego for “running towards enemy fire. The ad didn't mention crypto issues at all. The super PAC was one of three crypto-aligned organizations, led by one called Fairshake, that spent a combined $291 million in the 2024 election cycle. Only three candidates received more than Gallego: Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, $40 million and the fractionally larger sums spent supporting Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Michigan, and opposing the Senate campaign of former Rep. Katie Porter, D-California. Four congressional candidates in Arizona also received support from the crypto-aligned super PACs: Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, $1.4 million; Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Arizona, $1.6 million; former Republican candidate Blake Masters, $583,000; and former Democratic candidate Andrei Cherny, $415,000. For Selkis, who founded a crypto analytics firm, Gallego's recent vote shows the folly of helping Democrats at all. Selkis is an enthusiastic Trump supporter who resigned his post as CEO of Messari after inflammatory social media posts following the first attempted assassination of Trump in July 2024. “Anyone that votes against Trump at this point can die in a (expletive) fire,” he wrote in a post he later deleted. As Gallego and other Democrats blocked a vote on the stablecoin bill last month, Selkis ripped his allies at Fairshake for their credulity in dealing with Gallego, Slotkin and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California. “It's hard to overstate how useless everyone in the crypto political machine was aside from me and (Bitcoin magazine chief) David Bailey last year,” he wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While these forms of digital currency were once little more than food for thought on the internet for niche online communities to discuss, they have since become integral to modern fintech and economics. Today, the Bitcoin price is soaring to unprecedented heights, reaching values it has never achieved before. In this way, Bitcoin's success reflects a growing shift in how the world approaches not only cryptocurrency but also financial markets as a whole. The highest value Bitcoin has ever had in its history was logged just a handful of hours before this writing, when it reached $111,691.50 USD per token. To this end, not only is Bitcoin flourishing at the moment, but it is outright setting new high-water marks that it has never reached before. Fluctuations in the price of BTC are often linked to economic events such as interest rate announcements, geopolitical tensions, or ETF flows. However, since then, the cryptocurrency has been on a steady ascent. Furthermore, the coin doesn't seem poised to relent anytime soon, having built up so much momentum that it continues to break its own records. When it debuted to the public in 2008, through a nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” the concept of cryptocurrency felt more like science fiction than reality. In 2008, a major superhero movie had just come out, online shopping was often viewed negatively, YouTube was still emerging, and MySpace reigned as the leading social media platform. However, over the next decade, society and culture gradually aligned with the vision that Bitcoin's anonymous creators outlined in that original whitepaper. Bitcoin's true utility began to be realized over a decade after its release. In 2020, during a period of global unrest and challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin's popularity surged. While many skeptics and forecasters doubted that cryptocurrency was a legitimate venture or one that would endure, the digital currency ultimately proved its staying power in the following years. Nevertheless, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, making it essential for investors to be acutely aware of Bitcoin's current price. Economic factors like inflation, interest rates, and government policies significantly influence Bitcoin's price. Designed for high reactivity and swift changes, it responds noticeably to major global events, affecting its value. Cryptocurrency initially attracted investors eager to embrace such ambition and get in on the ground floor. As a result, any news about new regulations concerning cryptocurrency and its use can significantly impact the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a twenty-one million coin cap, making it resistant to inflationary dilution. Additionally, recent technological advancements surrounding the token and the acquisition of it have also aided in this boost of value and popularity. Advancements such as the Lightning Network have enhanced Bitcoin's utility for fast, low-cost payments. When a well-known cryptocurrency influencer or guru forecasts that Bitcoin's price will drop soon, many investors tend to sell off their tokens. Multiple factors influence the fluctuations in Bitcoin's market value. Critics often view this as a flaw in cryptocurrencies; however, it actually highlights the technology's exceptional strengths. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies were designed to be highly responsive and interactive, acting as smarter funds that swiftly adapt to market dynamics. Therefore, Bitcoin's persistent volatility is not a drawback of its technology; rather, it illustrates how effectively this digital currency is connected to the market's fluctuations. After nearly twenty years since its initial inception, Bitcoin has climbed its way out of obscurity and reached unprecedented levels of success. In 2020, when its value first began to skyrocket, many discredited the digitized currency and its value as little more than a passing fad. However, over five years later, the cryptocurrency is continuing to hit new highs and show the world how integral it has become to modern finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony has announced Soneium For All, an incubation program designed to accelerate the development of consumer applications and gaming within its decentralized ecosystem, which already has 7 million users. The Soneium For All project originates from Sony Block Solutions Labs (SBSL), the division that built Soneium, a blockchain based on Ethereum and developed using the Optimism OP stack. According to what was stated by SBSL, the goal is to “bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 audiences, particularly for creators, fans, and communities.” In other words, Sony aims to make the blockchain more accessible and useful for a broad audience, going beyond the financial sector to embrace areas such as entertainment, gaming, and content creation. Linked to a giant in electronics with 78 years of history, the network has already managed to attract millions of users, demonstrating significant potential for the mainstream adoption of blockchain. With the introduction of the Soneium For All incubator, Sony aims to stimulate innovation within its ecosystem, offering support to developers and startups that want to build consumer and gaming applications on its network. The initiative is part of a broader context in which large tech companies – from Apple to Uber – are exploring the possibilities offered by blockchain to transform their business models. “This initiative reflects our vision of empowering creators globally through blockchain technology. By lowering entry barriers for developers and helping them reach users more quickly, Soneium For All brings us closer to a more open and creator-driven internet,” stated Ryohei Suzuki, Director of Sony Block Solutions Labs. The words of Suzuki highlight a paradigm shift: no longer just large centralized platforms, but a decentralized internet, where creators can have direct control over their own content, monetize more fairly, and interact with their communities in a transparent and secure manner. The strength of Soneium For All also lies in its strategic partnerships. The collaboration with Astar Network, one of the main Japanese blockchains focused on interoperability and scalability, and with Startale Cloud Services, a provider of advanced cloud solutions, ensures the program a solid technological foundation. This type of integrated approach – technology, mentoring, and capital – is fundamental to creating a fertile environment for innovation. The gaming industry, in particular, is considered one of the most promising grounds for Web3 technology, thanks to the possibility of creating unique digital assets, virtual economies, and decentralized interactive experiences. The incubator will offer developers the opportunity to experiment with new forms of interaction, create innovative business models, and reach an already established user base. At a time when blockchain is trying to break out of its niche to become a mass technology, initiatives like this can make the difference. The launch of Soneium For All represents a key moment in Sony's strategy for the digital future. By combining advanced technology, high-level partnerships, and a creator-centered vision, the Japanese company demonstrates its intention to play a leading role in building a more open, inclusive, and decentralized internet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia's participation in Project Dunbar, a cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, is a sound move, said Professor of Economics Anella Munro. “Being part of this project certainly fits into the goal of understanding what it is, developing capacity, considering potential use cases, and collaborating with others, some of whom have experience and some who do not. Munro said while there are other ways to facilitate cross-border transactions, CBDCs remain a superior option. “None is really as good as a central bank digital currency because it's a safe settlement asset, like we use at the wholesale level, and I hope it would help potentially with transparency, speed, and cost.” She said cross-border payments have traditionally relied on correspondent banking systems, which are slow and expensive. However, Munro said, with cross-border CBDC implementation, there are a lot of issues about governance. Borders become irrelevant once you're on some of these platforms.” She pointed to stablecoins which could provide a similar kind of service, although they are not as strong as central bank liabilities because they come with a different kind of counterparty risk. “If stablecoins are very well backed, they could potentially serve as a settlement asset in the system,” Munro said. The push for CBDCs dates back starting with China's e-yuan project in 2014. When Facebook Libra came around in 2019, it renewed focus on the area, driven by concerns over big tech potentially controlling global payment systems and private data from social networks.</p>
