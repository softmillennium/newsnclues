                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that predicts acute child malnutrition up to six months in advance could help combat the condition in Kenya and across Africa, nearly half of deaths among children under five linked to acute undernutrition - most of them in low- and middle-income countries - according to the World Health Organization. Five per cent of children in Kenya are acutely malnourished, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic Health Survey, a level considered a public health concern. Scientists have come up with a machine learning model that uses clinical health data and satellite imagery to forecast malnutrition trends across the country. The tool was developed by a team from the University of Southern California (USC), in collaboration with Microsoft's AI for Good Research Lab, Amref Health Africa, and Kenya's Ministry of Health. Lead researcher Laura Ferguson, director of research at the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health, says the goal is to equip health authorities with early warnings that support effective prevention and treatment responses. Unlike traditional models that depend solely on historical trends, this AI tool integrates clinical data from more than 17,000 Kenyan health facilities. It achieved 89 per cent accuracy for one-month predictions and 86 per cent accuracy over six months, marking a significant improvement over baseline models. The tool can also integrate publicly available data on agricultural vegetation derived from satellite imagery into the model, to indicate available food sources, Ferguson added. "This model is a game-changer," said Bistra Dilkina, associate professor of computer science and co-director of the USC Center for AI in Society. "By using data-driven AI models, you can capture more complex relationships between multiple variables that work together to help us predict malnutrition more accurately," she explained. He suggests aligning health services with agriculture and disaster management efforts. "Continued investment in digital health infrastructure and training is also critical," Mburu told SciDev.Net. Peter Ofware, Kenya country director for Helen Keller International, a US-based non-profit focused on nutrition and health, agrees that integrating vegetation data with DHIS2 improves forecasting accuracy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that children living with multiple sclerosis (MS) show signs of accelerated biological aging, even in their teenage years. We found evidence that children living with MS experience accelerated biological aging. Compared to young people without MS, youth with MS had evidence of accelerated epigenetic age, a measurement of DNA chemical modifications associated with aging. We know that aging is related to the development of a less treatable form of MS and that adults with MS face both normal aging and accelerated aging from the disease." MS is a lifelong autoimmune disease that attacks the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The research team used DNA methylation markers - molecular changes that indicate biological age - to analyze blood samples from 125 children with MS and 145 children without MS. In contrast to chronological age, which reflects the number of birthdays, biological age tracks how quickly the body is wearing down on a cellular level. Despite appearing outwardly healthy, children with MS showed DNA patterns indicating they were biologically older than their peers. The researchers found differences in four different epigenetic clocks and signs of accelerated aging in MS patients in models of two clocks most sensitive to health-related stress and inflammation. Epigenetic clocks are age-predicting algorithms that calculate epigenetic age as an estimate of chronological age or age-associated clinical events such as disease or all-cause mortality. The most affected kids appeared to be aging up to two years faster biologically than their healthy peers, even though their average chronological age was just 15. Biological age has already been linked to disability progression in adults with MS. This study suggests the process may start much earlier than previously thought, potentially even before visible symptoms of progression appear. And that could change the way MS is treated. "This is a whole new concept in MS," said Graves. "Aging isn't something we think of affecting teenagers. But these kids are accumulating cellular damage that may not show up clinically until years later, when they suddenly transition from doing fine to disease progression in their 30s. It is a significant finding to see this accelerated aging in children. The researchers hope future studies will track patients over time to see how early biological aging contributes to long-term disability. They also plan to explore how social stressors, obesity and environmental exposures may accelerate aging in children with MS, especially given the higher prevalence of pediatric MS among lower-income families.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spending too much time on screens may cause emotional and behavioral problems in children â€“ and those problems can lead to even more screen use, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. Conducted by an international team of researchers, the study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed 117 studies, encompassing data from over 292,000 children worldwide. Children are spending more and more time on screens, for everything from entertainment to homework to messaging friends. Noetel and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis to better understand the relationship between screen time and socio-emotional problems, like aggression, anxiety, or low self-confidence. They included any study with participants under 10 years of age that measured screen use and socio-emotional problems, where children were followed-up for at least six months. Screen-based activities included social media, video games, TV watching and online homework. The researchers identified several factors that may moderate these relationships. Compared with younger children (ages 0-5), older children (ages 6-10) were more likely to develop socio-emotional problems with greater screen use. Girls were generally more susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems with greater screen use, while boys were more likely to increase screen use when facing socio-emotional challenges. The type of screen content and purpose of screen use also played a role, according to Noetel. The findings suggest parents might want to be cautious about what screens they allow and use parental controls to manage time, said Noetel. He also noted that kids who use screens heavily might need emotional support, not just restrictions. Parents could benefit from programs helping them handle both screen use and emotional problems. "This comprehensive study highlights the need for a nuanced approach to managing children's screen time," said lead author Roberta Vasconcellos, PhD, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who conducted the research while a doctoral student at Australian Catholic University. "By understanding the bidirectional relationship between screen use and socio-emotional problems, parents, educators and policymakers can better support children's healthy development in an increasingly digital world." Because every study in the meta-analysis followed kids over time, the research is a big step closer to causeâ€‘andâ€‘effect (as opposed to correlation) than the usual snapshots done at a single point in time, according to Noetel. "It's about as close as we can get to causal evidence without randomly cutting screens for thousands of kids," he said. "But still, we can't completely rule out other factors-like parenting style-that could influence both screen use and emotional problems." Vasconcellos, R. P., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the advent of extensive 3D biology studies, we are at a pivotal moment in transitioning from 2D biology-based research to more accurate and reliable 3D models. The shift towards utilizing complex organ-like structures developed from stem cells or tissue samples is becoming essential; these organoid models are leading the way to next-generation, animal-free research methodologies. Organoids show significant potential in various applications, including disease modeling, drug discovery and development, personalized medicine, cell biology processes, and genetic disease research. In the field of cancer research, there is particular interest in patient-derived organoids (PDOs), which are created using cells sourced from patient-derived samples such as biopsies and surgical resections. Tumor heterogeneity and genetic variations within tumors challenge drug treatment strategies and often require multiple lines of therapy, which can lead to the development of resistant cell populations. While several traditional in vitro assays exist for drug response studies, there is a growing need for improved combinations of 3D models, biological handling systems, and assays to better capture the complexity of in vivo conditions. These improvements should address common pain points such as timely handling of complex 3D models, scaling up workflows, automating assay steps, enhancing data acquisition, and enabling deeper analysis for therapeutic drug discovery. In this article, colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids were chosen as the model system for drug response studies, using established anti-cancer compounds to evaluate the effectiveness of robotics-based assay development. The organoids were cultured and treated over a six-day period, during which an image-based endpoint assay was conducted to analyze drug responses. The BAB400 pipette hand was employed to dispense organoids into MatrigelÂ® domes. Subsequently, organoid cultures were monitored over a six-day period through imaging for time-course observation and endpoint assays. Over 160,000 of our innovative solutions are incorporated into laboratories worldwide, enabling scientists to improve productivity and effectiveness â€“ ultimately accelerating research and the development of new therapeutics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immunotherapy is gaining traction as a prominent approach to cancer treatment. While significant progress has been made with immunotherapy for blood cancers, its effectiveness in treating solid tumors remains limited. A key factor contributing to this low success rate is the solid tumor microenvironment (TME), where suppressive cytokines hinder the tumor-killing capacity of T-cells. Research indicates that PDOs respond to drugs in ways that closely mirror the responses of the original tumors, highlighting their potential to improve therapeutic outcomes. As physiologically and pathologically relevant cancer models, PDOs better capture the key characteristics of primary tumors. This makes them a more suitable platform than 2D models for evaluating the effectiveness of T-cellâ€“mediated killing. Despite the advantages associated with PDOs, substantial obstacles hinder their widespread implementation in drug discovery. The production of organoids is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor. Furthermore, organoid culture requires specialized manual skills, leading to significant variability among operators. To address the challenges associated with large-scale applications of PDOs, a semi-automated bioprocess has been developed for the large-scale expansion of assay-ready organoids. Utilizing bioreactor-expanded patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids (CRCs), activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with CellTracker and introduced to CRCs (stained with MitoTracker) in a 96-well microtiter plate, with monitoring occurring every four hours for three days via a high-content imager. These results highlight the utility of bioreactor-expanded organoids in large-scale T-cell-based screening assays.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking antipsychotic medications as prescribed lowers the risk of a car crash for drivers with schizophrenia, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250020. Schizophrenia can cause hallucinations and disorganized behaviour that affect the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. Most people with schizophrenia are prescribed antipsychotic medications that improve many of these symptoms. Researchers hypothesized that these medications may also reduce the risk of a motor vehicle crash - but only if patients continue to take the medication as prescribed. Staples and colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, used 20 years of population-based health and driving data to examine 1130 motor vehicle crashes involving drivers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and prior treatment with antipsychotics. They found that taking antipsychotic medication as prescribed significantly reduced the odds of a crash. We found that perfect adherence to antipsychotic medication (relative to complete nonadherence) was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of a crash. We believe our results suggest that antipsychotic medications reduce crash risk among individuals with schizophrenia." "Our results provide one more reason for doctors and family members to encourage people with schizophrenia to take their antipsychotics as prescribed. We think our results also suggest that health systems should put more resources into programs to support antipsychotic adherence among people with schizophrenia," says Dr. He adds, "If a driver with schizophrenia isn't taking their medications as prescribed, should their driver's licence be temporarily suspended? But we also know that people with schizophrenia are often marginalized, with limited opportunities for employment and social engagement. Taking away their driver's licence might make them more isolated. We think more research is needed so that policy-makers can understand these risks before enacting a policy that might be coercive or harmful."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Detection of melanoma and a range of other skin diseases will be faster and more accurate with a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool that analyses multiple imaging types simultaneously. University of Queensland researchers including Professors H. Peter Soyer and Monika Janda were part of a Monash University-led team that developed the tool, which improved skin cancer diagnosis accuracy by 11 per cent when used by dermatologists in a reader study. A series of evaluations showed the model helped non-dermatologist healthcare professionals improve diagnostic accuracy on various other skin conditions by 16.5 per cent. It could also supported clinicians to detect skin cancer early, identifying potentially concerning changes before clinician detection. Professor Soyer said the tool could be particularly valuable in busy or resource-limited settings, or in primary care where access to dermatologists may be limited. Differences in imaging and diagnosis techniques can arise due to different levels of resources available in urban, regional and rural healthcare spaces. The strength of PanDerm lies in its ability to support existing clinical workflows. We have seen that the tool was also able to perform strongly even when trained on only a small amount of labelled data, a key advantage in diverse medical settings where standard annotated data is often limited." Trained on more than two million skin images, data for the model was sourced from 11 institutions in multiple countries, across 4 types of medical images. "By training PanDerm on diverse data from different imaging techniques, we've created a system that can understand skin conditions the way dermatologists do; by synthesising information from various visual sources," Mr Yan said. With skin conditions now impacting 70 per cent of the global population, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial and can lead to better treatment outcomes. Unlike current models, which are trained to perform a single task, PanDerm was evaluated on a wide range of clinical tasks such as skin cancer screening, predicting the chance of cancer returning or spreading, skin type assessment, mole counting, tracking lesion changes, diagnosing a wide range of skin conditions, and segmenting lesions. Alfred Health Victorian Melanoma Service Director, Professor Victoria Mar, said PanDerm showed promise in helping detect subtle changes in lesions over time and provide clues to lesion biology and future metastatic potential. "In real-world hospitals or clinic settings, doctors use diverse ways and different types of images to diagnose skin cancer or other skin conditions." Though showing promising research results, PanDerm is currently in the evaluation phase before broader healthcare implementation. The team plans to establish standardised protocols for cross-demographic assessments and further investigate the model's performance in varied clinical settings, with a particular focus on ensuring equitable performance across different patient populations and healthcare environments. The research led by AI and machine learning experts at Monash University also included collaboration with researchers and clinicians at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Alfred Health, Medical University of Vienna, NVIDIA AI Technology Centre in Singapore, University of Florence, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW Health Pathology and Hospital General Universitario de Alicante in Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to develop new therapies for age driven diseases, today announced the publication of new research identifying a novel, single-gene target for cellular rejuvenation. Capable of reversing cellular aging across multiple cell types, without inducing dangerous pluripotency pathways seen in other approaches, SB000 is well positioned as a target for safer, next-generation cell rejuvenation therapeutics, with broad application across age-driven diseases. Existing approaches to cell rejuvenation primarily focus on the Yamanaka Factors (OSKM), a combination of genes that can be used to reverse cellular aging but are known to induce pluripotency that may result in tumorigenesis, limiting their use in a therapeutic setting. In this seminal study, SB000 demonstrated cellular rejuvenation at both methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without evidence of pluripotency. Not only is this approach safer when compared to OSKM, it also demonstrated comparable methylome rejuvenation, consistently across multiple cell types. Offering comparable efficacy to the Yamanaka Factors without the safety concerns associated with pluripotency, SB000 is well positioned as a target for next-generation, safer cellular rejuvenation therapeutics, helping us bring about a future where we have substantial control over the aging process and age-related diseases. We are pleased to progress SB000 on to proof-of-concept studies and expect this paper to be the first in a series of publications as we uncover the previously hidden biology of cellular ageing and rejuvenation."
