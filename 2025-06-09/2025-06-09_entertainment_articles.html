The ten-part series, which is based around Moore's Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson character, is being launched without an “anchor” broadcaster after a “frantic” dealmaking process.

Justin Baldoni‘s $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds and an additional suit against the New York Times have been dismissed by a judge in a major setback for the “It Ends with Us” director and star. The judge did, however, allow Baldoni to amend and re-file his complaint by June 23. Related Stories ‘Another Simple Favor' Trailer: Blake Lively Cons Wedding Guests with Anna Kendrick in Paul Feig's Sequel ‘Another Simple Favor' Review: Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick Head to Capri for a Sequel That Somehow Makes Even Less Sense (in a Good Way) It continues: “The Wayfarer Parties have alleged that Reynolds and [publicist Leslie] Sloane made additional statements accusing Baldoni of sexual misconduct and that the Times made additional statements accusing the Wayfarer Parties of engaging in a smear campaign. But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane, or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.” “Today's opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane, and The New York Times. As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.” Baldoni filed his 179-page countersuit against Lively in January, claiming that messages presented in Lively's initial complaint were taken out of context. It alleged that Lively's publicist Sloane planted negative news stories about Baldoni, and that the legal move was designed to help rebuild Lively's own reputation. She also accused Baldoni of hiring a crisis PR firm to flood social media with negative comments about Lively after alleged issues of sexual harassment on the “It Ends with Us” set. The ugly back and forth since then has involved Baldoni's team slamming Lively for seeking to withhold medical information, Taylor Swift nearly needing to be subpoenaed, and accusations that Reynolds based his “Nicepool” character in “Deadpool & Wolverine” on Baldoni in an effort to mock him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a statement from the teams at Baby's All Right, Funny Bar, and Nightclub 101, Jones died on Saturday morning, June 7, due to “a highly aggressive case of glioblastoma.” He was 45 years old. Jones moved to New York in the early 2000s after falling in love with the city's fast-paced environment and boisterous music scene. In the ensuing years, he turned his passionate fandom of bands and routine attendance at shows into a job as a booker at the now-defunct East Village venue Sin-é, as well as Elvis Guesthouse and the Dance. His curatorial talents left a permanent mark when he opened the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, bar and 280-capacity venue Baby's All Right, in 2013, with Zachary Mexico. In addition to fostering a welcoming environment for artists and fans alike, Jones often rallied behind the importance of 18-plus shows at venues like Baby's All Right. Most recently, Jones and Tom Moore, in partnership with Knitting Factory Entertainment, opened the new venue Night Club 101 within New York's historic Pyramid Club. Following a soft launch at the end of 2024, it opened properly earlier this year. Numerous artists and music industry peers have posted tributes in Jones' honor, including Cassie Ramone, La Femme's Alix Brown, and Windser. “When Baby's All Right opened, there was a certain synergy about it.. It answered the begging question of where to go after DIY favorite 285 Kent closed. The answer, according to Billy and Co., was to take the like-minded giddy, fever dream curation to a better space both for the band and audience,” Neon Indian's Alan Palomo wrote on Instagram. An innumerable amount of bands have cut their teeth in that space and gone on to do many a great musical deed. A lot of my favorite NYC memories are at Baby's All Right, Elvis's Guest House, and Pianos; courtesy of Billy. The teams at Baby's All Right, Night Club 101, and Funny Bar shared an additional statement in tribute to Jones. “He was one of the best to ever do it. We are holding him in the light,” Jones' colleagues wrote. “As his family, ourselves, our staff, and his friends all take time to mourn this profound loss, we ask that everyone just try and do what he did every day: share the love of music. There will be a memorial held in early July at Baby's All Right—more details to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds‘ team are claiming “total victory” Monday after a federal judge tossed out Justin Baldoni‘s $400 million defamation and extortion suit over what went on during the making of It Ends With Us and the subsequent alleged preemptive astroturfing smear campaign against Lively last year. While Judge Lewis Liman has permitted Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, executives and PR team of Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel to submitted another amended complaint by June 23 against Lively,  his exhaustive 132-page order looks to leave little wiggle room for Baldoni. “But the Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Reynolds, Sloane or the Times would have seriously doubted these statements were true based on the information available to them, as is required for them to be liable for defamation under applicable law.” Telling, and perhaps going to the heart of the multimillion-dollar, multi-lawsuit fracas he once termed a “feud between PR firms,” Liman also noted: “Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee's wrongful threats.” As a part of today's order, Judge Liman kicked out Baldoni's separate $250 million suit against the NYT. Baldoni's main lawyer Bryan Freedman did not respond to request for comment on today's ruling, but Lively's reps could barely contain their glee. “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys' fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.” While mum so far today, back in March when Lively's lawyers moved to have Baldoni's big-bucks complaint dismissed, Freedman said that the actress' attempt to “dismiss herself from the self-concocted disaster she initiated is one of the most abhorrent examples of abusing our legal system.” In a digital-age spectacle by any and all estimation that has seen the likes of Taylor Swift, Hugh Jackman, WME and others make what would be called cameos in any other context, today's ruling comes less than a week after a dust-up over Lively's 10th Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and her 11th Cause of Action for negligent infliction of emotional distress from her initially filed December 31 lawsuit took center stage. In the end, in part to preserve the privacy of her medical records, Lively dropped those claims, insisting they were essentially covered by other portions of her filing. Nobody is talking settlement right now, at least not before today. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California Governor Gavin Newsom has been publicly slamming President Donald Trump for taking control of the National Guard and deploying troops to Los Angeles amid anti-ICE protests. Trump flung it wide open, however, telling reporters on Monday that he thinks arresting Newsom would be “great.” Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job,” the president said. Newsom said earlier on Monday that the state will sue Trump over his federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. “The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. Trump signed an order on Saturday authorizing the federalization and deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops, 300 of which were promptly sent to Los Angeles without the request or consent of city and state officials. The action hasn't been taken by an American president since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson bypassed Alabama's segregationist Governor George Wallace and sent the National Guard to protect civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Trump's order invoked Title X, and called the National Guard — typically under the control of state governors — into federal service “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” The order does not mention California, but instead directs the National Guard “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” In effect, the order could be invoked in other states. “Let's be very clear, there was no risk of rebellion, no threat of foreign invasion, no inability for the federal government to enforce federal laws,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a Monday press conference. Bonta affirmed that his office would be pursuing a lawsuit to declare the president's unilateral commandeering of the National Guard as unlawful. “The Trump administration likes to ignore laws and just barrel forward. “They'd be getting two orders from two of their bosses, so to speak […] we think the appropriate way is to get a clear order from the court saying that Trump's actions were unlawful.” Sean Combs Trial: Second Mistrial Motion, ‘Freak-Off' Audio and Peek Inside Mogul's Bank Accounts Israel Detains Greta Thunberg, Other Activists After Halting Gaza-Bound Aid Ship The Biggest Boondoggles in Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Billie Joe Armstrong Tells ICE to ‘F-ck Off' in Support of L.A. ‘Unfathomable': Seth Rogen Torches Lawmakers Threatening Cuts to Medicaid Finneas Says He Was Tear-Gassed During ‘Very Peaceful' ICE Protest in L.A. Trump later claimed that Los Angeles would be “completely obliterated” if he had not sent in the National Guard. “Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight,” Newsom said in a Sunday night interview with MSNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armstrong posted an Instagram video filmed from one of the Los Angeles protests, captioned with a flipping-the-bird emoji and an ice cube. It's soundtracked to Green Day's “Fuck Off,” a bonus track from their Saviors (edition de luxe), which arrived in May. The clip shows a spray-painted car ignited in flames and police ostensibly arresting demonstrators, walking them while zip-tied away from the scene. On Sunday, Finneas said he was tear-gassed while attending a “very peaceful” protest in downtown L.A. Sean Combs Trial: Second Mistrial Motion, ‘Freak-Off' Audio and Peek Inside Mogul's Bank Accounts Israel Detains Greta Thunberg, Other Activists After Halting Gaza-Bound Aid Ship On Saturday night, Trump issued a memo federalizing National Guard units in California for 60 days. He also suggested that, via his Secretary Pete Hegseth, he could choose to additionally deploy members of the “regular Armed Forces as necessary.” Hegseth appeared to back that sentiment, tweeting in part: “And, if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.” On Sunday, the National Guard arrived in the city. Trump continued to antagonize protesters with threats of more troops on Monday, while area officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom have spoken against Trump's deployment of the National Guard, which they attribute to him escalating the situation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Jonathan Daviss is set to star as venerable hip hop artist Snoop Dogg in the definitive biopic from Universal Pictures. The film will be produced by Snoop Dogg, Brian Grazer and Death Row Pictures president Sara Ramaker. Daviss hails from Houston and played the role of Pope in the Netflix YA drama Outer Banks. The film is a look at how Calvin Broadus Jr. entered into the West Coast hip hop fray. Taking the moniker Snoop Doggy Dogg (he'd later drop the middle name), Snoop brought his laid back drawling delivery and sharp lyrics to Death Row Records, where he worked with Dr Dre on his smash debut album Doggystyle. He broadened into other platforms to the point he might well be seen rubbing elbows with Martha Stewart or getting in the pool with Michael Phelps during the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he became one of the high points of that Olympiad on NBC and Peacock. Numerous of Snoop's recent forays are tied to NBCUniversal; he's returning to NBC's musical competition series The Voice this fall, reclaiming his red chair for Season 28. Universal SVP Production Development Ryan Jones and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio. Daviss is represented by Monster Talent, Innovative Artists and Skrzyniarz & Mallean. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

So what does a modern woman do? Well, Sophie Brooks‘ “Oh, Hi!” might be the twisted answer to a very relatable dilemma. Billed as a “subversive rom-com” to not give too much away, “Oh, Hi!” premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman star as Iris and Isaac, a couple whose first romantic getaway soon goes awry. Brooks wrote and directed “Oh, Hi!,” with Gordon having a story by credit (she also produces). “Oh, Hi!” is screening at the 2025 Tribeca Festival June 13 and 14 before debuting in theaters this July.

Brooks told IndieWire that “Oh, Hi!” was inspired by “The Worst Person in the World,” “Normal People,” and the HBO adaptation of “Scenes from a Marriage” with Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac. “The film toes this really thin line of tone and perspective. It was really important to me that both characters felt like real people and fully rounded, realized versions of themselves. Iris is a really brave character, and it's a perfect storm of everything kind of landing in a way at the end of the first act where you're like, ‘Oh, if those things hadn't happened, she probably wouldn't have done this crazy thing.' She added, “Because, inherently, the movie's about miscommunication and how these two people are not on the same page, that moment, the audience is seeing his perspective in a scene where it's supposed to be about her.” Sony Pictures Classics will release “Oh, Hi!” in theaters on July 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The abrupt visa issues have impacted touring schedules for Mexican stars like Julión Álvarez and Grupo Firme. Henry Cárdenas was on his way to Texas from Chicago when he got the news: Julión Álvarez's work visa was cancelled, which meant the música mexicana hitmaker couldn't enter the United States in time for his sold-out show at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on May 24. “The entire production, including labor and equipment, amounted to over $2 million dollars — it was all a complete loss because we had to postpone the event. “In the past, we've known of groups or bands that apply [for a non-immigrant visa] and are denied but at least we were informed ahead of time. The day before your sold-out stadium show with 50,000 people? In the past two months alone, at least a handful of regional Mexican acts — including Los Alegres del Barranco, Banda Cuisillos, Lorenzo de Monteclaro and, most recently, Grupo Firme — have shared a similar experience to that of Álvarez's. Such was the case for touring giant Firme, which was unable to perform at La Onda Fest in Napa Valley, Calif., on June 1. Chicago's Michelada Fest, featuring Mexican music headliners Luis R Conriquez, Firme and Gabito Ballesteros, cancelled its two-day summer event over artist visa “uncertainty.” In general, U.S. visa uncertainties under the Trump administration have upended multiple communities and groups of people. “Everything is taking longer under Trump,” says attorney Daniel Hanlon, who specializes in immigration law. “It's a combination of a few things, including stricter vetting policies, which have resulted in delays in visa processing almost across the board. We're seeing this with foreign students at universities and now these musicians, and no one knows how it's being brought to the attention of those who are in the position to make these revocation decisions, or why they are deciding to do this now. In an unprecedented move, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau announced on X that the State Department had revoked Los Alegres del Barranco's work visas after the group portrayed images “glorifying” drug kingpin “El Mencho” at a concert in Mexico in March. The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” his post reads. In Mexico bans on narcorridos have spread across the country, where now 10 states have implemented laws to control or limit the diffusion of corridos in public spaces. That quickly changed this year when a wave of regional Mexican acts began to be impacted by visa delays, going beyond those who sing narcocorridos. Grupo Firme and Julión Álvarez — two of the biggest touring acts in the genre's history, breaking barriers for regional Mexican artists in the U.S. — are mainly known for norteño and banda ballads and party songs, not narcocorridos particularly. “We don't know what we are fighting against because we really don't know the reason these visas are getting denied or revoked, and it seems like it's no longer just because they sing narcocorridos, which is what they initially had said,” says Mariana Escamilla, vp at Promotores Unidos USA, a longstanding organization composed of promoters who specifically work the regional Mexican touring circuit. But even after being approved, these visas can be revoked at any time. “It's a euphemism for basically more background checks,” adds Hanlon. They use that as a blanket to delay the processing of visas. In a statement sent to Billboard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Mexico said, “Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally do not comment on U.S. government actions with respect to specific cases. What could be interpreted as targeting Mexican music and culture aligns with the Trump administration's “disdain for Mexicans,” says entertainment attorney Marjorie García, partner at King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano. “Any indication that [artists] are singing about anything the government doesn't like, just like they [want to cancel] funding for PBS and NPR, if you're not saying the things they want you to say, there is a perception that you don't get to be here.” Whether intentional or not, the timing couldn't have been worse. In 2023, Billboard reported that regional Mexican music consumption in the United States had jumped 42.1% year over year, outpacing gains in the Latin genre overall, as well as country, dance/electronic, rock and pop, according to Luminate. But now, the visa is being pulled after it's already given, and as you get closer to the show, and at that point, you either show up or pay. There's no way you can plan for someone to cancel your visa. This is all going to have a chilling effect when artists voices are most needed and in demand.” Visa delays or revocations will almost certainly not fall under a contract's force majeure clause, meaning event cancellation insurance very likely won't cover it. If the U.S. government says no, that's almost assuredly not going to be covered by event cancellation insurance,” says attorney Tim Epstein, partner at Duggan Bertsch, who represents most of the independent events and festivals in North America, including Sueños and Baja Beach Fest. “Maybe once a year you were dealing with artists having to cancel concerts or festival performances over visa issues, but having a whole festival canceled because of artist visa issues … I have never seen that before.” “A group like Los Alegres del Barranco that has a large following in the United States and already had contracts signed there, it is devastating financially,” Luis Alvarado, spokesperson for Los Alegres del Barranco, tells Billboard. “It is obvious that there is some kind of movement against Los Alegres del Barranco, but also against musicians who play this genre of music (regional Mexican). 1 market to tour in — it's the “base for success,” says Cárdenas. “You get guys like Firme and Julión who gross $10 million in one night here. This is where you make the big money — you don't make the money in Mexico, with all due respect.” For now, Cárdenas is staying optimistic and working diligently to help resolve this issue. “There are thousands of people working at the stadium when a concert happens, from parking, to vendors, production staff, all kinds of occupations that didn't make any money because the Julión show didn't happen,” he says. If this was a small promoter, it would go out of business immediately. They consume everything — food, water, beer, and people are working, trying to make a dollar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauren Miller Rogen was 22 years old, celebrating her graduation from college the first time she noticed something was happening to her mother, Adele. But for Rogen, who had watched Adele care for her own parents as they slowly succumbed to Alzheimer's disease, it was the potential future that unnerved her. Within two years, Adele, a first-grade teacher, would be diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at age 55. When the couple married a few years later, Adele's condition had progressed to the point that it wasn't clear at their wedding if she even realized who Lauren was. The toll of caring for Adele was hardest on Lauren's father. This — caring for her — seemed like it's literally killing him,” she says. “Without being able to afford outside help, I dread imagining what would have happened.” The couple went on to found a nonprofit, Hilarity for Charity, that disburses grants to offset the cost of caring for a person with dementia. “Until we were part of the care system, we didn't realize how broken it was,” Seth says in a video they recorded on behalf of the organization Caring Across Generations, to raise alarms about the threat families face under a pair of proposals to slash health care programs for the poor and disabled that are being considered at the state and federal level, and encourage people to contact their legislators. And that is why it is so unfathomable that federal and state legislatures are making massive cuts to Medicaid as we speak.” “That means these people will be losing access or have less access to the health care they need, creating more out-of-pocket expenses and medical debt.” In Washington, President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which was recently approved by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, would cut roughly $600 billion from Medicaid in order to help pay for a new round of tax cuts for the wealthy. The bill would additionally impose a financial penalty on states, like California, that offer health coverage to undocumented immigrants. Gavin Newsom that would slash Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. Medicaid is a pillar for caregivers — some 12 percent of recipients are people who can't work because of their responsibilities caring for a family member. Their ability to access the program could be jeopardized by the Big Beautiful Bill, which would impose work requirements on all able-bodied adults under 65 in order to qualify for Medicaid.

With the 10-episode “Murderbot” series, we actually get two sci-fi shows in one: There's the main sci-fi comedy from Chris and Paul Weitz about a rogue security robot (Alexander Skarsgård) hiding his free will while on a dangerous mission with a group of scientists. In addition, there's Murderbot‘s favorite space soap opera that he watches for escapist fun: the cheesy “Star Trek” parody, “Sanctuary Moon” (starring John Cho as the Captain). For production VFX supervisor Sean Faden, this meant wrangling a diverse array of nearly 1,800 VFX shots (spread among DNEG, Pixomondo, Image Engine, and Fin Design, among others). This included the opening and closing of Murderbot's helmet (his practical white suit was created by costume designer Laura Jean Shannon), the UI that reflects his POV (accompanied by his snarky voice-over commentary), a giant alien worm, and the realistic VFX used on the bridge of the spaceship on “Sanctuary Moon.” Related Stories Darren Criss, Nicole Scherzinger, Sarah Snook, and Cole Escola Lead Tony Winners Fred Armisen Accepts Maverick Award for Natasha Lyonne at IndieWire Honors “And then let the nanotech just kind of help us justify the pieces getting small enough that they could all fit together. “So that's why, when you watch it,” he continued, “the pieces still kind of have a motion to them that is more or less related to the shape of the helmet design itself. But the thing that was really fun was that Murderbot doesn't really wanna open its helmet most of the time, and I thought it would be great to have a button to play with. But, in Episode 2, Murderbot presses it and there's a pregnant pause to show that he's just messing with Gurathin [David Dastmalchian], who he doesn't like.” For the floating graphics displaying Murderbot's system alert, Faden worked with Finn and their design team, Super Vixen. He even had an idea of making the graphics character-driven during a Murderbot fight scene with another robot. “We wanted to bring all these graphics for fight enhancement that are still telling the story,” he said. I think we found the right sweet spot.” This was more like a caterpillar body with odd patterns on its plates and a snapping turtle mouth. “Our stunt guy would actually get a real reaction of being inside the kiddie tunnel with a bunch of grips rocking it around and getting him knocked back and forth.” Meanwhile, the use of an LED wall from Pixomondo to create the background environments on “Sanctuary Moon” was intended to look impressive in combo with a real set, despite the show's cheesy vibe. “And we had three cameras running at once, so sometimes the lock off camera on the side might just be seeing a wall and didn't have to track, and that was okay. But “Murderbot” also made use of a lot of good drone location footage from Toronto, Moab, Utah, and Iceland. “I went to Utah and shot a ton of stuff for over two days,” Faden said. “And a lot of those wider establishing shots were used for the Hopper spaceship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The parody king is still showing younger performers from John Mayer to Clairo how to stand out — and stay in the game. Am I the first person to feel strange calling you ‘weird'?” John Mayer — bespectacled, grinning goofily, very much nerding out — is sitting across from “Weird Al” Yankovic, interviewing the Hawaiian shirt-clad parody music king, who is sitting across from him for his SiriusXM show, How's Life With John Mayer. “You can call me Al, like Paul Simon says,” Yankovic says with smile, before adding that the most normal thing about him is, probably, his pancreas. Let's just get this out of the way: “Weird Al” Yankovic is, beneath his accordion-playing, polka-loving surface, exceedingly normal. He likes long evening walks to get his steps in. (“It's going to look almost exactly the same as it did before, except it cost a fortune!”) The 65-year-old artist's one attempt at rock star behavior, back in his early-'80s heyday, was comically un-vain: On a touring rider, he requested, in the spirit of Van Halen's famed ban on brown M&M'S, “one really horrible Hawaiian shirt for every show I did.” (On that run, he did 200, and a collection that now extends to a storage unit somewhere in greater L.A. Still, if not precisely weird, Yankovic is truly singular. His catalog can be divided into two types of songs: intricately crafted, meticulously arranged, hilarious yet never mean-spirited parodies of hits by acts ranging from Michael Jackson to Coolio to Nirvana to Lady Gaga, and original pastiches, for which he deep dives into artists' catalogs to create songs that, with eerie accuracy, mimic the sounds and idiosyncrasies of those genre-spanning artists. During each of the first four decades of his career, he has had entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and eight of his albums have reached the top 20 on the Billboard 200 — including his most recent studio release, 2014's Mandatory Fun, which became his first No. He has won five Grammy Awards and an Emmy. Billboard estimates he has sold 12 million albums in the United States (based on RIAA certifications pre-1991 and Luminate data from 1991 on). Incredibly, he's done all this without ever changing his essential “Weird Al”-ness. “From day one, there was never even a discussion that would not be about following his singular vision,” says Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager of 43 years and sometime creative collaborator (notably, they co-wrote the now nerd canon comedy UHF, which Levey also directed). “It's hard to find any career where there's literally no compromise, but we might be able to count on one hand the number of compromises he's made in his career.” Sometimes, that's meant turning down lucrative deals, like the $5 million beer endorsement that Yankovic passed on in 1990 because, he feared, the brand was “trying to make me into Joe Camel.” Many times, it's meant standing up to record-label executives, like when, amid his “draconian” first album contract with Scotti Brothers (an indie then distributed by CBS), he was asked to shoot 10 music videos on a $30,000 budget simply because he'd proved he could do one for $3,000. But just as often, it's meant embracing an open-to-anything spirit that seems to almost always work out in his favor. Yankovic decided very early in his career to ask permission of any artist he parodied — not because the law required it (it doesn't) but because he simply had no interest in making enemies. The sound quality was superb,” says McLean, who calls Yankovic a “straight-ahead good boy” who “could be on Leave It to Beaver.” Thanks to that combination of earnest good intentions, work ethic, backbone and obsession with quality, Yankovic finds himself in an unusual position today: He's no novelty relic of the '80s, but a truly cross-generational artist. “Growing up with his videos was a massive thing in my generation,” says Clairo, 26. He always knew how to draw people in.” He and his team will prove just how true that still is when Yankovic heads out on the Bigger and Weirder Tour this summer. It's his fastest-­selling, biggest-grossing tour yet, according to his agent, Wasserman Music's Brad Goodman, and his biggest by other metrics, too: an eight-piece band (his largest yet) onstage; first-time venues bigger than any he's played before, including New York's Madison Square Garden and L.A.'s Kia Forum; a mini-Las Vegas residency (the tour will open June 13 with six sold-out nights at The Venetian); and stops both expected (Red Rocks Amphitheatre) and less so (Riot Fest) on the route. Whether it becomes a springboard for the next Weird Al era is anyone's guess — including Yankovic himself. Right now, he has no further plans to release albums; and since Mandatory Fun arrived over a decade ago, he's only sporadically released new music, most recently the 2024 “Polkamania!” single (the latest in his long-running series of madcap polka medleys, this one recapping the past decade's pop highlights, all sung in Yankovic's manic tenor). “Nobody owns any piece of me,” he says, exhaling. Then again, for Yankovic, that's always been true. “When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about being the next Weird Al, like it's a position he applied for and got,” says Lin-Manuel Miranda, a lifelong fan who's now also friends with Yankovic. On an overcast April afternoon a few days after the Mayer taping, Yankovic meets me for lunch at Crossroads, a vegan spot in West Hollywood where, years ago, he ate his first Impossible Burger. He's quick to jokingly note that he is not a member of the city's “vegan elite” — still, as he walks in, a man walking a golden retriever stops his phone conversation to stare and declare, “It's that Al Yanko-vich guy!” Chalk it up to veganism, staying out of the sun (“I melt in direct sunlight”) or following the directions of his longtime hair stylist, Sean James, very well (he never blow-dries those famous ringlets, hence their eternally bouncy and well-defined nature), but Yankovic has an ageless quality that lends many of his fans to liken him to mythological figures. “He's Santa Claus for nerds of a certain stripe,” Miranda says, a comparison Mayer had also made (as well as to Forrest Gump). brought out a cast of characters both human (Thundercat, Portugal. The Man's John Gourley) and not so much (cartoon mascots like Sleestak, PuffnStuf and Duo the Duolingo owl) to sing “The Rainbow Connection” with its composer, Paul Williams — and, on lead vocals, Yankovic. “But it was definitely a little bit of an out-of-body experience.” He admits that the “hey kids, let's put on a show” energy was fun and that the invite wasn't a total shock (having appeared on a season-three episode as an accordion-playing circus ringmaster, he's tight with the Gabba group). Tweaking hits like Jackson's “Beat It” (“Eat It”) and Madonna's “Like a Virgin” (“Like a Surgeon”), Yankovic created new songs that, thanks to his painstaking re-creations of their arrangements, were immediately recognizable but rewarded repeated consumption — as did their accompanying videos, in which Yankovic demonstrated his incredible eye for detail and formidable acting chops. “MTV was on like video wallpaper in the background 24 hours a day,” he says of that time. Since then, Yankovic's understanding of the promotional power of visuals has remained prescient — take when, leading up to Mandatory Fun's arrival, he insisted on releasing a music video on YouTube each day (not all at once, as some advised) to whet fans' appetites for the album. And his genre-agnostic approach to making music has proved ahead of its time, too. “A lot of pop songs are very repetitive,” he says. “How can I be funny in seven syllables, you know? Parodies like “Amish Paradise” (Coolio's “Gangsta's Paradise”) and “White and Nerdy” (Chamillionaire's “Ridin' Dirty”) are among his most streamed — though he's been equally adept at literally any microgenre he takes on, from just-electrified Bob Dylan (“Bob,” entirely comprising palindromes) to arty new wave (the Devo pastiche “Dare To Be Stupid”) to crunchy Detroit garage rock (“CNR,” a tribute to Charles Nelson Reilly through the lens of The White Stripes). “The nature of what he does is incredibly populist. He's not snooty about it; he's like, ‘This is what the kids like, and as long as I have a good angle comedically, I'm going to do it.' And because of that, it's always appealing to young people.” Growing up in Compton-adjacent Lynwood, Calif., Yankovic listened to rock radio, but as a teenager found playing the accordion a bit solitary. (His friends' rock bands weren't really interested in an accordionist joining up.) “When you take accordion lessons, I think the high-water mark is ‘Maybe someday I'll play in an Italian restaurant or at a wedding,' ” he says with a laugh. I grew up a complete nerd in high school. I kind of held on to that mentality: Like, you know, ‘Who cares?' One of his idols was Allan Sherman, the satirical singer best known for his 1963 summer camp send-up, “Hello Muddah Hello Fadduh!” “He was the last person to have a No. But within a few years, he completely burned out. So I was always more concerned about, ‘Don't mess it up. “In a way, we're almost always looking over our shoulders at that,” his manager Levey says. He cautiously admits that he and Yankovic have ­finally reached a level in his career where they're “no longer at the point where every year [of continued success] is a surprise,” then adds, “I don't actually even like saying that out loud because it sounds like you're taking something for granted.” But if Sherman was a rocket that blasted off only to burst into flames, Yankovic has been the opposite: one that, as Levey puts it, has kept steadily traveling through space — maybe sometimes at a slower speed than others, but never plummeting back down to Earth, buffeted by the most unexpected boosters. Despite at first airing only on the Roku Channel, it won almost universal acclaim and a prime-time Emmy, while expanding Yankovic's universe yet again. (“Bob” is his favorite Yankovic track, and he took the opportunity on set to ask his hero how he came up with all the palindromes.) Unwittingly proving the point, Yankovic gasps in glee as our lunch ends. “Mochi doughnuts!” He shows me a photo his wife has just texted him: a box of the treats for dessert later. Somewhat sheepishly, he explains the occasion: “Eric Idle is coming over for dinner tonight. Later that afternoon, Yankovic meets me in a park near Coldwater Canyon called Tree People. “I'm gearing up for a big tour, so I'm mostly just making sure I don't have a heart attack onstage or pass out or something,” he says of the walks he takes in spots like this. Yankovic's last tour outing didn't require much of a physical regimen. The idea, he recalls, occurred to him when “I was putting on my ‘Fat' suit for the thousandth time and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it just be nice to like, go out onstage and play the songs, sit on a stool and have an intimate evening with fans?' Instead, it allowed him to visit new, smaller major-market venues (Carnegie Hall, Tennessee's The Caverns) and ­strengthen his presence in off-the-beaten-path markets (like, say, Huntsville, Ala.) while superserving his ride-or-die fans. For Bigger and Weirder, Yankovic is in self-described “overpreparer” mode, the hyper-organized creative core of his team. “I came up with the setlist a year ago. “We have stage props, wigs, a lot of costume changes, and a big portion of what we need is a quick-change area behind the scenes onstage, usually 40 by 20 feet,” says Melissa King, his tour manager of nearly 20 years. That backstage planning ensures that in front of the audience, the man who has spent his career parodying rock and pop stars is free to embody one himself. “When I speak to [talent] buyers and say, ‘Have you seen the show?,' if there's a pause, for sure I know the answer is no,” Goodman says. Onstage, Yankovic isn't just physically “working his ass off,” as Samberg says. His range is so impressive — he does things to his voice that, as somebody who sings a bit in musicals sometimes, if I tried that I'd hurt myself.” “Al's a genuine, kind person, and because he is, that's the way everyone in our camp is.” That ethos extends to both the fans who'll attend (“There aren't many arseholes who are Weird Al fans,” Radcliffe observes) and how Yankovic treats them: According to Goodman, he's kept maximum ticket prices for Bigger and Weirder to $179.50 and has always refused to engage with platinum ticketing. When he decided against renewing his Sony contract, Levey says, they tested the waters with “very limited outreach” to a mix of indie and major labels. He figures he'll put out a single here and there, contribute to soundtracks if he's asked and, as always, remain open to what may come — like making a surprise appearance last November to duet with Will Forte on Chappell Roan's “Hot To Go!” at a charity event or developing a Broadway Weird Al jukebox musical that he says is in the very earliest creative stages, a “bucket list” project. 1 album in the country, that was such a triumphant moment. “It just shows you — I don't think anyone else will really touch that space. “Now the playing field has been so leveled that anybody can upload their material to YouTube or various portals like that. And if the stuff is good, chances are people will eventually see it. It's a generous sentiment, a reminder that, as Miranda puts it, one of Yankovic's many talents is also “reading the room.” But in its humility, it's also a reminder that, flooded as the market may now be with funny people on the internet, none of them, still, are doing it like Weird Al: the 65-year-old who once thought he'd play accordion at weddings and Italian restaurants, who's about to make his Madison Square Garden debut.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He and Gunnar Weidenfels detail the blockbuster unbundling of WBD: Decision "reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together." Discovery CEO David Zaslav told Wall Street analysts Monday that the “bold choice” to effectively unbundle the company he helped forge three years ago “reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together.” 'Dirty Jobs' Host Mike Rowe Sues Discovery Over Denying Streaming Royalties “These companies will be better aligned with shareholders based on each business's individual dynamics and growth prospects, more agile, more aggressive and creative in pursuing growth and sharper in their ability to deliver consumers more of the stories and entertainment they demand,” Zaslav said, adding that they expect each business to attract very different sets of investors. “It's safe to assume that the majority of the debt is going to live with global networks and a smaller portion — but a not-insignificant portion — on streaming & studios as well,” he told analysts. The executives remained coy on how the companies will team up after the split, though they indicated that they may still work together on things like distribution and ad sales, but that each company will also focus on their own business and do their own deals. People see us as the highest quality streaming service out there,” Zaslav added. “We have confidence in that business, but it's probably the more difficult business in terms of margin and swings,” Zaslav added, outlining the plan moving forward. “I think the thing that I feel best about is we put real discipline around it, but our overall content is underused — our great iconic content — rather than overused. [WBD film chiefs Mike DeLuca and Pam Abdy] are really looking at mining the big brands. As for the TV networks, Weidenfels told investors that “I have full conviction that we will see very successful networks for many, many years to come.” “The desire for people to consume content, especially from recognizable and iconic brands like TNT, sport, Food Network, CNN, etc., none of that is changing,” he added. Zaslav said that content from the linear networks account for about 25 percent of HBO Max viewing and that the split will likely come up during carriage negotiations, though a series of deals made over the past year mean no major talks are imminent. “There are times when you have distributors that really just want HBO Max, and we've ended up in protracted discussions trying to create a alignment around more of our products,” Zaslav said. But the split is also part and parcel with potential dealmaking. Weidenfels told investors that once the deal closes, each company should be “free and clear” to pursue deals, unlike the WBD deal, which had a complex structure that meant it would have to wait two years to do anything meaningful. “We do believe the transaction provides each business with greater ability to capitalize on potential options and opportunities that may arise, but I also want to stress that there is no such plan,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some attendees of a Tribeca Festival post-screening panel on Friday appeared to be under the impression that it was a Cyrus concert. Some Miley Cyrus fans who paid top dollar to attend the Tribeca Festival debut of the singer's new visual album, Something Beautiful, appeared to be under the impression that a post-screening Q&A would include a concert. When Cyrus sat down with the film's co-directors, Brendan Walter and Jacob Bixenman, and producer Pano Cosmatos to discuss the project on Friday night, they were interrupted by hecklers who demanded that she sing a song. We paid $800,” yelled one disgruntled attendee in a video posted on X. “I can almost see it/ That dream I'm dreaming/ But there's a voice inside my head saying/ You'll never reach it,” she sang, gently berating the crowd for “not singing” as she finished the second verse. Something Beautiful will open in theaters on Thursday (June 12). A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early in the 2025 Tony Awards, host Cynthia Erivo singled out an “up-and-comer” who landed his first nomination this year: George Clooney. The Oscar-winning actor-director was going places, Erivo suggested, but just hours later Clooney, who got a number of onstage shout-outs during the awards ceremony that aired live on CBS, left the Tonys without the Broadway play receiving a single award, despite being nominated for five honors, including a best actor in a play nod for Clooney, which he lost to Oh, Mary!‘s Cole Escola. The play, which has been breaking records with its multimillion-dollar weekly box office grosses, closed out its run with a matinée performance before Sunday's awards, after which Clooney quickly went back to his natural hair color, which he'd dyed brown for the show, and Saturday night's performance aired live on CNN in a highly touted special. Similarly, the latest revival of Gypsy, which landed five nominations, including an historic 11th nod for Audra McDonald, making her the most Tony-nominated performer in history in addition to holding the record for most awarded performer in Tonys history, was also shut out Sunday night, with McDonald losing the best actress in a musical award to Nicole Scherzinger for Sunset Blvd. Other notable shutouts included Dead Outlaw and John Proctor Is the Villain (seven nominations each), Floyd Collins and Just in Time (six nominations each) and Real Women Have Curves (two nominations), with Real Women‘s best shot at a win coming in the score category, where it lost to Maybe Happy Ending. Indeed, though Maybe Happy Ending had already received multiple awards by the time Darren Criss‘ name was called as the best actor in a musical winner, his win, on his first nomination, was still somewhat of a surprise as he was in a tight race with Jonathan Groff, who was gunning for his second Tony in a row. Death Becomes Her only won one award, for best costume design, given to Oscar-winner Paul Tazewell, despite the musical going into the Tonys in a three-way tie with Maybe Happy Ending and Buena Vista Social Club for the most nominations with 10 apiece. In an upset, Purpose won the Tony Award for best play, besting Oh, Mary! But Purpose, which follows a powerful family in Black American politics recovering from scandal, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year and saw five of its cast members nominated for Tony Awards, including Kara Young, who won a Tony for the second year in a row.
