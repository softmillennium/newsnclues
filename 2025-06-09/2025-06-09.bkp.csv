            Israel vowed on Sunday to stop an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists on board from reaching Gaza.
    


            As of Sunday evening, the UK-flagged civilian vessel was north of Egypt in the Mediterranean Sea, slowly approaching the coast of Gaza. The “Madleen” is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an organization that has campaigned against Israel's blockade of Gaza and tried to break the siege by boat.
    


            “We know that it's a very risky mission and we know that previous experiences with flotillas like this have resulted in attacks, violence and even cases of death,” Thunberg told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “But of course none of those risks are even remotely as high as the risk that Palestinians are facing everyday just by trying to survive.”
    


            Defense Minister Israel Katz reiterated that the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, would not make it to the besieged enclave.
    


            “I have instructed the IDF to ensure that the ‘Madleen' flotilla does not reach Gaza,” said Katz in a statement, referring to the name of the ship.
    


            Katz warned the ship that “you'd better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza.”
    


            Thunberg and the Madleen expect to reach Gaza within the next day, organizer Yasemin Acar told CNN on Saturday.
    


            “We are still on our way to Gaza. There's no turning back, and we're hoping to make it into Gaza within two days,” Acar said.
    


            The coalition campaigns to end Israel's blockade of Gaza and has tried to reach the enclave several times in the past

            After an 11-week blockade that prevented any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, Israel has begun allowing a trickle of aid in once again.
    


            But it is only a fraction of the aid that entered the enclave before the war, with humanitarian organizations warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of widespread famine.
    


            Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, said on social media that the flotilla carries more than food.
    


            “It is not only the aid, it is the HUMANITY THEY CARRY. For all of us,” she said.
    


            The crew, which has publicized the location of the ship with an online tracker, began preparing for the possibility of interception by the Israeli military.
    


            Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, is also onboard the Madleen.
    


            “From both a legal and moral standpoint, Israel has no right to intercept this vessel,” the group said in a statement.
    


            “The people of Gaza, under siege, starving, and facing the threat of annihilation, have the legal right to decide who enters their territories.”
    


            Last month, another vessel from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition came under what its organizers said was an Israeli drone attack off the coast of Malta in international waters. The group did not provide evidence that the drone was Israeli, while the Israeli military has declined to comment on the alleged attack.
    


            The ship, the “Conscience,” was heading to Malta, where a large contingent of activists were due to board before it departed for Gaza, more than 1,000 miles away, but had not made it into port, the group said.
    


            The coalition told CNN that Thunberg was among those who were expected to board the vessel in Malta.
    


  An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated Irish actor Liam Cunningham was onboard the Madleen. The FFC has confirmed he is not onboard.

            Israel's blockade of Gaza may have been partially lifted – and a new US-backed plan to deliver aid has begun. But there are multiple indications that the plight of Gazans is rapidly worsening.
    


            Restrictions imposed by the Israeli military on aid routes, ongoing airstrikes, a lack of security and the continuous displacement of tens of thousands of people are aggravating an already alarming situation, according to the UN and other aid agencies. The supplies that do get in risk getting looted.
    


            “People in Gaza are starving. This demands the urgent opening of all crossings and allowing unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid at scale, through multiple routes,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest assessment.
    


            One woman, Umm Zuhair, who was trying to get food for her family on Sunday at one of newly established aid distribution sites, told CNN: “We're so hungry that we're willing to risk getting shot just for a kilo of flour.”
    


            The number of children in Gaza with acute malnutrition is rising, the UN reported Saturday, while a lack of fuel threatens to close hospitals that are still operating.

            The Israeli agency handling the inspection of aid going into Gaza, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), said Saturday that 350 trucks containing humanitarian aid had entered the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the last week – less than 20 per cent of the volume of goods getting into Gaza before the conflict.
    


            And even the aid that gets in frequently does not make it to the most desperate. UN agencies report continuing difficulties with getting distribution routes within Gaza agreed with the Israeli military. OCHA said that out of 16 truckloads ready for distribution last Thursday, five were rejected, including fuel and water, and six failed to reach their destination.
    


            Additionally, the looting of aid convoys in Gaza has risen sharply in recent weeks.
    


            “Operations have faced unprecedented levels of insecurity and a very high risk of looting, with partners reporting that most looting incidents are conducted by desperate civilians,” according to OCHA.
    


            Nahed Shehaibar, head of the Private Transport Association in Gaza, said on Saturday that transport of aid had been suspended “for the third consecutive day due to repeated attacks on trucks, including gunfire that has damaged and put several trucks out of service.”
    


            Last week the association reported that one driver was killed and another injured while trying to deliver aid, but Shehaibar said on Sunday that 11 trucks of commercial goods had reached merchants in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza successfully.
    


            The distribution of aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that started operating late last month, has been dogged by security issues.
    


            A CNN investigation last week pointed to the Israeli military opening fire on crowds of Palestinians as they tried to make their way towards one of GHF's hubs on Sunday June 1, killing at least 31, according to the Palestinian ministry of health The IDF disputed the accounts of the incident. There were similar deadly incidents last Monday and Tuesday; the IDF said in those instances that it had fired warning shots at “suspects” who had approached its positions, but challenged the casualty figures.
    


            On Sunday, GHF said it operated three distribution sites - two in southern Gaza and one in central Gaza - to hand out more than 17,000 boxes of food. In addition, GHF said in its daily update that it gave more than 10,000 meals to community leaders north of Rafah in what the organization called a pilot test of “direct-to-community distribution.”
    


            But many people who went to the Netzarim site in central Gaza left empty-handed.
    


            Mohammad Salim told CNN: “I went at 6 a.m. and found nothing. What's happening is shameful. I'm holding an empty cardboard box – there's nothing inside, not even lentils.”

            He said some people took more than they needed and complained there was no ID-based distribution system, as operated by the UN. CNN has previously reported that GHF has no system in place to screen aid recipients.
    


            Nader Musleh, who had walked from Al-Mawasi several kilometers away, agreed.
    


            “Some people took five or 10 boxes, and there's no organization at all,” he said.
    


            Mohammad Abu Akouz was one of several civilians who alleged that some people were injured after coming under Israeli tank fire as they made their way to the site.
    


            An Israeli military official told CNN that Israeli forces fired what they called “warning shots” from an armored vehicle approximately a kilometer from the distribution site. The official said the area is an active war zone.
    


            GHF said it had been unable to open its sites on Saturday, accusing Hamas of making threats against its operations, including against drivers and Palestinian workers. It said the threats had made it impossible to proceed without putting innocent lives at risk.
    


            A driver familiar with the operation, who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN on Sunday that Hamas had “threatened the bus drivers responsible for transporting workers to the three American aid distribution points, warning them not to continue the transfers.”
    


            The drivers had been scheduled to move 180 employees to the three distribution sites, he added.
    


            GHF said on Friday that it had distributed more than 140,000 boxes of food, with each box intended to feed a family for half a week. The boxes contain pasta, lentils and cooking oil, among other products. GHF says its goal is to distribute boxes containing enough food for 4.5 million meals each day.
    


            After last week's shootings, GHF appealed to people not to arrive at distribution points “before the official opening time or gather near the gates ahead of schedule. This is for your safety and the safety of others.”
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday in a post on X that gathering outside distribution centers outside of announced hours was “strictly prohibited,” and warned that the areas around the aid hubs were closed military zones between 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) and 6 a.m. (11 p.m. ET).

            The UN says that the use of the Israeli and American-backed GHF has militarized aid distribution and is inadequate for the huge task of feeding families in Gaza. GHF has no presence in northern Gaza.
    


            In its latest assessment, OCHA said that 90 per cent of families in Gaza lack the cash needed to buy what little food remains available in markets. “Meat, dairy, vegetables and fruit are nearly absent from people's diets,” it said.
    


            Half of the community kitchens in Gaza have been forced to stop cooking due to lack of supplies or displacement orders, according to OCHA.
    


            The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) – the main agency for supplying aid in Gaza – said Saturday that a nutrition study had found that the percentage of children under 5 suffering from acute malnutrition had risen from 4.7% in the first half of May to 5.8% in the second half of the month.
    


            UNRWA said the number of children forced to fend for themselves had pushed an increasing number into “dangerous survival strategies. Children are reported working on the streets, participating in looting or gathering within large crowds in search of food supplies at insecure distribution points.”
    


            It's not just food that is running chronically short.
    


            Dr. Mohamed Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, told CNN on Sunday that the few hospitals in Gaza still operating “will completely shut down within two days if fuel does not enter.”
    


            He added that “a large number of the wounded cannot be treated due to the lack of blood supplies and medical equipment,” and medical staff faced difficult choices about which patients to save.
    


            The Palestinian health ministry said Sunday that Al-Shifa Hospital and the Baptist Ahli Hospital, both in northern Gaza, were at risk of shutting down service within 24 hours. It said that would mean the collapse of what remains of the healthcare system in Gaza City.
    


            In the south, the ministry said the Nasser Medical Complex was operating on a limited fuel supply that will last no more than two days.

            President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the US by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.
    


            The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the US and don't hold a valid visa.
    


            The ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all US diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the US even after the ban takes effect.
    


What exactly is Trump's new travel ban about? Not national security



            During Trump's first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy.
    


            No such disruption was immediately discernible at Los Angeles International Airport in the hours after the new ban took effect.
    


            Haitian-American Elvanise Louis-Juste, who was at the airport earlier Sunday in Newark, New Jersey, awaiting a flight to her home state of Florida, said many Haitians wanting to come to the US are simply seeking to escape violence and unrest.
    


            “I have family in Haiti, so it's pretty upsetting to see and hear,” Louis-Juste, 23, said of the travel ban. “I don't think it's a good thing. I think it's very upsetting.”
    


            Many immigration experts say the new ban is more carefully crafted and appears designed to beat court challenges that hampered the first by focusing on the visa application process.
    


Freeways blocked, cars on fire: LA protests against immigration raids and National Guard deployment



            Trump said this time that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. He relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the US after their visas expired.
    


            Measuring overstay rates has challenged experts for decades, but the government has made a limited attempt annually since 2016. Trump's proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries.
    


            Trump also tied the new ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. US officials say the man charged in the attack overstayed a tourist visa. He is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump's restricted list.
    


            The ban was quickly denounced by groups that provide aid and resettlement help to refugees.
    


            “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a nonprofit international relief organization.
    


            The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who have worked to resettle its people. The ban does make exceptions for Afghans on Special Immigrant Visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.
    


            Afghanistan had been one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trump suspended refugee resettlement his first day in office.

White British children are currently a minority in one in four schools across England, The Telegraph has reported, citing government records.

The report, published on Saturday, was based on the results of school census data collected from more than 21,500 educational institutions across the country in early 2025.

According to the figures, in 72 English schools there are no white children at all, while in 454 schools they make up less than 2% of the pupils.

At Rockwood Academy in Birmingham, none of the 1,084 students were recorded in the census as “white British,” while there were only 12 out of 2,779 attending Loxford School in the London borough of Redbridge, The Telegraph reported.

The “demographic shift” is most visible in cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford, and Leicester, the paper said.

In the capital, white British children are a minority in schools in all 32 boroughs, with the exception of Bromley, where they make up 50.3%. In Newham and Harrow, there are only 5% and 7% of white children, respectively, the report said.

“The school census data demonstrates that the white British share of the young population is in decline in many areas,” The Telegraph noted.

Last week, a report came out forecasting that white British people will become a minority in the UK population in the early 2060s.

According to the paper, which was based on analysis of migration, birth and death rates data, by the end of the century their share will drop from the current 73% to around 33.7%.

The author of the study, Buckingham University Professor Matt Goodwin, said that his predictions raise “profound questions about the capacity of the UK state to both absorb and manage this scale of demographic change.”

Goodwin stressed that they are certain to provoke a “considerable degree of anxiety, concern and political opposition” among many voters, which “need to be… addressed if the UK is to avoid considerable political turbulence and polarization in the years and decades ahead.”

Paris is pushing France's largest automaker, Renault, to establish a military drone production operation in Ukraine, the company has confirmed. Kiev has been significantly intensifying drone attacks on Russian infrastructure.

During the final week of May, 2,300 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down after being sent across the border to target Moscow and other regions, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

“We have been contacted by the [French] Defense Ministry about the possibility of producing drones,” Renault said in a statement to several media outlets, including Reuters, on Sunday. Although “discussions” on the issue have taken place, the company insisted that “no decision has been taken at this stage,” and that it is awaiting further details from the ministry.

French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu first revealed the plan on Friday, describing it as an “unprecedented partnership” in an interview with broadcaster LCI.

“We are going to embark on a completely unprecedented partnership… to equip production lines in Ukraine to… produce drones,” Lecornu said, noting that the project would involve both a major carmaker and a smaller defense contractor.

Renault could be tasked with setting up drone assembly lines “a few dozen or hundreds of kilometers from the front line” in Ukraine, France Info reported on Sunday.

According to the newspaper Ouest-France, the project could also involve Delair – a Toulouse-based drone manufacturer that supplies UAVs for border surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence, and special operations forces. The company has previously delivered kamikaze drones to the French Defense Ministry, which were later sent to Ukraine.

Lecornu described the initiative as a “win-win” for Paris and Kiev, claiming no French personnel would be deployed to Ukraine.

The production lines would be operated by Ukrainian workers, and the drones built for the country's military would also be used by the French Armed Forces for “tactical and operational training that reflects the reality” of modern warfare, he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov condemned the strikes as deliberate attempts to sabotage peace talks. Moscow has repeatedly warned that any weapons production facilities in Ukraine are considered legitimate military targets and subject to “unequivocal destruction.”

An explosion has rocked a storage depot at a US air base on the Japanese island of Okinawa, injuring at least four people, according to local media and defense sources.

The blast at Kadena Air Base occurred around 11:20am local time on Monday, injuring at least four members of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF), according to military sources cited by NHK and Jiji Press. None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening.

The affected facility is reportedly used to house unexploded wartime munitions. It is operated by the SDF's unexploded ordnance disposal team and is located within the US military's largest air base in the Asia-Pacific region.

Local authorities and emergency services responded to the incident in Yomitan Village. Kadena Air Base has yet to issue a formal statement, as both Japanese and US military officials continue to assess the extent of the damage.

Kadena Air Base, located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, is the largest and most strategically significant US Air Force installation in the Asia-Pacific region. Often referred to as the “Keystone of the Pacific,” the base spans more than 2,000 hectares and houses approximately 20,000 personnel. It serves as the headquarters of the US Air Force's 18th Wing, the largest combat wing in the service.

Kadena is jointly used by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, including SDF logistics and ordnance teams like the one involved in Monday's explosion. The base also routinely hosts rotating deployments of advanced US aircraft such as F-22 Raptors and B-52 strategic bombers, and plays a critical role in monitoring regional hotspots, including North Korea, Taiwan and the South China Sea.

WASHINGTON, June 9. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon, the US Justice Department, and the Department of Homeland Security to take action to suppress what he described as ""migrant riots"" in Los Angeles, California.

""A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals,"" the president stated on Truth Social. According to him, ""violent, insurrectionist mobs"" have been attacking law enforcement officers throughout the city in an effort to disrupt ""deportation operations."" ""But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve,"" Trump added.

He instructed US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, in coordination with other agencies, to ""take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots."" ""Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,"" Trump emphasized.

Earlier, Trump said he might deploy Marine Corps troops to Los Angeles if federal authorities determine that the protests in the city pose a broader threat to the country and its citizens. Previously, White House Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops from California to Los Angeles to respond to the unrest. The troops have already begun arriving in the city.

Trump issued the directive without consulting California Governor Gavin Newsom. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the protests and riots in California as an uprising and criticized the stance of the Los Angeles police chief, who had publicly refused to take part in mass migrant deportations. On Saturday, Trump warned that the federal government would ""step in and solve the problem - rioters and looters,"" if the California governor and the Los Angeles mayor fail to bring the situation under control.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Scores of National Institutes of Health researchers and staffers sign letter criticizing agency policies: ‘We dissent'

In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. “Dissent,” he said, “is the very essence of science.”

That commitment is being put to the test.

On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, a frontal challenge to “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe”.

It says: “We dissent.”

In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, more than 90 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter – and their careers on the line.

They went public in the face of a “culture of fear and suppression” they say Donald Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says.

Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world's premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.

It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12bn and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.

In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.

In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. “Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,” it says, “it wastes $4 million.”

The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya but also sent to the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr and members of Congress who oversee the NIH, was endorsed by 250 anonymous employees of the agency besides the 92 who signed.

Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Senator Angela Alsobrooks to talk about what is happening at the NIH.

At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.

“I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,” Norton told the Associated Press.

The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

His declaration drew together like-minded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive Covid-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.

“He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,” said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.

As chief of the health systems and interventions research branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who have been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. “So much of it is gone – my work,” she said.

The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because “I don't want to be a collaborator” in the political manipulation of biomedical science.

Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. “You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.

“We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,” he added. But that will not happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants.

The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes or the NIH.

Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.

The letter asserts that “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health”.

The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.

This has forced “indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science”, the declaration says.

Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.

A Signal group became the place for participants to sort through NIH chatter on Reddit, discern rumor from reality and offer mutual support. The declaration took shape in that group and as word spread neighbor to neighbor in NIH offices.

The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a linchpin in science.

With that in place, he said in a statement in April: “NIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.”

Now it will be seen whether that is enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.

“There's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,” said Norton, who has three young children. “I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.

“Maybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,” she added. “And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Move comes ahead of Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where support for Israel has become key issue

Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, signed an executive order this week adopting a controversial definition of antisemitism, as Israel's invasion of Gaza and alleged antisemitism continued to dominate the city's mayoral election.

The mayor signed the order, which requires city agencies to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's description of antisemitism, at a synagogue in Manhattan on Sunday. Adams described antisemitism as “a vile disease that's been spreading across our nation and our city”.

Critics of the definition say it is designed to protect Israel by punishing legitimate criticism. Examples of antisemitism that accompany the formal definition include “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor” and “applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”. The lead author of the definition has spoken out against its use to suppress free speech.

The move comes two weeks ahead of the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, where a number of high profile candidates are running against Adams. Support for Israel and the city's Jewish population has become a key issue, with the frontrunners holding starkly different views on Israel's war on Gaza.

Adams, a deeply unpopular first-term mayor whose time in office has been blighted by accusations of accepting bribes, has positioned himself as a staunch defender of Israel as he seeks to win election. He referenced the recent murder of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington and the attack on a crowd of people in Colorado who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza before signing the order.

“Since Hamas' terror attacks on October 7 2023, we have seen this hateful rhetoric become normalized on our campuses, in our communities, and online as antisemitic propaganda far too often masquerades as ‘activism'. When Jewish New Yorkers make up 11% of the population but more than half of all hate crimes, we know this moment demands bold, decisive action to crack down on anti-Jewish hatred,” Adams said.

Antisemitic and Islamophobic violence have risen since the Hamas attack and Israel's response, and Adams has criticized pro-Palestinian demonstrations which have taken place on university campuses and around the city.

Adams was elected as a Democrat, but is running as an independent candidate in this year's election. His main rivals are Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned in 2021 amid accusations of sexual harassment, and Zohran Mamdani, a New York state representative.

In 2021, Orthodox Jewish support helped Adams win the Democratic primary, but with Cuomo, Adams is up against a fellow staunch supporter of Israel. Last year, Cuomo joined Benjamin Netanyahu's legal defense team after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister for alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has long been outspoken on Palestinian rights, has described the situation in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 50,000 people, as “genocide” and said he would have Netanyahu arrested if he came to the city.

Adams signed the executive order at a synagogue in Manhattan on Sunday. He then sat for a discussion with Phil McGraw, a television personality and Trump supporter, about the threat of antisemitism, in which he criticized anti-Israel demonstrations at universities.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

From his so-called ‘Muslim ban' to slashing DEI measures, the US president has turned taboo behaviour into norms

This month marks exactly 10 years since Donald Trump coasted down an escalator at Trump Tower, declared his run for US president and accused Mexico of sending drugs, criminals and rapists into the homeland. The past decade has been exercise in normalising.

When Trump threatened to terminate Elon Musk's government contracts, and Musk linked Trump to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, all because of a petty clash of egos, people were riveted but unsurprised. Likewise, when Trump ordered a travel ban on a dozen countries, many reacted with a collective shrug: well, of course he did.

There was little sign of the collective uprising and airport protests that greeted Trump's so-called “Muslim ban” – an executive order that barred travel to the US for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries – in January 2017. The president's spectacular blow-up with Musk ensured the attention cycle quickly moved on.

Yet travel ban 2.0 is no less pernicious. The proclamation signed by Trump last Wednesday bans the citizens from many of the world's poorest nations, supposedly to protect the US against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.

The countries affected are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The entry of people from seven other countries – Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela – will be partially restricted.

“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,” Trump said.

He cited the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a man tossed a gasoline bomb into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators as an example of why the new curbs are needed.

An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Yet Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits, nor is Syria, whose Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by Trump as a “young, attractive guy” after their recent meeting.

Alex Berrios, a co-founder of Mi Vecino, a community empowerment organisation, and the son of a Cuban immigrant, said: “Trump targeted countries with Black, Brown and Muslim populations. There is no clear national security basis for the ban, but there is a clear pattern of targeting people of color. Latino and immigrant communities recognize this as a racist policy, plain and simple.”

Indeed, the list points to a 78-year-old president who continues to view large swaths of the world as drug-dealers, criminals and rapists, who finds new and ingenious ways to play white identity politics, whose “Make America great again” mantra is coded nostalgia for an era of American apartheid.

In 1973, Trump and his father, Fred, were sued for discriminating against Black applicants by refusing to rent apartments to them in predominantly white buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. The case was settled with no admission of guilt but a requirement that the Trumps change their practices.

In 1989, after five Black and Latino teenagers were accused of assaulting and raping a white jogger in New York's Central Park, Trump took out full-page ads in several newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. The Central Park Five were convicted and later exonerated but even last year Trump continued to assert they were responsible for the crime.

From 2011 to 2016, Trump was a leading proponent of the debunked “birther” theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore was ineligible to be president. After Obama released his birth certificate, Trump admitted the truth but never apologised and continued to refer to Barack “Hussein” Obama.

After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counter-protester was killed, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” and blamed “many sides” for the violence. He later tweeted: “I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!”

In a 2018 White House meeting on immigration, Trump reportedly asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”, referring to Haiti and African nations, and suggested more immigrants from places such as Norway.

During 2020 protests over George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis, Trump sent national guard troops to Washington and deployed federal officers to Portland, Oregon, leading to injuries. He also called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”, linked by critics to a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes.

At last year's National Association of Black Journalists convention, he falsely claimed that Kamala Harris “turned Black” for political gain, questioning the vice-president's heritage. And on the campaign trail, Trump said immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has issued executive orders that aim to restrict or eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He even baselessly blamed DEI for undermining air safety after an army helicopter pilot was involved in a deadly midair collision with a commercial airliner.

With the help of Musk's unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Trump has slashed foreign aid and gutted the development agency USAID, causing death and devastation for people in Africa and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the immigration crackdown has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students and deport others.

The US granted refugee status to around 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”. Trump ambushed South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is Black, with a video that falsely portrayed “burial sites” and articles that included an image of body bags from the Congolese city of Goma.

He has also repeatedly singled out “Congo” in Africa for emptying its prisons and sending criminals to the US. During a meeting last month with Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, he said: “Many, many people come from the Congo. I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo.”

Factcheckers have found no evidence to support this claim. Trump's travel ban includes the Republic of Congo but not the much bigger Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is currently negotiating a minerals deal with Washington. The Republic of Congo said the country's inclusion was a “misunderstanding”.

Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, says: “This is just another page from the catalogue of racism, bigotry, hate and white supremacy that Trump flips to and uses as his guide so often.

“He needs to keep putting coins in the rightwing machine because that is what keeps them going. In many ways he has to do this in order to stay true to who he is and his candidacy and Trumpism, because one of the key ingredients of Trumpism is racism, and we've seen that confirmed over and over again.”

After a decade of Trump dominance, none of it comes as a surprise any more. What was once outrageous and taboo is now routine. And that numbness, shifting of the Overton Window and reordering of US political culture may be his most dangerous legacy of all.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israel yesterday intercepted a Gaza-bound aid boat, preventing the activists onboard, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, from reaching the blockaded Palestinian territory.

The Madleen departed from Italy on June 1 aiming to bring awareness to food shortages in Gaza, which the UN has called the “hungriest place on Earth.” After 21 months of war, the UN has warned the territory's entire population is at risk of famine.

Israeli forces “forcibly intercepted” the vessel in international waters as it was approaching Gaza, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition said in a statement.

“If you see this video we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters,” Thunberg said in a prerecorded video shared by the coalition.

The Palestinian group Hamas condemned the diversion, saying in a statement that the boat was being taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod.

The Israeli government had vowed to prevent the “unauthorized” ship from breaching the naval blockade of Gaza, urging it to turn back.

Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz on Sunday said that the blockade, in place since years before the Israel-Hamas war, was needed to prevent Palestinian militants from importing weapons.

After diverting the boat, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a picture of the activists all in orange life jackets being offered water and sandwiches.

“All the passengers of the ‘selfie yacht' are safe and unharmed,” the ministry wrote on social media, adding that it expected the activists to return to their home nations.

“The tiny amount of aid that was on the yacht and not consumed by the ‘celebrities' will be transferred to Gaza through real humanitarian channels,” it added.

Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza to alleviate widespread shortages of food and basic supplies.

It has allowed humanitarian deliveries to resume after barring them for more than two months and began working with the newly formed, US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, but humanitarian agencies have criticized the foundation and the UN refuses to work with it, citing concerns over its practices and neutrality.

Dozens of people have been killed near foundation distribution points since late last month, according to Gaza's civil defense agency.

It said Israeli attacks on Sunday killed at least 10 people, including five civilians hit by gunfire near an aid distribution center.

Civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal and witnesses said the civilians had been heading to a site west of Rafah in southern Gaza, run by the US-backed foundation.

Witness Abdallah Nour al-Din said that “people started gathering in the al-Alam area of Rafah” in the early morning.

“After about an hour and a half, hundreds moved toward the site and the army opened fire,” he said.

The Israeli military said it fired on people who “continued advancing in a way that endangered the soldiers,” despite warnings.

At a charity kitchen in Gaza City, displaced Palestinian Umm Ghassan said that she had been unable to collect aid from a foundation site “because there were so many people, and there was a lot of shooting. I was afraid to go in, but there were people who risked their lives for their children and families.”

A global summit on the dire state of the oceans commenced in France yesterday, with calls to ban bottom trawling and bolster protections for the world's overexploited marine areas.

World leaders attending the UN Ocean Conference in Nice have been told to come up with concrete ideas — and money — to tackle what organizers call a global “emergency” facing the neglected seas.

The appeal for unity comes as nations tussle over a global plastics pollution treaty and the US sidesteps international efforts to regulate deep-sea mining.

On the eve of the summit, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that leaders must act now.

“The planet can no longer tolerate broken promises,” he said.

A wave of new commitments is expected in Nice, where about 60 heads of state and government joined thousands of business leaders, scientists and environmental activists.

“Never in the history of humanity have we brought together so many people for the oceans,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday before hosting leaders for an official dinner.

The UK was expected to unveil a partial ban on bottom trawling in half of its marine protected areas, putting the destructive fishing method squarely on the summit agenda.

Bottom trawling sees huge fishing nets dragged across the ocean floor, a process shockingly captured in a documentary by British naturalist David Attenborough.

Greenpeace welcomed the UK announcement on trawling, but said in a statement it was “long overdue.”

Macron on Saturday said that France would restrict trawling in some of its marine protected areas, but was criticized by environmental groups for not going far enough.

French Minister of Ecological Transition Agnes Pannier-Runacher told reporters on Sunday that other nations would make “important announcements” about the creation of new marine protected areas.

Samoa led the way, announcing that 30 percent of its national waters would be under protection with the creation of nine marine parks.

Just 8 percent of global oceans are designated for marine conservation, despite a globally agreed target to achieve 30 percent coverage by 2030, but even fewer are considered truly protected, as some nations impose next to no rules on what is forbidden in marine zones, or lack the finance to enforce any rules.

Nations faced calls to cough up the missing finance for ocean protection, which is the least funded of all the UN's 17 sustainable development goals.

Small island nations were expected in numbers at the summit, to demand money and political support to combat rising seas, marine trash and the plunder of fish stocks.

The summit would not produce a legally binding agreement at its close like a climate COP or treaty negotiation, but diplomats and other observers said it could mark a much-needed turning point in global ocean conservation if leaders rose to the occasion.

“The UN Ocean Conference gives us all an opportunity to turn words into bold and ambitious action,” said Enric Sala, founder of Pristine Seas, an ocean conservation group.

Another summit priority would be inching toward the numbers required to ratify a global treaty on harmful fishing subsidies, and another on protecting the high seas beyond national control.

France is also spearheading a push for a moratorium on deep-sea mining ahead of a meeting of the International Seabed Authority next month.

TOKYO (AP) — An explosion at a storage site for unexploded ordnance at a U.S. military base on Japan's southern island of Okinawa injured four Japan's Self-Defense Forces soldiers, though the injuries are not life-threatening, officials said Monday.

The four soldiers sustained finger injuries while working at a facility that belongs to Okinawa prefecture and temporarily stores unexploded ordnance, mostly from wartime and found on the island, local officials said. One of the harshest battles of World War II was fought on Okinawa.

Prefectural officials said the injuries were not life-threatening, but no other details were immediately known.

The U.S. Air Force said in a statement that the explosion occurred at the facility managed by the Okinawa prefectural government at Kadena Air Base's munitions storage area. It said no U.S. servicemembers were involved in the incident.

The Self Defense Force's joint staff said one of the devices suddenly exploded when the soldiers were inspecting it at the facility. The blast occurred when the soldiers were trying to remove rust, NHK television reported.

The SDF said they are trying to confirm what caused the accident.

Monday's accident was believed to be the first ever since the 1974 launch of the Japanese army's unexploded ordnance disposal unit.

Hundreds of tons of unexploded wartime bombs, many of them dropped by the U.S. military, remain buried around Japan and are sometimes dug up at construction sites and elsewhere. Many of them are still found on Okinawa, where about 1,856 tons of unexploded U.S. bombs are believed to remain.

In October, an unexploded wartime U.S. bomb exploded at a commercial airport in southern Japan, causing a large crater and suspending dozens of flights.

ATAMI, Shizuoka — Princess Akiko of Mikasa stressed the importance of cultivating fertile soil for traditional Japanese culture to live on without the need for protection, during a recent event that kicked off the World Forum on Japanese Culture.

The forum, which was established to convey to the world the distinctive characteristics of Japanese culture, held its inaugural sessions at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, on May 31, with about 500 people in attendance.

In the first session, Princess Akiko delivered a speech titled “Japanese Art: Untold Stories,” in which she said that traditional Japanese culture will become “a thing of the past” unless it is incorporated into modern society and people make use of it.

“Culture should come alive in our everyday lives,” she said. “Japanese culture is supposed to be closely connected to our everyday lives, not something merely appreciated.”

The princess said she realized how little she knew about Japanese culture when people often asked her about it while she was studying at the University of Oxford. That realization led her to study Japanese art and eventually launch “Shinyusha,” an initiative that provides children with opportunities to experience authentic Japanese culture through workshops. Topics include making Japanese tea in a traditional manner and wearing kimono — practices that are no longer common in everyday Japanese life.

The princess said that the goal of the initiative is to plant “seeds of memories.” She hopes that the children will have pleasant memories of the workshops and that they will recall those memories in the future, thereby building a feeling of affinity toward traditional culture.

She called for a “bottom-up style” of cultural preservation, in which each person naturally strives to protect their culture, rather than a “top-down style,” in which authorities choose what to keep and protect.

“If you don't know why something is important, you don't care to protect it,” she said. “What we can do now is use our own efforts to build a future for preserving our precious Japanese culture.”

In the second session held on the same day, Masatomo Kawai, a professor emeritus at Keio University, gave a keynote lecture on the uniqueness of Japanese culture. He said Japanese culture has been nurtured through finding harmony between nature and people, while in the West, culture and science have developed through efforts to overcome nature.

A similar point was addressed in the discussion that followed involving four experts: Kawai; Kazumi Murose, a lacquer artist designated as a living national treasure; Harvard University Prof. Yukio Lippit; and Tokugo Uchida, director of the MOA museum.

During the discussion, they affirmed the importance of seeking “coexistence between nature and society” in the 21st century amid global challenges such as division, conflict and environmental issues. Murose said that Japan, through its long history, has incorporated aspects of overseas cultures into its own to create new values and traditions to pass on to the next generation.

Lippit said culture is not something each country should discuss independently, and that common values are important for getting even people overseas to feel like they want to carry on Japanese cultural heritage.

World Forum on Japanese Culture

Organized by Harvard University′s department of History of Art + Architecture, the MOA Museum of Art, the Japan Arts Council and the Cultural Affairs Agency, the forum aims to elevate the appreciation of Japanese cultural values globally. Leading figures in traditional arts, traditional crafts, science and other fields are invited to speak, providing various perspectives on Japanese culture.

Recordings of the forum's lectures and discussions will be made open to the public in multiple languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese and Thai. The recordings are planned to be made available online through about 20 institutions in 10 countries, such as the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University.

The third session is scheduled to be held in August and will feature Ryoji Noyori, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, and Seiichi Kondo, a former director general of the Cultural Affairs Agency, as speakers.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

A Ukrainian drone attack struck the JSC VNIIR-Progress facility in the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic, causing explosions and massive fires, Russian Telegram news channels reported in the early hours of June 9. 

The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed the strike, saying Ukrainian drone units, in coordination with other units, targeted VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro in Cheboksary overnight as part of efforts to degrade Russia's capacity to produce air attack systems.

The targeted facilities are part of Russia's military-industrial complex and produce adaptive Kometa antennas, used in Shahed-type attack drones, planning and correction modules for guided aerial bombs (KAB), and other precision-guided weapons, the General Staff said.

The Ukrainian military confirmed that at least two drones struck the site, causing a large fire. The results of the strike are still being assessed.

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute that specializes in developing electronic warfare (EW) systems, including the Kometa antenna, used to jam satellite, radio, and radar signals. The facility has been sanctioned by the U.S. and the EU.

Oleg Nikolayev, the head of the Chuvashia Republic, claimed that two drones ""fell"" on the premises of the VNIIR-Progress facility on June 9.

The ""responsible decision was made to temporarily suspend production to ensure the safety of employees,"" he said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. 

In video footage from local residents purporting to show the attack on the facility, smoke and flames can be seen rising over the city of Cheboksary. One video, published by the Russian independent news outlet Astra, shows a drone approaching the target and making impact, causing another explosion. 

VNIIR-Progress is a major research and development institute for Russian EW systems. It produces the Kometa antenna, which Russia uses to make its bombs more accurate and less vulnerable to Ukrainian interference. 

The strike marks the second reported Ukrainian drone attack against Russia's Chuvashia Repbulic. 

Ukraine reportedly attacked the Burevestnik oil refinery in Cheboksary on March 9, in its first reported drone strike in the region. The refinery lies over 900 kilometers (559 miles) from the Ukrainian border. 

In recent days, Ukraine has launched a number of strikes against military facilities in Russia, including missile bases and airfields. The most audacious and high-profile attack came on June 1, when Ukraine carried out Operation Spiderweb — a mass drone strike that simultaneously targeted four major Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 planes. 

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on June 9 that air defense units had intercepted 49 Ukrainian drones throughout the country. 

Overnight drone strikes reportedly triggered flight restrictions at airports in Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov, and Tambov.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched another large-scale attack against Ukraine overnight on June 9, assailing cities across the country with drones and missiles. 

At least one person was reported injured in Rivne, a city far from the front lines in northwestern Ukraine. 

The mass strike comes shortly after Russia on June 6 launched 452 drones and 45 missiles at Ukraine in a single night — one of the largest aerial attacks in the full-scale war. The Kremlin claimed the bombardment was retaliation for Kyiv's Operation Spiderweb drone strike on Russian strategic aircraft. 

Ukraine's Air Force issued aerial alerts throughout the night on June 8-9, warning multiple regions of the threat of ballistic missiles and Shahed-type attack drones. 

The Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces said it scrambled fighter jets in response to the Russian aerial attacks in western Ukraine.

Explosions were reported during the night in Kyiv and Rivne. 

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported that an office building in the capital's Darnytsia district had been damaged in the attack. 

One civilian in Rivne was injured in the attack, regional Governor Oleksandr Koval said. Emergency responders are still at work on the scene and the consequences of the strike are still being determined. 

""A very difficult night for Rivne Oblast. Our region suffered a powerful enemy air strike,"" Koval said. 

Rivne is located in northwestern Ukraine and shares a border with Belarus. Like neighboring Volyn Oblast, which was hit in Russia's mass strike on June 6, the region is not a frequent target of Russian aerial attacks

Reuters reported on June 8 that the U.S. expects Russia to launch more large-scale, multi-pronged strikes at Ukraine in the coming days as part of Moscow's ""asymmetrical"" response to Operation Spiderweb. 

The Kremlin's retaliation could target high-value government sites, such as administrative buildings or intelligence facilities, a Western diplomatic source said. 

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on June 1 carried out an audacious mass drone attack on four key Russian air bases, reportedly damaging 41 military planes, including the heavy bombers Moscow uses to carry out attacks on Ukrainian cities. 

The operation took 18 months to plan and execute, and allegedly caused $7 billion of damage to Russia's aerial fleet. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly warned U.S. President Donald Trump during a June 5 phone call that Moscow was preparing a response to the operation. That night, Russia's mass strikes injured 80 people and killed four civilians, including emergency workers. 

Trump said the next day that Operation Spiderweb  ""gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night.""

Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb exclusively targeted military facilities — specifically, the aircraft used to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine. The strike followed three years of aerial attacks and three months of Russian refusal to accept a ceasefire. 

In the days leading up to the June 1 operation, Russia launched three heavy aerial attacks against Ukraine over three consecutive nights. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the idea that Russia's attacks are a response to Operation Spiderweb. Following a night and day of relentless bombings in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Zelensky on June 7 said Russia's strikes were ""not 'retaliation' but acts of destruction.""

David McKinnon is a former diplomat who is currently a senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. 

The days when foreign policy was an afterthought, subordinate to domestic politics, are over.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Canada had its own “end of history”: comforting illusions of a stable international order (with Canada near the centre) and ever widening free trade. The fall of the Soviet Union and seemingly permanent unfettered access to the United States made us assume that prosperity was inevitable and our security guaranteed. This has ended. Today's global environment is volatile, competitive and unpredictable. Effective diplomacy and national security are now existential.

For Canada to navigate this disorder, our international engagement needs to be at the centre of policy and public discourse. We can no longer outsource our prosperity and security to global systems or allies or think that our seat at high tables like the Group of Seven is inevitable (or, indeed, that the G7 retains the relevance it had). The burden is now ours, guided by interests, values and a renewed sense of identity and common purpose.

Values such as democracy, pluralism and the rule of law remain vital. But values alone cannot build serious foreign policy. Too often, Canada has treated values as ends in themselves rather than as elements of prosperous and successful societies. We need to pursue our interests, including those rooted in our values, if we are to turn ideals into influence.

Anand insists Canada is mulling options with allies for ceasefire in Gaza and more aid

Effective diplomacy requires coherent priorities and expertise backed by serious investment. At its core, diplomacy is deeply personal, built on trust and sustained relationships. A modern, properly trained and resourced foreign service is central to this, but it has not been a priority for Canada in decades. It demands creativity and deep understanding, especially of those whose outlooks differ from our own.

We need diplomats with expertise: people who understand the world through lived experience, grasp the histories, speak the languages, and can interpret the motivations of other states (and explain Canada to them). An effective foreign and trade ministry is not cheap, but it is a cost-effective complement to defence and development spending to build influence.

While it is essential that we deepen our understanding of large emerging or resurgent powers such as India and China, we should not neglect smaller states. Relationships with them can be pivotal, especially if Canada aspires to global relevance. Likewise, while we have long prioritized multilateralism, effective bilateral relationships are the building blocks of global success. Our capacity to navigate a complex web of ties – from Washington to Colombo – can amplify our voice on the world stage.

AI can transform diplomacy, but the benefit will come only if we know what our diplomacy needs to achieve. We need to be informed users of these tools and resist the temptation to outsource our knowledge and understanding to algorithms.

Effective diplomacy requires tending the diplomatic garden, as U.S. statesman George Shultz once put it. You cannot wait until you need a favour to invest in a relationship, and attention to smaller relationships can pay off.

Carney defends decision to invite Indian PM to G7 summit in Alberta

This approach must go beyond government. Our foreign policy ecosystem needs to be enriched by business leaders, academics, think tanks, civil society and media with international insight. There has been some progress in developing this capacity, but the coverage and commentary when the murder of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar hit the headlines showed how limited our historical and geostrategic understanding can be. We need a deeper bench of people who know the world and our own history.

Inside Global Affairs Canada, the culture must change. Over-management stifles initiative, and diplomacy suffers when entrepreneurial thinking is suppressed. Diplomats need to be able to ask hard questions, take risks, and admit when things do not go as planned. A culture that insists everything is a success leaves no room for learning from its failures. Global Affairs' latest “transformation” exercise, started in 2023, is working to bring some cohesion and modernity to a deeply siloed organization. It seems, however, heavy on process and values, while avoiding substantive action on more fundamental problems including structure, human resources and communications.

Finally, Canada needs a serious foreign policy review, one that goes well beyond Ottawa and engages Canadians, including those who do not always agree with prevailing assumptions; this should be completed in months, not years. A credible and enduring foreign policy must reflect who we are, what we care about, and what we stand for. It requires leadership to develop and pursue but cannot simply be imposed from above.

We are at a crossroads. In a world of fractured power and rising disorder, Canada cannot drift. We need to be clear-eyed, confident and committed. The opportunity to redefine our place in the world is here. Let's not waste it.

In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. “Dissent,” he said, “is the very essence of science.”

That commitment is being put to the test.

On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, a frontal challenge to “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.”

It says: “We dissent.”

In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter – and their careers on the line. Another 250 of their colleagues across the agency also endorsed the declaration, without using their names.

Opinion: The chaos in America's scientific community could be Canada's gain

The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. 

The White House defended its approach to federal research. “In recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized health care and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,” spokesman Kush Desai said. “The Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science – not ideological activism – as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.”

The signers went public in the face of a “culture of fear and suppression” they say President Donald Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says.

Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world's premier public-health research institution over the course of mere months.

It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.

In one case, an NIH-supported study of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.

In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. “Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,” it says, “it wastes $4 million.”

Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.

At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.

“I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,” Norton told the Associated Press.

The signers said they modelled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October, 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

His declaration drew together like-minded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.

“He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,” said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.

As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. “So much of it is gone – my work,” she said.

The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because “I don't want to be a collaborator” in the political manipulation of biomedical science.

Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. “You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.

“We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,” he added. But that won't happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants.

The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes or the NIH.

Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centres gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.

The letter asserts that “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.”

H.A. Massey and Company manufactured farm equipment and tools in Ontario factories, before shipping them overseas. The U.S. is the one market it avoided.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

John Turley-Ewart is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail, a regulatory compliance consultant and a Canadian banking historian.

The need to diversify Canadian trade continues. American tariffs on Canadian goods spotlight concentration risk: 75 per cent of this country's exports go to the U.S. That risk's sharp point cut through recent Statistics Canada data showing that “Canadian exports cratered in April and the trade deficit soared to a record high.” 

The numbers are stark: April exports to the U.S. dropped by 15.7 per cent, and our trade deficit surpassed $7-billion. We are buying far more abroad than we are selling. 

Betting on a renewed U.S. trade deal isn't a sure win. Mounting U.S. national debt (US$36.2-trillion) that President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will exacerbate is causing bond markets to flash red. An American fiscal crisis will weaken U.S. demand for Canadian imports down the road. 

During the Canadian federal election campaign, Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals had proposals to help businesses “diversify away from the U.S.” and soften the ebbs in trade flows caused by American political and economic instability. Easy said, harder done. 

Barbecue maker Napoleon has always been proud to be made-in-Canada. But a closer look shows the harsh reality of manufacturing at home

What does success look like? A lot like a business case study that documents the rise of one of this country's earliest industrial triumphs that put “Made in Canada” on the world's manufacturing map. 

In the lead-up to Canadian Confederation in 1867, the U.S. had abrogated a free-trade deal and imposed new tariffs. Canadian businesses and farmers were compelled to figure out how to manage increased costs while seeking new markets, both internal and external. One of those businesses was family-run H.A. Massey and Company, based in Newcastle, Ont.

The Masseys immigrated to Cobourg, Ont., from the U.S. in 1802 and took up farming as their chance at fortune. They soon realized that the farming tools their prosperity depended on – equipment used to clear land, prepare soil, plant crops and harvest them – were, as one family member told a reporter at the time, “the same as those used in the days of the Pharaohs.”

Thus began a quest to find, build and innovate new technologies that would transform farming from an arduous, subsistence exercise to one that generated prosperity and nation-building growth. 

The Masseys tinkered with their own farm implements in their work shed and foundry. Yet they also long spent time and money exploring the innovations emerging across Lake Ontario in places such as New York state, where a much larger and wealthier market fostered technological successes and failures at a rapid pace. 

The made-in-Canada tools that are helping make ‘buy Canadian' more convenient

They bought farm implements and tools from the U.S., reverse engineered them and then licensed the best ones for use in Canada, which they would then produce, honing their manufacturing capacity in the process. At the same time, they learned to market and took advantage of new railway building in Canada to expand their customer base.

The company won critical acclaim for its harvesting equipment at home and soon found itself representing Canada at the 1867 International Exhibition in France. There, it walked away with two gold medals: one in marketing for its display and the other, importantly, in recognition of the superior performance of Massey harvesters.

From gold medals to foreign sales, Massey reapers and mowers found markets. Twenty were sold to buyers in Germany after the exhibition in France. Twenty years later, Massey equipment was being sold in Europe, Britain, Turkey, Russia, South America, Jamaica and most British colonies.

Massey farm machinery and tools were made in factories in Ontario and shipped overseas using steam-powered ships with corkscrew propellers that opened global markets. But the one market Massey avoided was the American one to the south. 

What the Masseys had accomplished is what business schools today call the multiplier effect. Through market diversification, the company built economies of scale, mitigated the seasonality associated with selling only in Canada, widened its field of learning to global customers and suppliers, and refined its ability to win business in the face of strong competition that further supported research and development of their own products at home.

The take-away for diversifying away from the U.S.? Rather than compete against their American counterparts in the U.S., the Masseys made the critical decision to learn as much as they could from American enterprise and know-how, add their own innovations and expertise, and use the outcome to beat brash U.S. competitors at their own game on the global stage and in Canada itself. Only after that, in 1910, did they enter the U.S. market.

“Made in Canada” became a market differentiator in the 19th century. Today, it still can be.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Israeli Military Seizes Gaza Freedom Flotilla in International Waters","https://truthout.org/articles/israeli-military-seizes-gaza-freedom-flotilla-in-international-waters/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 16:20:30 GMT","

Israeli forces commandeered the humanitarian aid boat and arrested its 12 passengers.

After a week in Mediterranean waters, Israeli forces put an end to the journey of the Madleen to Gaza, intercepting the aid boat in international waters and arresting its 12 passengers, including the crew and Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg.

The boat, named after Madleen Kullab, a Palestinian fisherwoman from Gaza, had left the port of Catania in eastern Sicily in early June and set sail toward Gaza carrying food and medical supplies in an attempt to break the Israeli siege on the Strip. The mission was organized by the Freedom Flotilla, an international alliance of activist groups that has been organizing similar missions to Gaza since 2008.

In addition to Thunberg, the Madleen's mission included French journalist and filmmaker Yanis Mhamdi, Brazilian activist and Freedom Flotilla member Thiago Avila, Turkish activist Suyab Ordu, Spanish activist Sergio Toribio, French activist Reva Viard, French activist and Freedom Flotilla veteran Pascal Maurieras, French journalist Omar Faiad, Dutch activist and member of the Freedom Flotilla Marco van Rennes, French activist and doctor Baptiste Andre, German activist Yasemin Acar, French-Palestinian member of the European parliament Rima Hassan.

At around 1:30 in the morning local time, only a few dozen miles from Palestinian shores, activists on board the Madleen reported being surrounded by three Israeli military boats, which sounded their sirens at the Madleen. Activists also reported that Israeli drones were dropping an unknown white liquid substance on the boat as they were preparing to encounter an Israeli takeover. At around 2:00 a.m., Israeli troops boarded the boat after surrounding it, taking control of the vessel as activists onboard raised their hands up in the air, shortly before the Madleen lost contact.

Activists had previously recorded video messages calling on people to act and pressure their governments to demand their release in case they were arrested by Israeli forces. The footage was posted online shortly after the interception of the boat.

The Madleen's voyage marks the second attempt in the last month to break Israel's siege of Gaza by sea. In early May, the Freedom Flotilla's boat, the Conscience, was attacked by drones shortly before setting sail from Malta. Organizers said that they suspect Israel was behind the drone attack.

Last week, as the Madleen sailed toward Gaza, activists on board repeatedly warned that they suspected an Israeli attack on the boat. In 2010, Israeli forces assaulted another aid ship, the Mavi Marmara, on a mission to Gaza. The attack resulted in the killing of nine Turkish activists by Israeli forces.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated on Sunday that he had instructed the Israeli army to prevent the Madleen “hate flotilla” from reaching Gaza's shores as the boat sailed near Egyptian waters, and to “take whatever measures are necessary to that end.” Katz directly addressed 22-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg: “To the antisemitic Greta and her fellow Hamas propaganda spokespeople, I say clearly: you should turn back because you will not reach Gaza.”

In Gaza, Palestinians awaited the arrival of the Madleen, with “little hope that it will be allowed to arrive,” according to Eyad ِAbu Mousa, an engineer at the Gaza Relief Committee, who coordinates efforts between different international aid organizations and was in contact with the passengers of the Madleen until it was commandeered.

“In Gaza, we followed the news of the Madleen every hour, hoping to receive them, but we know too well how the Israeli occupation deals with any attempt to break the siege,” Abu Mousa told Mondoweiss. “In fact, we were concerned about their safety because of previous experiences, like the Mavi Marmara, but the Madleen team told us constantly that they are fully aware of the risk, and that they are prepared to face any scenario,” he pointed out.

“Speaking to them every day, the passengers of the Madleen expressed a very high human sense of responsibility, which we in Gaza admire and appreciate very much,” Abu Mousa continued. “Especially at a time when we feel that the entire world has turned its back on us and accepted the genocide. To know that there are those out there who are not only speaking out for us, but willing to take a risk to break the siege, is beyond words.”

“What we learned from the Madleen crew is that most of the humanitarian aid they had on board is children's formula, in addition to other food items and medical supplies, all of which are desperately needed in Gaza,” Abu Mousa said. “Had they been allowed to reach Gaza, the cargo would have been unloaded and distributed immediately, because the need is so great that people would have already been at the port waiting for the aid, but the quantity is also small and almost symbolic compared to the actual need.” 

“If there were more missions like the Madleen taking place, then maybe some of them could reach Gaza, and the impact would be much greater,” he went on.Early on Monday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Israeli forces had redirected the Madleen to the port of Ashdod and that its passengers would be deported to their countries of origin. As of the time of writing, no news as to the whereabouts of the Madleen has been reported.

Israel has imposed a full siege on Gaza since breaking its ceasefire with Hamas in mid-March and resumed bombing the territory. For the past two weeks, Israel has tasked the shadowy American-run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) with distributing limited amounts of food to Palestinians at specific distribution points, where many aid massacres against starving civilians have taken place. Just last week, 30 Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces opened fire on crowds rushing to obtain food rations, after being forced to walk long distances to reach these remote distribution points.

“The distribution method implemented by the U.S. and Israel is humiliating, inefficient, and clearly is meant to provoke engineered chaos,” Abu Mousa said. “It is aimed at bringing about the collapse of social cohesion among people as they rush to obtain limited daily rations that aren't enough for everybody.”

“It is a death sentence, because Israeli forces always shoot, supposedly to maintain order at the distribution points, and if you don't get shot today while trying to get food for your family, you might get shot tomorrow,” he continued. “It is illogical to continue with this method when we have 400 distribution centers, where UNRWA staff ran the operations efficiently all across the Strip. Never in decades did the chaos that we see now happen.”

“This is why the message of the Madleen activists and all those calling for humanitarian aid to access Gaza freely is so important, and this is why it has to continue,” he stressed.

Nearly three-quarters of Americans worry that cuts to Medicaid will lead to more adults and children becoming uninsured.

New polling demonstrates that a majority of Americans are concerned about the cuts to Medicaid and other social health programs in President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill, with most believing that the cuts will likely increase their family's health costs.

The KFF poll, published last week, comes shortly after a new analysis by health experts shows that millions will lose their health insurance should the legislative package — which Trump has dubbed a “big, beautiful bill” — become law.

According to the survey, 54 percent of Americans say they are worried that federal spending cuts on Medicaid would negatively impact their family's ability to pay for or obtain health care. A higher proportion of respondents, 72 percent, said they were worried that the proposed spending cuts would lead to more adults and children in the U.S. becoming uninsured, with only 28 percent saying they didn't have those concerns.

Across party lines, Democrats were more likely to express worries about the bill's impact on Americans' access to health care, with 94 percent saying they worried that the spending cuts would lead to more in the country becoming uninsured and only 44 percent of Republicans expressing the same view. However, within those crosstabs of the poll, even 4 in 10 self-identified “MAGA” Republicans expressed those concerns, signaling that a significant segment of Trump's base is concerned about the cuts to Medicaid.

The administration has continuously attempted to alleviate these fears through misleading press releases and public statements. But in a letter sent to a group of senators earlier this month analyzing the impacts of the GOP's reconciliation bill, health experts from Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the legislation would lead to an additional 51,000 deaths in the U.S. each year for the next decade.

That analysis noted that 10.9 million people would lose their health insurance due to the bill's cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The experts also found that an additional 5.1 million people would lose their insurance status due to the bill failing to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans and the Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS) proposed rules to limit the program's enrollment periods, bringing the total of people who could lose their health care due to the bill and other actions by the administration up to 16 million.

Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was among the lawmakers who had requested the independent analysis, decried the administration for pushing a bill that would lead to millions losing their health coverage.

“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said in a statement.

On April 2, a day he dubbed “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced a sweeping new program of tariffs intended to rebalance U.S. trade. Trump's tariff rates were shockingly high, triggering a stock market selloff and a flight away from U.S. assets, rare rebukes from some Republicans in Congress, and diplomatic outrage around the world. After a week of mounting backlash, the president announced a 90-day pause on most of the country-specific tariffs, leading foreign counterparts to scramble for deals that would allow them to escape the levies before the clock ran out. U.S. court rulings questioning the legality of the president's tariffs have added further uncertainty.

The Trump administration's trade policy chaos has already caused harm, slowing growth, raising prices, and sparking dire predictions about the fate of the world economy. Yet there is a kernel of truth in the president's insistence that the international trade system needs a reset. Distrust of free trade has been rising in both political parties in the United States. Governments around the world are more and more willing to intervene in their economies to safeguard national interests. The U.S.-led global trading order, constructed over eight decades following World War II, has frayed.

What comes next is uncertain. But there is no going back to a time when the United States championed ever freer trade. Although many of the targets of Trump's tariffs, including businesses and foreign states, may pine for such a world, structural geopolitical changes have made it untenable. Instead of trying to turn back time, these actors should push the administration to usher in the needed transformation of the global trading order.

Disruptive tariffs, then, can create an opportunity. And despite the president's erratic behavior, the United States retains deep-rooted structural advantages that give it the power to lead a new trade effort. Many countries are dependent on the U.S. market, and few see China as a viable alternative. Most major economies will seek accommodation with the United States, even after being beaten up by heavy U.S. tariffs. Washington can therefore leverage its trade wars to achieve a productive restructuring of the international economic system.

To do so, however, the Trump administration must look beyond securing simple, short-term wins—such as one-off purchase agreements of U.S. commodities or temporary tariff truces—and cease bullying the United States' trade partners. It must instead build a new set of rules and norms that facilitate integration among like-minded states and that disentangle them from adversarial ones, especially China. A better path is possible, one that leads to gains for the United States and its allies. But they need to leverage the current chaos, rather than letting it consume them.

In the aftermath of World War II, the United States led a process to create a set of economic rules that promoted an open, multilateral trading order. The country struck bilateral and multilateral free trade and investment deals. It set up institutions to help govern commerce, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, later, the World Trade Organization. These bodies and rules provided economic and political stability, encouraged trade and investment flows, and offered trading partners reliable, peaceful, legal mechanisms to resolve their disputes. The resulting system, which favored openness and integration, was well suited to a geopolitical era marked by American hegemony. Washington viewed the rules-based economic order as vital to its own prosperity and strategic interests, and it had every reason to uphold it.

But the United States is no longer the sole superpower. As of last year, China is the world's largest trading nation in terms of goods, having clawed its way up by diverging from market principles and creating enormous friction in the global economic order. Many countries, including the United States, practice industrial policy, but China's systemic abuse of the open trading system is in a category by itself. And Beijing has used its economic growth to enhance its military power and expand its territorial ambitions in the Indo-Pacific, raising concerns in Washington and other governments. Meanwhile, new shocks and crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted vulnerabilities associated with deep economic interdependence. Rather than a unipolar order premised on U.S. leadership, the global economic landscape is now characterized by emerging alternative power centers and, for many countries, a privileging of security concerns over economic efficiencies. If a rules-based economic order is to persist, governments will need to adapt the rules to meet today's strategic interests.

At its core, the current trading system prioritizes nondiscrimination and the “most favored nation” principle that trading partners should treat each other alike. But economic and national security concerns differ by trading partner: trade with close allies can strengthen a country's security, while trade with adversaries can make it more vulnerable. It thus makes little sense to require countries to treat all trade partners as “most favored.” The trading system allows members to break with this universalist ethos on national security grounds, but it provides little guidance on what conditions must be met to take advantage of this exception. In the past, this mattered little as states acted with a presumption of openness and minimal restrictions. But over the last decade, increasing geopolitical competition has compelled more and more countries to impose export controls, sanctions, and other economic restrictions on trading partners. Such recurring deviations from the rules, even when justified, have bred disorder and uncertainty.

Against this backdrop, Trump has turned the United States into a revisionist power seeking to shatter what remains of the economic order. Thus far, his approach has been needlessly chaotic. But there is still an opportunity to wrest a positive outcome from the current tumult. The president's willingness to take bold action has set in motion ambitious trade negotiations, which normally proceed at a snail's pace. And there is reason to think they could yield favorable results for the United States and its allies.



In March, the Center for a New American Security ran a simulation of a trade war to examine how foreign governments might respond to sharply increased U.S. tariffs. Participants included experienced trade negotiators from the United States and several foreign capitals, as well as regional experts and security analysts. In the trade war simulation, the team representing the United States introduced expansive levies on all major trading partners but remained open to negotiating alternative arrangements. Teams playing the roles of foreign governments had to choose to negotiate with or retaliate against the United States. The simulation was designed to create complex and hostile negotiating conditions, including U.S. provocations on nontrade issues, such as the status of Greenland and the sovereignty of Canada. But by the end of the game, the U.S. team had unexpectedly succeeded in laying the foundation for a highly integrated democratic trading bloc that shut out China.

This process was hardly seamless. Teams representing traditional U.S. trade partners such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe bristled at Washington's bullying. But even as they recognized that the United States might not be a reliable partner, they concluded that they needed to work with American officials to mitigate the tariffs' damage. A trade war version of the classic prisoner's dilemma played out: country teams recognized the value of coordinating to form a coalition to counter the United States, but each still prioritized its own access to the American market. Most country teams tried to sprint to the front of the line to negotiate with Washington.

In the game, the Chinese team's attempted charm offensive mostly fell flat. As long as the U.S. team signaled an openness to dealmaking, the players representing major advanced economies did not view deepening economic integration with China as a sensible option. In fact, many agreed to align with the U.S. team on counter-China measures. In the real world, Beijing is working hard to take advantage of Washington's plunging global standing, courting foreign governments with a message that China, not the United States, is the reliable partner committed to the rules-based trading system. But to date, that message hasn't stuck. Rather than pursuing deeper integration with China, many countries are scrambling to ensure that the incipient trade war does not bring a flood of cheap Chinese exports into their markets.

The insights from the trade war simulation show how American policymakers might salvage Trump's tariff chaos. But real-life success is far from guaranteed. Multiple contingencies could propel the world trading system in a different direction. Foreign governments, for example, might face intense domestic political pressure to push back against the United States. Even in the absence of popular outrage, U.S. provocations on nontrade issues could tank any talks. To achieve a positive outcome, Trump will have to prioritize good-faith trade negotiations and tamp down the more chaotic aspects of his trade policy, such as imposing tariffs so extreme that he is forced to roll them back once it becomes painfully obvious that they are unsustainable.

If the Trump administration hopes to salvage a victory from its trade wars, Washington must use tariffs as leverage in pursuit of clear and achievable trade objectives rather than as a blunt tool wielded in pursuit of myriad and mutually incompatible ones. The administration has offered an array of rationales for the tariffs: that they will reindustrialize the United States, raise revenue for the U.S. government, lower trade deficits, and induce other countries to take actions that benefit the United States. Targeted tariffs could help the administration realize some of these objectives, but not all of them, and certainly not all of them at once. The administration was always going to have to prioritize its aims; the sooner it does so, the better.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for the administration is to establish credibility that it will honor any future commitments. After all the chaos Trump has unleashed, foreign governments rightfully worry that a U.S. promise to lift tariffs today will not protect them tomorrow. Trump's trade wars with Canada and Mexico highlight this point acutely, as the president's tariffs violate the rules that he himself negotiated in his first term under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-­Canada Agreement.

There is no simple solution to the credibility problem. The Trump administration came to power determined to demonstrate that it would be a disruptive force not bound by existing norms, and it has done just that. The president's early moves to impose tariffs primarily relied on emergency powers, since these allow for speedy action unencumbered by routine democratic processes (such as soliciting public comment on the potential impact of his policies). This erratic approach has already led to outcomes that are plainly ridiculous, such as the administration's punitive tariffs on the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited largely by penguins. Actions that were meant to seem aggressive have instead come off as uninformed and unsustainable.



But the Trump administration can still improve U.S. credibility, if not rescue it entirely, by bringing more order and predictability into the trade policymaking process. Trade policy, after all, does not need to be this chaotic. The president has a variety of legal avenues to pursue his objectives. The administration could use instruments such as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which addresses unfair trade practices, and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the United States to impose tariffs or take other remedial actions on national security grounds. These mechanisms require fact-based investigations by the administration and input from the public, which are at odds with Trump's unilateral style. But they give the government a chance to uncover and address unintended consequences. The slow and steady pace of these trade tools also affords the private sector time to prepare and adjust rather than throw their supply chains into disarray overnight.

Washington must also clarify what it expects of allies. At present, the United States' trading partners don't even know what they can do to secure tariff relief. Foreign governments leave meetings with the Trump administration confused about the American president's endgame. Trump may believe that keeping trade partners on their toes is a smart negotiating strategy. But in reality, the administration's opacity stands in its own way. A durable reset of the trading system is possible, but only if the administration views allies as part of the solution rather than part of the problem.

Trump has demonstrated little interest in adopting a more deliberate, methodical approach to negotiations or to recalibrating his means to meet more achievable ends. But the chaos unleashed by his trade policies is already bumping up against external constraints. Such backlash could nudge the administration toward a more moderate path. The U.S. courts, for example, are weighing in on the administration's actions. Congress, too, may opt to rein in some of the executive's tariff authorities. American consumers are souring on the president's tariff obsession and anticipating higher inflation. And if government bond holders panic again, as they did in April, Trump may once more be forced to announce a tariff pause.

The Trump administration would be wise to get ahead of these mounting external pressures by adopting a more predictable approach. Continually rejiggering the tariffs signals incoherence, perhaps even weakness, to allies and adversaries alike. Meanwhile, many trade partners, having witnessed the whims of Trump's on-again-off-again approach, may now believe they should simply wait out the president rather than come to the table with substantive offers.

Even if Trump could be convinced to implement a more deliberate strategy in the trade wars, the question remains—to what end? At present, the administration appears focused on negotiating shallow “framework agreements,” which provide some partial relief from tariffs in return for modest trade concessions and purchase agreements but gesture only vaguely at possible future cooperation. If the trade wars end in a series of such deals, the United States will merely paper over the flaws in the existing trading system while burning valuable leverage.

There is an alternative, even more worrisome path the trade wars could take. After tearing up the existing global trade rules, the United States could advance a more nakedly transactional approach in its international economic relations, eschewing any rules or shared norms that might constrain U.S. action. As the world's largest economy turns inward and adopts beggar-thy-neighbor policies, other countries would respond in kind, adopting regressive protectionist policies, as happened during the Great Depression. In such a scenario, disorder would prevail.

Yet a third path is also possible. Having used tariffs to shake trading partners out of their complacency, the United States can work with these countries to negotiate a reset of the trading system—one that preserves many of the advantages of the old system while rectifying its shortcomings. The starting point should be relaxing the principle of nondiscrimination and accepting that trade policy will differentiate among trade partners and allow democracies to favor one another. Indeed, this would simply reflect the fact that the United States already treats China, its principal geopolitical adversary, differently from other trading partners.

The United States should continue to trade with China in low-end manufacturing, agriculture, and a handful of other areas. But in more strategic sectors, such as chips and pharmaceuticals, Trump should prioritize “de-risking” from China, as he did in his first term. The administration should maintain targeted tariffs that would allow the United States to build capacity in these critical industries. Additionally, Washington should make significant investments in domestic manufacturing and research and design, coordinating with other major economies wherever possible.



Should China and the United States partially decouple, Americans could feel some economic pain. To offset the loss in trade, Washington will have to deepen economic integration with like-minded partners and allies. Doing so will help the United States and its partners replace what has been lost and scale up production in sectors essential to a strong defense, technology, and innovation base—which will be required for long-term competition with China. To that end, they should coordinate their use of export controls, investment screening, and data security measures. They will also need to address China's overcapacity and unfair trade practices in key industries, such as steel and aluminum. These steps will help build shared expectations about when trade and investment restrictions are legitimate for national security concerns, fostering predictability and stability in the new economic security order.

Ultimately, Trump should aim for a future order made up of the following concentric circles: deep economic and security integration for close allies and partners; predictable, rules-based exchange among most countries; and careful de-risking from competitors. Such an order would provide a more stable framework for the world as it is. To realize that order, Washington should seek to establish legally binding commitments with its close partners that provide the clarity, consistency, and credibility that businesses and governments require. The 90-day framework agreements the Trump administration has been negotiating should be exactly that: frameworks for more concrete rules to be hammered out in the months ahead. If the framework agreements are instead treated as ends in themselves, without any ambitious follow-through, the tariff pain will not be worth the very modest resulting benefits.

The United States' trading partners correctly fear that Trump is breaking an economic order that cannot be rebuilt, and their near-term objective is tariff relief. But they must also look further ahead. They must see this as an opportunity to work alongside the United States in building a new architecture that addresses their shared challenges. Whether they like it or not, geopolitics has shifted in ways that make the previous rules-based order unsustainable. Trump's shock to the system may not be pretty. But it could open the way for a much better system.

In January and February of this year, parents searching for their missing children secretly visited a ranch outside the small town of Teuchitlán, in the western Mexican state of Jalisco. They suspected that it had been a cartel training camp and might hold clues about the fates of their children, whom many believed to have been kidnapped or forcibly recruited by the cartels. But once they arrived, they discovered something far worse: what appeared to be three crematoriums littered with bone fragments and hundreds of pairs of shoes, some of them identical to the ones their children had been wearing when they went missing. The ranch had been a cartel extermination camp. It wasn't the first one discovered in Mexico in recent years. It wasn't even the biggest.

Equally disturbing is what followed. In March, after news of the discovery spread, Mexico's attorney general's office organized an official visit for reporters and parent collectives. But according to those who returned to the site, much of the evidence had disappeared; the pits where the bone fragments had been found were smoothed over. Even worse, authorities may have known about the ranch before they intervened in September 2024. According to the newspaper El País, Virgina Garay, whom I met while she was searching for her missing son, had alerted authorities to the suspicious site in 2021 after receiving an anonymous tip and visiting the area. But nothing was done.

After authorities finally shut down the camp, the attorney general declined to investigate the case. So it fell to Jalisco state prosecutors, who failed to collect fingerprints or to properly safeguard vehicles held as evidence, two of which were later stolen. In mid-May, a different group of mothers found an even larger extermination camp in neighboring Colima State that the federal authorities had also known about for years before shutting it down in 2023, having arrested an alleged drug trafficker there in 2018.

These are not isolated events; they happen because state officials in Mexico protect organized crime—not occasionally but routinely, at various levels of government. Often, officials face a simple calculus: they are more likely to profit than be punished for colluding with cartels.

The defining dilemma of Claudia Sheinbaum's presidency may be whether she is willing to alter this status quo, raise the costs of collusion, and protect those who stand up to the cartels, instead. Since taking office in October 2024, Sheinbaum has taken a harder line on organized crime, increasing seizures of drugs and guns and arrests of suspected cartel operators. In February, when the Trump administration threatened tariffs on Mexico if it didn't stop the flow of fentanyl across the border, Sheinbaum doubled down on her efforts, and the number of seizures and arrests has since grown substantially. But with their political and judicial protection networks still intact, any criminal groups that are weakened by the president's current strategy may simply be replaced by new ones. Criminal-political networks will continue dividing the country into private fiefdoms, with politics, justice, and the legal economy reduced to arenas of lawless competition. Deadly drugs and insecurity will continue flowing north.

To truly reduce the cartels' corrosive power, Sheinbaum should pursue their protectors. Although fully dismantling the judicial and political protection networks that have underpinned Mexican organized crime for decades in just six years is likely impossible—they are too vast and numerous for any president to eliminate in one term—she has it in her power to make an example of the worst offenders and at least deter collusion. This will be a risky project. Under Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as AMLO, the cartels' power and protection networks grew. If Sheinbaum begins holding public officials accountable, she may alienate powerful members of her party, the National Regeneration Movement, known as Morena, some of whom allegedly benefit from these relationships.

The Trump administration, however, can offer Sheinbaum valuable political cover—and incentives to act. It has referred to an “alliance” between the Mexican state and cartels and clearly grasps that the Mexican authorities are not dismantling these pacts on their own. Although tactics such as U.S. drone strikes will do little to weaken the cartels, U.S. pressure could help generate the political will in Mexico to finally begin punishing collusion. The challenge for the United States, then, is figuring out how to incentivize Sheinbaum to do so without causing her to fracture her party or lose governability in the process. If it succeeds in striking this balance, Sheinbaum could begin meaningfully and durably weakening the cartels—not just temporarily disrupting their operations. After a nearly two-decade period in which 275,000 Mexicans have been killed by organized crime and one million Americans have died from drug overdoses, it's time.

Although Sheinbaum won the election as an AMLO disciple, she quickly broke with the former president's hands-off security strategy, known as “hugs not bullets.” This was a significant shift for Morena, which, despite its popularity has always been weak on security. When López Obrador was running for president in 2018, he promised to curb impunity for organized crime, but once elected, he instead prioritized the growth of Morena—the party he founded—above all else. He recruited and defended politicians with alleged criminal ties, and he even pressed the first Trump administration to return a top Mexican army general who had been arrested in the United States on drug smuggling charges. Trump complied, and Mexico's attorney general dropped all charges on his return to the country. AMLO also spent big on cash transfers that boosted Morena's support while cutting funding for state and local police forces. And he spoke as if belonging to the party was in itself a guarantee that politicians would not collude with criminals.

The result was that Morena became hegemonic—a genuinely popular big-tent party that oversaw rising wages and the exit of five million Mexicans from poverty. But organized crime's power also grew. Although homicides declined slightly in López Obrador's final years in office, his term was overall the deadliest in modern Mexican history. Rising incidents of extortion and forced disappearances signaled the consolidation of criminal territorial control. Even in Morena bastions such as AMLO's southern home state of Tabasco, voters I spoke with expressed frustration with their Morena governor for overseeing rising cartel violence. In the last election, Mexicans wanted continuity on many issues—but not on security.



This helps explain why Sheinbaum, despite loyally carrying forward other AMLO initiatives such as judicial reform, immediately pivoted on security. Six more years of nonconfrontation with the cartels would have imperiled both her and AMLO's political project and the country itself. In addition to expanding gun and drug seizures, Sheinbaum has overseen a steep increase in arrests of criminal groups' midlevel management. And in an unprecedented move for Mexico, the government sent 29 long-sought drug bosses to the United States in February, sidestepping the country's normal extradition rules.

Sheinbaum's government claims these tactics are already pacifying the country, with homicides officially down almost 25 percent since September. Journalists, however, have pointed out that disappearances have increased, which suggests that criminal groups may simply be hiding their violence more effectively. The share of Mexicans who report feeling unsafe, at 62 percent, has barely budged in the last year, and just under a third of Mexicans expect their cities to get safer this year.

Still, nearly half of Mexicans approve of the government's new security policy, close to double the percentage who felt that way when Sheinbaum started. She has a mandate to keep going, and, fortunately, her plans go beyond increased arrests and drug busts.

As mayor of Mexico City from 2018 to 2023, Sheinbaum and her public security secretary, Omar García Harfuch, achieved a steep drop in crime by increasing the use of intelligence and promoting closer cooperation among security policymakers, prosecutors, and the Mexico City police. Other cities that have adopted the same coordination, such as the northern city of Torreón, have also seen crime plummet. Still, in Mexico's decentralized federalist system, the norm is for different levels of government to clash, agencies to compete, and intelligence to be scattered among separate authorities rather than shared and jointly analyzed. This has been a major hindrance to fighting cartels.

Now Sheinbaum and Harfuch are attempting to fix this disjointed system. They are passing laws to centralize intelligence collection and analysis and are consolidating the power of the federal public security ministry, which Harfuch leads, to coordinate policy across agencies. In November, a constitutional amendment gave Harfuch's ministry the power to conduct police investigations. Proposed secondary laws would give the federal security minister access to nationwide data on prison inmates, arrests, vehicles, fingerprints, criminal records, and cellphone accounts linked to users' biometric data, and require municipalities and states to share this information upward.



The problem, of course, is that if Sheinbaum and Harfuch succeed in these reforms, several other institutions are bound to lose authority, resources, and control. As a result, they are facing pushback. The chief obstacle seems to be the military, whose personnel gained sweeping control over intelligence collection under AMLO. According to reporting by El País, General Ricardo Trevilla, Mexico's national defense secretary, is lobbying Morena lawmakers not to pass the remaining legislation when it comes up for a vote in mid-June or July.

Even if these reforms succeed, others threaten to limit the scope of any anti-impunity efforts—none more so than Mexico's recently implemented judicial reform. On June 1, Mexico held the first of two rounds of elections to replace all of the country's judges. Several candidates with alleged ties to organized crime, including one who spent time in U.S. prison for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Texas, made it past candidate screening commissions, which were dominated by Morena, and onto the ballot. Now that judges are vulnerable to electoral pressures, many fear that they will be less likely to sentence powerful crime bosses and their protectors.

Then there are Sheinbaum's budget constraints. Mexico's 2025 budget reduced security spending by 36 percent—even though state police in half of Mexican states make less than minimum wage. The slimmed-down budget compensated for electorally motivated last-minute spending by AMLO that pushed Mexico's fiscal deficit to a record 5.7 percent of GDP in late 2024. Generating more revenue is likely crucial to transform Mexico's security situation. But the country's tax revenue as a share of GDP is among the lowest in Latin America, and Sheinbaum has for now ruled out higher taxes, forcing her to reconcile social programs and other spending with Mexico's security needs.

These obstacles are significant. But Sheinbaum's biggest challenge of all remains finding the political will to address corruption inside Morena.

This is where Sheinbaum's commitments get blurrier. On the one hand, on Sheinbaum's watch, the attorney general has begun investigating a former Morena governor and a handful of Morena local officials for alleged criminal wrongdoing. These probes center on relatively minor figures, but they are nevertheless a marked change from the all-too-permissive tone set by AMLO.

Sheinbaum also addressed a letter to Morena members in which she insisted that “there cannot be any collusion with crime—whether organized or white-collar.” She also secured passage of a law against nepotism in politics, which may weaken some existing corruption networks. On the other hand, Sheinbaum told a reporter, “There are no ties between Morena and crime.” And although she called for a thorough investigation into whether state prosecutors in Jalisco mismanaged the Teuchitlán case, she also defensively insisted that “there is no forced disappearance by the state” in Mexico—this despite the United Nations calling disappearances “generalized and systematic.”

The reason for Sheinbaum's caution is likely twofold: the damage that public exposure of criminal collusion could do to Morena's image, and her fear that she could lose control over her party to internal rivals. It is becoming increasingly clear that Sheinbaum lacks AMLO's capacity to unify and control Morena's many competing currents and personalities. She has faced pushback from her own party over the anti-nepotism law and her choice for welfare secretary. If Sheinbaum truly aspires to “zero impunity,” she will have to figure out how to advance her goals without inciting a rebellion by top legislative power brokers.

Given the pushback Sheinbaum may face from party heavyweights, the army, prosecutors, and even AMLO himself, she may decide that none of this is worth it—that disrupting the status quo of widespread impunity is too risky. There is, however, one external factor that could increase her resolve to act: the United States.

The United States has more leverage over Mexico now than at any time in recent years. With a major reduction of migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border in recent months, Washington is not as beholden to the Mexican president in stemming migrant flows across the border as in the recent past, affording it greater leverage over Mexico City. Moreover, Mexico's economic slowdown means that Sheinbaum must take Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement seriously.

The Trump administration must resist the temptation to focus on showy public-facing policies, such as unilateral drone strikes, which would practically force Sheinbaum to reduce cooperation in defense of Mexican sovereignty. Instead, the administration should focus its attention and leverage on the narco-corruption half of the equation, which could create a much-needed sense of urgency within Morena. Understandably, the Trump administration may wish to avoid anything that sounds like futile justice sector reform. The United States spent over $400 million supporting a decadelong transition to a new criminal justice system in Mexico, as part of the Mérida Initiative, only for Morena to clear large parts of that system away in its recent judicial reform. The administration does not need to try to rebuild Mexican institutions that support the rule of law, but it can and should raise the costs of colluding with crime in more targeted ways.

For instance, the administration has already revoked visas of Mexican politicians allegedly linked to crime, and according to an unnamed U.S. official interviewed by ProPublica, Washington is currently developing a longer list of such politicians eligible for sanctions. Many cartel leaders are also now in U.S. federal custody and facing charges; they presumably have knowledge of official corruption that they will share with U.S. federal prosecutors to strike plea deals. As the United States gathers more information about how the state-crime pacts really operate and makes some of this information public, it will strengthen Sheinbaum's incentive to act.

The Trump administration, however, should not overestimate Sheinbaum's control over Morena. It's unlikely she will move as quickly and aggressively against politicians and state officials with crime ties as Washington might like. Curbing impunity for colluding with crime will be a long, incremental process, extending beyond any one six-year term. If Trump and Sheinbaum miss this opportunity, and the penalties for official collusion with crime remain as low as they are today, the outcome is all but certain: more drug overdose deaths in the United States, and more tragic cases like Teuchitlán in Mexico.

Follow:


            The US Department of Education is paying more than $7 million a month to employees it has forced to go on leave, according to analysis from the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, the union that represents department employees.
    


            The payments could continue for years amid a long court battle over cuts instituted by the Trump administration.
    


            The department has already paid more than $21 million to idle employees over the last three months, AFGE has calculated, after they were terminated in March when the agency cut nearly half of its workforce. Roughly 1,300 people were laid off and hundreds more took voluntary “buyouts.”
    


            The firings were part of President Donald Trump's larger plan to dismantle the Department of Education and promise to deliver efficiencies through cuts across government. Dozens of other agencies have faced cuts in recent months, with workers in those departments facing similar situations.
    


            Under the terms of the layoffs, affected Department of Education workers were to be paid their salaries until June 9, their last day of employment.

            However, following a May federal court decision blocking White House plans to shut down the agency, the workers were reinstated and placed on “administrative leave” — meaning they are employed but not allowed to work — as lawsuits continue.
    


            This means salary payments will now continue past Monday, while employees remain in what many describe as “administrative purgatory,” racking up further costs for the department.
    


            According to AFGE Local 252, which analyzed over 900 salaries of affected employees, the true cost to the Department of Education is well over $7 million a month as the figure does not include employee benefits or managers' pay.
    


            The cuts were billed as a drive for government savings. When announcing the layoffs in March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said they reflected the agency's “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.”
    


            Critics point out that it has instead generated wasteful costs with no returns when employees continue getting paid for not working.
    


            Meanwhile, numerous employees on administrative leave who are members of Local 252 told CNN they feel embarrassed collecting a paycheck.
    


            After her termination in March, Ariel Shepetovskiy, a Department of Education lawyer, lost access to computer systems and email accounts needed to do her work.
    


            Now on administrative leave, “it feels like garbage to receive pay in exchange for doing nothing,” Shepetovskiy said. “I also feel shame because on some level I feel like a parasite for American taxpayers.”
    


            But, she said, “If I leave my position then there's no chance of me ever being able to do my job again.”
    


            She is holding on despite the uncertainties because she has hope that employees could be brought back, she said.
    


            “I'm trying to do my best to be productive, but I am also sad. I am frustrated and upset every day.”
    


            Robert Jason Cottrell, a data coordinator with the department, also expressed frustration — wanting, but unable — to work. “I feel like I am on welfare,” he said. “I almost feel like a leech on the system. I am able-bodied and able to go into work to help the nation's mission to educate our future generations. And I'm not doing that right now.”
    


            CNN has asked the Department of Education for comment.

            In an email to staff reviewed by CNN, the agency told workers Friday that they would continue to be employed, and that it was assessing how to “reintegrate you back to the office in the most seamless way possible.”
    


            “This includes evaluating necessary updates to security access, technology, and workspaces to ensure full operability,” the email said.
    


            Dozens of government agencies are involved in lawsuits challenging White House directives cutting their workforce, with workers similarly placed on administrative leave and unable to work across Washington.



            As lawsuits drag on, agencies have offered buyouts or settlements to encourage workers to leave.
    


            In recent weeks, some Department of Education employees say they were offered settlements in exchange for resigning their positions. Several employees given the offer told CNN they had cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board, or MSPB, a government office that civil servants can use to appeal personnel disputes.
    


            Settlement offers reviewed by CNN would pay for these employees through September if they drop their cases and quit.
    


            Some who received the offers described them as feeling “scammy” and like being plied with “sweet talk” upon receiving them.
    


            Sheria Smith, president of AFGE Local 252 in Dallas, felt the deals amounted to attempts to “intimidate great public servants to leave their jobs.”
    


            Smith, who was laid off in March, said she has heard from over a dozen employees who were approached with these offers in the past two weeks.
    


            Victoria DeLano, who is on administrative leave, said the settlement would mean giving up the option to be reinstated. “I am not giving up that option,” she said. “So many of us are just holding on because we know how important this work is.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Once home to the CIA, this tiny Southeast Asia runway was considered ‘the most secret place on Earth'","https://www.cnn.com/travel/long-tieng-laos-cia-runway-air-america-cold-war-intl-hnk-ml","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Deep in the sweltering jungles of central Laos, a 4,500-foot stretch of cracked concrete cuts through the trees — an airstrip without an airport, in a village where many have never been on a plane.
    


            But behind its crumbling control tower and bomb-cratered runway lies a hidden chapter of America's Cold War history — a site once known as “the most secret place on Earth.”
    


            The village of Long Tieng sits in central Laos, about 80 miles northeast of the capital, Vientiane. Today, it's a sleepy settlement of a few thousand people who mostly rely on the land to carve out a living.
    


            There are a couple of restaurants, two guesthouses and a handful of multipurpose shops selling everything from rice to farming tools made from repurposed bombshell metal — a nod to the village's agricultural roots and wartime past.
    


            At the village center lies the airstrip. It no longer serves aircraft, instead now functioning as a kind of outdoor community center: children ride scooters, farmers herd cattle and elderly villagers take early morning strolls before the intense heat engulfs the valley.
    


            But 50 years ago, the scene was vastly different.
    


            From the 1960s to the early 1970s, Laos played a central role in the United States' fight to stop the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. Long Tieng was the secret headquarters of a US-backed Hmong anti-communist army fighting against the communist Pathet Lao forces, which were supported by the North Vietnamese Army.
    


            At its height, tens of thousands of inhabitants — Hmong soldiers, their families, refugees from other parts of Laos, Thai soldiers and a small contingent of American CIA operatives and secret US Air Force pilots, dubbed “Ravens” — called this place home. It was the heart of the largest paramilitary operation ever conducted by the CIA.
    


            At one point in time, the tiny airstrip handled 900 daily take-offs and landings, making it one of the busiest airports in the world. Cargo planes would offload crucial supplies including ammunition and food, which would then be loaded onto smaller planes that flew to even smaller airstrips around the country.
    


            Despite the scale of the base, it was so secret even some of those participating in the war in other locations did not know of its existence, says Paul Carter, a Laos Secret War specialist who lives in Southeast Asia.
    


            “The war in Laos was so compartmentalized … I knew guys who participated in that war, they did not even know Long Tieng existed until the late 1960s when they started letting the reporters in there,” he tells CNN.
    


            From this remote mountain village, the CIA-backed Hmong army, led by the charismatic General Vang Pao, fought not only the communist Pathet Lao forces but also conducted guerrilla operations — destroying North Vietnamese supply depots, blowing up critical supply routes and generally harassing communist forces — all with full support from the US.
    


            As part of this secret war, the US launched a brutal bombing campaign that paralleled its broader military operations in Vietnam. And because international agreements barred direct military involvement in Laos, the effort fell almost entirely on the CIA.
    


            American pilots flew thousands of missions from Long Tieng's airstrip, which was known by the codenames Lima Site 98 and Lima Site 20A.
    


            Fifty years after the fall of Long Tieng in 1975, I set out to explore the remnants of the US presence in the area.
    


            I was drawn here after reading the book, “A Great Place to Have a War” by Joshua Kurlantzick. It pulled me into a world I'd never known — a hidden Cold War battleground on the sidelines of the Vietnam War. Watching old, grainy newsreels of reporters wandering around the base only deepened my fascination. Somewhere along the way, I realized I needed to see Long Tieng with my own eyes.
    


            Before long, I find myself in Vientiane with an old college friend who I've convinced to come along for an adventure and Mr. Pao — the only driver I could find with a car suitable for the journey.
    


            Pao says he used to work at the mines near Long Tieng and is familiar with the area, though he admits he's only visited the village once before.
    


            Several tour companies organize trips, but the number of tourists that visit Long Tieng still pales in comparison to Laos' major tourist destinations like Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng.
    


            Chris Corbett, owner of Laos Adv Tours and Rentals, tells CNN that his company operates around 10 motorbike tours a year to the site, taking a total of around 40 people to the village. He said his guests mainly come from the United States, Australia and Europe.
    


            Today, the village remains largely cut off from the rest of the country. Though just 80 miles from Vientiane, the drive takes over eight hours.
    


            Beyond the capital's outskirts, roads quickly degrade — first into unsealed dirt tracks, then into rugged mining roads scarred by landslides and potholes.
    


            Visibility is often poor — dust kicked up by mining trucks combines with smoke from slash-and-burn agriculture. At times, we crawl forward, barely reaching 5 mph.
    


            Part of the road winds over a rugged mountain pass with no guardrails, just a sheer drop into the valley below. Sitting in the back of the car, I grip the seat in front of me as our driver edges closer to the cliffside, the tires skimming loose gravel.
    


            At one point, our driver glances back and warns us that if we get a flat tire out here, we'll likely be stuck for a long time — maybe hours. There's no phone signal. We nod silently and keep going.
    


            As we approach Long Tieng, the rough dirt road suddenly gives way to smooth pavement. Cresting the final mountain pass, we expect to glimpse the airstrip — but thick smoke shrouds the valley, limiting visibility to a few hundred meters.
    


            Descending into the village as the sun sets, there's little sign that 30,000 people once lived here. Family farms now occupy land once filled with barracks and command centers. Military convoys have long been replaced by scooters and cattle.
    


            We stay in a guesthouse next to the airstrip. It's barebones — a wooden bed and a single creaky fan that spins with little effect. There's no air conditioning, and the humid air hangs heavy and unmoving. It's hard to sleep — not just because of the heat, but because I can't stop thinking about what this place had once been.
    


            The next morning, we walk down the center of the airstrip as the sun rises over the valley. Once one of the busiest runways in the world, it now lies silent. Tall grass sprouts from potholes left by artillery strikes. The crumbling control tower is only half its original height, and the hangars at the far end sit abandoned — rusting reminders of a war long past.
    


            As I walk along its length, I notice the absence of signposts, statues or any form of commemoration. Despite the airstrip's historical importance, there's nothing to mark it.
    


            Among those who operated out of Long Tieng during the war were the Ravens, a secret group of active-duty Air Force pilots who volunteered to serve in Laos. Their primary role was to act as forward air controllers (FACs), flying low behind enemy lines to identify and mark targets for US Air Force bombers.
    


            “They were just kind of taken off the books,” Carter says. “They operated under a different cover.“
    


            The Ravens wore civilian clothing and were issued US Embassy ID cards. In some cases, Carter notes, pilots were also issued US Agency for International Development (USAID) identity cards.
    


            The Ravens often flew in pairs — an American pilot in front and a local Hmong “backseater” who communicated with ground forces.
    


            But they weren't alone over the skies of Laos. Pilots from Air America, a secret CIA-owned airline, also operated in Long Tieng; they flew in crucial supplies to the base and conducted daring search and rescue missions to recover downed pilots deep behind enemy lines.
    


            “I landed there pretty much every other day,” Neil Hansen, a pilot stationed in Laos during part of the war, tells CNN.
    


            Hansen worked for Air America between 1964 and 1973 and detailed his experience in the book, “FLIGHT: An Air America Pilot's Story of Adventure, Descent and Redemption.”
    


            “I was flying a C-123, bringing in munitions, supplies and fuel for ‘the little birds,' which would then distribute it to other sites,” Hansen recalls. As part of his mission, he also transported “CIA customers.”
    


            During one flight in 1972, Hansen was shot down over the Plateau de Bolevan in southern Laos.
    


            “After getting my crew out and bailing out, I watched the C-123 fall out of the sky and explode,” he says, noting he was rescued by Air America helicopters shortly after.  



            About 100 meters west of the airstrip stands a two-story house that once served as the headquarters of General Vang Pao, the leader of the CIA-backed Hmong army. From this remote compound, Pao worked closely with American operatives to coordinate a covert war, marshaling thousands of Hmong fighters while receiving US air support, weapons and humanitarian aid in return.
    


            Set behind a tall fence and overgrown garden, the house still feels separated from the rest of the village — distant, guarded. A sign on the front door, written in English, reads: “No entry without permission.” It's the only English sign we've seen in the entire village, and it stops us in our tracks. With no one around, we circle the property, peering through dusty windows, unsure whether we can get inside.
    


            An older man in weathered military fatigues appears nearby. Without saying a word, he approaches, slowly dangling a key in front of our faces. He doesn't speak English, but types out a number on his phone. We nod and hand over the cash. A moment later, we're inside.
    


            The house is not what I expected. I'd imagined a preserved time capsule, cluttered with mementos or forgotten artifacts — but the rooms are eerily empty. No furniture, no decorations, no posters or portraits of the general. In the foyer, dozens of artillery shells are stacked neatly in one corner, with several mortar rounds resting nearby. It's surreal to see these instruments of war arranged with such quiet precision. Through a translation app, the man warns us not to touch anything — some might still be live.
    


            Upstairs, a single wooden desk and chair have been placed near a panoramic window facing the airstrip. I sit down, imagining General Vang Pao and CIA officers in this very spot, directing B-52 bombing runs on communist strongholds. The war — so vast, so devastating — had largely been coordinated from this small, simple room. It was almost impossible to reconcile the scale of the conflict with the modesty of this setting.
    


            We climb up to the roof. From there, the view stretches across the old airstrip and into the mountains that once shielded Long Tieng from attack. Today, the village is quiet. A few people walk slowly down the main road. Stray dogs nap in the sun. It's hard to believe that tens of thousands of people once lived here.
    


            Today, the impacts of the intense US bombing campaign on Laos are still being felt. Of the 270 million sub-munitions dropped on the country, an estimated 30% did not detonate, according to the Mines Advisory Group (MAG). These unexploded ordnances continue to kill, injure and hinder development across the country, according to MAG.
    


            Around the hills of Long Tieng, villagers still rarely venture off established roads and trails to avoid unexploded munitions.
    


            Full US-Laos relations were restored in 1992 and since 1995, the US has invested more than $390 million in a Conventional Weapons Destruction program aimed at addressing the legacy of the war. However, questions remain about future US funding of explosive ordinance clearance in Southeast Asia following the Trump administration's widespread suspension of foreign aid.
    


            “I fell in love with Laos,” says Hansen. “I look back on my time as exciting and a place where I could immerse myself in the culture. I was fulfilling a purpose where I knew I was accomplishing something that was needed.”
    


            Back in Long Tieng, children riding scooters zoom past my friend and me, their tires bumping over the broken concrete that once launched warplanes into the sky.
    


            I now understand why the community gravitates toward the airstrip whenever they can: it's one of the few open spaces cleared of unexploded ordnance.
    


            A rare place where children can play without fear of becoming another casualty of a war that ended 50 years ago.
    


            The legacy of a secret conflict — barely remembered back in the United States.

TORONTO (AP) — Canada will meet NATO's military spending guideline by early next year and diversify defense spending away from the United States, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday, asserting that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage.

The announcement means Canada will achieve NATO's spending target of 2% of gross domestic product five years earlier than previously planned. 

“Our military infrastructure and equipment have aged, hindering our military preparedness,” Carney said. “Only one of our four submarines is seaworthy. Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational. More broadly, we are too reliant on the United States.”

According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO's target by the end of the decade. 

“Our goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,” Carney said. 

Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target. 

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump's demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more. 




Carney has said he intends to diversify Canada's procurement and enhance the country's relationship with the EU. 

“We should no longer send three-quarters of our defense capital spending to America,” Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. “We will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.”

Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney's government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options. 

“We stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,” Carney said in French, one of Canada's official languages.

He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting that its strong gravitational pull became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. “our closest ally and dominant trading partner.”

“Now the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,” Carney said.

Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.

The prime minister said “a new imperialism threatens.”

“Middle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,” Carney said. 

Carney said the long-held view that Canada's geographic location will protect Canadians is increasingly archaic.

European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he plans to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the National Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” 

Roughly 300 National Guard members arrived in the city over the weekend, and Trump said he had authorized 2,000 members to deploy if needed.

What to know:

Travel ban: As tensions continue to rise over Trump's immigration enforcement, his new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries is taking effect Monday.

The California governor and the White House have been feuding over how to handle protests in Los Angeles.

It started when Tom Homan, the border czar, warned that anyone, including public officials, would be arrested if they obstructed federal immigration enforcement.

“No one's above the law,” he said on Fox & Friends, although he added that “there was no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

The California governor responded in an interview with MSNBC.

“Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy,” Newsom said.

Trump grinned when asked about the exchange after landing at the White House.

“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump said. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He's done a terrible job.”

Robotaxi company Waymo has suspended service in downtown Los Angeles after several of its self-driving cars were set ablaze during weekend protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids.

Waymo confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that five of its robotaxis were impacted and removed from downtown Los Angeles. The company added that it would not be operating in this area of the city for the time being — citing guidance from local law enforcement.

Waymo's services in other parts of Los Angeles county remain available. The city's protests are centered to several blocks of its downtown area.

Footage from Sunday's demonstrations showed spray-painted messages protesting ICE on these Waymo vehicles, which brought large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploded intermittently as they burned. Some demonstrators were also seen smashing windows of the robotaxis.

Waymo began offering driverless rides in Los Angeles last year. 

Federal prosecutors have charged California union leader David Jose Huerta with conspiring to impede an officer.

The 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California is currently detained and expected to appear in federal court in Los Angeles Monday afternoon for a bond hearing.

In a court affidavit, a homeland security agent wrote that law enforcement officers were executing a federal search warrant Friday at a Los Angeles business suspected of hiring illegal immigrants and falsifying employment records when Huerta and others appeared to try to disrupt the operation.

A law enforcement officer approached Huerta and told him to leave, then put his hands on Huerta to move him out of the way of a vehicle, the agent wrote. The agent said Huerta pushed back and the officer pushed Huerta to the ground and arrested him.

The SEIU has planned a rally in Los Angeles for Monday.

“We demand David Huerta's immediate release and an end to these abusive workplace raids,” April Verrett, SEIU's international president, said in a statement.

Messages seeking comment were left for Huerta's attorney, Marilyn Bednarski.

After inspecting a site on the White House lawn for a future flagpole, Trump spoke to reporters about the protests in California.

“I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent,” the president said, complaining about “the little railroad he's building” that is “100 times over budget.” It's a reference to the much-delayed high-speed rail project, which predates Newsom's tenure. Trump also criticized the protestors. “The people that are causing these problems are professional agitators, they're insurrectionists, they're bad people. They should be in jail.” 

In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise.

Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places.

Trump wrote that Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary.

Perla Rios, an indigenous community leader in Los Angeles, urged legal representation and due process for the dozens of workers who were detained in the city by ICE on Friday.

Rios spoke at a conference Monday morning in Los Angeles outside of Ambiance Apparel, where ICE raids set off days of tense protests in the city. Behind her stood family members of workers detained, holding up signs saying “Immigrants make America Great,” “Liberate them all” and “We want justice” next to photos of their loved ones.

“What our families are experiencing is simply a nightmare ,” Rios said.

Tom Holman defended the ICE arrests that preceded the protests and Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blaming the California governor for stoking anti-ICE sentiments and waiting two days to declare an unlawful assembly in LA.

“He's failed that state,” Holman told Fox News on Monday morning.

Newsom dared federal officials to arrest him in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, stating, “Come after me, arrest me, let's just get it over with, tough guy.”

On Fox, Holman said there was “no discussion” about arresting Newsom.

“Donald Trump—in the midst of a war with Elon Musk and his ugly tax bill that would rip healthcare from 17 million people— is in desperate need of a diversion,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday. 

“His order to deploy the National Guard in California is unnecessary, inflammatory, and provocative. Trump should immediately revoke his command to use the National Guard, and leave the law enforcement to the governor and the mayor, who are more than capable of handling the situation.”

“Americans do not need or deserve this unnecessary and provocative chaos.”

The smell of fire hung in the air of downtown Los Angeles Monday morning. A series of ash piles littered Los Angeles Street with the charred remnants of cars set afire during protests over immigration.

The quiet in the streets was in marked contrast to several days of escalating protests over President Trump's immigration crackdown. The demonstrations intensified Sunday in the country's second-most-populous city after Trump deployed the National Guard.

Police cars from a smattering of Southern California cities were blocking streets in the downtown.

Workers swept up debris from the streets including tear gas canisters. Crews painted over graffiti that covered downtown buildings.

More demonstrations were expected in Los Angeles Monday.

“I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. 

She posted the message on X over the weekend. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.”

Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.”

However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

No president has done so since Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Johnson, unlike Trump, invoked the Insurrection Act, an 18th-century wartime law that allows presidents to deploy military forces during times of rebellion or unrest.

Trump instead relied on a similar federal law that places National Guard troops under federal command under circumstances that include the threat of rebellion.

But the law also says that orders for those purposes “shall be issued through the governors of the States” — making it unclear whether the president can activate the Guard without the order of that state's governor.

Union leaders are planning a rally for downtown Los Angeles Monday to support a labor leader arrested during immigration protests.

The Service Employees International Union said Monday that the rally at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles is in support of its California president David Huerta.

Huerta was arrested Friday and expected to appear in court Monday afternoon.

The SEIU represents thousands of janitors, security officers and other workers in California. The group is also planning rallies in at least a dozen other cities spanning from Denver to New York.

Los Angeles has seen three days of protests over immigration arrests. Protests intensified after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard.

In Chicago, dozens of labor leaders, immigrant rights activists and elected officials rallied in a downtown plaza Monday in support of David Huerta, a regional president of the Service Employees International Union, who was arrested in California last week. The crowd called for Huerta's immediate release, ending speeches with chants of “Free David!”

“He was wrongfully detained,” said Genie Kastrup, president of a Chicago-based SEIU chapter. What happened to Huerta “is about more than a single leader. It is a direct assault on all of us.”

The group also called out the Trump administration's aggressive tactics on immigration enforcement, including a travel ban and arrests last week at a Chicago office used for Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins.

“We're not going anywhere. This isn't about safety. This is about control,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, who was born in Mexico. “Fear is the tactic, silence is the goal. This is not about immigration. This is about domination of all of our communities.”

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

On Sunday, protesters clashed with the National Guard in downtown LA, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire.






Confrontations began when dozens of protesters gathered outside a federal detention center demanding the release of 44 people arrested by federal immigration authorities across Los Angeles Friday, as part of Trump's mass deportation campaign.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is averaging about 1,600 arrests per day, according to the agency's head, Todd Lyons, who defended the tactics on June 2.

Mexican Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente said Monday that 42 Mexicans had been detained in raids in Los Angeles and that four had already returned to Mexico – two voluntarily and two via deportation.

“The Mexican government reiterates its unwavering commitment to the protection and defense of the human rights of Mexicans living overseas, regardless of their immigration status. In this sense, we make a respectful but firm call to United States authorities for all immigration procedures to be carried out with adherence to due process, within a framework of respect for human dignity and the rule of law.”

“We do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest. Burning police cars appears to be more an act of provocation than of resistance. We condemn violence, no matter where it comes from. We call on the Mexican community to act pacifically and not allow itself to be provoked.”

“The Mexican government will continue using all diplomatic and legal channels available to express its disagreement through its consular network with practices that criminalize immigration and put at risk the safety and wellbeing of our communities in the United States.”

Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he planned to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

But Newsom said he believed the president was required to coordinate with the state's governor before ordering such a deployment.

“We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday.

The city in California is cancelling a contract that allowed federal immigration authorities to house detainees within its local jail, citing fears of undermining community trust.

In a statement Sunday night, Glendale officials said the city would formally terminate its agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“[T]he City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement noted.

Federal immigration authorities often enter into agreements with local police departments to house immigrant detainees. ICE's agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, officials said.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote on Truth Social at 12:16 a.m. ET.

Trump has already deployed 300 members of the National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The military said that 500 Marines were on standby.

“ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m.Trump cited Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell's recent comments to defend his response to the protests.

“Don't let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump wrote at 12:14 a.m.

“This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday.

“We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.”

Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Trump has deployed 2,000 members of the National Guard. He has so far deployed 300.

An Australian television journalist was hit in the leg by a nonlethal round Sunday while reporting live from downtown Los Angeles.

Video of the incident released by 9News shows correspondent Lauren Tomasi reporting live when an officer behind her suddenly raises their firearm and fires a nonlethal round at close range. Tomasi, who doesn't appear to be wearing personal protective equipment, cries out in pain and clutches her lower leg as she and her cameraman quickly move away from the police line.

“You just (expletive) shot the reporter,” a voice off-camera can be heard shouting.

The shooting came after a tense afternoon in which Tomasi and her crew were caught between riot police and protesters. At one point, she struggled to speak over the sound of clashes, while a protester grabbed the camera mid-broadcast.

“They've told people to get out of this area, and protesters have been refusing,” she reported. “We are safe here. It's just noisy. But you can see the volatility.”

Speaking later Monday to 9News, Tomasi confirmed she was safe and unharmed.

Starting Sunday morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

Sunday's protests in Los Angeles were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and making arrests of people who don't leave. Some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend of protest. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police, and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

The new proclamation, which Trump signed on Wednesday, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa. It does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list.

President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.

In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise.

Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places.

Trump wrote that Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary.

The president isn't just remaking the Rose Garden. He wants to install two large flag poles, one on either side of the White House. When he stepped off Marine One, he walked to a bulldozer that was positioned on the South Lawn to dig a foundation for the pole. Trump posed for a photo with workers.

The project is expected to be completed in about two months, or during the first half of August, a White House official said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly about intended changes to the property.

The Senate minority leader issued the following statement Monday:








The lawsuit, which is also over plans to return seized devices, was announced Monday.

The states argue that returning the triggers, which make semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly, would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. The administration announced the deal last month.

It resolves a series of cases over the aftermarket trigger the government had previously argued qualify as machine guns under federal law, saying they're essentially illegal machine gun conversion devices because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing essentially like an automatic weapon.

“I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. She posted the message on X over the weekend. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.”

Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.”

However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

As President Trump builds a crypto empire — including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club — Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.

But the Democratic Party's own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.

Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.

“I'm all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “But at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don't think you can close your eyes to that when you're legislating.”

A senior White House official says he expects a “short meeting with a big, strong handshake” on the export of rare earth minerals from China.

Appearing on CNBC this morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said it was a “very significant, sticking point” because China, which controls the processing of critical minerals, has been “slow rolling” in sending the materials to U.S. over licensing requirements.

“It could potentially disrupt production for, you know, some U.S. companies that rely on those things,” Hassett said. High-level U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting today in London for their latest round of trade talks.

Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC he plans to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.”

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

But Newsom said he believed the president was required to coordinate with the state's governor before ordering such a deployment.

“We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday night.

Security precautions are already being put in place ahead of this Saturday's military parade. Workers were assembling black metal barriers near the White House on Monday morning.

More information on preparations will be announced in the afternoon during a briefing with local and federal officials.

The American and Israeli leaders plan to speak Monday morning, according to a White House official. The official requested anonymity before a public announcement.

Trump has been pushing for a nuclear agreement with Iran, while Netanyahu is wary of the diplomatic effort.

ABC News has suspended correspondent Terry Moran for calling Trump administration deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller a “world class hater” in a since-deleted social media post.

Moran's post was swiftly condemned by administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance. ABC News, in a statement, said it “stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.”

The network said Moran was suspended pending further evaluation.

Moran, in his post on X at 12:06 a.m. on Sunday, said President Trump was a hater, too. But he wrote that for Trump, his hatred is a means to an end, “and that end is his own glorification.” For Miller, “his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.”

This morning, Trump is traveling back to the White House from Camp David. Later today, at 2 p.m., he'll participate in an “Invest America Roundtable” event at the White House.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote on Truth Social at 12:16 a.m. ET.

Trump has already deployed 300 members of the National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The military said 500 Marines were on standby.

“ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m.

Trump cited Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell's recent comments to defend his response to the protests.

“Don't let these thugs get away with this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump wrote at 12:14 a.m.

“This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday.

“We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.”

Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Trump has deployed 2,000 members of the national guard. He has so far deployed 300.

High-level delegations from the U.S. and China are meeting in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that's roiled the global economy.

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng was due to hold talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at a U.K. government building.

The talks, which are expected to last at least a day, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war.

The two countries announced May 12 they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

Scores of National Institutes of Health scientists have gone public to assail deep program cuts and upheaval at their agency under the Trump administration.

On Monday, more than 90 current employees sent their leader a letter entitled the Bethesda Declaration. It's a frontal challenge to policies it says “undermine the NIH mission, waste our public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.”

By signing their names, the NIH employees gave up the veil of anonymity common in Washington — and put their jobs at risk. Their declaration was endorsed anonymously by 250 other NIH researchers and staff. Altogether, employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers registered their dismay with the agency's direction.

Trump is not backing off his battle with Elon Musk, saying Saturday that he has no desire to repair their relationship and warning that his former ally and campaign benefactor could face “serious consequences” if he tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.

Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he has no plans to make up with Musk. Asked specifically if he thought his relationship with the mega-billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is over, Trump responded, “I would assume so, yeah.”

“I'm too busy doing other things,” Trump said. 

The president also issued a warning amid chatter that Musk could back Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the 2026 midterm elections.

“If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,” Trump told NBC, though he declined to share what those consequences would be. Musk's businesses have many lucrative federal contracts.

Johnson took clear sides Sunday in Trump's breakup with mega-billionaire Elon Musk, saying Musk's criticism of the GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure, and he downplayed Musk's influence over the GOP-controlled Congress.

“I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,” Johnson said on ABC's “This Week.”

Johnson said he has exchanged text messages with Musk since he came out against the GOP bill.

Musk called it an “abomination” that would add to U.S. debts and threaten economic stability. He urged voters to flood Capitol Hill with calls to vote against the measure, which is pending in the Senate after clearing the House. His criticism sparked an angry social media back-and-forth with Trump, who told reporters over the weekend that he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk.

The speaker was dismissive of Musk's threats to finance opponents — even Democrats — of Republican members who back Trump's bill.

Early in Trump's first term, he issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

It was one of the most chaotic and confusing moments of his young presidency. Travelers from those nations were either barred from getting on flights to the U.S. or detained at U.S. airports after they landed. They included students and faculty, as well as businesspeople, tourists and people visiting friends and family.

The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban,” was retooled amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

That ban affected various categories of travelers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Koreans and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.






Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched a campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.

The travel ban stems from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence to compile a report on “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S.

The aim is to “protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes,” the administration said.

In a video posted on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terrorist attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The man charged in the attack is from Egypt, a country that is not on Trump's restricted list. U.S. officials say he overstayed a tourist visa.

Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement.

The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa.

The new ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the U.S. even after the ban takes effect.

Australian television journalist Lauren Tomasi was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet Sunday while reporting live from downtown Los Angeles on the large-scale protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and subsequent deployment of California National Guard troops to the city.

NEWCASTLE, Australia (AP) — An Australian television journalist was hit in the leg by a nonlethal round Sunday while reporting live from downtown Los Angeles on the large-scale protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and subsequent deployment of California National Guard troops to the city.

Video of the incident released by 9News shows correspondent Lauren Tomasi, microphone in hand, reporting live when an officer behind her suddenly raises their firearm and fires a nonlethal round at close range. Tomasi, who doesn't appear to be wearing personal protective equipment, cries out in pain and clutches her lower leg as she and her cameraman quickly move away from the police line. 

“You just (expletive) shot the reporter,” a voice off-camera can be heard shouting.

Tomasi assured her crew she was okay: “Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.”

The shooting came after a tense afternoon in which Tomasi and her crew were caught between riot police and protesters. At one point, she struggled to speak over the sound of clashes, while a protester grabbed the camera mid-broadcast. 

“They've told people to get out of this area, and protesters have been refusing,” she reported. “We are safe here. It's just noisy. But you can see the volatility.”

Speaking later Monday to 9News, Tomasi confirmed she was safe and unharmed.

“I'm okay, my cameraman Jimmy and I are both safe. This is just one of the unfortunate realities of reporting on these kinds of incidents,” she said.




9News is part of Nine, one of Australia's largest media companies, which operates across television, radio, print and digital channels. Its major platforms include free-to-air Channel Nine and leading newspapers like The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

The demonstrations, which began with a few hundred people on Friday, had swelled by Sunday to thousands of people who blocked a major freeway and set several self-driving cars on fire.

President Trump's sent National Guard troops to the city over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, in the first deployment without state consent since 1967.

LONDON (AP) — High-level delegations from the United States and China met in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that has roiled the global economy,

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at Lancaster House, an ornate 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace.

Wang Wentao, China's commerce minister, also was part of Beijing's delegation.

The talks, which may continue Tuesday, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war. 

The two countries announced May 12 they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

The U.S. and China are the world's biggest and second-biggest economies. Chinese trade data shows that exports to the United States fell 35% in May from a year earlier.

Since the Geneva talks, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, visas for Chinese students at American universities and "" rare earth ” minerals that are vital to carmakers and other industries.

President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the following day that the trade talks would resume in London. 

Stay up to date with similar stories by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

Rare earths were expected to be a focus of the talks. The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.




Beijing indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well as U.S. firms.

Kevin Hassett, a U.S. economic adviser, told CNBC on Monday that he expected a short meeting with “a big, strong handshake” on rare earths.

The U.K. government says it is providing the venue and logistics but is not involved in the talks, though British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves met with both Bessent and He on Sunday, and U.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds was due to meet Wang.

“We are a nation that champions free trade and have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody's interests, so we welcome these talks,” the British government said in a statement.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he planned to file a lawsuit Monday against President Donald Trump in response to the administration's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard to confront immigration protesters who took to the streets in Los Angeles.

“Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the governor of that state is illegal and immoral,” Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC on Sunday.




The streets of the sprawling city of 4 million people were quiet Monday morning, but the smell of smoke hung in the air downtown, one day after crowds blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.

While much of the city was spared from any violence, clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places. It could take days to clear the debris from burned cars and to paint over the graffitti. Sunday was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier. Others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover at one point.




Trump said Monday that the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.

Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, the president accused Newsom and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, of lying by saying Guard troops were not necessary.

The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.

Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.

Several dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.

Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.

“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” he wrote.

Newsom called on Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling it a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”

The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.

“Trump wants chaos and he's instigated violence,” he said. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for.”

The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

McDonnell pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. He said his department responded as quickly as it could and had not been notified in advance of the raids.

Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and he told MSNBC that Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called Trump a “stone cold liar.”

The admonishments did not deter the administration.

“It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder Sunday morning in LA, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some demonstrators closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently. By evening, police had shut down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash-bang grenades echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.

Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.

The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” 

He said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.

Trump told reporters Sunday as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they're not going to get away with it.” 

In San Francisco, officers arrested dozens of protesters Sunday night after a group refused to disperse, police said in a statement on social media.

Officers monitoring one protest declared an unlawful assembly when people in the group became violent, the San Francisco Police Department said. Many protesters left the scene, but some remained while others moved to another area where they vandalized buildings and a police vehicle.

Criminology professor Dr. Adam Lankford and former FBI special agent Nicole Parker break down the details of Travis Decker allegedly killing his three daughters on 'Sunday Night in America.'

New photos of the Washington state survivalist accused of killing his own daughters have been released as federal authorities warn he could be trying to flee to Canada following a two-week-long manhunt. 

Officials are still searching for Travis Decker, 32, nearly two weeks after his three daughters, Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5, were first reported missing and days after their bodies were discovered.

On June 7, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office released an updated wanted poster with new photos of Decker, highlighting his tattoos, haircut and wardrobe, as authorities continue to comb through large swaths of wilderness in search of the father.

Decker was last seen wearing a green or tan shirt, which he was previously photographed in, and dark shorts, according to authorities. He is described as ""dangerous"" with police warning he ""may be armed."" 

Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been combing through nearby wooded areas and structures, with the state's National Guard deploying late Friday as the search for Decker continues. 

""Law enforcement members have conducted thorough searches of the forested areas, the river, and many structures in the area that Mr. Decker was last known to be in,"" the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. ""We continue these search efforts, acting upon gathered information and tips from the public, and leads developed through even more search warrants.""

The Chelan County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Officials are also looking into the possibility that Decker, an experienced survivalist who previously spent time in the military, is attempting to flee to Canada, according to a U.S. Marshals Service affidavit obtained by Fox 13 Seattle. 

According to the affidavit, a search of Decker's Google account revealed queries such as ""how does a person move to Canada,"" ""how to relocate to Canada"" and ""jobs Canada."" 

The U.S. Marshals with the Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

WASHINGTON STATE FATHER WANTED FOR MURDER AFTER 3 DAUGHTERS FOUND DEAD

Additionally, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson has pledged to provide helicopter transportation for officers searching in remote areas. 

""As a parent, my heart goes out to Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia's mom, Whitney, and all those who love them,"" Ferguson wrote on X. ""The brutal murder of these young children has shocked our state. I'm committed to supporting law enforcement as they seek justice for Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia.""

The girls were discovered with plastic bags over their heads and bound wrists at a Chelan County campground last week and are believed to have died from asphyxiation. Additionally, deputies found two bloody handprints on the tailgate of Decker's vehicle.

Decker's ex-wife, Whitney Decker, 35, told police that the girls had not returned from a court-ordered visit three days after a visit with their father, according to court documents. 

Decker was permitted to visit the girls every other weekend – but not overnight – according to a court-ordered parenting plan that he did not sign. When he failed to drop the girls off with their mother by the 8 p.m. curfew on Friday, May 30, his ex tried calling – but was unable to reach him, according to a Chelan County police affidavit.

The children's mother told police Decker has mental health issues – including borderline personality disorder – but had never missed a deadline to return their children following a visit. He is homeless and lives in motels and campgrounds, according to the affidavit. 

Local, state and federal officials continue to search for Decker, who is described as standing approximately 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing about 190 pounds. Authorities are unsure if Decker is armed, but insist he is considered dangerous.

Decker is charged with three counts each of aggravated first-degree murder and kidnapping. If convicted, he faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Protesters in Los Angeles were filmed burning and spitting on American flags as they chanted anti-Trump slogans over the weekend.

Footage from the incident shows a circle of dozens of people, many wearing masks, surrounding an American flag burning on the ground. Several of the individuals then spit on the flag or sprayed flammable liquid to continue the blaze before a second flag was added to the fire.

A number of the protesters held high the flags of South American countries like Mexico as the U.S. flag burned on the ground. They also chanted ""F-Trump.""

The footage from this weekend's riots also shows officers with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department moving in to disperse the crowds, shooting flash bangs as they went.

The Los Angeles Police Department declared an ""unlawful assembly"" Sunday night as protesters failed to disperse in the downtown area.

""Agitators have splintered into and through out the Downtown Area,"" the LAPD's Central Division wrote on X. ""Residents, businesses and visitors to the Downtown Area should be alert and report any criminal activity. Officers are responding to several different locations to disperse crowds.""

""An UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY has been declared for the Downtown Los Angeles area,"" the department added.

Protesters marched into the L.A. Live area, an entertainment complex in the heart of downtown Los Angeles that sits adjacent to Crypto.com Arena and the Los Angeles Convention Center, and were blocking lanes on Figueroa and 11th streets, police said.

President Donald Trump sent in the National Guard this weekend after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were reportedly attacked on the streets of L.A. as they conducted raids to catch and deport illegal immigrants. Seeing that neither California Gov. Gavin Newsom nor L.A. Mayor Karen Bass were moving aggressively enough to stop the attacks, Trump signed a presidential memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to ""address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,"" the White House said in a statement.

""I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles county and return them to my command,"" Newsom wrote on X on Sunday alongside his letter to President Trump. ""We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved. This is a serious breach of state sovereignty – inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they're actually needed.""

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump implementing a travel ban on several countries and signing a proclamation restricting foreign students at Harvard. 

President Donald Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 African, Middle Eastern and South American countries went into effect on Monday.

The ban, signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa.

The order does not cancel visas that have already been issued to citizens of the countries, and those who possess them will remain free to travel to the U.S.

The president said on X the travel ban was being introduced after a terror attack against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, last weekend, allegedly by an Egyptian man who had overstayed his visa.

In a White House fact sheet, Trump said, ""We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.""

This point was backed by the State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott. In a briefing last week, Pigott said, ""This is a national security imperative.""

""We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,"" Trump said before signing the ban.

""That is why today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya and numerous others,"" he concluded. ""We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm, and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe.""

LVMPD says the shooting occurred in the 3600 block of S. Las Vegas Blvd. and not inside a casino. (Storyful)

A manhunt is underway for a possible suspect after two people were killed in a shooting on the Las Vegas strip near the iconic Bellagio fountains.

Undersheriff Andrew Walsh said officers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department were on patrol in the 3600 block of Las Vegas Blvd around 10:40 p.m. Sunday when they heard gunfire coming from the west side of the street. 

The officers ran to the gunfire and found two victims laying on the sidewalk suffering from apparent gunshot wounds. The officers rendered aid to the victims but they both succumbed to their injuries, Walsh said. 

""We are responding to a shooting in the 3600 block of S. Las Vegas Boulevard. The shooting did not occur inside a casino. Please avoid the area,"" police shared in a post on X.

Walsh said the LVMPD believes they have identified the suspect and that Sunday night's violence was an isolated incident, knowing that the suspect and victim had previously engaged in some type of conflict using ""a variety of social media platforms."" 

""At this point every effort is being by members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Department to locate, apprehend, and arrest the suspect, who's responsible for this crime,"" Walsh said.

The reported shooting was captured during a livestream on the strip, showing people dropping the ground and taking cover after a man appeared to open fire in a crowded area. 

Video footage obtained by Fox News Digital shows a heavy police presence on the strip. Fox News Digital is working to confirm reports that at least one person was killed in the shooting.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are beginning a nationwide initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings as they leave courtrooms, multiple sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Fox News.

The effort will target those who have been living in the United States for less than two years, sources said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strategy aims to get illegal immigration cases dropped. Federal officials plan to arrest migrants and place them in expedited removal proceedings, fast-tracking them to deportation out of the country, allowing for almost-immediate removal without a hearing before an immigration judge, according to ICE sources.

If a migrant has an active, pending court case, expedited removal cannot happen, which is why DHS officials are planning to get them dropped. Immigration judges, however, have to agree to drop cases, and so far, they are cooperating with the effort, sources said.

ICE BEGINS NEW, NATIONWIDE EFFORT TO ARREST ILLEGAL ALIENS AT IMMIGRATION HEARINGS

The initiative will likely cause controversy because migrants will be disincentivized from attending asylum hearings, and it will involve arrests of migrants with no criminal histories aside from entering the United States illegally.

Videos posted to social media and captured by local news across the country show the ICE arrests already happening in various courthouses.

""Secretary Noem is reversing Biden's catch-and-release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News. ""This Administration is once again implementing the rule of law.""

The spokesperson added that ""most aliens who illegally entered the United States within the past two years are subject to expedited removals.""

""ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been.""

""Biden ignored this legal fact and chose to release millions of illegal aliens, including violent criminals, into the country with a notice to appear before an immigration judge,"" the spokesperson said. ""ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as they always should have been. If they have a valid credible fear claim, they will continue in immigration proceedings, but if no valid claim is found, aliens will be subject to a swift deportation.""

Gregg Jarrett, Fox News legal analyst and commentator, noted the Supreme Court's recent ruling ""that President Trump had the authority to end Biden's Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for certain specified migrants who have been in the U.S. for less than two years.""

""That means they are eligible for expedited deportation,"" he said. ""There is no law that prevents ICE from carrying out the initiative by making arrests at immigration/asylum hearings. From a safety standpoint, it makes sense. Indeed, it has been a longstanding practice.""

ICE FORCED TO RELEASE SOME ILLEGAL MIGRANTS WHO COULD POSE DANGER TO AMERICANS: IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY

ICE has escalated their pursuit and detention of migrants by waiting outside courtrooms to see if judges are ordering them to be deported or if prosecutors are asking for their cases to be dismissed.  (Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis )

Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, immigration attorney and CEO and owner of Lincoln-Goldfinch Law, told Fox News Digital that while ""ICE can go in and conduct apprehensions in courthouses,"" such arrests ""can be restricted"" if immigration judges refuse to dismiss cases. 

WATCH: Attorney explains effort to detain illegal immigrants in courthouses

""Because the playbook is this: the immigrant goes into their court hearing. The DHS attorney, which is essentially the prosecutor, tells the judge, 'Judge, we actually want to dismiss this case. We don't want to pursue it.' And in many instances, the judge will just dismiss over objection of the immigrant or [if] the immigrant doesn't know any better, and they say, ‘Sure, that sounds great.' And then they walk out of the courtroom, and they're apprehended,"" Lincoln-Goldfinch explained. 

If judges refuse to dismiss cases, they can ""maintain their own jurisdiction over what happens with [an immigrant] because this person is in immigration court proceedings and the judge gets to decide what happens to them so long as they don't dismiss the case.""

Jarrett believes ""the likelihood of interference is minimal"" when asked whether judges might try to stop the arrests.

""Most asylum and deportation hearings are in front of an immigration judge who is an employee of the Justice Department,"" he said. ""Those hearings occur in federal courthouses or detention facilities, so the likelihood of interference is minimal. You would not have, for example, a state court judge trying to interfere, as we saw in [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].""

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTS SKYROCKET UNDER TRUMP ICE COMPARED TO BIDEN LEVELS LAST YEAR: 'WORST OF THE WORST'

Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan, 65, was indicted last month on federal charges of obstruction of proceedings before a U.S. agency and unlawful concealment of an individual subject to arrest after she allegedly directed an illegal immigrant defendant to leave through a private exit at the Milwaukee County Courthouse while ICE officials were serving a warrant for his arrest.

WATCH: WISCONSIN JUDGE SEEN TALKING TO ICE AGENTS

Lincoln-Goldfinch, meanwhile, believes the new DHS effort is a scheme for the Trump administration to easily and quickly boost illegal immigrant apprehension numbers, and that ""they are not targeting the population of immigrants that Trump and Kristi Noem purport to want to go after, and that is law-breaking, dangerous, criminal history type of immigrants.""

This initiative, she said, targets illegal immigrants trying to go through a legal citizenship process.

""Why are we not sending ICE after the people that they're claiming are here to harm us? It doesn't make sense from a resource expenditure perspective,"" she said. ""And I think that is the main objection. So do I think this will be challenged in court? But on top of that, I think that people should really take issue with the fact ICE is going after people who are following the rules and they're playing dirty tricks and games in order to get them to dismiss their cases and then they arrest them walking out of the courtroom.""

WATCH: INSIDE THE THREATS AND DANGERS ICE AGENTS FACE

In an April 29 press release marking 100 days in office, DHS announced that border apprehensions were down 95% since President Donald Trump took office, and more migrants are returning to their home countries to avoid deportation. 

The administration also noted that it had arrested more than 158,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone, including more than 600 members of Tren de Aragua, saying federal officials are ""targeting the worst of the worst"" with 75% of illegal immigrant arrests involving those with convictions or pending charges.

A major Los Angeles suburb revoked its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to public backlash to federal agents seeking to carry out the Trump administration's deportation agenda by detaining illegal immigrants.

Officials in Glendale, California, announced the decision to abruptly cancel its ICE detainee holding contract late Sunday evening as riots over ICE activity rocked Los Angeles, leading President Donald Trump to send in the National Guard.

City officials said they were canceling the contract, which allows federal authorities to hold suspected illegal immigrants in local jails, after it had been in place for nearly 20 years.

“The City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” local officials wrote in a press release. “And while opinions on this issue may vary—the decision to terminate this contract is not politically driven. It is rooted in what this City stands for—public safety, local accountability, and trust.”

“It is also our duty to ensure that Glendale's residents and businesses do not suffer the consequences of the unruly and unlawful behavior of others,” the announcement continues. “Moving forward, the facility will continue to serve local law enforcement needs without participation in federal detention efforts.”

Glendale City Manager Roubik Golanian made the decision due to “evaluation of legal, operational, and community considerations,” per the press release.

Some families may face greater difficulty visiting family members held by ICE, and access to legal counsel for detainees may be more limited, the city, which is the fourth-largest in Los Angeles County, said.

Since roughly the start of the Trump administration, 82 people have been detained by ICE and housed in the Glendale City Jail, according to NBC Los Angeles.

Violent protests broke out in Los Angeles over the weekend as ICE worked to remove illegal immigrants in the area.

Democrats have decried ICE's activity in the Golden State, while condemning the Trump administration's efforts this weekend to target demonstrators as unduly harsh. 

Top California officials, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have blamed Trump for the protests. Rep. Norma Torres (D-CA) accused ICE of inciting the violence in the area, telling federal agents on Friday evening to “get the f*** out of LA so that order can be restored.” 

Republicans have denied that ICE is to blame and rejected claims that the Trump administration's response to the riots has been unnecessarily heavy-handed. 

Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) compared the unrest to the nationwide riots following the death of George Floyd in 2020.

“We watched this kind of scene five, six years ago, when there was a takeover in the northwest, around Seattle and Portland, when we watched all that happen, and local law enforcement was being challenged over and over again,” Lankford said. “It finally took a National Guard presence to be able to bring it down after weeks. What President Trump is trying to do is say, ‘This is not going to take weeks this time.'”

“We're not going to allow this to be able to spiral out of control,” Lankford added. “This is an American city, and to be able to have an American city where we have people literally flying Mexican flags and saying, ‘You cannot arrest us,' cannot be allowed. If someone violates the law, no matter what state that they're in, they're in violation of a federal law. They should face consequences for that.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rioters in Los Angeles, objecting to the efforts to deport illegal immigrants in the United States, have plagued the city with violence for three days, including assaulting law enforcement officers and federal agency officials, setting Waymo vehicles on fire, and other criminal acts.

The destruction and violence have led President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the National Guard deployment on his X account and warned that if the violence continues, Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton, California, were on high alert and would also be deployed.

It was a decision that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed with and called “common sense.” He spoke about the decision in a Sunday segment on Fox News Live.

“This is common sense. This is basic law enforcement,” Pompeo said. “What the secretary of defense is talking about is bringing in folks to provide support so we can do the fundamental duty of the government, which is to protect its law enforcement officers and the people from these violent assaults.”

Pompeo also referenced the summer of 2020 in the U.S., in which rioters devastated cities throughout the country.

“We do all remember the summer of '20 where this got out of hand, where local law enforcement and governors just let the flames burn,” Pompeo said. “This can't happen this time. And you see President Trump and his team taking the actions that are both appropriate and necessary to protect people.”

The former CIA director stressed the importance of ensuring that people in the country are here legally. He expressed the need for such people to be allowed to do their jobs without being attacked.

“If we don't support the folks who are doing the important work of securing our southern border, making sure everyone who is here is here lawfully, and then keeping people and property protected and safe, we'll end up in a very bad place again,” Pompeo said. “And that is not good for the United States of America.”

“When you let completely unvettable … people who you just … don't know who they are, when you let them into our country by the hundreds, you get precisely what you're seeing in Southern California today,” Pompeo added.

Democratic politicians in California, particularly Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), were heavily critical of the deportation efforts.

NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE ‘EVERYWHERE' IN LA, TRUMP SAYS

“As mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our society in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city.”

“Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” Newsom said. “Donald Trump's chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America's economy.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) responded to Tom Homan‘s warning on Sunday that obstructing immigration enforcement would lead to an arrest of “anybody,” telling the White House “border czar” to come arrest him.

“Come after me. Arrest me. Let's just get it over with, tough guy. I don't give a damn,” Newsom told NBC News on Sunday night.

The California governor defended the illegal immigrant population of Los Angeles, which was targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a wave of raids late last week, spurring violent protests across the city.

Newsom said Homan needs to leave alone the “poor people just trying to live their lives” and insisted that the state needs to “push back” against the Trump administration, which has sought to control the law enforcement response to the protests.

“These guys need to grow up,” the California governor said. “They need to stop, and we need to push back. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let's go.”

Newsom has been critical of the Trump administration's move to deploy the National Guard to the area, which he sees as unnecessary given the state's resources. On Sunday, he said President Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis and is inflaming conditions” as the protests continue into the night.

Earlier on Sunday, he requested that the administration revoke its deployment order, deeming it “unlawful.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rioters in Los Angeles set several self-driving vehicles operated by Waymo, a ride-hailing service, on fire on Sunday as the city grapples with a violent three-day protest against U.S. deportation efforts.

Footage shows multiple Waymo vehicles engulfed in flames, with an intense amount of smoke billowing into the air. Masked protesters could be seen filming and parading around the cars, which all had their windows smashed, tires slashed, and anti-ICE graffiti covering their exteriors.

According to the Los Angeles Times, one rioter appeared to use a makeshift flamethrower to set the interior of one of the cars ablaze, while others were seen throwing Lime electric scooters into the burning cars.

The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the vehicle fires on Los Angeles Street, warning people to stay away from the area.

“Burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, including hydrogen fluoride, posing risks to responders and those nearby,” the LAPD said in a statement.

The protests, which began on Friday, have significantly escalated over the weekend, with protesters directly clashing with law enforcement.

They have thrown stones, bottles, and Molotov cocktails at police officers, while there were reports on Sunday afternoon of two motorcyclists deliberately crashing into officers behind a police barricade.

Superman is Jewish.

That statement always elicits an unusual reaction when I say it in social situations. Some people look puzzled, some laugh, and a handful tell me I'm crazy. Superman is an alien from another planet, they say. He ain't Jewish or Catholic or anything.

Yet, in his origins, different names, and even his costume, Superman is a deeply Jewish creation. With a new Superman movie about to be released and American Jews suffering a terrible new wave of antisemitism, it's a good time to celebrate Superman's Jewishness — and the truth, justice, and American way he represents.

I recently spoke with Valerie Estelle Frankel, author of the book Jewish Science Fiction and Fantasy through 1945: Immigrants in the Golden Age. In her book, Frankel explores the Jewish origins of the comic book. Comic strips appeared in newspapers in the early 29th century, but in 1933, Charlie Gaines (born Max Ginsberg) had the idea to reprint the most popular newspaper comics in a booklet. It was a huge hit, and by 1939, comic books were selling 400,000 copies a month. Gaines and his assistant, Sheldon Mayer, were the original publishers of Superman.

Superman was created by two Jewish children from New York, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

“Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster have described putting a lot of themselves into Clark Kent,” Frankel told me. “He has dazzling abilities, family talismans, a secret name  — and Kal-El is quite a Jewish one, meaning the voice or vessel of the almighty. He's from somewhere so foreign with such different traditions that the local Americans have no context for it. So, sure, he blends in as a shy geek in glasses. He feels that to get a good job and a girlfriend, he has to bury it all. Still, when someone needs his special skills, he shows off all he is — family crest proudly displayed. Siegel and Shuster likewise led double lives — both drawing fantastical creations and wrapping themselves in a tallit and tefillin at temple.”

Frankel also said there has been some erasure of the Jewishness of some comic book characters — that is, characters who are explicitly Jewish in their comics become secular when put on the big screen.

“There's been a delightful trend toward multicultural superheroes in Marvel and DC's shows and films,” Frankel said. “I loved Birds of Prey, Suicide Squad, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, Moon Knight, Captain America: Brave New World, Batwoman, and Agatha All Along, like the older X-Men films and Fantastic Four. But there's a catch. Each of these had a character who was Jewish in the comics. However, onscreen, Harley Quinn, Kitty Pryde, and Ben Grimm never indicate any Jewishness. Magneto sure does, but not his children, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Ragman, Martin Stein, and Marc Spector each get a very quick reference. Sabra is described as Israeli. Batwoman goes a bit further with a Bat Mitzvah episode, as does Billy Kaplan from Agatha All Along. But all this adds up to a trend of erasure — removing a significant part of the characters' identity. So will something Jewish appear with Superman, who's always been a Jewish metaphor but doesn't identify as Jewish? I doubt it.”

Frankel also explores the story of Supergirl. Like Superman, she is an orphan. Frankel believes that Supergirl's story reflects the Kindertransports that sent Jewish children to safety during World War II. She sees Krypton Memorial Day as a reflection of this remembrance of the Holocaust.

“The 50s and 60s were prosperous for America,” Frankel said, “but Jews were still mourning the Holocaust, and it showed. Characters from this time include the neurotic and guilt-ridden Spider-Man, for instance. Supergirl is perky, but in her backstory as a refugee sent to her ‘cousin in America,' lots of Jews saw themselves. She and Superman are the only survivors of an entire race, after all. And there are even darker comics from this period, as before the discussion of the Holocaust really went mainstream, Jewish comics authors sent their heroes to liberate camps and save survivors facing American antisemitism. The collection We Spoke Out collects many of these.”

MEDICAID IS BROKEN. LET'S FIX IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

So, what current comics would Frankel recommend?

“Oh, there are way too many to have a favorite, and different creators really reimagine some characters. I always pick up Ms. Marvel, Ironheart, Gwenpool, Runaways, and Wonder Woman. Plus anything by Peter David, Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti, Chelsea Cain, or J. Michael Straczynski, whoever they're writing on. To see Supergirl becoming an earthborn angel with plenty of Jewish philosophy, Peter David's 90s Supergirl is fascinating,” Frankel said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

On capital punishment, and The Atlantic's July 2025 cover story

Listen to more stories on hark

On June 22, 2000, Thomas Loden Jr., a 35-year-old Marine recruiter, kidnapped a 16-year-old girl named Leesa Marie Gray from the side of a road in Itawamba County, Mississippi. Loden raped and sexually battered Gray for four hours. Then he strangled her to death. When police found him, they discovered that he had carved the words I'm sorry into his chest.

Loden pleaded guilty to capital murder. I first met him 21 years after the killing, on death row at the Mississippi State Penitentiary, which is better known as Parchman Farm.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Loden told me conspiratorial tales about the murder and spoke mainly in non sequiturs. Unlike some men on death row, who either are honestly transformed or at least put on a convincing performance of penitence, Loden seemed to me to be an unreconstructed killer. But he asked me to read documents about his case, and I agreed. In the year that followed, Loden sent me handwritten letters, some 20 pages in length, that did nothing to aid the cause of exculpation.

When he told me that he was soon scheduled to be executed, I volunteered to be a media witness. I had a specific reason to do so; I wanted to experience firsthand what one of our staff writers, Elizabeth Bruenig, has chosen as her vocation. In my job, I send people to dangerous places, and I try to do so carefully. America's death chambers are worthy of sustained journalistic coverage, but there are hazards involved—not the sort one associates with war reporting, but psychological and spiritual hazards. Witnessing clinical barbarism is not good for one's soul, or one's sleep.

What you will learn when you read Liz's new cover story—among the very best and most important that The Atlantic has ever published—is that she possesses an almost-otherworldly toughness that has allowed her to witness, again and again, the unnatural act of state-sanctioned killing. I cannot do her story justice in a few lines, but I will say that she does not flinch from any of the ugliness of capital punishment, and, crucially, she does not flinch from the appalling crimes committed by so many of the men on death row.

From the July 2025 issue: Elizabeth Bruenig on sin and redemption in America's death chambers

Liz's motivations for pursuing this specific journalistic practice are several: Like many writers, she's drawn to outsiders, victims, and life's losers. She's drawn to this work because she sees injustice and has a pen. And she pursues these stories because, she told me, Jesus said, “I was in prison and you visited me.”

The state of Alabama has banned Liz from its prisons; her reporting has repeatedly embarrassed its corrections department. But she is continuing her work in other states, and on the federal government's death row.

I support her in her pursuit, but I worry. I've seen people die in horrible ways—in terrorist attacks and minefields and artillery strikes. Watching Thomas Loden die because the state of Mississippi injected him with lethal chemicals was a very different thing—coldly medieval and arrogant. My sympathy is with the family of Leesa Marie Gray, but Loden's killing was a reminder that humans have a great capacity for vengeance. It was also a reminder that our continued use of the death penalty places the United States in a category that includes such countries as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and China. No democracy should be in this club.

Jeffrey Goldberg: Rehabilitation and reform in Angola penitentiary

For understandable reasons, people turn away from the subject of capital punishment. But Liz has done a remarkable thing here—she has written a propulsive narrative about redemption and sin and invested her story with humanity and grace. I've told her that she should stop witnessing executions whenever she feels it is enough. But she remains committed to bearing witness, for all of us.

The president wants to draw out a politically expedient fight, not broker compromises.

Last year, Donald Trump's presidential campaign notoriously made transgender issues a centerpiece of its charge that Democrats were out of touch with Middle America. The Trump team focused on matters where liberal activists and politicians had taken deeply unpopular stances: They would allow biological males in women's sports; Trump wouldn't. They supported medical transition for minors; he didn't.

But in office, the Trump administration has gone far beyond those positions, issuing a series of executive orders and official statements that depict trans people as innately deluded, duplicitous, or dishonorable. The cumulative effect is to portray anyone who is gender-nonconforming as a traitor. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA,” Trump posted on Truth Social when he took over the Kennedy Center, in Washington, D.C.

Look at the language of one of Trump's early executive orders, which prohibits trans people from serving in the military. The “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life,” a January 27 order declares. (Early last month, the Supreme Court allowed the ban on transgender soldiers to stand while legal challenges against it run their course.)

More recently, the Trump confidante Laura Loomer has called for the firing of transgender government employees, including one she described on X as a “Biden holdover.” This is noteworthy because Loomer's other personnel interventions appear to have been successful; six officials were fired from the National Security Council in April, apparently at her request. Loomer's animus against gender nonconformity is so strong that she has clashed with other MAGA darlings. She recently challenged Trump's nominee for surgeon general, Casey Means, to “condemn” her own father, Grady, for having written a children's book about a flamboyant flamingo exploring its identity.

When I asked Loomer by text why she opposed trans people working in national-security roles, she replied: “Transgenderism is a mental disorder. It's important that only people of sound mind work in positions of national security. It would be reckless to appoint or allow transgenders to work at the NSC, given the fact that transgenderism is body dysmorphia, which is a mental disorder.”

Helen Lewis: The Democrats need an honest conversation on gender identity

The straightforwardly antagonistic tone in Trump's orbit represents a big shift since his first presidential campaign, when he said that North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill had gone too far and repulsed voters, and that Caitlyn Jenner, the Olympic champion and reality-TV star who'd publicly transitioned the year before, was welcome to use whichever bathroom she liked at Trump Tower.

In the second Trump term, however, gratuitous rudeness toward transgender Americans has become normalized. Representative Sarah McBride, the first openly trans member of Congress, has been repeatedly referred to by some of her fellow lawmakers as “the gentleman from Delaware” and “Mr. McBride.” No doubt the people doing this see it as a punkish political statement. To me, they just seem pointlessly rude.

My conclusion might strike some trans-rights advocates as incongruous. I have previously argued against the inclusion of biological males in women's sports and expressed skepticism of poorly evidenced treatments in youth gender medicine. I don't believe that male rapists and killers who say they are trans belong in women's jails—as California and some other jurisdictions decree. That creates an unacceptable risk to female prisoners.

But understanding that women's rights sometimes conflict with those of males who identify as women is not the same as thinking that a lot of ordinary Americans are innately predatory or degenerate just because they are transgender. Adults should have broad latitude to make decisions about their own body, yet Republicans in Congress are considering the withdrawal of Medicaid funding for all hormonal and surgical gender treatments, not just those for minors. If you're skeptical of people who put their pronouns in their email signatures, feel free to roll your eyes—We could have guessed you're a man, Steve—while understanding that the gesture might be meaningful to them. Barring federal workers from including their pronouns, as this administration has done, is just as illiberal as mandating pronoun inclusion.

Trump's actions on trans policies reflect a pattern across the administration of chaotic executive orders, inflammatory language, and counterproductive decisions. European reviews have found that American child gender-medicine practices far outstrip the available evidence for their safety and efficacy. But the Trump administration isn't helping convince the champions of puberty blockers to reconsider. When the Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a balanced, well-evidenced report suggesting caution in child gender medicine, the administration preempted its release by calling the practice “chemical and surgical mutilation.” The White House's emotive language duly gave liberals—along with the medical associations who were criticized by the report—permission to ignore the findings.

Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won't end there

Even policies that may be defensible in substance have been carried out with a level of haste that seems vindictive. In January, Trump issued an executive order declaring that there are only two sexes, and that they are fixed at birth. (Most Americans agree with these statements.) Yet the consequences of this executive order have been to throw trans Americans' legal status into confusion: In February, the Euphoria star Hunter Schafer, a trans woman, revealed that her passport had been returned to her with the sex marker changed to “Male.” No support or explanation has been provided for people who have to navigate what this might mean for their travel abroad.

Trump has also said that any athletes who have changed their legal documents from their birth sex will not be allowed into the United States to compete in the 2028 Olympics. More than that, such athletes could receive a lifetime visa ban—even though their home country might well recognize their legal gender. “America categorically rejects transgender lunacy,” Trump said in February—hardly the kind of language that will convince liberals that his primary interest is fair competition in women's sports.

Overall, these are the actions of an administration that wants to keep waging a polarized fight against a vilified enemy, not broker sensitive compromises that respect the dignity of a minority group. The same pattern is obvious in the scrapping of several grants by the National Institutes of Health whose abstracts used the word transgender. We need more research on gender-related medical treatments, for the simple reason that thousands of Americans have already been given them, with too little attention to their long-term outcomes. We don't need grant refusals so haphazard that you suspect that a 20-something coder has done a keyword search and defunded entire studies as a result. If artificial hormones are dangerous, as some MAGA influencers contend, why would the government cancel grants dedicated to studying their side effects? Similarly, the only conceivable reason to scrap an LGBTQ suicide hotline is gratuitous meanness.

The most recent Pew Research Center survey shows that 77 percent of Americans believe that discrimination against trans people exists, including 63 percent of Republican-leaning people. Waging all-out war on transgender Americans is just as out of touch with popular opinion as supporting routine mastectomies for troubled teenagers.

Helen Lewis: The push for puberty blockers got ahead of the research

One very good reason for the Democrats to retreat from their unpopular, maximalist Joe Biden–era positions on this issue is that they could then oppose the Trump administration's overtly cruel decisions. At the moment, the entire party is paralyzed about the topic, unwilling to go against its loudest activists while also reluctant to endorse those activists' demands. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, is now on the record opposing trans athletes in girls' sports, but the practice is still legal in his state—and drawing both grassroots protests and threats from Trump. “Many in the Democratic coalition share, if only among close and trusted friends, the sense that we are walking on eggshells,” Jonathan Cowan, of the advocacy group Third Way, wrote in Politico late last month, adding: “That silence is proving a political disaster.” As it stands, Democrats are neither being honest with voters that they went too far before nor opposing the Trump administration's overreach in the opposite direction.

It should be possible to express concern about trans-rights groups' most dogmatic positions without being shouted down. But that does not also mean signing up to the premise that transgender Americans are inherently unworthy of basic respect.

Under Biden, the left went too far into bad and unpopular gender-identity policies. Under Trump, the same is true of the right.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

As Donald Trump prepares to host Les Mis at the Kennedy Center, a Victor Hugo scholar imagines what the author would make of the president.

On February 7, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts suffered a presidential coup. Donald Trump filled its board of trustees with loyalists and declared himself its “amazing Chairman.” On June 11, he is set to celebrate the dawn of what he has called a “Golden Age in Arts and Culture” by attending a Kennedy Center performance of one of his favorite musicals, the globally popular adaptation of Victor Hugo's epic novel Les Misérables.

Several cast members plan to boycott the opening. Perhaps they find it strange or even disconcerting that Trump is a big fan of Les Mis. Having declared of his Kennedy Center, “It's not going to be woke,” why would he enjoy a tale in which the official victimization of society's underdogs is contrasted with the civilizing power of love, charity, and forgiveness? The term misérables can translate roughly to “the wretched,” “the dirt poor,” or even “the scum of the Earth.” The frequent Trump epithet losers would be a suitably pejorative modern equivalent. This despised underclass is pitted against a punitive regime that honors bullies, sycophants, and plutocrats. They are not the sort of people who might expect compassion and understanding from the current administration.

I find the gaudy, mass-market musical's appeal to Trump ironic but not surprising. Since it premiered on London's West End in 1985, the show, with its rousing anthems and its tear-jerking tale of victory over oppression, has thrilled more than 100 million people. We know that Trump has a weakness for bombastic 1980s musicals, and Les Mis is certainly that. Having spent four years writing a biography of Hugo, I can't help but find it a sweetened, antiseptic version of his weird, digressive underworld of moral and literal sewers. The original book would surely bamboozle and exasperate Trump if he ever undertook the journey through its 1,500 pages.

Read: America now has a minister of culture

The author himself wouldn't seem to hold much appeal for the leader of the MAGA movement. The president mentioned Hugo in 2018 at a White House dinner for Emmanuel Macron and the French delegation: “This is the divine flame, which Victor Hugo wrote that ‘evil can never wholly extinguish,' and which ‘good can make to glow with splendor.'” Trump was referring to the shared military glories of France and the United States from the American Revolution through the Second World War. In fact, the words were taken from a description of the central character of Les Misérables, destitute following his conviction for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. The narrator wonders whether Jean Valjean's soul has been destroyed, or whether an immortal “spark” (not “flame”) has survived his dehumanization by a vindictive justice system.

When Les Misérables was published in 1862, Hugo was an outcast. The founder of two distinct periods of Romanticism, he was the world's most famous living writer and an international symbol of freedom and democracy. By then, at the age of 60, he had spent 10 years in exile after opposing the coup d'état led by Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the self-crowned emperor of France who reigned as Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870.

Hugo, as a refugee in the Channel Islands, was an embarrassment to the British government. The intelligence services of France and the United Kingdom considered him a socialist menace. Spies reported his dealings with suspected immigrant terrorists. His diatribe against “Napoléon le Petit” was smuggled across the English Channel in walking sticks, sardine tins, and women's underwear. Miniature copies were concealed in souvenir plaster busts of Napoleon III.

The exiled poet was criticized for his arrogant attempts to influence British and American foreign policy. He was mocked for his poor English and his wild appearance, as he recalled in his notebooks: “To the English, I am shoking, excentric and improper”; “I oppose the death penalty, which is not respectable”; “I am an exile, which is repellent, and on the losing side, which is infamous.” I would venture to say that Hugo would not be made welcome in the Oval Office today: “I look like a workman,” he wrote, and “I fail to wear my tie in the correct fashion.”

Les Misérables is one of the last universally read masterpieces in Western literature. In its own day, it was as popular as its musical adaptation would be in the next century. In France, it was bought even by people who had never learned to read. It was devoured by soldiers in the trenches of the American Civil War. Like all great works of art, it has a mind and momentum of its own.

Read: The fame of Victor Hugo

This ostensibly simple tale contains labyrinthine complexities and contradictions. Hugo had been a monarchist in his youth and then became a moderate liberal. At the time of the 1832 revolt, which takes up almost one-fifth of Les Misérables, he was a property-owning family man firmly opposed to violent protest. “We should not allow barbarians to bespatter our flag with red,” he wrote in his diary.

The barricade at the heart of the novel and the musical is actually a scene from the savagely repressed uprising of June 1848. Hugo had just been elected to the National Assembly as a right-wing moderate. When the rioting broke out, he fought with the forces of law and order against the insurgents, whom he considered innocent but misguided. These were the starving unemployed of the Paris slums, the malodorous and degraded masses that polite society called “les misérables.” He took prisoners and was directly responsible for deaths and deportations. Tormented over his culpability, he had a crise de conscience and joined the socialist opposition to the dictatorship of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.

Hugo became the mascot and inspiration of liberation movements in Greece and Italy and throughout Central and South America, so it is fitting that the musical's opening and concluding song, “Do You Hear the People Sing?” has been chanted in this century by antigovernment protesters in China, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Belarus. Less obviously appropriate is the adoption of Les Mis by Trump and the MAGA movement.

No artistic genre is the exclusive property of one faction. As the Trump administration demonstrates, forms of moral discourse evolved by left-wing thinkers can serve the purposes of right-wing ideologues. The novel and the musical both have roots in popular 19th-century entertainment—vaudevilles, comic operas, and newspaper serials. Both were sneered at by middle-class reviewers and adored by the public. The MAGA reading of Les Misérables is just the latest example of its populist appeal. It also typifies the volatile nature of political buzzwords.

Misérables was an insult that French insurgents picked up and brandished as a banner. By the same process, after Hillary Clinton called Trump's supporters “deplorables” during the 2016 election campaign, her dismissive term inspired the digital backdrop of a Trump rally in Miami: Under the words les deplorables, a doctored image from the musical showed a crowd storming a barricade, waving the French Tricolor and the Stars and Stripes. That evening, the crowd sang a MAGA version of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” In 2025, the U.S. Army Chorus sang this appropriated anthem of popular revolt at the White House Governors Ball.

Hugo would likely have been repelled and fascinated by Trump's demagoguery, his rambling mendacity, his grammatically illogical but easy-to-follow oratory. The writer might have been reminded of Napoleon III, who hovers in the background of the novel as a sinister, clownish figure. Two significant differences are that Napoleon III had a long-standing interest in justice, and that he was never envious of Hugo's fame. After granting him and his fellow outcasts amnesty in 1859, Napoleon III lamented the great man's decision to remain in exile. In 1862, he allowed Les Misérables to be advertised and sold in France, leading his government to review its penal and industrial legislation and to concern itself with the exploitation of women and orphans, as well as the education of the poor.

Trump's attacks on universities, the arts, and free expression increase the likelihood that any future American equivalent of Les Misérables will also have to be written in exile. But none of this knotty history need spoil Chairman Trump's triumph when he sits in the royal box at the Kennedy Center and hears the people sing for his pleasure.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What creates the “relatable dude-bro” audience is organic connection, not donor checks.

Since President Donald Trump's victory last fall, Democrats have been trying to reengage with male voters, find a “Joe Rogan of the left,” and even fund a whole left-leaning “manosphere.” Young men—Rogan's core audience—were among the voting blocs that definitively moved toward the GOP in 2024, as a comprehensive postmortem by the data firm Catalist recently illustrated. In response, many powerful liberal figures have obsessively returned to the same idea: If we can't compete with their influential manosphere, why not construct our own?

One high-profile progressive group, the Speaking With American Men project, is embarking on a two-year, $20 million mission to build “year-round engagement in online and offline spaces Democrats have long ignored—investing in creators, trusted messengers, and upstream cultural content,” though its leaders say they're not looking for a liberal Rogan. Another effort, AND Media (AND being an acronym for “Achieve Narrative Dominance”), has raised $7 million and, according to The New York Times, is looking to amass many times that amount over the next four years to back voices that will break with “the current didactic, hall monitor style of Democratic politics that turns off younger audiences.”

But in recent conversations with people in all corners of Democratic politics—far-left Bernie bros, seasoned centrists of the D.C. establishment, and rising new voices in progressive media—I came away with the sense that Democrats don't have simply a podcast-dude issue, one that could be solved with fresh money, new YouTube channels, and a bunch of studio mics. The party has struggled to capitalize on Trump's second-term missteps. It has yet to settle on a unifying message or vision of the future. Given this absence, such a tactical, top-down fix as deputizing a liberal Rogan looks tempting. The big problem is: That fix is both improbable and illogical.

Read: Democrats have a man problem

The party's “podcast problem” is a microcosm of a much larger likability issue.

“We are a little bit, you know, too front-of-the-classroom,” Jon Lovett, a former Obama speechwriter and a co-host of Pod Save America, told me. In a sense, the show's production company, Crooked Media, already tested the “make your own media ecosystem” proposition: Five years after its independent founding in 2017, Crooked announced that it had received funding from an investment firm run by the Democratic megadonor George Soros. Lovett seemed less skeptical of the new initiatives than other Democrats I interviewed, but also acknowledged some limitations. “We believe how important it is to invest in progressive media,” Lovett told me. “But in the same way you can't strategize ways to be authentic, you can't buy organic support.”

The limits of this approach have already become clear. “If you're trying to identify and cultivate and create this idea of a ‘liberal Joe Rogan,' by definition, you're manufacturing something that's not authentic,” Brendan McPhillips, who served as campaign manager during John Fetterman's successful Pennsylvania Senate bid in 2022, told me. “This fucking insane goose chase that these elite donors want to pursue to create some liberal oasis of new media is just really harebrained and misguided.”

Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and other prominent voices in the existing manosphere are not inherently political and, even when they do touch politics, don't adhere to GOP or conservative orthodoxy. Although Rogan and Von did attend Trump's second inauguration, both have also been enamored with Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont; and recently, Von delivered an emotional monologue about the destruction in Gaza, drawing ire from many of his listeners on the right. In short, these guys are guided not by ideology, but by their own curiosity and gut instinct. Fluidity in belief is central to their appeal, and helps explain their cross-party success. Their audiences also blossomed over time, not after the stroke of a donor's pen.

Throughout my interviews, I heard constant lamentations over the inescapable “D.C. speak” in both Democratic politics and the left-leaning press. “Normal people aren't out here talking about and paying attention to the kind of things that tie senior Democratic strategists up in knots,” McPhillips, who lives in Philadelphia, told me. You can't read white papers and study what goes on in the states from afar, he argued; you have to be there at eye level, living among real people, talking like a real person.

What politicians have been advised to do for decades—stick to short cable-news hits, repeat the same few points over and over—are habits that today's voters find, in the words of a senior official who worked both in the Joe Biden White House and on the Kamala Harris campaign, “repulsive.” Although this person, who asked for anonymity in order to speak freely about party strategy, discounted the premise of finding a “Rogan of the left” as a fool's errand, they did say that, from now through 2028, Democrats should try to infiltrate sports-focused podcasts, paying particular attention to YouTube.

This operative has come to view the current moment less as center-left versus center-right, and more as a larger battle of institutionalists versus anti-institutionalists: “The psyche of a liberal in this moment is institution defense.” Also: fear. Too many Democrats, they believe, approach every public conversation and media interview with a level of trepidation about what they're saying—not in fear of Trump, but in fear of the wrath of their own potential voters. During her 2024 campaign, Harris reportedly feared the potential blowback within her own team from sitting down with Rogan. “There was a backlash with some of our progressive staff that didn't want her to be on” his show, Jennifer Palmieri, who advised the second gentleman Doug Emhoff, said a week after the election. (Palmieri later revised her comments.)

This year, some progressives have found a way to break through. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who's proved capable of acing a hostile Fox News interview, has now grown facial scruff and has been popping up on the podcast circuit. Several Democrats I spoke with praised both Buttigieg's recent media tour—his appearance on the brash bro show Flagrant was singled out—and Sanders's ability to win over certain manosphere hosts. “They're able to do that because they have the confidence and the skill to go on a program like that and just be themselves, and people believe what they say because they're being honest,” McPhillips told me.

On the Fighting Oligarchy Tour, and in his frequent podcast appearances, Sanders has positioned himself as an accessible and righteously angry force. Faiz Shakir, Sanders's 2020 campaign manager and now an adviser to the senator, told me that Democrats “are too far removed from organic and interesting conversations that people want to hear about, and have become too reliant on a one-way push at people about the things we want to tell them,” rather than actually listening to voters. Although he himself is a Harvard alumnus who lives and works in D.C., Shakir criticized the Democratic Party's perpetually buttoned-up ethos, the opposite of an unstructured podcast hang.

He spoke about the power of anger—the defining emotion of the past political decade—as something that many Democrats don't know how to wield effectively. “If you're angry, you're uncouth,” Shakir said. “Calm down! That's not professional!” Unless Democrats stop worrying about politely conforming to pre-Trump communication mores, he believes the chasm with voters will continue to exist, hypothetical new-media ecosystem be damned.

John Hendrickson: Jake and Logan Paul hit the limits of the manosphere

Two things can be true at the same time: Many centrist Democrats may be too timid or genteel, and lack the moxie to speak with the anger that resonates with voters. But the cause of men's alienation from liberal politics cannot be distilled simply into perceptions of gentility. Nor is voicing rage a plausible way to hack the manosphere. When it comes to podcasts—the medium of the moment—a different emotion reigns: curiosity.

Hosts such as Rogan and Von succeed across party lines not because they're indignant, but because they're inquisitive and, crucially, persuadable. Their talent is to seem real and relatable without trying. Throughout my conversations, I asked why liberals have not organically produced a figure of Rogan's magnitude and influence. No one really had an answer. But one thing became abundantly clear: No amount of strategic parsing will let Democrats fake their way through this moment. You can't buy authentic communication.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Instead of cutting services to cut costs, one rural hospital plans to thrive by offering more.

After years of trying to improve his hospital in Riverton, Wyoming—first as a doctor, then as a board member and volunteer activist—­Roger Gose was ready to give up.



Gose, a Texas native, had been in Wyoming since 1978, when he saw an ad in a medical journal looking for a small-town internist. Ever since he was a kid, he had wanted to be a community doctor, the kind who made house calls and treated his neighbors from birth into adulthood. He found his calling in Riverton, a town of 10,000 people in one of the state's poorer counties. For 35 years, he ran a private practice and worked shifts at Riverton Memorial Hospital, even serving for a time as the chief of medicine there. After retiring from his practice in 2012, he joined the hospital board, still eager to do whatever he could to help.



“You want to leave a place better than you found it,” he told me. And for a long time, he felt like he had.



But that was before LifePoint Health, one of the biggest rural-hospital chains in the country, saw his hospital as a distressed asset in need of saving through a ruthless search for efficiencies, and before executives at Apollo Global Management, a private-equity firm whose headquarters looms above the Plaza Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, began calling the shots. That was before Gose realized that, in the private-equity world, a hospital was just another widget, a tool to make money and nothing more.



In late 2018, Gose and a group of his neighbors decided that trying to save their hospital was futile. It had already lost its maternity ward, leaving pregnant people to drive nearly 30 miles to deliver a baby. Data from the Wyoming Department of Health show that the number of air-ambulance flights from the county where Riverton sits to hospitals elsewhere in the state rose from 155 in 2014 to 937 in 2019. By the time I spent several days with Gose and a dozen other Rivertonians in the spring of 2023, they didn't even have a hospital anymore, they told me; they had a “Band-Aid station.” The only way to ensure that their town had a real hospital, they decided, was to build one themselves.



The conventional wisdom about rural hospitals in the 21st century is that they are, in a word, screwed. Young people move away; older residents left behind need more expensive care and are less likely than urban and suburban residents to have private insurance, which is more lucrative for providers than Medicare and Medicaid. A 2018 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that twice as many rural hospitals closed from 2013 to 2017 than in the five years prior, and the ones that remained were in much worse financial shape than their nonrural counterparts. Emergency funding during the coronavirus pandemic improved the financial health of rural hospitals, but after that ­funding dried up, many were left facing labor shortages and supply-chain problems that increased prices. House Republicans' proposed cuts to Medicaid could drive even more hospitals out of business, the American Hospital Association argued in a letter to congressional leaders this April.



The ability to stave off closure has been the chief value proposition that private-equity firms offer to rural hospitals. In my reporting on private equity's growing dominance in health care, I heard versions of the story that LifePoint and Apollo told Riverton residents again and again: Without us, you will be left with no hospital at all. Yours is running out of money, and our ability to consolidate and find efficiencies across our ever-­growing system is the only thing that can keep it alive. Your community is too small and poor to support an obstetrics department, or general surgery, or mental-health services, so you won't have those anymore, but isn't something better than nothing?



Accepting that private equity is the only option for rural hospitals, though, requires accepting that rural Americans deserve less access to care than their urban and suburban counterparts, and that the care they do receive will be measurably worse. A landmark 2023 study found that in the three years after a private-equity acquisition, the rate of serious preventable medical complications increased significantly. (LifePoint hospitals were not included in the study, which focused on acquisitions made before 2018.) Patients were more likely to fall in the hospital and more likely to acquire infections at the site of a surgical incision. The number of central-line infections, which often result from improper insertion or cleaning, rose 38 percent. Though the study didn't delve into the reasons for the increases, the implication was clear: Focusing on short-­term profits was leading to cost cutting that could be dangerous for patients.



In Riverton, the hospital's owner was cutting costs aggressively, while also raising prices. In 2014, LifePoint formally merged the hospital with one in wealthier Lander, a town 25 miles away, and renamed them SageWest Riverton and SageWest Lander. In 2017, the year before Apollo bought LifePoint, researchers examined hospital data for 14 individual Wyoming facilities and found that SageWest charged the highest relative prices; data from 2020 show that SageWest maintained the largest price disparity of any general hospital in the state after the Apollo acquisition. (LifePoint referred questions about the Riverton and Lander hospitals to SageWest; SageWest leaders did not respond to several requests for comment.)



At the same time, the Riverton hospital was shrinking. In quick succession, SageWest suspended its obstetrics services, closed its inpatient mental-health unit, and shrank other basic services. By 2022, the last year for which Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data are available, SageWest employed 227 people across its two campuses, nearly 40 percent fewer than before the Riverton-Lander merger. According to Gose, the number of physicians based in Riverton had dwindled from 20-something to just seven.



If they were going to build a new hospital, Gose and his neighbors first needed to know whether it could theoretically be financially viable. By 2018, they had formed a nonprofit, Riverton Medical District, and one of the board members, Vivian Watkins—the former head of commercial lending for U.S. Bank's 14 branches across Wyoming, and the kind of person who can't leave the grocery store without stopping four times to ask about someone's kids or their neighborhood drama—began cold-calling hospital CEOs across Wyoming, looking for advice on where to start. One told her that she should go straight to Stroudwater Associates, a Maine-based consultancy with a specialty in rural-health-care finances.



The Riverton nonprofit was not Stroudwater Associates' typical client. The company's chairman, Eric Shell, and his team usually work directly with rural hospitals, or occasionally with a larger chain looking for system-­wide strategic planning. Gose, Watkins, and their allies didn't have a hospital, didn't have concrete plans for a hospital, didn't even have any money for a hospital. Still, Shell was intrigued by the brazenness of what they were dreaming up.



After nearly 30 years working with rural hospitals, Shell believed that rural hospitals could survive, but that too few hospital executives think creatively about solutions. Over and over, he's seen cuts damage a hospital's business further: “You win the battle, but you lose the war,” he told me. Instead of cutting costs by “doing more with less” (to use the corporate jargon for layoffs and overworking employees), making rural hospitals run in the 21st century means increasing profits by expanding a hospital's business.



One of Shell's go-­to examples is Mahaska Health in Oskaloosa, Iowa, a nonprofit hospital in a city slightly bigger than Riverton. When the pandemic hit in 2020, hospitals across the country were overwhelmed with critically ill COVID patients, but also saw a decline in other types of cases. The result was a huge, unexpected loss of revenue for many hospitals, and a correspondingly huge number of layoffs: 1.4 million health-care workers lost their jobs in April 2020 alone. At Mahaska, though, CEO Kevin DeRonde—­a former NFL linebacker—­ran in the opposite direction: He hired many of the providers who had been laid off from other area hospitals, Shell said. His hospital took a short-­term financial hit, but DeRonde wagered that patient volume would recover once the worst of the pandemic eased up.



The bet paid off. After the drop in 2020, the number of non-­COVID patients skyrocketed. Now many hospitals were understaffed, but not Mahaska. The hospital hadn't been doing well even before the pandemic, losing more than $5 million in 2017. By 2023, it made $7.5 million in net income, according to Shell and Mahaska Health officials.



Growth, though, is more difficult at hospitals owned by private-equity firms, because of the need to keep shareholders happy through quick returns. “When I look at what they're doing in Lander and Riverton, I shake my head and say, ‘That's not the way I'd be running the company,'” Shell told me. “But I'm not running the company, and they're driven by an external force. If they're not beating the market rate of compensation for their investors, their investors are going to walk.”



Shell agreed to conduct a feasibility study for Riverton Medical District, and Stroudwater spent months digging into every aspect of Riverton's economy, population, and existing health-care options. Just 44 percent of Medicare recipients in the area who needed hospital treatment got it at either Riverton or its sister hospital, leaving an opening for a new hospital to quickly capture market share. The presence of the Wind River Reservation, which surrounds Riverton, boosted the financial case: The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes, which share the reservation, both provide private insurance to their members. In June 2019, Shell's firm handed over its report. Its takeaway: The area had the ability to “support a financially viable rural health system with a range of medical, surgical, and specialty services.”



The Riverton Medical District team had the answer they wanted, from a company with real bona fides in the rural health-care world. Gose and Watkins were jubilant. They were going to build a hospital—if they could find the money, that is.



Friends and neighbors had banded together to cover the $150,000 Stroudwater study, but a whole new hospital was going to cost tens of millions.



Shell didn't think they could pull it off. He told them so outright. He's an accountant, which means always assuming the worst. He couldn't fathom why a bank or a government would give Riverton Medical District a loan, considering the competition risk. The group, though, was unanimous: Shell's fears weren't going to stop them. They were the ones who lived there; they were the ones who, in Gose's words, felt an obligation to leave Riverton better than they found it.



After months of looking into every other source of funding they could think of, Riverton Medical District turned to what the group considered the “lender of last resort”—the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the primary government funder of projects affecting rural Americans. A community hospital in an underserved rural area fit the portfolio, which could qualify Riverton Medical District for low-­interest loans.



Applying for government money, however, required navigating government bureaucracy. In an email exchange that stretched over months, the USDA rural-development regional director for Wyoming, Lorraine Werner, was encouraging but exacting. Every time Werner needed more documents, including a third-­party audit that cost an additional $50,000, the group would scramble to get them to her. Then she would ask for even more. It took Riverton Medical District more than a year to have its application accepted—­not for funding, just for consideration.



Yet somehow, Riverton residents never seemed to grow tired of what looked to many outsiders like a quixotic scheme. To house the hospital, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe agreed to sell eight acres on the north end of town and donated four more acres outright. People kept handing over money, frequently $5 or $10 at a time.



Finally, after an application process that took nearly two years, USDA announced its ruling. The federal government agreed that a new hospital in Riverton could be financially viable, committing to fund the lion's share of the costs—more than $37 million. It was the largest USDA rural-development loan ever awarded in the state of Wyoming.



The money would fund a hospital offering every routine service Rivertonians had lost. It would have 13 inpatient beds, a full surgical department, two labor-and-delivery rooms, two rooms equipped for intensive care, and space for physical and speech therapy. It would be staffed to perform surgery and deliver babies 24 hours a day. And the building would be designed to accommodate future growth, with the potential to add 11 new patient rooms, additional surgery space, and more parking, board members told me.



In its report, USDA was more bullish than Shell and Stroudwater had been; the agency's official assessment of the project barely referenced the threat of competition from the existing hospitals. Citing numbers provided by the Riverton Medical District board, USDA found that the hospital could break even with just 30 percent market share, far less than SageWest's 44 percent.



The Riverton Medical District project, evaluators wrote, had generated a remarkable level of local support; the agency noted donations from individuals and businesses that added up to more than $1 million, and more than 200 letters of support. Several of the letters said that without a new hospital, they would move out of Riverton. Multiple business owners wrote that the lack of a fully functioning hospital left them unable to recruit and retain workers. Most of the USDA report was written in bureaucracy-­speak, but at one point the author slipped into first person: “The applicant started a true grassroots movement to bring back essential services to the community and has exhibited a level of community support, both monetarily and otherwise, that is unseen in my experience.”



In December 2024, just before the soil froze for the season, work crews broke ground on Riverton's new community hospital. In early June, 400 people turned out for a community celebration, cheering for state-government officials and Riverton Medical District board members and signing a beam that will be installed into the new facility.



Building a new, locally owned hospital isn't a scalable way to help every community where hospitals owned by private-equity firms are providing less health care. The particular combination of ingredients in Riverton Medical District's recipe baked into something resembling a miracle. But to Gose's mind, following Riverton's example doesn't require building a community hospital in every rural county in the country. What it requires is people with knowledge of, and investment in, one specific community making decisions for that community—the exact opposite of the private-equity ethos of consolidation at all costs.



“Often you'll see a lot of people get excited and involved in something for two or three months or six or whatever, but then they get disillusioned and quit,” Gose told me. “And I think that's what LifePoint thought we were doing. And they underestimated that failure was not an option.”

Jay Bhattacharya, the the agency's director, has made a point of welcoming dissent. A letter from his officials will test that.

Updated at 10:26 a.m. on June 9, 2025  Since winning President Donald Trump's nomination to serve as the director of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya—a health economist and prominent COVID contrarian who advocated for reopening society in the early months of the pandemic—has pledged himself to a culture of dissent. “Dissent is the very essence of science,” Bhattacharya said at his confirmation hearing in March. “I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives and create an environment where scientists, including early-career scientists and scientists that disagree with me, can express disagreement, respectfully.”



Two months into his tenure at the agency, hundreds of NIH officials are taking Bhattacharya at his word.



More than 300 officials, from across all of the NIH's 27 institutes and centers, have signed and sent a letter to Bhattacharya that condemns the changes that have thrown the agency into chaos in recent months—and calls on their director to reverse some of the most damaging shifts. Since January, the agency has been forced by Trump officials to fire thousands of its workers and rescind or withhold funding from thousands of research projects. Tomorrow, Bhattacharya is set to appear before a Senate appropriations subcommittee to discuss a proposed $18 billion slash to the NIH budget—about 40 percent of the agency's current allocation.



The letter, titled the Bethesda Declaration (a reference to the NIH's location in Bethesda, Maryland), is modeled after the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter published by Bhattacharya and two of his colleagues in October 2020 that criticized “the prevailing COVID-19 policies” and argued that it was safe—even beneficial—for most people to resume life as normal. The approach that the Great Barrington Declaration laid out was, at the time, widely denounced by public-health experts, including the World Health Organization and then–NIH director Francis Collins, as dangerous and scientifically unsound. The allusion in the NIH letter, officials told me, isn't meant glibly: “We hoped he might see himself in us as we were putting those concerns forward,” Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and one of the letter's organizers, told me.



None of the NIH officials I spoke with for this story could recall another time in their agency's history when staff have spoken out so publicly against a director. But none of them could recall, either, ever seeing the NIH so aggressively jolted away from its core mission. “It was time enough for us to speak out,” Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the National Cancer Institute, who has signed her name to the letter, told me. To preserve American research, government scientists—typically focused on scrutinizing and funding the projects most likely to advance the public's health—are now instead trying to persuade their agency's director to help them win a political fight with the White House.



In an emailed statement, Bhattacharya said, “The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.” A spokesperson for HHS also defended the policies the letter critiqued, arguing that the NIH is “working to remove ideological influence from the scientific process” and “enhancing the transparency, rigor, and reproducibility of NIH-funded research.”

The agency spends most of its nearly $48 billion budget powering science: It is the world's single-largest public funder of biomedical research. But since January, the NIH has canceled thousands of grants—originally awarded on the basis of merit—for political reasons: supporting DEI programming, having ties to universities that the administration has accused of anti-Semitism, sending resources to research initiatives in other countries, advancing scientific fields that Trump officials have deemed wasteful.



Prior to 2025, grant cancellations were virtually unheard-of. But one official at the agency, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional repercussions, told me that staff there now spend nearly as much time terminating grants as awarding them. And the few prominent projects that the agency has since been directed to fund appear either to be geared toward confirming the administration's biases on specific health conditions, or to benefit NIH leaders. “We're just becoming a weapon of the state,” another official, who signed their name anonymously to the letter, told me. “They're using grants as a lever to punish institutions and academia, and to censor and stifle science.”



NIH officials have tried to voice their concerns in other ways. At internal meetings, leaders of the agency's institutes and centers have questioned major grant-making policy shifts. Some prominent officials have resigned. Current and former NIH staffers have been holding weekly vigils in Bethesda, commemorating, in the words of the organizers, “the lives and knowledge lost through NIH cuts.” (Attendees are encouraged to wear black.)



But these efforts have done little to slow the torrent of changes at the agency. Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the NIH and one of the letter's signers, told me that the NIH fellows union, which he is part of, has sent Bhattacharya repeated requests to engage in discussion since his first week at the NIH. “All of those have been ignored,” Morgan said. By formalizing their objections and signing their names to them, officials told me, they hope that Bhattacharya will finally feel compelled to respond. (To add to the public pressure, Jeremy Berg, who led the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences until 2011, is also organizing a public letter of support for the Bethesda Declaration, in partnership with Stand Up for Science, which has organized rallies in support of research.)



Scientists elsewhere at HHS, which oversees the NIH, have become unusually public in defying political leadership, too. Last month, after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—in a bizarre departure from precedent—announced on social media that he was sidestepping his own agency, the CDC, and purging COVID shots from the childhood-immunization schedule, CDC officials chose to retain the vaccines in their recommendations, under the condition of shared decision making with a health-care provider.



Many signers of the Bethesda letter are hopeful that Bhattacharya, “as a scientist, has some of the same values as us,” Benjamin Feldman, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told me. Perhaps, with his academic credentials and commitment to evidence, he'll be willing to aid in the pushback against the administration's overall attacks on science, and defend the agency's ability to power research.



But other officials I spoke with weren't so optimistic. Many at the NIH now feel they work in a “culture of fear,” Norton said. Since January, NIH officials have told me that they have been screamed at and bullied by HHS personnel pushing for policy changes; some of the NIH leaders who have been most outspoken against leadership have also been forcibly reassigned to irrelevant positions. At one point, Norton said, after she fought for a program focused on researcher diversity, some members of NIH leadership came to her office and cautioned her that they didn't want to see her on the next list of mass firings. (In conversations with me, all of the named officials I spoke with emphasized that they were speaking in their personal capacity, and not for the NIH.)



Bhattacharya, who took over only two months ago, hasn't been the Trump appointee driving most of the decisions affecting the NIH—and therefore might not have the power to reverse or overrule them. HHS officials have pressured agency leadership to defy court orders, as I've reported; mass cullings of grants have been overseen by DOGE. And as much as Bhattacharya might welcome dissent, he so far seems unmoved by it.



In early May, Berg emailed Bhattacharya to express alarm over the NIH's severe slowdown in grant making, and to remind him of his responsibilities as director to responsibly shepherd the funds Congress had appropriated to the agency. The next morning, according to the exchange shared with me by Berg, Bhattacharya replied saying that, “contrary to the assertion you make in the letter,” his job was to ensure that the NIH's money would be spent on projects that advance American health, rather than “on ideological boondoggles and on dangerous research.” And at a recent NIH town hall, Bhattacharya dismissed one staffer's concerns that the Trump administration was purging the identifying variable of gender from scientific research. (Years of evidence back its use.) He echoed, instead, the Trump talking point that “sex is a very cleanly defined variable,” and argued that gender shouldn't be included as “a routine question in order to make an ideological point.”

 The officials I spoke with had few clear plans for what to do if their letter goes unheeded by leadership. Inside the agency, most see few levers left to pull. At the town hall, Bhattacharya also endorsed the highly contentious notion that human research started the pandemic—and noted that NIH-funded science, specifically, might have been to blame. When dozens of staffers stood and left the auditorium in protest, prompting applause that interrupted Bhattacharya, he simply smiled. “It's nice to have free speech,” he said, before carrying right on.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If passed, President Donald Trump's signature legislation would make college more expensive.

by  Abdallah Fayyad

If the “big, beautiful bill,” President Donald Trump's signature legislative priority, eventually becomes law, it would gut some social programs that many people rely on. As my colleague Dylan Scott wrote in a thorough explainer, the package, which House Republicans passed last month, could result in millions of people losing their health care because of proposed work requirements on Medicaid.

There's also another part of the bill that really stands out when it comes to how Trump's domestic policy package will hurt low-income families: its overhaul of student loan programs. From changing eligibility requirements for Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college, to capping how much money students can borrow to cover the cost of tuition, the legislation would put a college education further out of reach for many Americans.

A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad.

These cuts aren't inevitable. The bill still has to pass through the Senate through an expedited process called reconciliation before Trump can sign it into law, and the unfolding (and very public) drama between the president and Elon Musk over the bill makes it unclear how congressional Republicans will proceed. But in the meantime, here's what's at stake:

According to the liberal think tank New America, the lack of publicly available data makes it difficult (or impossible) to analyze the full projected impact of the bill, but numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) show that more than half of Pell Grant recipients would see a reduction in aid, and at least 10 percent would lose their grants altogether. 

That's mainly because of how the bill changes eligibility requirements for Pell Grant recipients. The biggest change would be the number of course credits students have to take in order to remain eligible for the amount of aid they currently get. To receive the maximum Pell Grant of $7,395, students would have to take 30 credit hours each year, up from 24. The number of credits for part-time students would go up from 12 to 15. The bill also eliminates eligibility for students who are considered less than half-time students. 

These grants are crucial in helping students from low-income families attend college. In the 2023–2024 academic year, around 6.5 million students received a Pell grant. According to the Washington Post, the vast majority of Pell Grant recipients come from families making less than $60,000 a year, with about two-thirds coming from families earning less than $30,000. Because Pell Grants aren't loans and don't need to be paid back, they make college more affordable to students who otherwise might not be able to access an education beyond their high school diploma. Undermining these grants would ultimately make college — and a future with higher earning potential — out of reach for too many people living in poverty. 

While proponents of the bill might argue that the eligibility changes would simply require students to focus more of their time on school, the reality is that many students — especially part-timers — have other responsibilities, including jobs and family, and are unlikely to be able to take on more course work. As a result, the cuts to Pell Grants will likely hurt students who need it most.

The proposed changes are especially worrisome for community colleges, where many part-time students who stand to see their grants reduced are enrolled. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, some 400,000 Pell Grant recipients who attend community colleges might see their aid entirely eliminated. 

It's not just Pell Grants that Republicans are targeting with the big, beautiful bill. If the legislation becomes law, students from low- and middle-income families might also see the cost of college actually increase. The bill proposes to eliminate subsidized loans, which don't accrue interest while students are in school. 

The bill also imposes a lifetime cap on how much students can borrow, including a limit based on the median cost of a given program. And while capping how much money people can borrow is generally a good idea because higher amounts of debt can drag people down, the proposed limits don't account for varying costs by state or university. Professional programs, including medical school, would be especially difficult to finance, which is why some have been warning that the bill could worsen America's doctor shortage. 

Another way these cuts might make college more expensive is that students might turn to private lenders with higher interest rates. As Julie Margetta Morgan, the president of the Century Foundation, recently told me, “It's not only cutting Pell Grants and the affordability of student loan programs in order to fund tax cuts to the wealthy, but it's also creating a gap where [private lenders] are all too happy to come in.”

So while Musk and Trump argue (at least in part) over whether this bill is cutting enough spending, the reality is the legislation as proposed would already be devastating for many families. And just like the proposed Medicaid cuts, the provisions involving student loans make it clear that the bill's burden will fall on some of the country's most vulnerable people.

Here are the numbers behind the bill behind Trump's breakup with Elon Musk.

by  Nicole Narea

The fight over President Donald Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill is turning ugly.

After passing the GOP-controlled House, the bill has moved to the Senate, where Republicans are facing a bitter divide over how to balance their competing priorities.

They want to extend and expand Trump's tax cuts, which disproportionately benefit the rich and come at a steep price tag, as well as bolster immigration enforcement and defense spending. However, some are reluctant to do so while increasing the national debt by almost $2.6 trillion and slashing Medicaid benefits. 

Republicans want to pass the bill by July 4 through a complex process known as budget reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes to pass. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, but it's unclear whether they will be able to resolve their disagreements in time.

Some Republican senators, including Ron Johnson (R-WI.) and Rand Paul (R-KY), have criticized the current version of the bill as unreasonable. Trump megadonor (and newly sworn enemy) Elon Musk has called on lawmakers to rework the legislation, which he dubbed a “disgusting abomination.” 

”Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,” Musk said in a post on X Wednesday.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that Musk is “flat wrong” about the bill and that there is not enough time to go back to the drawing board.

So, what exactly is in the bill, and what does it mean — for the deficit and for Americans? We break it down, in charts.

This spending bill is expensive, and short of truly drastic cuts to nearly all social programs (and perhaps not even with such cuts), it's not clear that the government could feasibly pass it without increasing the national debt. 

The version that passed the House would raise the deficit by trillions of dollars over the next decade, not accounting for the potential effects the bill would have on the US economy. That spending is concentrated between 2025 and 2028, coinciding with the next presidential election.

Republicans once campaigned against raising the national debt during the Obama administration, framing it as a national security threat and a burden to future generations. But it's no longer the rallying cry it once was. 

There are reasons to be concerned about a growing national debt. As my colleague Dylan Matthews writes, the bond market is already bristling at the prospect of such a significant increase in the deficit, a warning of potential economic downturn or even further increasing debt due to higher servicing costs if the bill becomes law. 

Trump wants to build on the tax cuts he passed during his first term. They are set to expire this year if Congress does not act, and the spending bill would keep them in place. It would also add some new ones, including the elimination of taxes on tips.

That is going to cost the US government. A breakdown of the bill's budgetary effects published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shows that the House Ways and Means Committee, which presides over tax policy, would be permitted to contribute an additional $3.8 trillion to the deficit — far more than any other House committee. That's at least in part because tax revenue would be lower under the bill. 

Meanwhile, the Armed Services and Homeland Security committees are the only others where Trump is seeking significant increases in spending as he seeks to deliver on his campaign promise of “mass deportations” with assistance from the military.

Any spending cuts in other areas aren't nearly enough to counterbalance the resulting increase in the US deficit. That would likely require Republicans to slash public benefits even further than they already have in this bill. While they haven't gone so far as to touch Social Security benefits, they have gone after Medicaid and insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans have also included measures in the bill that would greatly increase the number of people without health insurance, according to a CBO estimate.

One provision allows enhanced premium tax credits for ACA insurance plans to lapse, which would increase premiums for millions of Americans who rely on them. 

After the Covid-19 stimulus bill was signed in 2021, these tax credits became available to anyone whose premiums were over 8.5 percent of their household income — not just people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line. Enrollment in ACA plans subsequently doubled to 24.3 million people between 2020 and 2025.

The House bill would allow those expanded tax credits to expire this year, effectively driving people out of the ACA marketplaces with higher costs.

Another provision would significantly decrease Medicaid enrollment by creating a work requirement for people under the age of 64 who do not have a dependent under 7 years old.

While not directly slashing Medicaid benefits, the work requirement would create additional barriers to Medicaid access, including administrative hurdles that could result in lower enrollment even among people who do work. (It's worth noting that most nondisabled Medicaid recipients already work.)

Some states have already implemented similar work requirements with disappointing results. Arkansas and Georgia saw Medicaid enrollments plummet thereafter, with a court eventually overturning the Arkansas requirements on the basis that they violated federal Medicaid law.

Under the tax cuts passed by Trump during his first term, the top 1 percent of earners saw the most significant gains, both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of their incomes.

This time is no different. Top earners will again profit significantly from the House spending bill, according to the CBO. The lowest earners, meanwhile, will see their household resources shrink, primarily due to reduced access to public benefits programs such as Medicaid and SNAP and higher ACA insurance premiums. 

The House bill advances numerous provisions targeting immigrants and undermining their US-citizen relatives, from restricting access to public benefits for families in which at least one person is undocumented to imposing new fees on asylum-seekers. However, there is one that would have a sizable impact well beyond America's borders: a new tax on remittances, the payments that immigrants typically send to their families in their home countries. 

The US is the largest source of remittances worldwide. Some of the top receiving countries include America's neighbors in Central and South America — countries that have produced high numbers of migrants in recent years.

That's significant because remittances have historically accounted for much larger sums than any foreign aid provided by the US and represent efficient, direct payments to individuals who can spend that money on what they need, mitigating economic incentives for them to migrate.

Now that the Trump administration has reduced foreign aid, remittances are more crucial than ever; however, their sums may be decreasing with new taxes.

What is “coercive control”?

by  Aja Romano

Among all the lurid details and allegations that have surfaced in Sean “Diddy” Combs's trial on federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, one potential aspect of the music mogul's relationships has flown under the radar. 

What we haven't heard on the witness stand is a concept crucial to understanding intimate partner violence and how individual incidents can form a pattern of abuse over time. That pattern, described by sociologists as “coercive control,” may have played a major role in Diddy's relationships — but it won't play a major role in the trial. 

Generally speaking, “coercive control” is a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse over time. It is criminalized in the UK, and seven states have passed laws that say coercive control is a form of domestic violence, though how they're applied varies by state. US courts have been slow to adopt the concept, and Judge Arun Subramanian, overseeing Combs's trial in New York City's federal district court, blocked the prosecution's expert on domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV), from testifying specifically about coercive control. 

That leaves the prosecution and all witnesses walking a very interesting line in their presentation of the evidence against Combs, who has pleaded not guilty. While “coercive control” isn't a widely recognized legal concept in the US, “coercion” as an individual act is. Typically described in the US legal code as being compelled, forced, or threatened to act in a specific way, it's a crucial pillar of several of the legal charges being brought against Combs. 

Additionally, if the jury can't hear testimony about the impact of long-term abuse and toxic environments on survivors over time, will they be able to understand why so many of the people testifying against Combs now spent years, even decades, working for him and/or entertaining positive relationships with him?

The case serves as a reminder that, despite having been known to IPV prevention researchers for decades, “coercive control” is still a little-known term to the public. While it's an important concept for expanding how we think about intimate partner abuse beyond acts of physical violence, some experts say its highly murky legal status is warranted. 

That ambiguity, however, makes it hard to talk about ways an alleged abuser might exert control over survivors that aren't always obvious. Many of those methods have surfaced in the Combs trial. That gives us a major opportunity to understand what coercive control is — and the ways in which it's being tried and tested in court.

The term “coercive control,” reportedly first coined and promoted by the late social worker Susan Schechter, has existed in the fields of domestic violence prevention and feminist circles since the '80s. “There is no single word to describe the full range of controlling behavior,” Schechter and her co-author Ann Jones wrote in their 1993 book When Love Goes Wrong in a section indexed as “coercive control.” 

They write that many controlling abusers “never use force” and note controlling behaviors, such as “deliberately throwing a partner into mental confusion and anxiety, and tearing a partner down emotionally.”

If you or anyone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence (IPV), there are people who want to help.

Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 (or text BEGIN to 88788).

Since the late 20th century, the phrase “battered woman syndrome” has been used in court to describe the psychological effects of IPV on women, which can include trauma and cognitive defects. While still in wide use in courtrooms as a legal defense, the concept has long been a source of debate, with many experts framing it as part of general PTSD or using the gender-neutral phrase “battering and its effects” instead. Legal advocates have argued for decades for a better descriptor, one that emphasizes nonphysical forms of abuse as well as physical abuse. 

Enter “coercive control.” Experts like Schechter and the late Evan Stark have helped mainstream the phrase as an alternative concept, one that more clearly acknowledges the ways abusive partners often use nonviolent abusive tactics, such as emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, threats, and unpredictable behavior, to influence and control their situations. Research has shown that coercive control is present in up to 58 percent of relationships where IPV occurs, and even nonviolent coercive control engenders PTSD, depression, and ongoing fear in survivors.

Understanding that such patterns exist helps us understand intimate partner violence, especially in answering questions like “why didn't the victim just leave?” when “just leaving” is not so simple. But because coercive control is coercive, and coercion is often hard to pin down, it's also a somewhat slippery legal concept. There's not much precedent in the US court system for a discussion of coercive control as an ongoing pattern of abuse. There's also debate among experts about whether trying to codify it is ultimately helpful or harmful — manipulation and gaslighting can be harder to identify than physical abuse or explicit threats as well as easier for abusers to turn around and use to accuse their victims. 

The charges against Combs are a bit tricky, which isn't unusual for a racketeering case. Combs is charged with two counts of sex trafficking, two counts of transporting people across state lines for sex work, and one count of “racketeering conspiracy,” which is a broader charge than racketeering itself and merely requires the guilty party to have agreed to participate in any of a litany of crimes that fall under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization ACT, commonly known as RICO laws. 

In this case, those alleged crimes include forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, sex trafficking, and obstruction of justice — all acts that witnesses have testified to having seen Diddy commit or experienced themselves while with him. 

In all three charges, the legal concept of coercion plays a major role. It's part of the criteria that must be met to prove illegal sex trafficking: Per the federal statute under which Combs is charged, any use of “force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion” to induce people to engage in sex work violates the law. Similar wording and logic apply to the transportation charge. If Combs used coercion to get people to travel across state lines for the purposes of sex work, he could be guilty. 

But an understanding of coercion can be very different based on different contexts. In the case of this trial, Judge Subramanian seems to be allowing discussion related to alleged individual moments of actual physical coercion, violent coercion, or the implied threat of physical harm to a target or others close to them. 

The prosecution's domestic violence expert, clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes, was able to discuss elements of IPV on the witness stand, such as trauma bonding and reasons why survivors stay with their abusers — but she was prohibited from discussing how long-term coercive control can impact them and their reasoning.

“There's so much physical violence in this case, and I think it's easy to extrapolate how fear of physical violence could coerce somebody into making choices,” Courtney Cross, who runs a law clinic for abuse and IPV survivors at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, told me. “But coercive control itself as a dynamic is way less about the physical violence and so much more about that web of nonphysical tactics of abuse.” 

Since testimony in the case kicked off May 12, we've already heard plenty of evidence pointing to physical coercion or the threat of it. Combs's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, played an inadvertent role in jump-starting the federal investigation into Combs when 2016 surveillance footage surfaced in 2023 showing Combs violently beating her in a hotel hallway. 

Ventura testified over several days on the witness stand that during their 11-year relationship, Combs frequently physically assaulted her, threatened her with violence, and dangled the possibility of leaking filmed sex footage of her to the public (which might be considered “revenge porn” or a form of image-based abuse). Multiple witnesses have corroborated Ventura's testimony with their own accounts of having seen or heard Combs abuse Ventura. Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura's, testified that Combs once threatened her in Ventura's 17th-story apartment by hoisting her to the balcony ledge. After yelling at her, he allegedly threw her into the balcony furniture, causing wounds and bruises to her legs.

What's perhaps even more striking, however, is the bigger picture that emerges from all of this witness testimony: an environment, in both Combs's working relationships and his intimate ones, of fear, paranoia, and unpredictable outbursts of temper. 

One longtime staffer, Capricorn Clark, testified that Combs issued a death threat to her on the first day she worked for him, physically assaulted her, and at one point kidnapped her, forcing her to come with him to track down Ventura's boyfriend. (The boyfriend was musician Kid Cudi, whose Porsche Combs is also accused of firebombing.) She as well as another former staffer have each testified to having been required to take polygraph tests by Combs to keep their jobs. 

Another former staffer, testifying under the pseudonym Mia, recounted being pressured to reside mainly with Combs at his residences, where she said she was then not permitted to lock her bedroom door or leave the property. At one point, she alleged on the stand, Combs began a pattern of intermittently sexually assaulting her over the eight years she worked for him.

The physical abuses that Combs allegedly inflicted are covered in the trial and are on their own horrific enough. But what's left unexplained is the mental and emotional anguish that a pattern of coercive control creates. Having rules about where and how to live, the implicit invasion of privacy that comes with a forced polygraph test or not being allowed to lock a door; these things could add up to a sense that a person does not have agency over their own life. 

All of these moments arguably create a pattern of abuse and manipulation by Combs — the hallmarks of coercive control that the witnesses seem to have lived with and experienced, even if they can't refer to it by name in the courtroom. 

So far, the only area of the legal system where coercive control has made inroads is the family court system — and the few states that do have laws on the books often have harrowing stories that put them there. 

Take Jennifer's Law, for instance, the 2021 Connecticut law criminalizing coercive control. It was named in part for Jennifer Magnano, a mother of three who was shot and killed in 2007 by her estranged husband. The murder occurred shortly after a judge ordered Magnano, who had fled the state, to return with her kids for a custody hearing, ignoring her claims of having experienced over a decade of abuse. The Connecticut law now defines coercive control and increases protections for people experiencing it while ensuring they don't have to testify in person before someone they are being protected against.

Yet even with these stiffer types of legal protections in place, problems abound. To someone experiencing coercive control, it's often the nonphysical meanings of “coerce” that can exert the most power and have the longest-lasting psychological effects. But courts may fail to recognize highly individualized acts of coercion because they're looking for signs of physical violence or threats. 

Additionally, just as abusers often use DARVO tactics (in which an abuser paints themselves as the wronged party using a strategy of “deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender”) to get authorities on their sides, coercive control patterns can be used against survivors in similar ways. Abuse victims can and often do react to their abusers with self-defense, or reactive violence. Their abusers will often use this reactivity to their advantage with authorities, rendering abuse victims vulnerable to being targeted by the same laws put in place to protect them. Think of it like a zero-tolerance policy in a school that punishes the bully and their victim equally without questioning who has the power and who is the target of abuse.

Cross has argued against passing laws criminalizing coercive control in favor of expanding resources to empower survivors who are trying to escape abusive situations. She points out that, unlike the UK, the US lacks a system of robust resources, rigorous risk assessment, and training around the issue that could help authorities identify it when they see it — and seeing it at all is the first challenge.

“You would need professionals to be able to see it differently in different people and validate that and understand how to respond to that,” Cross said. Rather than the courts trying to address coercive control after it's already established as a pattern, Cross explained what we need is “a wholesale societal reorganization to be able to take care of people.” 

And most of all, what we need is money. 

“People are trying really hard to meet this massive demand, but there aren't nearly enough supportive resources for anybody, including DV survivors, especially the most marginal DV survivors,” she said.

One thing that makes coercive control particularly complicated, Cross said, “is that to recognize and respond to it, we have to see it in ourselves” — and culturally, many of the traits that often comprise an abusive personality begin as highly lauded attributes, such as confidence, forcefulness, or invulnerability.

“We don't want to see that sometimes we do shitty and manipulative things and that maybe that crosses a line,” Cross said. “We don't want to see that we may have and take advantage of power differentials with our partners and people we love. I think to really understand coercive control, we have to be willing to look inside of ourselves, and people don't want to do that.” 

Cross pointed out that while coercive control isn't under discussion on the witness stand, it is on full display throughout the Diddy trial itself. 

“There is such an obvious analogy to me between the idea of this enterprise and the way that it relies on power and control and using fear to regulate and enforce the enterprise,” she said. “It may not be fraud, extortion, and bribery per se, but the emotional and psychological abuse amounts to a pretty similar outcome on an interpersonal level.” 

Essentially, organized crime and similar organized illegal systems exert pressure on their members, at scale, that resembles coercive control. While this context may not be made explicit in court, it's hard to ignore the similarities — and harder to ignore the possibility that this approach to relationships may have helped Combs hide in plain sight all along.

Tuskegee University's president explains how he's approaching this Trump administration.

by  Avishay Artsy and  Jonquilyn Hill

Universities are having a tough time under the second Trump administration.

From elite private schools like Harvard and Columbia to state schools and community colleges, the nation's institutions of higher learning are on high alert about cuts to federal funding and grants and even, in the case of Columbia, threats of stripping the university's accreditation status.

Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are no exception. These approximately 107 schools — public and private schools, big research institutions, and small liberal arts colleges — make up only 3 percent of the country's colleges and universities, but they enroll 10 percent of all Black students and produce almost 20 percent of all Black graduates.

President Donald Trump pledged “to promote excellence and innovation” at HBCUs in an April executive order, as he did in his first term. But soon after issuing his executive order, the White House announced funding cuts to Howard University, the nation's second-ranked HBCU.

Against the backdrop of the Trump administration's assault on the Department of Education and diversity initiatives across the government (and private sector), the move has prompted concern among many Black academic leaders about the sustainability of their schools.

Mark Brown, president of Tuskegee University in Alabama, joined Today, Explained guest host Jonquilyn Hill to share his perspective on how Black universities — especially those in Republican-controlled states — can navigate the uncertainty of this administration.

The university was founded by Booker T. Washington in 1881. US News & World Report ranked it No. 3 among HBCUs overall, tied with Florida A&M University.

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

In his first term, Trump touted his support of HBCUs. This term, he's been leading the crusade against DEI practices and cutting federal funding to education. Do things feel dramatically different for you in terms of policy on HBCUs this time around?

So you used the term “feel.” Some measurable things would be the White House initiative on HBCUs. We've not seen all of the execution of that, but that's where I think you'll find measurable results. The president has publicly said, as has the secretary of education, that they are supportive of historically Black colleges and universities.

We have done quite a bit to make sure everybody understands something. HBCUs are not diversity, equity, and inclusion universities, nor have we ever been. We are merit-based schools. Anybody can apply to come to Tuskegee, and if they qualify, they can come. And so it is confusion if we are associated with the pattern of diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

Having said that, if someone wrote in the federal government a grant, and that grant said that we are specifically looking at a particular subgroup under the category of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the decision is that across not just HBCUs but the educational spectrum, those grants have to be pulled back, then HBCUs would be impacted. 

Let me give you an example. We have work that we do with University of Alabama at Birmingham. And it is on cancer research — cervical, prostate, those kinds of cancers, specifically. It deals with the genealogy of it. In other words, the grant provides the payroll, or a good portion of the payroll, so that we can hire the best researchers to come to Tuskegee and do that research using samples. And it's important because the morbidity rates of certain cancers are far greater in our region and our area than they are in others. 

So if the person writing the grant specifically targeted an area under the category DEI, It wouldn't matter if we were UAB, which is a PWI [predominantly white institution], or if you're the partner, Tuskegee, on the other end. If you had that broad category swath, you would impact us both, and it does. 

I want to make sure — is it a matter of policy, or is it a matter of just pure confusion? We have to work all of that out. 

Is there a consensus among Black academic leaders right now? Are you at all anxious about the future of HBCUs? Or are you feeling more optimistic because of Trump's statements of support right now?

Let me reframe it in my way of looking at this. Here's what people in higher education ought to be concerned about, and I believe they are. There is a budget, and the House of Representatives has submitted it to the Senate for action. There are reductions in things like [student] loans. There are reductions in the way that you use Pell Grants — people who would be eligible, income levels, those kinds of things. There are policies like risk sharing as it relates to defaulted loans over time that ought to concern schools that service students in need. 

And here's what I mean: Nine out of 10 students at historically Black colleges and universities have some form of federally assisted financial aid. Access to education will be impacted by that legislation. Anybody paying attention, though, would be concerned. 

But I want to be careful about one thing. What is the issue? Is the issue that we're at HBCUs? Or is the issue poverty? In other words, I want to make sure we frame it the right way. Because if I'm at Georgia Tech, depending on a Pell Grant and a Parent PLUS loan to go to grad school to get a doctorate in engineering, I'm just as impacted if I'm down here trying to get a doctorate in engineering at Tuskegee. 

Like you said, most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or some form of federal aid. What happens if access to those resources changes? What happens to the students? What happens to the universities?

Here's what happens. In 2011, the policy was to change access to what we typically call the Parent PLUS loan across the country, not just to any particular demographic — 3 to 4 percent immediate reduction in enrollment across HBCUs. Access went down. That's evidence. At the same time, across the country, enrollment went up. I'm not saying it was targeted. I'm talking about the outcome. 

So if you reduce access to those programs, you're going to reduce access to students' ability to go to college. And I'll take that just a little bit further. So, how do we fill the gap?

One way is to get an endowed scholarship. The wealth of a university is based on the endowment to some degree. If you take the HBCU endowments, and you add them all up — all of 'em — you will have less of an endowment than if you added up Brown University. 

Now this is not a criticism. I'm happy for the students at Brown University. I'm just trying to tell you the difference in the wealth that makes the impact far greater for a portion of society.

A lot of HBCUs, including yours, are in states where Republicans hold the purse strings. I'm curious how you navigate that.

Education is politically neutral. I believe that. Education should be politically neutral, and I think statesmen would see it that way. 

Here is my point. We produce chemical engineers. We produce electrical engineers. We have an aviation science program. The nation is short on aviators. The plane doesn't know if you're Republican or Democrat. The plane just knows that a qualified person has filled that need, which has an economic impact to this state.

I take what you mean that a lot of this education stuff should be neutral, should be gender-neutral, should be race-neutral. But I often wonder if it is that way in practice. The disparities come from somewhere. I wonder how you navigate that.

I navigate that by making sure the framework of our discussions are the same: What is the economic impact of our state? Because I can have that discussion with anybody. The way you navigate this is in capability — capability, outcome, and performance. That is what I want to drill into everybody at Tuskegee University. Did the student get an internship? Did they get experience? Did they graduate?

Dr. Brown, you strike me as — I think a word I would use to describe you is very pragmatic, the way you approach things. And I think a lot of higher education institutions are trying to figure out the best approach to securing funds under this particular presidential administration. How do you think about these things and approach it?

I would suggest, the approach we ought take with this administration, any other administration, is that we are an economic engine that creates social and economic mobility for this country. And we take greater risk in doing so, and that should be recognized. That's the approach that we take. 

And I don't think the approach is unique to Tuskegee, you know. I could say that my friends in Huntsville, Alabama, are doing the same thing, at Alabama A&M. My friends at the Morehouse School of Medicine — everybody should want the Morehouse School of Medicine to be successful. Everybody should want the Howard University School of Medicine to be a success. Everybody should want Claflin to be successful, not just South Carolinians, but everybody. 

I think we live in a great country that can be greater just like any other country, but we're a part of it. And we're part of the greatness. And so HBCUs are a part of the greatness. And I think we need to continue to make sure everybody understands that.

The rules don't apply to Trump on the Court's “shadow docket.”

by  Ian Millhiser

On Friday, the Supreme Court handed down a brief order permitting the Department of Government Efficiency, the enigmatic White House entity that billionaire Elon Musk previously ran, to access a wide range of sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration — including many individuals' bank account numbers and medical records. All three of the Court's Democrats dissented from the Court's order in Social Security Administration v. AFSCME.

Realistically, it was always likely that the Trump administration would eventually prevail in this case. As Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues in the administration's brief, the plaintiffs in AFSCME “do not contend that their information has been shared with parties outside the government.” Rather, this case boils down to whether the courts can second-guess the executive branch's decisions about which government employees may see data that is already held by the government. These sorts of internal management decisions typically are not subject to judicial review.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Yet, while the result in AFSCME isn't surprising, the case reveals a schism within the Court — and it highlights how the Trump administration has managed to successfully circumvent normal court procedures to quickly get their grievances before a largely sympathetic Supreme Court.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissenting opinion primarily focuses on her concerns over the rapidity with which the Court hears Trump cases, and she argues that her Republican colleagues appear to have abandoned an important limit on the Court's authority (or, at least, that they've done so when the Trump administration asks them to prematurely get involved with a case).

The AFSCME case arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the Court decides on an unusually tight schedule, without full briefing or oral argument. Prior to the first Trump administration, the Court rarely granted requests for shadow docket relief — indeed, lawyers were so discouraged from seeking shadow docket decisions that both the Bush and Obama administrations only requested it about once every other year.

That changed once President Donald Trump took office. Now, Trump's lawyers routinely approach the justices after a lower court issues a decision constraining its actions, and the justices frequently grant Trump's administration the relief it seeks — often over the dissent of the Court's Democratic minority.

But there are supposed to be rules governing when the Supreme Court may allow a litigant to bypass the normal appeals process and seek an immediate decision blocking a lower court's order. Among other things, as Jackson writes in her dissent, the government is supposed to show “that it will actually suffer concrete or irreparable harm from having to comply with the District Court's order” before it can obtain a Supreme Court decision blocking that order.

Jackson is becoming increasingly vocal about her belief that the Court should return to its prior shadow docket policy. She argues, in both her AFSCME dissent and in a similar dissent she handed down a week earlier, that her Republican colleagues have abandoned this “irreparable harm” requirement. Moreover, as she lays out in her previous dissenting opinion in Noem v. Doe, the Court took a much narrower view of its authority under the shadow docket when the Biden administration sought relief.

Moreover, the evidence laid out in Jackson's opinions suggests that her Court is applying one set of shadow docket rules to Democratic administrations and another, more favorable set of rules, to Republicans.

Prior to the first Trump administration, when a lower court ruled against someone, its order would typically remain in effect while the case was being appealed. It was possible to persuade an appeals court to suspend this order while the appeals proceeded, but appeals courts were not supposed to do so except in rare circumstances.

As the Supreme Court explained in Nken v. Holder (2009), it is not enough for a party that lost in a lower court to show that it is likely to prevail on appeal when it asks a higher court to temporarily block that lower court's decision. That party must also show that it “will be irreparably injured absent a stay.” Additionally, Nken instructs higher courts to consider whether temporarily blocking the lower court order will “substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding” or harm “the public interest.”

One reason for this “irreparably injured” requirement is that appeals courts are typically far less familiar with the details of a case than the trial court that initially decided it, especially when a party seeks emergency relief on something like the Supreme Court's shadow docket. So, if appeals courts are too eager to block lower court decisions before they fully consider the case on appeal, they are likely to hand down many wrongly decided orders.

That said, Nken recognized that it is unfair to make a litigant wait for a higher court to step in if they need immediate, time-sensitive relief to prevent them from being injured in a way that cannot be fixed by a later court decision. As Jackson writes in her Doe dissent, appeals courts are supposed to ask “whether the applicant can be made to wait until the conclusion of the litigation to vindicate their purported legal rights, or whether irreparable harm will befall the applicant in the interim such that the court must act early to stave off that damage.”

But the Supreme Court's shadow docket orders rarely even mention this irreparable harm requirement, and even when they do mention it, they typically don't explain how the Court analyzed this question. The Court's decision in Doe, which allowed Trump to strip half-a-million immigrants of their ability to live in the United States, does not mention Nken at all. The order in AFSCME quotes the Nken standard, but it does not explain why the Republican justices who joined that order believe that this standard was met.

In both cases, Jackson argues — without any rebuttal from the majority — that the Trump administration failed to show irreparable harm. In the Doe case, she points out that the administration “does not identify any specific national-security threat or foreign-policy problem that will result” if the immigrants targeted by Trump are allowed to remain in the country for a few months longer while appeals courts fully consider the issues in that case.

In the AFSCME case, it is even clearer that there is no irreparable harm. The trial court in this case found that the government “never made clear why … the DOGE Team requires unbridled access to the [personally identifiable information] of countless Americans in order to effectuate [its] responsibilities.” And when the judge asked the Trump administration to explain why DOGE needed this information right away, the government chose instead to “stand on the record in its current form.”

The Trump administration's brief to the justices in the AFSCME case devotes only a single paragraph to the question of irreparable harm, and that paragraph also doesn't explain what harm will result if the lower court's decision is not stayed. Instead, it complains that the lower court's order “impinges on the President's broad authority to direct the federal workforce, to oversee government information systems, and to require agencies to identify fraud, waste, and abuse.”

So the Trump administration, for whatever reason, chose not to even make an argument that there is irreparable harm when it brought the AFSCME case to the justices. Nevertheless, at least five of the Court's Republicans voted to block the lower court's order. (In shadow docket cases, the Court typically does not name which justices voted with the majority. So it is possible that one of the Court's six Republicans disagreed with the Court's order but chose not to make that disagreement public.)

Some justices have implicitly argued that Nken should be overruled — or, at least, that it should be modified to permit shadow docket relief in some cases where there is no irreparable harm. Concurring in Labrador v. Poe (2024), Justice Brett Kavanaugh claimed that, in many shadow docket cases, “this Court has little choice but to decide the emergency application by assessing likelihood of success on the merits.” Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined that opinion.

So Kavanaugh and Barrett, at least, have explicitly stated that there are some cases where shadow docket relief will be granted solely based on which party is likely to prevail once the case is fully litigated.

But, if you look at the Court's past behavior, it seems that the main factor determining whether Nken should be abandoned is whether the party seeking shadow docket relief is a Democrat or a Republican. In her Doe dissent, Jackson flags several cases where her Court “denied similar stay requests from federal agencies.” The primary difference between these cases and the Doe and AFSCME cases appears to be that Joe Biden was president when the Court denied these stays.

In Biden v. Texas (2022), for example, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that a Trump-appointed district judge was wrong when he ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump immigration policy that required many asylum-seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border while awaiting a hearing. But it did so after leaving that Trump judge's order in place for more than 10 months.

Similarly, in United States v. Texas (2023) the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that a Trump judge didn't even have jurisdiction to hear a case, where the judge cut off the Biden administration's authority to set enforcement priorities for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But the Court left that judge's order in place for nearly an entire year while the case was pending on appeal.

Maybe there is a nonpartisan explanation for why the Court treated Biden differently than Trump. Perhaps there were legally sound, politically neutral arguments for why Nken shouldn't apply in Doe or AFSCME. Or maybe the Republican justices have a good argument for why irreparable harm does exist in those cases — even though the Trump administration didn't even bother to argue that it exists in the AFSCME case.

But, if such an explanation exists, the Republican justices did not explain what it is. Instead, they've chosen to sit silently while Jackson levies some very serious charges against them — all while presenting evidence that strongly suggests her colleagues are rooting their shadow docket decisions in partisanship and not the law.

Trump is declaring an end to a postwar precedent.

Over the past century, US foreign policy has been guided by the notion that as a country we'd do well by doing good—that there are dividends, both moral and material, from helping our friends and neighbors. Now the administration of President Donald Trump is unraveling that philosophy with startling speed. How other branches of the American government, countries and multinational companies respond in the months and years ahead will be the defining question of at least the rest of our lives.

America's practitioners of altruistic statecraft were famous for their high-minded ideals and soaring rhetoric. “I need not tell you gentlemen that the world situation is very serious,” said Secretary of State George Marshall in 1947 to students at Harvard University, in a speech still replete with historical resonance. He was introducing the Marshall Plan, the program to rebuild the war-torn countries of Western Europe. “It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Then, the US president's global trade war tanked the price of crude and stifled transactions in the country's oil patch, which are down by more than 40% this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show.

Ukraine said its drones hit a Russian research and production facility that supplies components for missiles, as Russia unleashed a fresh barrage of air attacks overnight.

Two Ukrainian drones struck the site of an electronics developer and manufacturer in Cheboksary, which temporarily halted operations to protect employees, Oleg Nikolayev, governor of Russia's Chuvashia region that's located 1,300 km (800 miles) from the border with Ukraine, said in a Telegram post.

In this article

Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav ended his company's long relationship with the National Basketball Association. Now, he may be setting the stage to end his relationship with U.S. sports, altogether.

WBD announced Monday it's splitting itself into two companies — a concept CNBC first reported had picked up steam in April. One company, temporarily called Streaming and Studios, will consist of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max. The other, currently dubbed Global Networks, will be the rest of the company's assets: legacy cable networks, TNT Sports, digital products and free-to-air channels in Europe.

Zaslav will be the CEO of Streaming and Studios. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the current Warner Bros. Discovery Chief Financial Officer, will become the CEO of Global Networks.

The divorce raises the question of where live sports right held by TNT will land without Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming portfolio as part of the same company. 

During a conference call Monday, Zaslav said it will be up to Wiedenfels and his team to decide where they'd like to license TNT Sports programming to the Streaming and Studios business — or anyone else —in the future.

Currently, all of TNT Sports appear on HBO Max, Warner Bros. Discovery's flagship streaming service. Zaslav said U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max signups, suggesting that it may make sense for TNT Sports to consciously uncouple with the streaming service down the road.

""Inside the U.S., sports have been less critical,"" Zaslav said on a call with investors Monday. ""It's viewed, but it hasn't been a real driver for us. So it will continue to be on HBO Max, but the Global Networks business will evaluate over time where the best place for that is.""

HBO Max will continue to license sports for existing deals. Still, Wiedenfels will have options on how to monetize TNT's future streaming and digital sports rights. He could strike a licensing deal with a different media company for the live sports that appear on the Turner networks (TNT, TBS and TruTV), such as the NCAA's March Madness, the French Open, NASCAR, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.

""The U.S. sports rights will reside at the Global Networks, and its management team will determine how best to monetize the streaming and digital rights over time,"" said Wiedenfels. ""Internationally, sports will largely coexist, both on linear and streaming, as they do today.""

Or, he could decide to merge TNT Sports with another entity, such as the forthcoming Comcast spinout, Versant. Mark Lazarus, Versant's CEO, told CNBC Sport last month he was interested in bidding on sports rights to gain distribution heft with pay-TV operators. Acquiring TNT Sports could be a major step in that direction.

If Wiedenfels opts for consolidation, he will have to weigh the tax effects of selling off assets after the separation takes place. While Warner Bros. Discovery noted the split is tax-free, Wiedenfels emphasized on Monday's call that transactions could begin as soon as the separation occurs, which is expected by mid-2026.

""On the tax side, I said this earlier, I want to be absolutely clear: Once this deal closes, both companies are going to be free and clear,"" Wiedenfels said. ""There is no minimum time.""

A spokesperson for Versant did not immediately return request for comment.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC. Versant will become the parent company of CNBC when the spinout is complete.

In this article

Walmart's majority-owned fintech startup OnePay said Monday it was launching a pair of credit cards with a bank partner for customers of the world's biggest retailer.

OnePay is partnering with Synchrony, a major behind-the-scenes player in retail cards, which will issue the cards and handle underwriting decisions starting in the fall, the companies said.

OnePay, which was created by Walmart in 2021 with venture firm Ribbit Capital, will handle the customer experience for the card program through its mobile app.

Walmart had leaned on Capital One as the exclusive provider of its credit cards since 2018, but sued the bank in 2023 so that it could exit the relationship years ahead of schedule. At the time, Capital One accused Walmart of seeking to end its partnership so that it could move transactions to OnePay.

The Walmart card program had 10 million customers and roughly $8.5 billion in loans outstanding last year, when the partnership with Capital One ended, according to Fitch Ratings.

For Walmart and its fintech firm, the arrangement shows that, in seeking to quickly scale up in financial services, OnePay is opting to partner with established players rather than going it alone.

In March, OnePay announced that it was tapping Swedish fintech firm Klarna to handle buy now, pay later loans at the retailer, even after testing its own installment loan program.

In its quest to become a one-stop shop for Americans underserved by traditional banks, OnePay has methodically built out its offerings, which now include debit cards, high-yield savings accounts and a digital wallet with peer-to-peer payments.

OnePay is rolling out two options: a general-purpose credit card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted and a store card that will only allow Walmart purchases.

Customers whose credit profiles don't allow them to qualify for the general-purpose card will be offered the store card, according to a person with knowledge of the program.

OnePay hasn't yet disclosed the rewards expected for making purchases with the cards. The Synchrony partnership was reported earlier by Bloomberg.

""Our goal with this credit card program is to deliver an experience for consumers that's transparent, rewarding, and easy to use,"" OnePay CEO Omer Ismail said in the Monday release.

""We're excited to be partnering with Synchrony to launch a program at Walmart that checks each of those boxes and will help serve millions of people,"" Ismail said.

Sports entertainment, equipment and apparel stock Topgolf Callaway Brands surged on Monday after a high-profile corporate director bought shares in the company.

Shares rose 11%, hitting their highest level since May 13.

The moves comes after board member Adebayo Ogunlesi purchased about $2.5 million worth of shares last week, disclosed in a securities filing on Friday.

Purchases by corporate executives and directors can sometimes be seen as a vote of confidence in the company, and this purchase comes from an insider with the type of resume that Wall Street likes.

Ogunlesi is a founding partner and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, which was acquired by BlackRock last year in a $12 billion deal. Ogunlesi now serves on BlackRock's board after that deal, and he also joined the OpenAI board in January.

The purchase by Ogunlesi comes after a difficult period for Topgolf Callaway. Shares are down 9% in 2025, and more than 50% over the past year. Overall, the stock has delivered a negative return since Callaway first announced its acquisition of Topgolf in October 2020.

This is Ogunlesi's first purchase of Topgolf Callaway stock since June 2023, according to VerityData. Shares have dropped about 60% since that purchase.

Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set ablaze in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday amid widespread protests against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

A spokesperson for the Alphabet-owned company confirmed that five Waymo vehicles were vandalized in the vicinity of the protests and were unable to be retrieved. Waymo suspended service in the protest area until it was deemed safe, the spokesperson added.

Waymo responded with guidance from the Los Angeles Police Department, the spokesperson said.

The protests erupted in downtown LA on Friday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted raids in the city and surrounding communities. Demonstrations were largely peaceful, but tensions flared Saturday and Sunday, with police clashing with protesters near the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown LA.

California National Guard members arrived in the city on Sunday after Trump signed an order to deploy 2,000 troops in response to the protests. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it ""illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,"" Newsom wrote in a post Monday on X.

In one photo, a line of Waymo robotaxis can be seen engulfed in flames, with anti-ICE graffiti scrawled across the cars' hoods and doors. It's unclear whether the vehicles were deliberately targeted.

Some people were seen tossing Lime e-scooters into the burning Waymo vehicles, the Los Angeles Times reported.

""Burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, including hydrogen fluoride, posing risks to responders and those nearby,"" the LAPD said in a statement posted on X.

A Waymo in San Francisco's Financial District was also vandalized with graffiti on Sunday as people demonstrated to support the protests against immigration raids in L.A., according to a Reddit post. It's unclear how many vehicles were affected.

Waymo began offering robotaxi rides across 80-plus square miles of LA in 2024. The service also operates in parts of San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin, Texas.

The company has more than 1,500 vehicles in its fleet across L.A., San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin.

LONDON — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang poured praise on the U.K. on Monday, promising to boost investment in the country's artificial intelligence sector with his multitrillion-dollar semiconductor company.

""The U.K. is in a Goldilocks circumstance,"" Huang said, speaking on a panel with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson. ""You can't do machine learning without a machine — and so the ability to build these AI supercomputers here in the U.K. will naturally attract more startups.""

The Nvidia boss went on to say, ""I think it's just such an incredible, incredible place to invest. I'm going to invest here.""

Huang also stressed that Britain ""has one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet,"" along with ""amazing startups"" such as DeepMind, Wayve, Synthesia and ElevenLabs.

""The ecosystem is really perfect for takeoff — it's just missing one thing,"" he said, referring to a lack of homegrown, sovereign U.K. AI infrastructure.

Earlier Monday, Nvidia announced a new U.K. sovereign AI industry forum, as well as commitments from cloud vendors Nscale and Nebius to deploy new facilities in the country with thousands of the semiconductor giant's Blackwell graphics processing unit, or GPU, chips.

The U.K. has been touting its potential as a global AI player in recent months, amid Starmer's efforts to lead his Labour government with a growth-focused agenda.

In January, Starmer unveiled a bold plan to boost the domestic U.K. AI sector, promising to relax planning rules around new data center developments and increase British computing power by twenty-fold by 2030.

Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly set to boost its manufacturing in India with a view to bolstering its international supply chains amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.

The Chinese-founded, Singapore-headquartered brand and Indian partner Reliance Retail are set to expand their supplier base in the South Asian country and begin international sales of India-made Shein clothes within the next six to 12 months, Reuters reported Monday, citing sources.

The plans aim to increase Indian suppliers from 150 to 1,000 within a year, they added.

Shein told CNBC the partnership was limited to the licensing of its brand to Reliance Retail for Indian domestic consumption only. Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the sources, discussions between the firms were underway ahead of fresh U.S. tariffs on China and the closure of the former's 'de minimis' trade loophole.

Analysts nevertheless dubbed it a potentially savvy move given brewing trade tensions and increased scrutiny over Shein's supply chains ahead of its closely watched initial public offering.

''Shein's expansion of its production in India is on the face of it a shrewd move, given the trade headwinds facing the company,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC via email.

""It does look like using India as a manufacturing base is a long-term plan and the current tariff challenges could speed this up,"" Ed Sander, analyst at Tech Buzz China, added.

Shein launched in India in 2018 but it was banned in 2020 as part of a government clampdown on Chinese firms.

It returned to India in February, as part of a licensing deal with Reliance Industries, the conglomerate owned by Asia's richest person, Mukesh Ambani. The partnership is one of many Reliance has with global clothing brands including Brooks Brothers, Marks & Spencer and Diesel.

Under the deal, Shein-branded clothes are produced domestically in India and sold on the SheinIndia.in website. This differs from most other Shein websites, which list products made in China. The firm nevertheless has existing manufacturing in Brazil and Turkey.

An official from Reliance Retail said at the time that Shein would use India as ""supply source for its global operations,"" according to the BBC. They added that the deal would simultaneously help Reliance in ""building the network"" and training Indian garment manufacturers as part of India's wider plans to promote its textile and garments export industry.

""I doubt if the option of exporting elsewhere from India will be the main aim at the moment,"" Sander said, noting current limitations around India's factory capacity. ""Having said that, this could change in the future if Reliance scales up.""

It comes as other companies have also been ramping up their production in India as they seek to avoid the most punitive tariffs on China. Tariffs on India are currently held at 10% while trade negotiations remain underway.

""With the outcome of U.S. China trade talks still unclear, diversifying the manufacturing base to other parts of the world which could benefit from lower tariffs on exports to the U.S. looks sensible,"" Streeter said in emailed comments.

U.S. tech giant Apple has also been boosting its production in India with a view to making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the coming years. Those plans sparked backlash from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose 25% tariffs on such goods.

The timing is especially interesting for Shein, however, as it seeks to overcome scrutiny in its troubled pursuit of an IPO. The e-commerce behemoth reportedly recently shifted its listing from London to Hong Kong after failing to receive approval from Chinese regulators.

Shein has long sought to shake allegations over the use of forced labor to produce its low-cost goods — claims it vehemently denies. Still, some raised concerns about whether India would provide the silver bullet.

""India is not without risk in this respect. There have been reports of labor violations amounting to forced and child labor occurring on cotton farms supplying to three Indian textile suppliers to 60 multinational clothing brands,"" Streeter said.

""Among responsible consumers and investors, there still may be significant skepticism about this move.''

A spokesperson for the Indian government did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the claims.

China appears to have offered U.S. and European auto giants something of a reprieve after industry groups warned of increasing production threats over a rare earth shortage.

China's Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it was willing to establish a so-called ""green channel"" for eligible export license applications to expedite the approval process to European Union firms.

A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said Wang expressed hope that the EU would take ""reciprocal steps"" and adopt measures to promote compliant trade of high-tech products with China.

The breakthrough comes after trade talks between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic met in Paris, France last week.

Beijing also granted rare earth licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis, Reuters reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. The report said China's Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a faxed request for comment. CNBC has contacted GM and Ford.

Stellantis said it is closely monitoring the situation and ""working with suppliers and institutions to ensure an efficient licensing process.""

The company, which owns household names including Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, said it has been able to address ""immediate production concerns without major interruptions.""

China's Ministry of Commerce in early April imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive, defense and energy sectors. The curbs were part of a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's products.

Some of the affected rare earth elements were critical components to the production of both combustion engines and electric vehicles.

Maximilian Butek, an executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in China, said the weekend announcement was certainly good news for European businesses, but noted that it remains unclear whether the fast-track channel applies to large-scale firms or to sectors more broadly.

""It is a huge bureaucratic monster that they've created and I'm not sure if they really can now speed up the process and give the licenses to those who need them,"" Butek told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

Europe's top automakers will welcome the diplomatic breakthrough, Butek said, while stressing the European bloc's need to improve supply chain diversification.

""It all hit us quite by surprise that China is even willing to draw this card because this is a retaliation measurement towards the tariffs the U.S. implemented, right? And we, as European companies, we are now in the crossfire of this trade escalation, and this is really not where we want to be,"" Butek said.

""It is not enough just to announce it but they have to show it,"" he added.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

Some analysts have compared the industry-wide squeeze on supplies of rare earth magnets to the global semiconductor crisis that disrupted automotive production during the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to CNBC before China announced plans to expedite the approval process of rare earth exports to the EU, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said some of its members were at risk of production outages starting as soon as next month.

The car lobby group, which represents the likes of Stellantis, Renault, Ferrari, Volkswagen and Volvo, said rare earth export licenses by China's Ministry of Commerce had been taking a ""significant"" amount of time to process since the April restrictions came into force.

""Generally, global stocks of these magnets are quite low. And, given that China is the bulk global supplier, it has meant that, in the absence of these export licenses, those stocks have been depleting progressively since the start of April,"" Jonathan O'Riordan, international trade director at ACEA, told CNBC by phone.

""We're gradually coming into a very, very critical moment whereby those stocks are now being exhausted, and we are potentially going to see production stoppages,"" he added.

ACEA's warning followed a separate ominous update from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers.

Last week, the group said that several auto supplier plants and production lines had already been shut down due to Beijing's recent export restrictions, with further outages expected as rare earth inventories deplete over the coming weeks.

Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor, however, suspended production of its Swift car due to China's rare earth curbs, Reuters reported Thursday, citing two unnamed sources. A Suzuki Motor spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

U.S. President Donald Trump's top trade officials are meeting their Chinese counterparts in London on Monday for talks aimed at resolving an ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are representing the U.S.

China's Foreign Ministry said Saturday that Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing's lead trade negotiator, will be in the U.K. between June 8-13, and that a meeting of the ""China-U.S. economic and trade consultation mechanism"" would take place.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Monday told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the U.S. was seeking confirmation China would restore the flows of critical minerals.

""The purpose of the meeting today is to make sure that they're serious, but to literally get handshakes ... and get this thing behind us,"" Hassett said.

He added that he expected it ""to be a short meeting with a big, strong handshake.""

""Our expectation is that ... immediately after the handshake, any export controls from the U.S. will be eased, and the rare earths will be released in volume, and then we can go back to negotiating smaller matters,"" Hassett said.

The talks come after Trump last week said he had held a lengthy phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping as both look to avert a full-blown trade war.

Diplomatic efforts by both sides have ramped up after weeks of heightened trade tension and uncertainty after Trump announced sweeping import tariffs on China and other trading partners in April.

Beijing retaliated, and a tit-for-tat escalation in duties ensued before both sides agreed in Geneva in May to temporarily slash duties for 90 days and to facilitate talks. At the time, the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports was cut from 145% to 30%, while China's levies on U.S. imports were lowered from 125% to 10%.

China and the U.S. have since repeatedly accused each other of violating the Geneva agreement, with Washington saying Beijing was slow to approve the export of additional critical minerals to the U.S., while China criticized the U.S. imposing new restrictions on Chinese student visas and additional export restrictions on chips.

U.S. press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday said that the London talks would focus on moving forward with the Geneva agreement, noting the two sides' strategic interests in each other's markets.

Analysts say the Monday talks are unlikely to make much progress in resolving disagreements and sector-specific tariffs targeting a range of strategic industries, ranging from technology and critical minerals to manufacturing and agriculture.

Rebecca Harding, chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security, told CNBC on Monday that China and the United States ""are locked in an existential battle at the moment.""

""There's absolutely no other way of describing all of this, and this is about how data flows. It's about information. It's about AI. It's about tech. It's about defense too. China's rapidly expanding its munitions production at the moment. So it's about how these two economies actually compete and survive in a digital world where nobody really knows what the power of the nation-state is,"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""It's much, much more than just about trade and what's going on in that domain between the two countries. It's about how they run their economies. This is only just starting and, effectively, it's a battle for the 21st century,"" she added.

Optimistic that talks are taking place at all, Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, told CNBC that it could take months for trade tensions to be resolved.

""I don't really have very high expectations for these trade talks ... I doubt they will reach an agreement very soon,"" he told CNBC's ""China Connection"" on Monday.

""There could be some resolution on specific issues, like a rare earths, for instance, China already announced that they will give some permits to foreign firms applying for imports. Now, those kind of a temporary solution, we might see some of that come out. But I doubt we will have a complete solution coming from this dialog in the U.K.,"" Zhang added.

In this article

LONDON — Britain's financial services watchdog on Monday announced a new tie-up with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to let banks safely experiment with artificial intelligence.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it will launch a so-called Supercharged Sandbox that will ""give firms access to better data, technical expertise and regulatory support to speed up innovation.""

Starting from October, financial services institutions in the U.K. will be allowed to experiment with AI using Nvidia's accelerated computing and AI Enterprise Software products, the watchdog said in a press release.

The initiative is designed for firms in the ""discovery and experiment phase"" with AI, the FCA noted, adding that a separate live testing service exists for firms further along in AI development.

""This collaboration will help those that want to test AI ideas but who lack the capabilities to do so,"" Jessica Rusu, the FCA's chief data, intelligence and information officer, said in a statement. ""We'll help firms harness AI to benefit our markets and consumers, while supporting economic growth.""

The FCA's new sandbox addresses a key issue for banks, which have faced challenges shipping advanced new AI tools to their customers amid concerns over risks around privacy and fraud.

Large language models from the likes of OpenAI and Google send data back to overseas facilities — and privacy regulators have raised the alarm over how this information is stored and processed. There have meanwhile been several instances of malicious actors using generative AI to scam people.

Nvidia is behind the graphics processing units, or GPUs, used to train and run powerful AI models. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, is expected to give a keynote talk at a tech conference in London on Monday morning.

Last year, HSBC's generative AI lead, Edward Achtner, told a London tech conference he sees ""a lot of success theater"" in finance when it comes to artificial intelligence — hinting that some financial services firms are touting advances in AI without tangible product innovations to show for it.

He added that, while banks like HSBC have used AI for many years, new generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT come with their own unique compliance risks.

 Analysts say Bitcoin could break its all-time high within 1–2 weeks, following breakout patterns seen recently in gold and the S&P 500. 

Key takeaways:

A newly created whale wallet opened a $54.5M 20x long position on Bitcoin at $106,538.

Bitcoin nears $108,000 as US-China trade talks and bullish equity forecasts lift market sentiment.

Analysts expect BTC to break its all-time high within 1–2 weeks, mirroring recent breakouts in gold and the S&P 500.

Bitcoin (BTC) reached $108,000 on June 9, just as a newly funded crypto wallet executed one of the boldest leveraged trades of the year: a $54.5 million long position on BTC with 20x leverage.

The wallet, identified as “0x1f25,” was created earlier today and promptly funded with $10 million in USDC stablecoin. 

The trader then opened a 511.5 BTC position on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, using full cross-margin leverage. 

With an entry price of $106,538 and a liquidation level of $88,141, the trader is currently sitting on over $11,000 in paper profit, a modest but strategic gain amid increasing market momentum.

Some traders believe the whale behind wallet “0x1f25” may be James Wynn, a high‑profile Hyperliquid trader who recently suffered massive liquidations. 

Wynn lost an initial $99.3 million when BTC fell below $105,000 on May 30, as two long positions totaling 949 BTC were wiped out. A week later, on June 4, he took an additional $25 million hit when 240 BTC in another leveraged position were liquidated.

Despite these setbacks, Wynn has quickly opened fresh mega‑bets and maintains a pattern of entering new high‑leverage trades, matching the aggressive style behind wallet 0x1f25.

BTC's push above $108,000 came as traders monitored US-China trade talks unfolding in London. 

Negotiations began on June 9 afternoon with signs of a diplomatic thaw: the US is reportedly willing to relax tech export restrictions in exchange for more access to China's rare earth materials. 

Talks may continue into Tuesday if needed, according to officials close to the matter. Like Bitcoin, US equities have responded positively to the news, indicating an overall positive sentiment among risk traders.

On June 6, strategists at JPMorgan and Citigroup raised their year-end targets for the S&P 500, pointing to easing US-China trade tensions and stronger-than-expected economic data. 

Goldman's David Kostin said markets are beginning to reflect an “optimistic growth outlook” — a sentiment that appears to be lifting crypto as well, with the digital asset market adding more than $190 billion in value since the revised forecasts.

Bitcoin may retest its record high of around $110,000 and may even cross above it in the coming 1-2 weeks, according to analyst Ted Pillows.

Pillows compares Bitcoin's current setup to recent moves in gold and the S&P 500, both of which surged after breaking above similar resistance levels. 

His chart shows all three assets facing horizontal barriers — levels where prices previously topped out — and Bitcoin now looks poised to follow the same breakout pattern.

Some analysts see Bitcoin price reaching over $150,000 by year's end, a move that can push the whale's profit to around 225%—or $22.5 million—given his $10 million margin.

The mini rally in Bitcoin over the past few trading sessions has made every purchase of the cryptocurrency by Michael Saylor's Strategy over the last four plus years profitable. 

The former MicroStrategy Inc. announced earlier Monday that it had acquired an additional 1,045 tokens for $110.2 million from June 2 to June 8, or for an average price of $105,426 each. Bitcoin was up about 1.7% to $108,022 as of 12:39 p.m. in New York, and has climbed around 7.5% since June 5. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","cryptocurrency"

 Strategy has acquired 1,045 Bitcoin for $110.2 million as part of its ongoing accumulation strategy, bringing total holdings to 582,000 BTC. 

Strategy has acquired $110.2 million worth of Bitcoin as the price trades near its all-time high level.

According to a Monday US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing, Strategy acquired 1,045 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $105,426 per coin. The company now holds 582,000 BTC acquired for about $40.8 billion at an average price of around $70,086 per BTC.

The announcement follows Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor hinting at the purchase on June 8. The buy marks the ninth consecutive week that Strategy has acquired Bitcoin.

News of the latest purchase comes as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin traded at $107,640 at the time of writing, just 3.9% lower than the all-time high of about $112,000 reported in May.

The latest Bitcoin acquisition follows Strategy's announcement of a $1 billion stock offering, which quadrupled its previous announcement of a $250 million raise. The company plans to use the proceeds to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions and corporate expenses.

The stock offering issues 11.76 million shares of Strategy's 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock for $85 per share. Following the deduction of expenses from underwriting and other dues, the firm expects to raise about $979 million.

Unlike previous fundraising rounds, this offering provides non-cumulative dividends of 10%, designed to appeal to institutional and professional investors seeking yield-generating opportunities.

Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 with an initial purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million. The firm now holds more than 2.75% of the total Bitcoin supply.  

The company's market capitalization stands at $104.6 billion, up from the $1.2 billion reported in July 2020 before starting its Bitcoin accumulation. Its success story has inspired a long list of other companies to follow suit.

Among them is Metaplanet, nicknamed “Japan's MicroStrategy.” It recently became the world's eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, using the same method as Strategy.

Similarly, France-based The Blockchain Group has added another 580 Bitcoin to its treasury, leading to a 225% surge in its stock price after pivoting to BTC accumulation in November 2024. 

Earlier this month, the Norway-based crypto exchange Norwegian Block Exchange saw its stock rise by over 138% in a day after announcing its intention to buy and hold Bitcoin.

Wall Street has now set its sights on altcoins, and inflows could follow if Bitcoin holds above a key level, says MEXC COO.

Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC). This demand could soon extend to proven, low-volatility altcoins, according to Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, who spoke with crypto.news. However, such a shift will largely depend on whether Bitcoin maintains strength above a critical threshold.

“Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy's hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. 

Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. One standout example was Circle's successful IPO. Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition.

“All of these moves together point to a big change: crypto companies are no longer just reacting to market trends; they're actually influencing how institutions can access crypto. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it's becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. 

According to Jin, this trend is likely to persist—at least in the near term. The key risk factor remains Bitcoin's price. If BTC drops below the psychological $100,000 level, a temporary institutional pullback becomes more likely.

As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000 and big investors keep wanting it, more companies will probably go public with it, buy more of it, and get more money flowing into it — and not just into BTC but eventually into the whole altcoin market as well, as more people feel confident about cryptocurrency.

 The Paris-based crypto company already holds $154 million worth of Bitcoin, claiming to be Europe's first BTC treasury company. 

Paris-based cryptocurrency company The Blockchain Group plans to raise over $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, signaling continued institutional adoption of crypto in Europe.

The Blockchain Group, which claims to be Europe's first Bitcoin (BTC) treasury company, plans to raise 300 million euros ($342 million) to fund more BTC purchases, according to a Monday news release.

The $340 million round's structure is inspired by the US practice of “At the Market” (ATM) offerings. Shares will be sold at market conditions initiated by the company's counterparty, subject to a pre-agreed volume.

The raise will be carried out in tranches, with pricing based on the “higher of the previous day's closing price or the volume-weighted average price,” capped at 21% of that day's trading volume, the announcement said.

The announcement comes a week after the company acquired $68 million worth of Bitcoin, pushing its total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin, or over $154 million, Cointelegraph reported on June 3.

Other institutional Bitcoin holders are also launching fundraising efforts to stack more BTC.

On Friday, Michael Saylor's Strategy announced plans to raise nearly $1 billion through a stock offering to fund its future Bitcoin purchases, quadrupling the firm's previously announced $250 million raise.

Strategy is the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over $61 billion worth of Bitcoin on its books, representing 2.76% of the entire BTC supply, Bitbo data shows.

Bitcoin has entered a period of price consolidation after breaching the $112,000 all-time high on May 22.

Despite the drawback, institutional adoption and strategic treasury moves continue to “anchor the bullish long-term narrative,” Nexo dispatch editor Stella Zlatareva told Cointelegraph, adding:

Bitcoin's strong rebound from the $103,000 support signals resilience, with “no signs of mass deleveraging or forced selling,” Zlatareva added.

Despite positive sentiment around treasury-based accumulation, US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have struggled to maintain inflows.  

The ETFs saw over $47 million worth of outflows on Friday, a second consecutive day of selling after $278 million worth of net outflows on Thursday, according to Farside Investors.

What if drones, AI, and blockchain could reshape the way we feed the world—starting in Malaysia?

That vision is becoming reality through a AgriTech initiative that integrates drones, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology.

In an effort to support sustainable farming and technological innovation, Farmsent, DroneDash, and SkyX have announced a partnership to launch an advanced smart AgriTech network spanning over 490,000 acres of palm plantations in Malaysia.

This collaboration creates a blueprint for modern agriculture that is efficient, sustainable, and globally participatory.

Imagine autonomous drones mapping vast plantations, deploying agrochemicals with pinpoint precision—all guided by real-time AI and blockchain-verified data.

Farmsent is introducing blockchain-tokenized soil sensors that continuously monitor critical soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These sensors provide real-time data, enabling precise and timely fertilization strategies, ensuring optimal nutrient application at the exact locations required.

Through tokenization, these sensors become assets within the global Web3 community, allowing global participants to invest and contribute actively to sustainable agricultural practices. These sensors employ predictive AI modeling to anticipate nutrient requirements, enabling highly optimized fertilization strategies and significantly boosting sustainability.

DroneDash plays a pivotal role, streamlining the deployment of drone technology for targeted agrochemical applications, thus enhancing the efficiency of pesticide and fertilizer use. This not only optimizes resource usage but also minimizes environmental impact, protecting ecosystems surrounding agricultural areas.

DroneDash's AgriTech Drone

Drone Dash

DroneDash's drone fleet isn't just high-tech—it's cost-cutting, reducing chemical usage and maximizing efficiency.

Complementing this technology, SkyX introduces advanced hyperlocal weather stations. These stations capture detailed, hyper-accurate climate data, measuring variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind direction, wind speed, and air pressure. This granular level of detail provides invaluable insights that allow farmers to make proactive, data-driven decisions, improving crop yields and resilience against climatic uncertainties.

Additionally, each technological component deployed—including sensors and weather stations—is assigned a unique blockchain identity via the peaq blockchain platform. This strategic integration of blockchain technology creates decentralized opportunities for global participation, enabling individuals around the world to directly invest and engage in agricultural innovations through tokenization.

Yog Shrusti, co-founder of Farmsent, commented to me that ""this isn't just about integrating technology; it's about fundamentally reshaping how we approach agriculture in Southeast Asia. By empowering farmers with unprecedented data-driven insights and fostering a global community around sustainable practices through tokenization, we're not just optimizing yields – we're building a more resilient and equitable food system for generations to come.”

More than 25% of the world's population and more than 40% of the global agricultural production heavily rely upon unsustainable groundwater extraction. Traditional agricultural methods often result in significant inefficiencies and environmental challenges, necessitating innovative solutions to sustainably meet growing food demands.

The agricultural drone market alone is projected to reach USD 7.6 billion by 2028 according to Markets and Markets. By integrating drone technology into everyday farming operations, Farmsent, DroneDash, and SkyX are leading the charge towards substantial reductions in the use of critical resources, potentially cutting water, pesticide, and fertilizer consumption by up to 50%.

Paul Yam, CEO of DroneDash explained to me that “this is not just a technical integration — it's proof that decentralized technologies can solve real problems, create real value, and drive real profit for communities and investors alike.""

The practical impact of these innovations is immediate and tangible. Farmers equipped with real-time analytics and precise climate insights can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency, while drastically reducing environmental footprints.

This combination positions Malaysia at the forefront of global AgriTech innovation, serving as a benchmark for other nations facing similar agricultural and environmental challenges.

AI is the intelligence engine behind this transformation—turning raw data into real-time, predictive insights that farmers can act on.

AI-driven analytics integrate real-time sensor data, historical environmental information, and drone-collected imagery, providing farmers with actionable insights into current and future agricultural conditions. These predictive analytics enable farmers to anticipate crop health issues, optimize resource allocation, and implement proactive measures rather than merely reactive ones.

With each season, the system gets smarter—boosting yields, trimming costs, and future-proofing farms. This continual improvement means that the accuracy and effectiveness of interventions steadily increase, optimizing agricultural outputs and enhancing resource efficiency.

The integration of AI ensures that data-driven insights are accessible, practical, and tailored to local conditions. Farmers can receive personalized recommendations, allowing for more effective responses to specific agricultural challenges and ensuring a direct positive impact on crop yield and sustainability.

Blockchain isn't just for transparency—it's unlocking new markets. Every drone, sensor, and station becomes a verifiable, investable digital asset.

Each drone, soil sensor, and weather station is assigned a unique digital identity through the peaq blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent record of operations, maintenance, and data output.

That means farm operations are no longer black boxes. Investors, regulators, and farmers can track input-to-output performance in real time. With transparent tracking, stakeholders—from local farmers to international investors—can verify the authenticity and accuracy of the data generated by each device.

Frank Fang, the co-founder of SkyX, explained it well when he said, “While the agriculture industry has long relied on generalized weather forecasting, we're witnessing a fundamental shift toward hyperlocal precision that can make the difference between a profitable harvest and significant losses. Our blockchain-powered weather stations don't just collect data—they create a new economic model where accurate environmental intelligence becomes a trade-able asset.""

SkyX isn't just forecasting the weather—they're tokenizing it, letting anyone invest in climate intelligence infrastructure.

Blockchain also facilitates decentralized governance models, where stakeholders collectively make decisions, aligning incentives and promoting collaborative management of shared resources. Such participatory governance ensures equitable distribution of benefits and risks, encouraging sustained investment and involvement from global communities.

This isn't a regional pilot—it's a scalable model. With the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicting a 70% increase in global food demand by 2050, adopting advanced technologies like drones, sensors, and blockchain is not just beneficial—it's essential.

For consumers worldwide, these technologies promise enhanced sustainability and potentially lower food prices by increasing agricultural efficiency and reducing waste. More sustainable practices contribute directly to healthier environments and ecosystems, addressing pressing global environmental concerns.

Investors and participants in the global economy stand to benefit substantially through blockchain tokenization, which opens up new avenues for direct investment into the booming AgriTech sector. By democratizing access to agricultural advancements, individuals globally can actively participate in and benefit financially from sustainable farming innovations.

Summary of the benefits

This partnership exemplifies the power of technology to address critical global challenges, driving forward a vision of agriculture that is not only productive but also equitable, resilient, and sustainable.

Blockchain protocol OpenLedger said it will commit $25 million to fund AI and Web3 developers.

The capital will be available on OpenCircle, a new launchpad set up by the California-based project to assist developers with creating AI-focused protocols.

The funding comes at a time of increased intersection between the blockchain and AI industries. Telegram last month announced a deal with Elon Musk's xAI to incorporate the Grok AI chatbot on the messaging app, with the app also accepting the TON token for crypto payments.

“AI is currently an extractive economy, profiting from invisible labor and centralized training pipelines,” said Ram, a core contributor at OpenLedger. “OpenCircle turns that model inside out. We're building a system where anyone who contributes, whether through code, data, or compute, owns a piece of the value they help create.”

OpenLedger raised $8 million in a seed round in 2024 as it looked to become the ""sovereign data blockchain for AI technology."" The company also signed a deal with restaking protocol Ether.fi to enhance AI model development and security, Ether.fi has $6.5 billion in total value locked (TVL).

Oops, something went wrong

An updated edition of the April 24, 2025 article.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has been soaring high due to increasing acceptance as a non-sovereign asset, as well as higher institutional and corporate adoption. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, apparently benefiting from easing trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which reflected the digital currency's growing recognition as a store of value. As of April 28, more than 70 publicly listed companies, including the likes of MicroStrategy MSTR and Marathon Digital MARA, hold 720,728 bitcoins worth $68.5 billion.Bitcoin is now trading above $105,000, lower than the all-time high, but much higher than the $76,000 it registered in early April. The liberal policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have been benefiting Bitcoin and other crypto assets. An executive order by President Trump that directed a working group to study and propose changes to cryptocurrency regulations bodes well for crypto enthusiasts. In March, President Trump announced the creation of a crypto reserve, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano, which augurs well for cryptocurrency miners, including BIT Mining Limited BTCM and exchanges like CME Group CME.Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain technology, which comprises complex cryptography and software that creates an immutable and decentralized database. The system offers enhanced security for users, as it maintains a tamper-resistant record of transactions and keeps track of the owner. Blockchain's safety and decentralization features have been among the major drivers behind the proliferation of cryptocurrencies. Technology companies like International Business Machines IBM and Amazon are leveraging blockchain to drive growth. Per Gartner, business value generated by blockchain will reach $176 billion by 2025 and $3.1 trillion by 2030.

Gamified engagement strategies drive OpenSea's user activity amidst broader NFT market optimism.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

OpenSea's rollout of its OS2 platform has driven its highest user growth in over two years, suggesting that the long-dormant NFT market may be flickering back to life.

Monthly active users on OpenSea jumped to roughly 467,000 in May, marking a 44% increase from April and the most since April 2023.

While sales volumes remain at a fraction of their 2022 highs, though the user activity surge is fueling cautious optimism about a broader market rebound. Namely, due to the number of NFTs sold in April and May has returned to February 2023 at over 2 million.

Launched on May 29, OS2 represents a strategic overhaul of OpenSea's identity. The new platform supports token trading across 19 blockchains, introduces a gamified rewards system called “Voyages,” and teases the long-rumored SEA token airdrop. These moves aim to turn OpenSea into a full-spectrum on-chain hub rather than simply an NFT marketplace.

“The OS2 upgrade is the foundation for the next generation of OpenSea,” said CEO Devin Finzer in May. “We've rebuilt the platform from the ground up to become the best destination for everything on-chain.” That includes fungible tokens, multi-chain NFTs, and a growing emphasis on user engagement through quests and XP.

The Voyages system, now live with OS2, incentivizes on-chain activity with XP points widely expected to translate into SEA airdrop eligibility. Early evidence suggests the campaign is working: address activity surged in tandem with the update, though critics caution that wallet counts, OpenSea's primary user metric, may be inflated by airdrop farming.

Momentum is hard to track directly amid incentives, but current signs are positive. OpenSea regained market share last month, reclaiming ground from rivals like Blur, whose token incentives had previously lured pro traders.

Sales volumes also rose slightly, reaching $81 million in 30-day turnover, though this remains more than 90% below the peak of $5 billion in January 2022.

Part of the recovery tailwind may be regulatory. In February, the U.S. SEC formally ended its investigation into OpenSea, removing a cloud that had hung over the company since mid-2023. That clearance de-risks a potential token launch and reassures creators and traders who are still wary of enforcement action in the NFT space.

Even with renewed interest, the path forward is far from certain. Many of OS2's gains are tied to speculation around airdrops, and OpenSea hasn't committed to a timeline for the SEA token. Meanwhile, its expansion into fungible token trading may dilute focus or draw the ire of decentralized exchange incumbents.

Still, the May surge signals that user interest in NFTs isn't dead, but they are awaiting a reason to return. OpenSea's gamble is that OS2, coupled with cleaner regulatory skies and multi-chain functionality, provides the spark. Whether that fire catches beyond this first wave of airdrop activity remains to be seen.

Layer 1 blockchain Plasma showcased the massive demand for exposure to the stablecoin sector this morning, filling a $500 million initial coin offering (ICO) deposit vault in a matter of minutes.

The token sale was initially capped at $250 million, but after the vault filled instantly, the cap was doubled to $500 million, which filled as soon as market participants realized the cap had been increased.

The raise is being managed in collaboration with Sonar, which is the ICO arm of Cobie's public fundraising platform, Echo.

Plasma is a ‘stablechain,' or a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain optimized for stablecoin transactions, backed by Tether, the issuer of DeFi's leading stablecoin, USDT. It's offering 10% of its XPL token supply at a $500 million fully diluted valuation (FDV) through this sale.

The sale attracted significant whale activity, with just over 1,110 wallets filling the vault for a median deposit of $35,000. The largest contributor to the presale sent the maximum allocation of $50 million, taking up 10% of the total presale. 38% of the raise is held by the top 10 depositors, and 50% belongs to the top 17.

Despite some pushback due to the concentration of top holders, some analysts consider the raise a success.

“All things considered, insanely good distribution of holders for @PlasmaFDN at $500m total size of deposit. Seeing a ton of folks with smaller amounts on here and only one entity with $50m in a wallet. Well done,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, the founder and Chief Investment Officer at Split Capital.

It appears that Plasma may raise the deposit cap again, based on a Discord message from a team member, Nathan Lenga. It is unclear if any additional deposits would be offered XPL at the same valuation as the initial $500 million.

The ICO is developing a statutory code of practice for organisations developing or deploying AI and automated decision-making to ensure they safeguard people's privacy.

As part of the data regulator's new strategy, it will focus particularly on policing and recruitment, including reviewing the use of automated decision making (ADM) systems by the recruitment industry.

Qualitative research with job seekers by the ICO found that participants acknowledged the increasing use of ADM in recruitment but generally had a limited understanding of how it worked.

The ICO will also conduct audits and produce guidance on the use of facial recognition by police forces as part of the new strategy. A survey by the regulator found that 54% of participants were concerned that the use of facial recognition technologies by police would infringe on their right to privacy.

The regulator is also placing more scrutiny on emerging AI ‘risks and trends', including the increase in agentic AI, used by organisations to act autonomously.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: ""Our personal information powers the economy, bringing new opportunities for organisations to innovate with AI and biometric technologies. But to confidently engage with AI-powered products and services, people need to trust their personal information is in safe hands. It is our job as the regulator to scrutinise emerging technologies – agentic AI, for example – so we can make sure effective protections are in place, and personal information is used in ways that both drive innovation and earn people's trust.”

Unilabs' unique AI-backed DeFi asset management platform sparks presale demand; Dogecoin prepares for a rebound, while Cardano tumbles 10%.

Table of Contents

Despite the bold Dogecoin forecasts and the soaring Cardano price, Unilabs Finance is in the spotlight. Popular for its novelty, the pioneering AI-backed DeFi asset manager is among the new DeFi protocols to watch out for this year. 

At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token, currently in presale and selling out fast. Over $2.2 million has been raised in early funding, priced at $0.062 in the third ICO stage. Hailed as a future top 100 coin, it is a strong contender against DOGE and ADA. 

Despite the recent downturn in the Dogecoin price, 15% in the past week, the 9-HMA and Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a rebound. At $0.18, a retest of $0.20 could push DOGE above its 30-day high of $0.25. 

Additionally, a new all-time high isn't out of the question. Down over 70% from the 2021 ATH of $0.73, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry, positioning it among the leading tokens to buy. 

While Hcpxbt targets a rally between $0.50 and $0.60 in its next leg up, many top analysts predict a jump above last cycle's peak. ProTheDoge, popular for their bullish stance, believes the Dogecoin price could climb past $2 this year. Although one of the top tokens to buy in this bull run, experts consider UNIL more attractive due to its AI narrative and higher growth prospects. 

Like many top altcoins, the Cardano price is in a downtrend. It nosedived by 10% on the 7-day chart, trading at $0.6. However, its long-term outlook remains promising, especially considering growing adoption and institutional interest. 

At the same time, technical indicators point to a bounce in the Cardano price, the Williams Percent Range and Stochastic RSI Fast are key signals. Its next jump could push the price above the monthly high of $0.8608, positioning it among the top DeFi tokens to buy. 

Meanwhile, its long-term outlook is even more promising. Despite recent market downswings, Crypto_Twittier is optimistic, predicting a range between $3.80 and $5.60 this year, a bold Cardano price prediction. However, experts believe its upside pales in comparison to Unilabs' UNIL token, considered a more compelling alternative. 

Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a new DeFi protocol that intersects with traditional finance and artificial intelligence. Fundamentally solid, experts believe it could be the year's breakout project. Also, its native utility coin, UNIL, is considered a strong contender against ADA and DOGE, one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy this cycle. 

A hot topic within the crypto community is its novelty, which revolves around being the first AI-backed DeFi asset manager in the world. Designed to democratize access to alpha and unlock institutional-grade opportunities for everyday retail investors, it intends to level the playing field for small-scale investors. 

With its utility coin, UNIL, currently in presale, it has been selling out quickly. A token costs only $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, with early investors positioned for significant gain during the presale and post-launch. Other perks to holding include staking, periodic airdrops, exclusive access to high-potential opportunities, voting rights and redistribution of 30% of the total platform-generated fees to holders.  

In its early stages, UNIL is one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy due to its upside potential and budget-friendliness. Presenting a lower entry than the current Dogecoin price, investors don't have to break the bank before positioning for gains. Despite experts' bold Cardano price prediction, its small market cap leaves plenty of room to run.

Chainlink (LINK) played a pivotal role in a successful pilot program that facilitated the exchange of two central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

The pilot involved the Hong Kong digital dollar (e-HKD) and an Australian stablecoin. It was part of Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program, initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol enabled seamless transactions. It showcases how smart contract technology can bridge traditional finance and the decentralized finance ecosystem.



At the heart of this milestone was Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, which allowed the exchange between the two digital assets. The transaction used the Australian Stablecoin issued by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group alongside the e-HKD. 

This integration was key in demonstrating how blockchain-based infrastructure can enhance the efficiency and security of international payments. Chainlink's protocol effectively bridged the gap between different blockchain networks, providing a seamless experience for all parties involved.

The pilot's success was further strengthened by the involvement of major financial institutions. Visa, Fidelity International, ANZ, and China Asset Management Company participated in the transaction framework. 

Each of these players contributed to the pilot's execution and success, reinforcing the growing collaboration between traditional finance and decentralized technologies. This partnership highlights how established financial players are beginning to adopt and integrate blockchain and digital currency solutions into their existing systems.

This pilot also comes when traditional financial institutions show increasing interest in blockchain and Web3 technologies. Recently, JP Morgan concluded its first transaction on a public chain, signaling a deeper commitment to the Web3 space. 

Using Chainlink's technology to connect private and public networks, JP Morgan's transaction with tokenized U.S. Treasuries on Ondo Finance demonstrates how blockchain is reshaping traditional finance.

PISTACHO

KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia's participation in Project Dunbar, a cross-border central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative, is a sound move, said Professor of Economics Anella Munro.

She said the participation demonstrates Malaysia's commitment to being at the forefront of regional financial innovation.

“Being part of this project certainly fits into the goal of understanding what it is, developing capacity, considering potential use cases, and collaborating with others, some of whom have experience and some who do not. From an outsider's perspective, I believe Bank Negara is doing all the right things,” she said in an interview with SunBiz.

Munro said while there are other ways to facilitate cross-border transactions, CBDCs remain a superior option.

“None is really as good as a central bank digital currency because it's a safe settlement asset, like we use at the wholesale level, and I hope it would help potentially with transparency, speed, and cost.”

She said cross-border payments have traditionally relied on correspondent banking systems, which are slow and expensive.

“What if we had a system that provided a safe settlement asset for cross-border transactions at the wholesale level?”

However, Munro said, with cross-border CBDC implementation, there are a lot of issues about governance.

“It's more complicated than it seems, due to jurisdictional and legal issues, in addition to technological challenges.

“It's a sovereign currency, do you want it on the same platform? Do you want it to be used abroad? Borders become irrelevant once you're on some of these platforms.”

She pointed to stablecoins which could provide a similar kind of service, although they are not as strong as central bank liabilities because they come with a different kind of counterparty risk.

“If stablecoins are very well backed, they could potentially serve as a settlement asset in the system,” Munro said.

She said stablecoins were a disaster a few years ago as they were not properly backed and were considered the Wild West.

“They say they're stable, but often back themselves with questionable assets. This has changed a lot in the last few years, but the area is still an open question. The regulation has really come in to tame them and make them much more what they say they are.”

The push for CBDCs dates back starting with China's e-yuan project in 2014. When Facebook Libra came around in 2019, it renewed focus on the area, driven by concerns over big tech potentially controlling global payment systems and private data from social networks.

Munro also highlighted that the fear of privacy issues and the potential for unregulated payments within private networks has led to the current push for CBDCs. “Not only were there privacy concerns, but if a payment system operated within a private network, it could avoid oversight for anti-money laundering and other regulations, which was a significant problem.”

Ruben Gallego as crypto power player","https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/06/09/stablecoin-bill-marks-shift-on-crypto-for-sen-ruben-gallego/83997206007/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:02:42 GMT","

Ruben Gallego, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, celebrated an election win for an Oregon Democrat with a social media post that alluded to her primary win over a well-supported opponent.

Rep. Andrea Salinas had “slayed the Crypto beast,” Gallego, D-Arizona, wrote in November 2022. He welcomed a Latina's win while he chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

His word choice from three years ago might suggest a hostility to Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency king whose PAC spent millions to boost Salinas' opponent in her Democratic primary before making news for the collapse of his company. But these days Gallego, now a freshman senator often mentioned as a possible 2028 presidential contender, seems more open to the industry.

Last year, groups aligned with the industry spent $10 million supporting Gallego's Senate campaign. This year, Marc Andreessen, a billionaire venture capitalist who is one of the biggest advocates for cryptocurrencies, headlined a fundraiser for Gallego's affiliated campaign funds.

It is part of the rapidly shifting politics of crypto. Gallego is part of a bloc of Democrats who have worked with Republicans on a bill that could become the first major legislation regulating stablecoins, a type of digital asset that generally tries to keep pace with the value of the U.S. dollar and is part of the cryptocurrency industry.

He is the top-ranking Democrat on a Senate subcommittee overseeing digital currency issues and embodies a recent embrace of an industry that many Democrats — and even President Donald Trump — had once viewed with wariness.

But Trump has dropped his reticence on an industry he once called “a scam” and has already pocketed billions from his family's own business interests in crypto.

With Trump's support, the crypto industry is on the cusp of a major legislative breakthrough, less than three years after a trillion-dollar retreat in digital money known as the “crypto winter.”

Gallego has delayed that triumph, at least for the moment. He has said he and other Democrats working on the bill want to ensure the measure contains safeguards against money laundering and protects national security.

On May 8, he helped block a vote on the stablecoin bill, urging more time to collaborate with his GOP colleagues on a measure he could support.

That position has garnered criticism from supporters and opponents of the crypto bill, known as the GENIUS Act.

“You are a traitor, and we're going to take it out on your house colleagues in 2026,” Ryan Selkis, the founder of the crypto data firm Messari, wrote on social media the day the bill stalled.

Selkis, a self-described member of the “crypto political machine,” pointed to the millions of dollars in backing Democrats like Gallego had received in 2024.

On the other end, Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said Gallego is further empowering an industry with a bill that will destabilize financial markets and hurt his own party.

“The Democrats in support of this bill are essentially putting our economy at risk and filling the pockets of an industry that is going to spend enormous amounts of money against them in 2026,” Frayer said in an interview.

The stablecoin bill would stand to create a regulatory framework for a payment system that to this point has gone unchecked by government. Relatively few people currently use cryptocurrency, but especially with a White House that markets it, that could change dramatically in the near term.

That reality has helped bring Democrats to the table for a bill that reflects their wishes, too.

Critics of the bill see it as treating crypto vendors too differently than banks.

Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, teaches financial stability regulation and worked with a congressional commission to identify the causes of the 2008 Wall Street crisis.

She worries the stablecoin bill won't provide the type of restrictions that already apply to banks to ensure sufficient reserves to protect investors.

“I think the narrative that the crypto industry is offering … over the last three or four years has really pushed the financial inclusion, or democratizing-finance angle,” she said. “Isn't it great for helping people who have been previously locked out of the financial system?

“The reality, just to shatter that narrative, is that it's essentially the same kind of story that was being told about some private mortgages in the lead-up to 2008, where people who have been previously excluded from financial opportunities are being offered something really quite predatory.”

Allen compared the crypto industry to a Ponzi scheme that depends on bringing in more people to prolong high asset values. When the crypto industry retrenched in 2022, it lost comparable value to the Wall Street crash in 2008.

“The key in 2022 why most people didn't even notice was that the crypto industry was not integrated with traditional finance,” she said.

“There were people who lost their lifetime savings. … But for people who had never invested in crypto, unless they were following the news, they wouldn't have known that anything had happened.”

Salinas' 2022 win in Oregon was no obscure contest.

It drew national attention for the outsized money poured into the Democratic primary in a Latino-heavy district with no incumbent running.

Bankman-Fried, the soon-to-be indicted billionaire entrepreneur who founded FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and his allies poured more than $10 million into the race in support of little-known Carrick Flynn.

Flynn, 35 at the time, worked in artificial intelligence in Washington, D.C., until the COVID-19 pandemic, when he moved back to his native Oregon and ran for Congress.

Salinas had been a state legislator for five years by the time of the May 2022 primary. She survived the deluge of crypto-rooted money that helped Flynn and won the primary. A few months later, she won the general election, which was unsurprising in a left-leaning district.

That's when Gallego congratulated Salinas for slaying “the Crypto beast.”

Three days before Gallego did, Bankman-Fried's FTX faced a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy. The implosion of FTX rattled cryptocurrency markets and put a glaring spotlight on Bankman-Fried.

In some ways, the arc of the Salinas race traced the highs and lows of the crypto world for a time.

During the period when Flynn was competing against Salinas in the Oregon primary, Bankman-Fried weighed helping Elon Musk finance his pending purchase of the social media platform then known as Twitter.

A legal resident of the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried had discussed personally paying off that country's $11 billion national debt.

Bankman-Fried even helped Gallego with $5,800 for his House campaign, the maximum allowed at the time.

By the time the elections ended in November 2022, FTX led a retreat for crypto assets. Bitcoin's price fell to its lowest point since the onset of the pandemic two years earlier. Ethereum, another leading crypto asset, tumbled as well.

Soon after the downfall of FTX, a bipartisan trio of senators questioned California-based Silvergate Bank about its significant relations to the crypto industry. In March 2023, the bank collapsed.

At the same time, then-President Joe Biden's proposed federal budget reflected a sense common among Democrats that crypto didn't need oversight breaks. Biden's plan included a provision to create a 30% tax on electrical costs attributable to maintaining cryptocurrency trading, known as crypto mining.

“Cryptominers' high energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where these firms locate across the country,” the White House said.

The Biden administration maintained a wariness toward crypto in May 2024, when he vetoed a bill intended to change the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules regarding the handling of digital assets by regulated banks.

But by then, some congressional Democrats sought a rapprochement.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, has been a crypto advocate for years and tried to smooth industry relations with the Biden White House in a private meeting in July 2024.

After Biden dropped out of the race, Khanna convened a similar meeting weeks later that included a representative for Vice President Kamala Harris and billionaire Mark Cuban, another left-leaning crypto fan.

That ended with industry executives “lashing out” at the White House team, according to an account by Fox Business citing unnamed sources.

Trump had completed a personal reversal on the issue long before that.

In 2021, he told Fox Business that “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar.”

Three years later, Trump vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” The Republican platform promised to “end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown.”

By contrast, the Democratic platform didn't mention crypto at all.

Gallego, meanwhile, was among the Democrats who were becoming friendlier to the industry in 2024.

Stand with Crypto, an industry group, provides grades on members of Congress.

It gave Salinas, the woman whose 2022 victory Gallego cheered for its crypto impact, an “F” on the basis of four votes against the interests of the crypto industry.

By contrast, Gallego got an “A” in part with three votes when he was in the House with Salinas. On one of them, Gallego voted on May 23, 2024, with her and against the industry.

Three weeks later, Gallego's written answers to Stand with Crypto's questions helped him win the support of the industry during his Senate campaign.

He said he didn't buy or sell assets using the blockchain technology at the heart of digital currency trading, but did think it would play a “major role” in the future and “is driving economic growth and supporting millions of jobs across the country.”

“I know firsthand that when Congress fails to keep up with our adversaries and competitors, we are putting our nation's security and economic growth at risk,” Gallego wrote in his only answer that went beyond yes or no.

“I know that emerging technologies fuel innovation, including in digital assets and digital currency, and we must encourage and foster growth in this space. If we do not, other countries will. We must also provide regulatory clarity that promotes safe, responsible use of technology for investors, consumers, businesses, and everyday Arizonans.”

One of the questions involved whether he would support something like a 2023 House bill that was an earlier attempt to create a stablecoin regulatory framework.

That bill, dubbed the “Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act,” got almost no traction when Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, introduced it in July 2023. It never got a vote in the House and only picked up one co-sponsor, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-New York.

In July 2024, Gallego was one of 21 House Democrats to vote with almost every House Republican to override Biden's veto of the measure affecting SEC rules on crypto. The House fell short of the needed 2/3 vote because 183 House Democrats stuck with Biden's approach.

Gallego's more crypto-friendly rhetoric helped convince a super PAC supportive of crypto to back Gallego over Republican Kari Lake in their Senate contest.

Over a three-week span beginning in August 2024, Protect Progress, a political-action committee funded by people with ties to the crypto industry, spent $10 million in support of Gallego's candidacy.

The ads played up Gallego's biography as a combat veteran. His platoon commander in the Iraq War, a Republican, recalled an ambush attack and praised Gallego for “running towards enemy fire. He saved lives that day.”

The ad didn't mention crypto issues at all.

The super PAC was one of three crypto-aligned organizations, led by one called Fairshake, that spent a combined $291 million in the 2024 election cycle. Their spending was notably bipartisan, especially in an era when few PACs invest in both parties.

Only three candidates received more than Gallego: Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, $40 million and the fractionally larger sums spent supporting Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Michigan, and opposing the Senate campaign of former Rep. Katie Porter, D-California.

Four congressional candidates in Arizona also received support from the crypto-aligned super PACs: Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, $1.4 million; Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Arizona, $1.6 million; former Republican candidate Blake Masters, $583,000; and former Democratic candidate Andrei Cherny, $415,000.

For Selkis, who founded a crypto analytics firm, Gallego's recent vote shows the folly of helping Democrats at all.

Selkis is an enthusiastic Trump supporter who resigned his post as CEO of Messari after inflammatory social media posts following the first attempted assassination of Trump in July 2024.

“Anyone that votes against Trump at this point can die in a (expletive) fire,” he wrote in a post he later deleted. “Literal war.”

As Gallego and other Democrats blocked a vote on the stablecoin bill last month, Selkis ripped his allies at Fairshake for their credulity in dealing with Gallego, Slotkin and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-California.

“It's hard to overstate how useless everyone in the crypto political machine was aside from me and (Bitcoin magazine chief) David Bailey last year,” he wrote.

Stand with Crypto “gave A's and Fair Shake gave $20mm+ to these three traitors on the GENIUS Bill. I did my job. They failed.”","{'href': 'https://www.azcentral.com', 'title': 'The Arizona Republic'}","cryptocurrency"

Deutsche Bank is actively exploring tokenized deposit options and considering launching its own stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday. The report cited an interview with Sabih Behzad, the bank's head of digital assets and currencies transformation, who outlined the institution's strategic approach to digital currency initiatives.

Behzad explained that banks have numerous pathways into the stablecoin market, ranging from serving as reserve managers to issuing their own digital currencies, either independently or through industry consortiums. While Deutsche Bank hasn't yet announced its own tokenized deposit solution, the German institution participated in trials with UBS last year involving single bank tokens and continues evaluating whether to launch a stablecoin independently or join existing industry efforts.

The bank's exploration comes as several major financial institutions have already moved into tokenized deposits. Citi, HSBC, JP Morgan and UBS have all launched single bank solutions, while Deutsche Bank has been participating in collaborative initiatives. These include the Partior cross border payments platform alongside DBS, JPMorgan, and Standard Chartered, as well as multi bank tokenized deposit experiments in Germany through the commercial bank money token initiative.

Deutsche Bank already has some exposure to stablecoin development through its asset management division DWS, which partnered with Galaxy Digital and Flow Traders to create the AllUnity stablecoin joint venture. The bank has also expanded its services to cryptocurrency firms, positioning itself within the growing digital asset ecosystem.

The broader banking sector shows increasing interest in stablecoins, with Société Générale's FORGE becoming the first systemically important bank subsidiary to launch one. Santander is reportedly considering its own stablecoin, Standard Chartered has announced development plans, and discussions continue around a potential joint stablecoin among US banks.

In the past five years, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have seen their legacy and public perception evolve exponentially in real-time. While these forms of digital currency were once little more than food for thought on the internet for niche online communities to discuss, they have since become integral to modern fintech and economics.

Today, the Bitcoin price is soaring to unprecedented heights, reaching values it has never achieved before. In this way, Bitcoin's success reflects a growing shift in how the world approaches not only cryptocurrency but also financial markets as a whole.

As of writing, the value of Bitcoin was $111,336.20 USD per token, which is very nearly the highest value the currency has ever had. The highest value Bitcoin has ever had in its history was logged just a handful of hours before this writing, when it reached $111,691.50 USD per token.

To this end, not only is Bitcoin flourishing at the moment, but it is outright setting new high-water marks that it has never reached before. Fluctuations in the price of BTC are often linked to economic events such as interest rate announcements, geopolitical tensions, or ETF flows. All of these factors have aligned within the last few weeks, creating a dramatic uptick in value for the digitized currency.

Bitcoin's value had hit a six-month low in the first few weeks of April, dropping as low as $75,000.00 USD. However, since then, the cryptocurrency has been on a steady ascent. Furthermore, the coin doesn't seem poised to relent anytime soon, having built up so much momentum that it continues to break its own records.

When it debuted to the public in 2008, through a nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” the concept of cryptocurrency felt more like science fiction than reality. In 2008, a major superhero movie had just come out, online shopping was often viewed negatively, YouTube was still emerging, and MySpace reigned as the leading social media platform. However, over the next decade, society and culture gradually aligned with the vision that Bitcoin's anonymous creators outlined in that original whitepaper.

Bitcoin's true utility began to be realized over a decade after its release. In 2020, during a period of global unrest and challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin's popularity surged. While many skeptics and forecasters doubted that cryptocurrency was a legitimate venture or one that would endure, the digital currency ultimately proved its staying power in the following years. Today, what was once an overlooked innovation in finance is now an important element of global commerce. Nevertheless, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, making it essential for investors to be acutely aware of Bitcoin's current price.

Global Events

Economic factors like inflation, interest rates, and government policies significantly influence Bitcoin's price. Designed for high reactivity and swift changes, it responds noticeably to major global events, affecting its value.

Regulations

In 2020, people seemed to recognize the opportunity in this uncharted, largely unregulated landscape to build new lives for themselves. Cryptocurrency initially attracted investors eager to embrace such ambition and get in on the ground floor. At the outset, regulations surrounding digital currency were extremely lenient, which further fueled the excitement around it. As a result, any news about new regulations concerning cryptocurrency and its use can significantly impact the value of Bitcoin.

Technological Developments

Bitcoin has a twenty-one million coin cap, making it resistant to inflationary dilution. Scarcity, especially in a climate of money printing and fiat instability, has fueled a renewed interest in this cryptocurrency. Additionally, recent technological advancements surrounding the token and the acquisition of it have also aided in this boost of value and popularity.

Advancements such as the Lightning Network have enhanced Bitcoin's utility for fast, low-cost payments. These tools have helped to position the digitized currency as not just a store of value, but as an evolving financial tool.

Market Sentiment

Market sentiment, which includes the behavior of institutional investors, retail traders, and major market players, also helps to shape Bitcoin's price. When a well-known cryptocurrency influencer or guru forecasts that Bitcoin's price will drop soon, many investors tend to sell off their tokens. This sudden wave of selling causes Bitcoin's price to decrease, demonstrating the delicate relationship between the highly reactive coin and the community that closely observes it.

Multiple factors influence the fluctuations in Bitcoin's market value. Bitcoin can greatly alter its worth almost instantly. Critics often view this as a flaw in cryptocurrencies; however, it actually highlights the technology's exceptional strengths.

Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies were designed to be highly responsive and interactive, acting as smarter funds that swiftly adapt to market dynamics. The creation of Bitcoin was prompted by the 2008 recession, a period marked by disastrous market crashes. Therefore, Bitcoin's persistent volatility is not a drawback of its technology; rather, it illustrates how effectively this digital currency is connected to the market's fluctuations.

After nearly twenty years since its initial inception, Bitcoin has climbed its way out of obscurity and reached unprecedented levels of success. In 2020, when its value first began to skyrocket, many discredited the digitized currency and its value as little more than a passing fad. However, over five years later, the cryptocurrency is continuing to hit new highs and show the world how integral it has become to modern finance.

A group of well-known internet billionaires is supporting an ambitious and controversial idea to build a “network state” powered by blockchain on Native American property. This has brought up old questions about sovereignty, exploitation, and the future of digital governance.

The idea is to make a self-governing, crypto-based society with its own laws, money, and way of running things. Elon Musk and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan are two well-known people who have led this movement. It envisions privatised towns that are run by blockchain protocols and paid for using cryptocurrency.

Srinivasan made the phrase “network state” famous in his 2022 book, where he explained the theory. The idea is to create online communities that pool their money to buy land, establish towns, and eventually get diplomatic recognition as independent countries.

This involves using decentralised governance systems, such as decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), to handle day-to-day tasks like law enforcement and building infrastructure. These cities would put digital identification, crypto-financial systems, and meritocratic values ahead of traditional governance structures.

Srinivasan has already started experimental learning centres like Network School in Malaysia to teach top students how to use Bitcoin, AI, and tokenised governance tools to establish these communities.

Recent sources say that Native American reserves are being looked at as good places for these network states. The reasons include the semi-sovereign status of tribal nations, tax breaks, and the chance to make legal deals directly with tribal administrations.

But this plan has gotten a lot of criticism. Critics say that the people who support the initiative are “techno-colonialists,” which means they are using their economic power to take control over Native land while pretending to be innovative and working together. 

Indigenous leaders and campaigners are worried that this could lead to the same kind of exploitation that has happened in the past, when promises of development benefit businesses more than the people who live there.

Choosing to do this kind of research on marginalized groups raises moral problems about consent, representation, and power imbalances. People are worried that tribal property could become testing grounds for new ways of governing that don't have clear lines of responsibility.

Peter Thiel and Sam Altman, two venture capitalists, are also said to be participating in or supportive of the movement, along with Musk and Srinivasan. The idea is similar to other projects, such as Praxis, which is building crypto towns in other countries, and groups that are sponsoring libertarian enclaves in Wyoming and the Mediterranean.

These elite tech groups all agree that traditional government isn't working and that the future is in opt-in communities run by code. They say that blockchain makes things more open, allows for faster innovation, and gives people more power than traditional governments do.

Even with tribal approval, establishing a network state encounters significant obstacles. In many areas, U.S. federal law still applies on tribal grounds, and sovereignty is not absolute. Negotiations would involve complicated legal systems and working together between governments.

Also, combining DAO governance with Indigenous practices and values might be a source of conflict. Tribal leaders are not sure if turning reserves into crypto-based enclaves will have long-term effects on society, the environment, and culture.

Shiba inu (SHIB) remains locked in a downtrend despite recovering from overnight lows, as the sharp drop in the ""daily burn"" rate has dented deflation prospects.

The token has recovered to trade near $0.000012650 at the time of writing, having reached a low of $0.00001234 during the Asian hours. Still, the downtrend identified by trendlines connecting May 12 and May 23 highs and the low reached on May 17 remains intact.

SHIB's daily burn rate dropped by 63%, threatening to derail the progress toward deflationary tokenomics, while trading volume surged by 78%. The daily burn rate refers to the number of SHIB tokens permanently destroyed or removed from circulation each day.

Token burns are widely used to introduce a deflationary appeal to cryptocurrencies. A deflationary token is a cryptocurrency whose supply is designed to decrease over time, typically through mechanisms like token burning.

So, the slower burn rate presents a headwind for SHIB. Still, on-chain data signaled $0.000012 and $0.000013 as potential support zones.

Solana's SOL SOL$156.05 posted a solid recovery over the past 24 hours, rising as much as 4.83% before retreating to trade around $152.16. While volatility remains elevated, the cryptocurrency has formed a pattern of higher lows, suggesting underlying strength amid a fragile macro backdrop.

The broader market remains focused on renewed trade talks between the United States and China, which kicked off Monday in London. The meetings bring together top officials, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, to address longstanding tensions over tariffs and tech restrictions. 

While the two sides struck a temporary truce last month, both have since accused each other of backsliding. Analysts say the rare earth export curbs and AI chip controls remain key sticking points that could influence global market sentiment—including for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Amid this uncertainty, Solana's network continues to show expansion potential, with some institutions projecting price targets as high as $420–$620 in 2026. In the near term, traders will likely watch how macro developments affect appetite for risk-on trades in assets like SOL.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,566.74 is up 1.28% in the past 24 hours to reach $2,538.25. This comes as new data from CoinShares shows ETH drew in $295 million in weekly inflows, the most of any digital asset last week. The surge brings month-to-date flows to $296 million and lifts Ethereum's total assets under management to $14.09 billion.

Technically, ETH rebounded from earlier weakness to retest the $2,540 resistance level after consolidating near $2,500,  according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

The recovery reflects renewed confidence among institutional investors, who have now supported 15 straight trading days of spot ETF net inflows according to SoSoValue. Combined with steady DeFi and staking growth, ETH appears poised to benefit if it can firmly clear $2,540.

Major cryptocurrencies showed little bullish momentum Monday, even as hopes for the U.S.-China trade talks lifted Asian stocks.

Bitcoin BTC$108,320.84, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat-to-negative near $105,650, having carved out a doji candle, a sign of indecision, on Sunday, according to data source TradingView.

Data from Blockchain.com showed a marked slowdown in network activity, with the seven-day moving average of daily on-chain transactions falling to 315.48K, the lowest in at least a year.

Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$2.30 struggled to gather upside traction despite topping a bearish trendline from the mid-May highs. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $2.24 at press time, down over 1% on the day (UTC). Volatility may increase this week as the XRP Ledger's APEX 2025 conference kicks off in Singapore.

Meme cryptocurrency dogecoin DOGE$0.18710 traded nearly 2% lower, closing in on 18 cents, having failed to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) over the weekend.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.3%, topping the 24,000 mark for the first time since March 24, according to data source TradingView. The move came in response to the optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks this week.

""Optimism is as high as it's been since Trump's election as top trade deputies will meet in London starting on Monday. There are indications that talks will go all week and Trump himself is optimistic,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst Adam Button said in a blog post.

""The meeting should go very well,"" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Friday, announcing the new round of trade talks in London.

Other Asian indices, such as South Korea's KOSPI and China's Shanghai Composite, also gained ground despite the deepening consumer and factory gate deflation in China.

China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. The CPI first turned negative in February.

Meanwhile, the producer price index, or factory gate prices, fell 3.3% year-over-year in May, registering a sharper decline than the 3.2% drop analysts had expected. Factory gate prices have been in deflation since October 2022.

According to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, the U.S. tariffs are generating a deflationary shock for major exporters like China.

""China's producer price inflation for consumer goods is down to its lowest level since the 2008 crisis. U.S. tariffs will now push China into full-on deflation. All necessary conditions for deflation are there: weak consumption and a debt overhang. U.S. tariffs are now the catalyst...,"" Brooks said on X.

The worsening deflation could prompt China to stimulate domestic demand with further liquidity easing.

China's central bank in May cut the key interest rates by 10 basis points to a historic low while reducing the reserve requirement ratio, releasing liquidity into the market. Last week, the state-run China Securities Journal reported that the People's Bank of China may lower the reserve requirement ratio further later this year to support growth and restart government bond trading.

More Chinese stimulus could bode well for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.

The U.S. consumer price index for May due Wednesday will be scrutinized by markets for clues that Trump's tariffs are adding to price pressures in the economy. 

The headline CPI is seen matching April's pace of 0.2% month-on-month growth, equating to an annualized 2.5% rise versus April's 2.3% increase, according to FXStreet. Meanwhile, the core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have ticked higher to 2.9% in May from 2.8% in April. 

Economists at Barclays expect the data to show first signs of tariffs-related price increases across wide range of core goods. 

A hotter-than-expected print could dent Fed rate cuts, potentially injecting downside volatility in financial markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","XRP price will hit $25 if ETF approved, then crash 90%, new analysis says","https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-price-25-etf-approved-crash-90-new-analysis","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:28:49 GMT","

 XRP traders say it has the potential to rally to $27 as ETF approval odds increase. 

Key takeaway:

Analysts predict XRP could hit $20–$27 in 2025.

XRP ETF approval odds jump to 98% on Polymarket.

XRP (XRP) recouped losses made between Wednesday and Friday and hovered around $2.26, up 9.7% from its local low of $2.06. 

Analysts said the altcoin may rally into double-digits amid increasing optimism of a possible spot XRP ETF approval in 2025. 

The likelihood of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2025 jumped to 98% on Tuesday, according to Polymarket data.

Multiple spot XRP ETF applications from major players like Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares have intensified pressure on the SEC, signaling robust demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles. 

The launch of XRP futures ETFs by the CME Group on May 19, with $19 million in first-day trading volume, demonstrated market maturity and institutional interest, addressing SEC concerns about regulated derivatives markets. 

Three companies across different sectors have unveiled plans to invest over $471 million in XRP treasuries, including Webus International's $300 million XRP strategic reserve filing with the SEC, further underscoring corporate adoption and growing institutional trust. 

🚨 BREAKING: Chinese firm Webus files with US SEC to raise $300M for $XRP treasury plan and Ripple payments integration. pic.twitter.com/J2dgaCxBfN

These factors and Ripple's legal clarity after the SEC dropped a lawsuit in March have bolstered market sentiment.

Despite SEC delays on the filings, the CME futures market's success and corporate strategies have driven Polymarket's approval odds from 68% in April to as high as 98% in early June, reflecting expectations for approvals by Dec. 31.

Approval of these funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially driving prices higher, with some analysts predicting $50 if major players like BlackRock step in. 

XRP price has been stuck below $3.00 since Feb. 1, but analysts say that the crypto could see a massive recovery from the current level, with a target of $25 and above. 

XRP price is “targeting double digits” in 2025, according to market analyst Egrag Crypto.

Using his “The Guardian Arch” analysis, the analyst suggested that XRP's price may rally to $20, potentially topping out at $27 based on past price patterns and timelines.

This analysis uses the relative positions of the 21-week exponential moving average and the 33-week simple moving average as key indicators to identify potential turning points. 

The analysis also considers the formation of a bull flag in the monthly time frame, which suggests a continuation of the uptrend toward $20, followed by a possible 86% drop to $3.00 during the bear market.

Fellow analyst Jaydee_757 echoed this, saying that XRP's current technical setup is “comparing the 2017 hidden bullish divergence” in the weekly time frame. 

Related: These 5 XRP charts hint at a price rally toward $3 in June

Jaydee_757 explained that the bullish divergence in 2017 led to a 20x rise in XRP price from around $0.0055 to all-time highs above $3.40.

If the 2017 scenario is repeated, a playout of the bullish divergence could see the price rally toward $25 and beyond, representing an over 1,000% increase from current levels. 

Jaydee_757 also said that this massive rally could be followed by a 90% price crash during the bear market, suggesting that $25 could mark the top for XRP's bull cycle in 2025.

These analyses align with previous predictions of XRP reaching $27 based on chart fractals, Eliot wave analysis and Fibonacci extensions.

 Metaplanet hopes to buy 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027, which would make it the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies. 

Japanese investment company Metaplanet's shares spiked on market opening after announcing its plan to raise $5.4 billion to buy Bitcoin last week. 

Metaplanet's stock (3350T) shot up over 12% in the June 9 trading session, trading at 1,505 yen ($10.42), according to Google Finance. However, at its peak of the trading session so far, Metaplanet's stock reached highs of 1,641 yen ($11.36), representing a 22% increase.

Metaplanet updated its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027 in a June 6 stock acquisition rights program announcement, increasing its previous target of 21,000 BTC.

If successful, the acquisition would make Metaplanet the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, behind Michael Saylor's company, Strategy, according to Bitbo data. 

Metaplanet holds 8,888 Bitcoin following its latest 1,088 BTC acquisition announcement on June 2.

As part of its new 555 million plan, the firm will need to buy 201,112 by 2027, at a cost of over $21 billion. By 2026, Metaplanet has flagged plans to hold 100,000 Bitcoin.

Previously, under its 21 million plan, Metaplanet would hold 21,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2026, with no concrete plan for more buys.

Metaplanet first announced it had bought Bitcoin on July 22, 2024, and its shares went up by 19% to 173 yen ($1.10). In the year since its first buy, the stock price is up by over 1,744%.

A growing number of companies have decided to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with South Korean entertainment company K Wave Media becoming one of the latest on June 4.

Corporate Bitcoin treasuries collectively hold over three million in Bitcoin, worth over $342 billion, according to Bitbo data, out of more than 19 million currently in circulation.

The Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms now holding a combined 3.2% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist, a June 3 report from Standard Chartered found. 

Other companies have also seen their stock prices surge after announcing their Bitcoin buying plans. Paris-based crypto company Blockchain Group started buying Bitcoin on Nov. 5, and its stock spiked 225% to 0.48 euros ($0.52).

Meanwhile, shares in the Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp nearly doubled, rising 91%, after the company said it plans to raise $100 million to seed its first of many Bitcoin buys.

However, not all have experienced the spike. Norwegian crypto brokerage firm K33 announced on May 28 its intent to buy and hold the cryptocurrency, but its share price traded flat, down 1.96%.

Video game retailer GameStop shares jumped nearly 12% on March 26 after the company announced plans to purchase Bitcoin. However, it dropped 11% on May 11 after the retailer made its first purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Tether plans to open-source Bitcoin mining OS; CEO says 'no need' for 3rd party vendors","https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-bitcoin-mining-software-open-source","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:42:01 GMT","

 The USDt issuer plans to launch its open-source project by the fourth quarter of 2025, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. 

Stablecoin issuer Tether plans to open-source its Bitcoin mining software, a move the company said would allow new miners to enter the market without relying on expensive third-party vendors.

By open-sourcing its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS), “A horde of new Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the game and compete to keep the network safe,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a Monday X post. 

Ardoino described MOS as scalable and modular, “built with a peer-to-peer [Internet of Things] architecture at its core.” 

The new operating system will support existing mining infrastructure, including several containers and other power devices, he said. 

Ardoino said the project is expected to be rolled out by the fourth quarter of 2025.

The new project expands on Tether's ongoing efforts to promote decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April, the company partnered with the Ocean mining pool to help decentralize block building by committing its current and future hashrate to the protocol.

Large Bitcoin miners have a significant advantage over smaller players due to their economies of scale, ability to negotiate favorable power contracts and increased hashrate. However, even these large players are diversifying their business strategy to remain competitive in a post-halving world.

Some miners have built large Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries to benefit from the asset's price appreciation during the bull market, while others have repurposed NGUs for artificial intelligence applications. 

For Hive Digital, revenue from AI workloads has generated significantly more income than crypto mining, which has prompted the company to invest more heavily in this area.

“Institutions are much more interested in us with our AI than Bitcoin,” Frank Holmes, Hive's executive chairman, told Cointelegraph in September. 

Still, some companies have gone all in on Bitcoin by shedding less competitive parts of their operations. Bitcoin miner Cango, for example, generated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months after selling off its legacy operations to focus solely on its mining business.

New Doubts about Milky Way–Andromeda Collision, Explanation of 2023 Marine Heat Wave and Worms That Build Towers

The Milky Way's big crash with Andromeda might not be a sure thing. Plus, we discuss an overheated ocean, a giant planet circling a tiny star and worms that build living towers.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed.

You've probably heard that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is doomed to collide with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy sometime around 5 billion years from now. But according to new research, maybe we shouldn't count on this multigalactic merger deal going through.

In a study published last Monday in Nature Astronomy, researchers who analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope and NASA's Hubble say the event is more of a coin flip than a given: the team's 100,000 computer simulations suggest there's just about a 50–50 chance of the two galaxies colliding within the next 10 billion years or so. When you look at the next 4 to 5 billion years, that chance drops down to around 2%.

In other space news, scientists are buzzing about a tiny star that punches way above its weight. TOI-6894 is a red dwarf that's roughly 20% as massive as our sun. But in a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, researchers say they've spotted the signature of a giant planet orbiting the little guy. The planet, called TOI-6894b, is described as a low-density gas giant—it is a little bigger than Saturn, but only has around half as much mass. Astronomers say the presence of a gas giant around such a small star is so surprising that it challenges the most widely accepted theory of planet formation. That theory, called core accretion, suggests that giant planets are born when their solid cores get massive enough to start pulling in lots of gas. Smaller stars generally lack enough gas and dust in their protoplanetary discs to allow for such a process, but this red dwarf ended up with a gas giant anyhow. Because red dwarf stars are super common in our galaxy, this could mean gas giants are more plentiful than we thought. The researchers will use the James Webb Space Telescope to study the planet's atmosphere, which should provide more clues about its formation.

Now let's move on to some environmental news. Back in the summer of 2023 an extreme marine heat wave hit the North Atlantic Ocean, affecting water temperatures from Greenland to the Sahara and all the way over to the Americas. A study published last Wednesday in Nature aimed to explain why. The researchers say the summer temperature surge was equivalent to around 20 years of typical warming in the North Atlantic. While climate change, of course, played a role, the new study pinpoints some other factors that made water temperatures particularly hot that summer. For starters, in June and July of that year, the winds over the North Atlantic were weaker than at any other period on record, which meant less churning to mix sun-warmed surface waters. As a result heat was more concentrated and rose more quickly.

The researchers also note that it's possible a reduction in sulphur emissions led to fewer clouds in some areas, so more sunlight hit the water. But the scientists were quick to add that weak wind was the primary driver—and that climate change is likely to make things worse. Reducing pollution from the atmosphere, generally speaking, remains a great thing to do. In a news release, the study's lead author noted that if we don't cut down our fossil fuel emissions, extreme marine heat waves like the one we saw in 2023 will only get more common and more intense. And that's bad news for everyone: warm water releases heat into the atmosphere, contributing to heat waves and severe rainstorms. Warmer oceans also mean more hurricanes. And higher water temperatures are tied to increases in coral bleaching as well.

But another study, published last Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science, offers some hope for ailing coral—not from bleaching but from a disease that can be just as devastating to a reef.

Stony coral tissue loss disease, or SCTLD, was first identified off the coast of Florida just over a decade ago and has now been spotted on reefs throughout the Caribbean. More than 20 species of coral can catch it. SCTLD quickly destroys a coral's soft tissue, with some species dying within weeks of symptoms appearing. It's not clear exactly what causes SCTLD, but it seems likely that bacteria at least play a part because treating affected corals with an antibiotic paste has been shown to help them survive.

The issue with this treatment is that it's a temporary fix, and it opens the door for the potential evolution of a resistant strain of whatever bacterium is involved. This new study reports on the promising results of treating coral with probiotics instead.

Corals have microbiomes just like we do, and a boost of good bacteria seems to help keep them healthy. The researchers behind the new study started by testing more than 200 strains of bacteria from disease-resistant corals and ultimately focusing on a particularly promising strain from great star corals in the lab. In 2020 the scientists took their experiment into the ocean, applying a solution of seawater and probiotics to a Florida reef impacted by SCTLD and using weighted plastic bags to create a sort of in-ocean aquarium that kept the treatment from floating away. After two and a half years, the probiotics seemed to be preventing the spread of SCTLD without causing any other disruptions to the reefs' microbiome. More research is needed to see how this treatment might impact coral in other regions, but probiotics could prove to be an important tool for fighting this devastating disease.

We'll wrap up today's episode with something fun, if maybe also a little bit creepy: an act of “collective hitchhiking” featuring a living tower of worms.

Nematodes are tiny worms that you probably don't spend much time thinking about, but they're actually the most abundant animals on Earth, making up an estimated four fifths of all animal life on our planet. According to a study published last Thursday in Current Biology, these creatures might sometimes use their vast numbers to make up for their miniscule size.

Individual nematodes will sometimes stand on their tails and wave around to try to hitch a ride on a passing animal. Scientists have long suspected that they can also link together to form multi-worm “towers” to increase their height, but this had only ever been observed in a lab setting. In the new study scientists describe seeing some of these waving worm towers inside decaying apples and pears found in the dirt of orchards.

Further observations proved that, far from a chaotic pile of worms, these structures reflect the kind of superorganism behavior we see in slime molds and fire ants. While many species of nematode could be found in each piece of rotting fruit, the towers only consisted of members of the same species. Once in place, the nematodes would wave in unison as if they were one giant worm. Experiments in the lab showed that nematodes could self-assemble in just two hours and remain stable for more than 12. They could even create little arms with which to explore the space and build bridges to cross gaps to new locations. So the next time you're struggling with a group project at school or work, just remind yourself that even nematodes can figure out how to work together.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Construction Crew Was Restoring a City Hall—And Found an Ancient Roman Theater Underneath","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a64993523/croatia-roman-theater-earthquake/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

The discovery was only possible because of the damage caused by an earthquake.

Here's what you'll learn when read this story:

A damaging earthquake in Croatia had an unexpected bright side—revealing hidden Roman-era secrets. Crews working in the basement to restore the city hall of Sisak, Croatia, after a 2020 earthquake discovered a small Roman theater, complete with stone rows and the theater's stage. 

The find, as announced by Croatia's Ministry of Culture and Media, shows how Sisak grew from a Roman military outpost into a full-fledged city sometime during the third century A.D., with the small theater, known as an odeon, a sign of the prominence. 

According to Brittanica, an odeum is a small concert hall, typically constructed as a theater for both musicians and orators to perform. They were not as grand as amphitheaters, but were similarly designed so that all instruments—or voices—could be easily heard.

Archaeologists called in to investigate the discovery uncovered three parallel semi-circular rows of stone blocks to hold an audience (all roughly 65 feet across), space for an orchestra, and the theater's podium (stage). 

“This extremely valuable find, which provides new insight into the size of the ancient city and further completes the interpretation of the urbanism of ancient Sisak,” the ministry wrote in a translated statement.

At some point, a “monumental building with buttresses” was built over the theater, although archaeologists said more research is needed to understand what that building was designed for. The city hall structure was constructed in 1914 over the older buildings already on site. 

Croatian officials didn't know the odeum existed under the city's main government building until the 2020 earthquake, which caused structural damage to the site that required extensive underground work. Structural reinforcement needs sent crews digging below the existing structure, and that effort revealed the history of the site. 

To avoid again burying the odeum, the city has preserved the ruins at the current location and created a window into the past with glass flooring. 

While the northern Croatia city is now known as Sisak, it was once Roman Siscia, and was most prominent in the late third century, according to Atlas Obscura. It was even named a capital city in 295 A.D., and was known for minting bronze coins for Rome.

The restoration of Sisak's city hall has revitalized its original color, the original design of the main entrance (created by Dionis Sunko in 1914), the original main gable, and the original tiling of the building. 

Not much of the original Siscia still remains, save for a piece of a defensive wall outside the Sisak Cathedral. This newly-discovered Roman odeum has now become a prominent piece of the city's history, and will be a part of its future for many years to come.

Spintronics could revolutionize how we store data.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Magnetism can be a strange and powerful force. In an almost supernatural way, magnets stick to surfaces with no adhesives, which is why games like Etch-a-Sketch and Operation have fascinated generations of kids. 

Most of what we see every day is ferromagnetism (think refrigerator magnets), the phenomenon describing how metals like iron and nickel are magnetized in a magnetic field and thus adhere to certain surfaces. There are also paramagnetic materials, like aluminum, which have a weak and almost unnoticeable attraction to magnets. There's even antiferromagnetism—a type of magnetism in which magnetic atoms or ions in a material cancel their magnetism out if they end up next to each other.

And then there is a magnetism that is none of the above. By merging properties of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, MIT physicists created a new kind magnetism that may someday revolutionize the memory chips that store data in laptops and smartphones. It's called “p-wave magnetism,” and it makes use of the spin of atoms in a material rather than their charge to create magnetic properties. 

“[This discovery] opens new opportunities for developing ultrafast, energy-efficient and high-endurance antiferromagnetic spintronic devices,” the researchers said in a study recently published in Nature.

The find is particularly huge for the field of spintronics. It might sound like a DJ spinning tracks on an alien planet—and, to be fair, it's almost as far out—but it's actually a scientific discipline centered around manipulating the spins of atoms in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. 

Atoms in ferromagnets are known to spin in the same direction, and as these atoms spin, so do their electrons. Those electrons, spinning furiously around their nuclei, generate magnetic fields that cause ferromagnets stick to some metals. On the other hand, neighboring atoms in antiferromagnets have opposite spins, which means the electrons generating their magnetic fields are spinning in opposite directions. 

Antiferromagnets do not show visible magnetization, because the spins of their electrons and atoms cancel each other out—but the MIT team found a way around that. They synthesized nickel iodide (NiI2) in a lab and observed the behavior of the electrons in its atoms. Like a ferromagnet, the electrons did have one spin orientation they preferred, and like an antiferromagnet, there were enough electrons spinning in the opposite direction to cancel out magnetism. But there was something more.

It turned out that nickel atoms form spiral patterns that mirror each other, which made it possible to manipulate the spins of those atoms with a voltage. This caused some atoms to switch their spiral path from spinning left to right, and vice versa, turning the material into a p-wave magnet. And the electrons had their spins switched right along with the atoms as a whole in the same direction of that voltage. 

This is how spintronics could seriously level up computer chips. With data taking the form of an electron's spin rather than its charge, it leaves much more space for storage. Spintronics could mean chips able to store amounts of information orders of magnitude greater than anything currently available. 

“The reported results represent the first observation of an electrically-switchable unconventional [opposite direction] magnet,” the researchers said. “These findings open a new frontier to realize symmetry-protected voltage-based switching of non-relativistic spin polarization in a compensated magnet.”

Werner syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging. From their twenties, patients develop gray hair, hair loss, cataracts, diabetes, and other age-related conditions normally seen in the elderly. Additionally, patients develop severe and untreatable skin ulcers, often requiring limb amputation, and face early death from cardiovascular diseases or cancer. This debilitating condition, which affects approximately nine per million people in Japan, lacks effective treatment options.

Interestingly, a recent study from the Bohr lab (Nat Commun, 2019 Nov 21;10(1):5284) showed that patients with WS model systems and patients had decreased levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a biomolecule crucial for cellular energy production, DNA repair, and various metabolic processes. This finding suggested that NAD+ depletion may contribute to the progression of the disease. While direct NAD+ supplementation isn't feasible in mammals, using its precursor -- nicotinamide riboside (NR) from Niagen Bioscience -- has shown promising results in animal studies, extending lifespan and protecting against age-related decline. In human clinical trials, NR has also demonstrated benefits against chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and muscle weakness across various populations. However, the effects of NR in WS remained largely unexplored -- until now.

In a recent study, a research team led by Associate Professor Masaya Koshizaka from the Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University/Department of Diabetes, Metabolism and Endocrinology, Chiba University Hospital, Japan, conducted the world's first rigorous clinical trial of NR in patients with WS. Their paper, published in Aging Cell on June 03, 2025, was co-authored by University President Koutaro Yokote, Assistant Professor Hisaya Kato, Associate Professor Yoshiro Maezawa, and Assistant Professor Mayumi Shoji, all from Chiba University, along with Affiliate Professor Vilhelm Bohr from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

This groundbreaking work involved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NR supplementation. The research team enrolled patients with WS in a crossover design, where participants received either a daily dose of NR or a placebo for 26 weeks, switched treatments for another 26 weeks. Researchers tracked NAD+ blood levels, skin ulcer size, arterial stiffness, and kidney function.

NR supplementation significantly increased NAD+ levels in patient blood compared to placebo. Importantly, NR improved arterial stiffness (a marker of cardiovascular disease risk), reduced the skin ulcer area, and appeared to slow the progression of kidney dysfunction -- all without any serious side effects. Moreover, a comprehensive examination of metabolites in blood revealed that NR treatment reduced levels of creatinine and other compounds associated with kidney dysfunction. This suggests that NR may help protect kidney function, addressing another serious complication of WS.

Dr. Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, Global Director of Niagen Bioscience's External Research Program called CERP, commented, ""this study represents a significant step forward in understanding how NAD+ restoration with NR may help address the underlying biology of WS. By supporting cardiovascular, skin, and kidney health, NR shows potential to improve the quality of life for patients with this devastating condition. We are proud to support Chiba University's groundbreaking research as part of our ongoing commitment to advancing NAD+ science for rare and underserved diseases.""

The treatment's multiple benefits across many different organ systems indicate that NAD+ depletion may be a fundamental mechanism in WS that can be targeted therapeutically. ""Our findings suggest NR could serve as a valuable treatment option for two major symptoms, arteriosclerosis and skin ulcers, as well as for preventing kidney function decline,"" explains Dr. Koshizaka. The results are particularly significant given that untreatable skin ulcers affect well over 70% of patients with WS, often leading to amputation, while cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of early mortality in this population.

Though larger studies are needed to extend these findings, this pioneering research offers new hope for patients with WS who have long lacked effective treatment options. Beyond its immediate implications for this rare condition, the study also provides valuable insights into the biology of aging and potential interventions to address age-related decline more broadly.

""We hope our work will accelerate studies on not only WS but also other premature aging disorders and common age-related diseases -- ultimately helping to extend health span and improve quality of life in both patients and the broader population,"" concludes Dr. Koshizaka.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How a common antibiotic fuels bacterial resistance","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250609073225.htm","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:27:08 GMT","

Antibiotics are supposed to wipe out bacteria, yet the drugs can sometimes hand microbes an unexpected advantage.

A new study from Rutgers Health shows that ciprofloxacin, a staple treatment for urinary tract infections, throws Escherichia coli (E. coli) into an energy crisis that saves many cells from death and speeds the evolution of full-blown resistance.

""Antibiotics can actually change bacterial metabolism,"" said Barry Li, a student at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School pursuing a dual doctoral degree for physician-scientists and the first author of the paper published in Nature Communications. ""We wanted to see what those changes do to the bugs' chances of survival.""

Li and senior author Jason Yang focused on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecular fuel that powers cells. When ATP levels crash, cells experience ""bioenergetic stress."" To mimic that stress, the team engineered E. coli with genetic drains that constantly burned ATP or its cousin nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Then, they pitted both the engineered strains and normal bacteria against ciprofloxacin.

The results surprised the researchers. The drug and the genetic drains each slashed ATP, but rather than slowing down, the bacteria revved up. Respiration soared, and the cells spewed extra reactive-oxygen molecules that can damage DNA. That frenzy produced two troubling outcomes.

First, more of the bacteria cells survived.

In time-kill tests, ten times as many stressed cells weathered a lethal ciprofloxacin dose compared with unstressed controls. These hardy stragglers, called persister cells, lie low until the drug is gone and then rebound to launch a new infection.

People have long blamed sluggish metabolism for persister cell formation.

""People expected a slower metabolism to cause less killing,"" Li said. ""We saw the opposite. The cells ramp up metabolism to refill their energy tanks and that turns on stress responses that slow the killing.""

Follow-up experiments traced the protection to the stringent response, a bacterial alarm system that reprograms the cell under stress.

Second, stressed cells mutated faster to evolve antibiotic resistance.

While persisters keep infections smoldering, genetic resistance can render a drug useless outright. The Rutgers group cycled E. coli through escalating ciprofloxacin doses and found that stressed cells reached the resistance threshold four rounds sooner than normal cells. DNA sequencing and classic mutation tests pointed to oxidative damage and error-prone repair as the culprits.

""The changes in metabolism are making antibiotics work less well and helping bacteria evolve resistance,"" said Yang, an assistant professor at the medical school and Chancellor Scholar of microbiology, biochemistry & molecular genetics.

Preliminary measurements show that gentamicin and ampicillin also drain ATP in addition to ciprofloxacin. The stress effect may span very different pathogens, including the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is highly sensitive to ATP shocks.

If so, the discovery casts new light on a global threat. Antibiotic resistance already contributes to 1.27 million deaths a year. Strategies that ignore the metabolic fallout of treatment may be missing a key lever.

The findings suggest several changes for antibiotic development and use.

First, screen candidate antibiotics for unintended energy-drain side effects. Second, pair existing drugs with anti-evolution boosters that block the stress pathways or mop up the extra oxygen radicals. Third, reconsider the instinct to blast infections with the highest possible dose. Earlier studies and the new data both hint that extreme concentrations can trigger the very stress that protects bacteria.

""Bacteria turn our attack into a training camp,"" Yang said. ""If we can cut the power to that camp, we can keep our antibiotics working longer.""

Li and Yang are planning on testing compounds that soothe bioenergetic stress in the hope of turning the microbial energy crisis back into an Achilles' heel rather than a shield.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Shocking brain cancer breakthrough: Electric fields supercharge immune assault","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250609060137.htm","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:35:38 GMT","

A new study led by Keck Medicine of USC researchers may have uncovered an effective combination therapy for glioblastoma, a brain tumor diagnosis with few available effective treatments. According to the National Brain Tumor Society, the average survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is eight months.

The study finds that using Tumor Treating Fields therapy (TTFields), which delivers targeted waves of electric fields directly into tumors to stop their growth and signal the body's immune system to attack cancerous tumor cells, may extend survival among patients with glioblastoma, when combined with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (temozolomide).

TTFields disrupt tumor growth using low-intensity, alternating electric fields that push and pull key structures inside tumor cells in continually shifting directions, making it difficult for the cells to multiply. Preventing tumor growth gives patients a better chance of successfully fighting the cancer. When used to treat glioblastoma, TTFields are delivered through a set of mesh electrodes that are strategically positioned on the scalp, generating fields at a precise frequency and intensity focused on the tumor. Patients wear the electrodes for approximately 18 hours a day.

Researchers observed that TTFields attract more tumor-fighting T cells, which are white blood cells that identify and attack cancer cells, into and around the glioblastoma. When followed by immunotherapy, these T cells stay active longer and are replaced by even stronger, more effective tumor-fighting T cells.

""By using TTFields with immunotherapy, we prime the body to mount an attack on the cancer, which enables the immunotherapy to have a meaningful effect in ways that it could not before,"" said David Tran, MD, PhD, chief of neuro-oncology with Keck Medicine, co-director of the USC Brain Tumor Center and corresponding author of the study. ""Our findings suggest that TTFields may be the key to unlocking the value of immunotherapy in treating glioblastoma.""

TTFields are often combined with chemotherapy in cancer treatment. However, even with aggressive treatment, the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. Immunotherapy, while successful in many other cancer types, has also not proved effective for glioblastoma when used on its own.

However, in this study, adding immunotherapy to TTFields and chemotherapy was associated with a 70% increase in overall survival. Notably, patients with larger, unresected (not surgically removed) tumors showed an even stronger immune response to TTFields and lived even longer. This suggests that, when it comes to kick-starting the body's immune response against the cancer, having a larger tumor may provide more targets for the therapy to work against.

Using alternating electric fields to unlock immunotherapy 

Pembrolizumab, the immunotherapy used in this study, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), which enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancers by improving T cells' ability to identify and attack cancer cells.

However, there are typically few T cells in and around glioblastomas because these tumors originate in the brain and are shielded from the body's natural immune response by the blood-brain barrier. This barrier safeguards the brain by tightly regulating which cells and substances enter from the bloodstream. Sometimes, this barrier even blocks T cells and other therapies that could help kill brain tumors.

This immunosuppressive environment inside and around the glioblastoma is what makes common cancer therapies like pembrolizumab and chemotherapy significantly less effective in treating it. Tran theorized the best way to get around this issue was to start an immune reaction directly inside the tumor itself, an approach known as in situ immunization, using TTFields.

This study demonstrates that combining TTFields with immunotherapy triggers a potent immune response within the tumor -- one that ICIs can then amplify to bolster the body's own defense against cancer.

""Think of it like a team sport -- immunotherapy sends players in to attack the tumor (the offense), while TTFields weaken the tumor's ability to fight back (the defense). And just like in team sports, the best defense is a good offense,"" said Tran, who is also a member of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Study methodology and results

The study analyzed data from 2-THE-TOP, a Phase 2 clinical trial, which enrolled 31 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients who had completed chemoradiation therapy. Of those, 26 received TTFields combined with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Seven of these 26 patients had inoperable tumors due to their locations -- an especially high-risk subgroup with the worst prognosis and few treatment options.

Patients in the trial were given six to 12 monthly treatments of chemotherapy alongside TTFields for up to 24 months. The number and duration of treatments were determined by patients' response to treatment. The immunotherapy was given every three weeks, starting with the second dose of chemotherapy, for up to 24 months.

Patients who used the device alongside chemotherapy and immunotherapy lived approximately 10 months longer than patients who had used the device with chemotherapy alone in the past. Moreover, those with large, inoperable tumors lived approximately 13 months longer and showed much stronger immune activation compared to patients who underwent surgical removal of their tumors.

""Further studies are needed to determine the optimal role of surgery in this setting, but these findings may offer hope, particularly for glioblastoma patients who do not have surgery as an option,"" said Tran.

Moving the research forward

Keck Medicine is participating in the multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial to validate the efficacy of TTFields with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Tran, who has been researching TTFields for more than a decade, serves as the chair of the steering committee for this trial. Frances Chow, MD, neuro-oncologist with USC Norris, is the principal investigator of the Keck Medicine study site.

This Phase 3 trial, currently open at 28 sites across the United States, Europe and Israel, aims to enroll over 740 patients through April 2029, including those with gross total resection, partial resection or biopsy-only tumors to assess the extent of how surgically removing tumors influences immune response.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Krakencoder predicts brain function 20x better than past methods","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250609054347.htm","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:19:06 GMT","

Using an algorithm they call the Krakencoder, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine are a step closer to unraveling how the brain's wiring supports the way we think and act. The study, published June 5 in Nature Methods, used imaging data from the Human Connectome Project to align neural activity with its underlying circuitry.

Mapping how the brain's anatomical connections and activity patterns relate to behavior is crucial not only for understanding how the brain works generally but also for identifying biomarkers of disease, predicting outcomes in neurological disorders and designing personalized interventions.

Addressing the Elephant in the Room

The brain consists of a complex network of interconnected neurons whose collective activity drives our behavior. The structural connectome represents the physical wiring of the brain, the map of how different regions are anatomically connected. The other piece of the puzzle is the functional connectome, which represents patterns of neuronal activity between different parts of the brain, highlighting regions that activate together during specific tasks or at rest. Surprisingly, scientists have found that regions that are ""wired together"" don't always ""fire together.""

""But we're still just scratching the surface of how brain networks relate to the tasks of everyday life, like solving a math problem, having a conversation with a friend or driving a car,"" said senior author Dr. Amy Kuceyeski, professor of mathematics in radiology and in neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine.

While many researchers are modeling the relationship between functional and structural connectomes, they come up with different maps. ""Everybody uses different methods to take pictures of the brain's networks,"" Dr. Kuceyeski explained. For example, when using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain scans, different methods for processing the same raw images can generate different connectomes.

Dr. Kuceyeski likens this patchwork approach to examining an elephant in a dark room, where one person is touching the trunk, somebody a leg, someone else an ear. ""Our fundamental assumption is that each set of choices in the imaging and processing pipelines provides a different view of the same underlying system,"" said Keith Jamison, the study's first author and a research associate in Dr. Kuceyeski's lab.

To get a more comprehensive representation, Dr. Kuceyeski and her team built a tool that could take the structural and functional connectomes produced by all of these disparate approaches and collapse them together to produce a more unified interpretation.

""In my head, I saw it as some sort of monster with multiple arms that could reach out and grab different brain representations and digest and congeal them into one unified connectome,"" Jamison said. The resulting program, an autoencoder that compresses and reconstructs more than a dozen different ""flavors"" of input data, thus came to be called the Krakencoder.

Identifying Connections that Restore Lost Function 

The team trained the Krakencoder on data collected from over 700 subjects who participated in the National Institutes of Health's Human Connectome Project. As part of that study, volunteers underwent extensive structural and functional MRI scanning.

The researchers found that the Krakencoder allowed them to take an individual's structural connectome and correctly predict that person's functional connectome about 20 times more accurately than previously published approaches.

The Krakencoder's combined and compressed representation also predicted the individual's age, sex and their cognitive performance scores received on tests which had been administered along with their imaging scans. Such scores, Dr. Kuceyeski noted, are notoriously difficult to gauge based on brain imaging alone.

Being able to map functions like cognition to specific brain networks is key to understanding how anatomy and physiology give rise to our behaviors and abilities -- and how diseases and injuries can impair our performance.

In the future, Dr. Kuceyeski and her colleagues plan to combine the Krakencoder with a network modification tool they call NeMo that will allow them to examine the connectomes of people whose brains have been damaged by diseases. Christie Gillies, a PhD student in the Kuceyeski Lab, is using this approach to map outcomes following stroke.

""She's comparing the functional connectome produced by the NeMo + Krakencoder pipeline, based only on MRIs regularly collected in the clinic, to the actual functional MRI of a person. We found that our functional connectomes do a better job at predicting an individual's motor scores and language scores at follow up,"" Dr. Kuceyeski said.

These tools could also identify brain network connections associated with improved cognitive or motor performance. Boosting the activity of damaged circuits -- for example, through transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in the brain -- could strengthen those connections and hasten recovery.

One of the current hot research topics is the combination of two of the most recent technological breakthroughs: machine learning and quantum computing. An experimental study shows that already small-scale quantum computers can boost the performance of machine learning algorithms. This was demonstrated on a photonic quantum processor by an international team of researchers of the University of Vienna. The work, recently published in Nature Photonics, shows promising new applications for optical quantum computers.

Recent scientific breakthroughs have reshaped the development of future technologies. On the one hand, machine learning and artificial intelligence have already revolutionized our lives from everyday tasks to scientific research. On the other hand, quantum computing has emerged as a new paradigm of computation.

From the combination of these promising two fields, a new research line has opened up: Quantum Machine Learning. This field aims at finding potential enhancements in the speed, efficiency or accuracy of algorithms when they run on quantum platforms. It is however still an open challenge, to achieve such an advantage on current technology quantum computers.

This is where an international team of researchers took the next step and designed a novel experiment carried out by scientists from the University of Vienna. The set-up features a quantum photonic circuit built at the Politecnico di Milano (Italy), which runs a machine learning algorithm first proposed by researchers working at Quantinuum (United Kingdom). The goal was to classify data points using a photonic quantum computer and single out the contribution of quantum effects, to understand the advantage with respect to classical computers. The experiment showed that already small-sized quantum processors can peform better than conventional algorithms. ""We found that for specific tasks our algorithm commits fewer errors than its classical Counterpart,"" explains Philip Walther from the University of Vienna, lead of the project. ""This implies that existing quantum computers can show good performances without necessarily going beyond the state-of-the-art Technology"" adds Zhenghao Yin, first author of the publication in Nature Photonics.

Another interesting aspect of the new research is that photonic platforms can consume less energy with respect to standard computers. ""This could prove crucial in the future, given that machine learning algorithms are becoming infeasible, due to the too high energy demands,"" emphasizes co-author Iris Agresti.

The result of the researchers has an impact both on quantum computation, since it identifies tasks that benefit from quantum effects, as well as on standard computing. Indeed, new algorithms, inspired by quantum architectures could be designed, reaching better performances and reducing energy consumption.

A small region of the brain, known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), plays a key role in how we process rewards. It produces dopamine, a neuromodulator that helps predict future rewards based on contextual cues. A team from the universities of Geneva (UNIGE), Harvard, and McGill has shown that the VTA goes even further: it encodes not only the anticipated reward but also the precise moment it is expected. This discovery, made possible by a machine learning algorithm, highlights the value of combining artificial intelligence with neuroscience. The study is published in the journal Nature.

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a key role in motivation and the brain's reward circuit. The main source of dopamine, this small cluster of neurons sends this neuromodulator to other brain regions to trigger an action in response to a positive stimulus.

""Initially, the VTA was thought to be merely the brain's reward centre. But in the 1990s, scientists discovered that it doesn't encode reward itself, but rather the prediction of reward,"" explains Alexandre Pouget, full professor in the Department of Basic Neurosciences in the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine.

Experiments on animals have shown that when a reward consistently follows a light signal, for example, the VTA eventually releases dopamine not at the moment of the reward, but as soon as the signal appears. This response therefore encodes the prediction of the reward -- linked to the signal -- rather than the reward itself.

A much more sophisticated function

This ""reinforcement learning,"" which requires minimal supervision, is central to human learning. It's also the principle behind many artificial intelligence algorithms that improve performance through training -- such as AlphaGo, the first algorithm to defeat a world champion in the game of Go.

In a recent study, Alexandre Pouget's team, in collaboration with Naoshige Uchida of Harvard University and Paul Masset of McGill University, shows that the VTA's coding is even more sophisticated than previously thought. ""Rather than predicting a weighted sum of future rewards, the VTA predicts their temporal evolution. In other words, each gain is represented separately, with the precise moment at which it is expected,"" explains the UNIGE researcher, who led this work.

""While we knew that VTA neurons prioritised rewards close in time over the ones further in the future- on the principle of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush -we discovered that different neurons do so on different time scales, with some focus on the reward possible in a few seconds' time, others on the reward expected in a minute's time, and others on more distant horizons. This diversity is what allows the encoding of reward timing. This much finer representation gives the learning system great flexibility, allowing it to adapt to maximise immediate or delayed rewards, depending on the individual's goals and priorities.""

AI and neuroscience: a two-way street

These findings stem from a fruitful dialogue between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Alexandre Pouget developed a purely mathematical algorithm that incorporates the timing of reward processing. Meanwhile, the Harvard researchers gathered extensive neurophysiological data on VTA activity in animals experiencing rewards.

""They then applied our algorithm to their data and found that the results matched perfectly with their empirical findings."" While the brain inspires AI and machine learning techniques, these results demonstrate that algorithms can also serve as powerful tools to reveal our neurophysiological mechanisms.

In March, Omar, a biomedical researcher, posted a request in a private Facebook group for researchers. He was seeking to have his name added to a paper in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine, in exchange for a payment.

Omar is an assistant professor at a Saudi Arabian university. He published 20 papers in 2024 alone, a big jump from 2 the previous year. But it wasn't enough, says Omar, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. To be promoted, he needed to publish at least ten more papers, in journals in the top half of those ranked by the Web of Science, a citation index. And to meet this demanding requirement, he'd turned to paper mills: fraudulent businesses that deceive publishers so as to arrange authorship, submission and other services related to publications.

Omar wasn't choosy. The paper could be on any branch of medicine with an AI theme, and he didn't need to see it before submission. Nor did he mind what position he had in the author list, but he did not want to deal with reviews.

Science's fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills

Science's fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills

Omar's circumstances are not unusual: many countries operate a research culture that expects researchers to publish frequently to secure their career in science. Some, like Omar, are unable or unwilling to collect data, conduct analysis and write a paper that might be accepted in a journal. So they turn to organizations online that offer authorship status — for a price. The paper mills that make this their business have various techniques to take advantage of desperate or lazy researchers and to trick publishers: some operate as a marketplace in which extra authorship slots on already--accepted papers are up for grabs. Others take published papers and use AI to tweak text and graphics to escape plagiarism detectors. Still more generate entirely new data sets and text, without the inconveniences of any real laboratory work.

Over WhatsApp, Omar told a reporter for Nature's careers team, “I am dealing with many writers” as a co-author. Omar wrote that he had already paid for many papers, namechecking co-authors based in India and -Pakistan. He could afford to pay no more than US$400 per paper, he said. Communications he shared indicated that he had paid as little as 76 Saudi riyals (US$20) for one paper. He had marked one Western Union transfer, of 810 Saudi riyals, as an “Education/School fee” on his statement. The reporter contacted Omar after seeing his request on Facebook, and, to explore in more depth why he was offering payment to be included on a paper, posed as the representative of a paper mill.

Omar isn't the only researcher finding paper mills on Facebook. A separate post offered co-authorship of a paper on medicinal plants and trace elements in return for payment. According to the post, the paper had already been accepted for publication by a respected journal. The reviewers had asked for only minor revisions. Now, the author was seeking other researchers to attach their names to the paper — even though they had not been involved in the research, and would not be needed for substantial revisions.

A US-based plant biologist who was asked by Nature why he had expressed interest in this co-authorship said: “Early-career researchers such as ourselves are under significant pressure to publish, which can sometimes be a challenging aspect of our work.” His Facebook account was then almost immediately deleted.

Ivan Oransky, the co-founder of research--integrity blog Retraction Watch, has repeatedly warned of the industrial-level scale of research misconduct, stressing that paper mills are just a symptom of an academic reward system focused on metrics such as university rankings and quantity of publications. In the absence of any other metric, retraction rates are often used to indicate rates of research misconduct, because retractions often occur only when a publisher decides that a paper is too flawed to be fixed with a correction or an erratum.

And these pressures are only intensifying, according to Anna Abalkina, who researches academic fraud, including the use of paper mills, at the Free University of Berlin. She points to two reasons: the increasing number of researchers, and the introduction in many countries of requirements to publish in international journals. Paper mills have stepped in to meet this challenge, she adds.

The pressures are particularly intense in some countries. Gengyan Tang, a researcher in education at the University of Calgary, Canada, spent almost a year doing research at a teaching hospital affiliated with a medical university in southwest China. “I found that there was a significant demand for paper mills among nurses,” he reports. “Some paper mills even actively promoted their services within hospital departments by handing out business cards and making direct contact with staff.”

“Early-career doctors and nurses in China are now facing even greater pressure to publish,” says Tang. As evaluation standards grow increasingly stringent, they are expected to produce more papers and publish in higher-impact journals than their predecessors, all while managing heavy clinical workloads, he says. “This struggle to balance research, clinical duties and personal life is one of the key factors driving some of them towards the services provided by paper mills.”

Tang's concerns around pressures to publish faced by clinical staff are borne out in the data. A Nature analysis of paper retractions from 2014 to 2024, published in February, found that seven of the ten institutions with the highest proportion of retracted research articles were hospitals in China (see Nature 638, 596–599; 2025).

Abalkina defines paper mills as “commercial companies that organize on-demand writing of fraudulent academic manuscripts and offer co-authorship of these papers for sale”. For example, International Publisher LLC, a paper mill based in Russia, generated $6.5 million from co-authorship slots offered between 2019 and 2021, according to an analysis by Abalkina1. She estimates conservatively that the paper-mill industry as a whole is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year (see ‘A case study of paper-mill purchases in Kazakhstan').

The Soviet era left scientists ill-prepared to meet the demands of international journals.

Anna Abalkina, who studies academic fraud at the Free University of Berlin, and her colleague Dorothy Bishop, a research-integrity sleuth and a retired psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, carried out work that led to the retraction of a number of papers with authors in Kazakhstan. Many were at the country's Ministry of Education and Science and its Institute for Strategic Studies, a research body based in the capital, Astana.

A large market for paper mills exists in former Soviet countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, says Abalkina. It is driven by their history. During the Soviet era, social scientists at regional universities were accustomed to domestic publication, usually in Russian, and with the expectation that their work would adhere to Soviet ideology.

A push to publish in international journals, she says, meant that many researchers had to grapple with new scientific disciplines and unfamiliar publishing norms. From around 2016, she adds, many scientists published in predatory journals, which tend to have weak editorial and publication practices, and might aggressively solicit submissions. And from around 2019, after Scopus and Web of Science removed a number of predatory journals, the market expanded to paper mills.

In her role as a research-integrity adviser at Springer Nature, Svetlana Kleiner corresponds with authors of disputed papers, including some who are based in the countries list above. (Springer Nature publishes Nature, but Nature journalists are editorially independent of the publisher.)

She thinks that some of them had genuinely contributed to the papers in some capacity, and had turned to a third-party service to handle translation or the daunting process of submission. They did not necessarily realize that this would include suggesting and responding to peer reviewers, or that doing so was a violation of journal policies. “It creates a problem when authors think they're signing up to one service, but they get something more,” Kleiner says. “In some cases they didn't know that what they were doing was wrong.”

But she stresses, too, that ignorance is not a reason for absolution. Abalkina says that authors have to remain responsible for their work throughout the publishing process. Otherwise paper mills can, and often do, manipulate reviews, revisions, authorships and citations.

Svetlana Shakirova, head of science at Kurmangazy Kazakh National Conservatory in Almaty, confirms that among Kazakh researchers it was common several years ago to use intermediaries for publication.

In 2022, the Elsevier journal Thinking Skills and Creativity retracted 47 papers, citing manipulation of peer review. It did so after Abalkina pointed out links to the paper mill Scientific Publications, based in Kyiv. She dubbed the company Tanu.pro after the peculiar e-mail addresses it often used. Shakirova noticed that two of the authors of the retracted papers were based at her own university at the time. She sent a confidential survey to the Kazakh corresponding authors of 11 of the retracted Thinking Skills and Creativity papers. Six of these authors responded. They admitted to using intermediaries with the goal of achieving publication in a journal indexed by Scopus or Web of Science. One author mentioned taking out a loan to pay the intermediary's fee of US$1,500.

Because papers are often mass--produced, typical signs include familiar text, duplicated images, suspicious e-mail addresses, implausible collaborations1 and irrelevant citations. Another red flag is “tortured phrases” resulting from attempts to hide plagiarism2 (examples include “profound neural organization” instead of “deep neural network”, and “subterranean insect settlement” instead of “ant colony”). Paper mills have also submitted, and occasionally been successful in publishing, plagiarized or duplicated papers.

One tactic is for companies to impersonate well-established researchers when offering papers for sale. In August 2024, a post appeared in a Facebook group selling co-authorship slots, for $200 to $700, on a paper about tracking COVID-19. Supposedly, this paper had already been accepted by the Lancet medical journal. The name on the Facebook account was Paul Robin Krugman, and photos of the Nobel prize-winning economist also appeared in profiles on Facebook and on the social-media app Telegram with the same name. The real Krugman confirmed to Nature's careers team that this was not him. But not all attempts to use the names of genuine academics are this blatant or easy to detect.

More than 10,000 research papers were retracted in 2023 — a new record

Paper mills offer a bevy of services. A researcher in a bind can find one through word of mouth or by searching online. They might need a paper written from scratch in a particular field, for a particular type of journal. They might already have a draft, but feel that they will have a better chance of acceptance if a third party handles the translation, submission, revision or communication with the journal. They might already have published a paper and want to boost its citations; paper mills often create citation networks to inflate the impact of their papers.

And journal editors willing to accept bribes can accept a paper with little or no scrutiny. Similarly, peer reviewers can give a positive review in exchange for payment. One of Omar's reviews is just 12 words long.

An unpublished analysis estimates that roughly 2% of all papers submitted to journals in 2022 bore the hallmarks of paper mills, and that the proportion was higher in biology and medicine (see Nature 623, 466–467; 2023). Mass-produced papers in these fields are especially worrying for academic--integrity researchers, because of the damaging effect that this junk science might have on patients.

In 2021 and 2022, sociologist Xinqu Zhang and criminologist Wang Peng, both at the University of Hong Kong, conducted anonymous interviews with natural-science academics at three elite Chinese universities, as well as obtaining internal documents3.

One faculty member told a research-ethics subcommittee that they had “indeed engaged in academic misconduct”. But they added that if university and faculty leaders “had not implemented such inhumane policies and forced us so harshly” to publish as many articles as possible, they “wouldn't have resorted to unethical means”.

This researcher was found out by his colleagues in the faculty, but punishment was lenient: deductions of salary and research funding for that year, without the case being formally reported to others at the university. A committee member handling the case admitted that faculty members admired their colleague's research, and wanted to avoid negative attention from the rest of the university and the public. A different researcher feared losing his job while dealing with health problems. He told Zhang and Peng that he “had no choice” but to commit research misconduct. He bought access to an official archive and altered the data to support his hypotheses. He then found someone who could help him to write up articles and have them published. “Money is the answer to everything,” he said. “I met all the required criteria in just a few months, and eventually secured a permanent position in the faculty.” These kinds of admission are rare. Authors whose papers have been retracted on suspicion of paper-mill activity tend to remain silent or to deny any participation in research misconduct.

For example, in 2019, Alexandr Litoy, a Moscow--based journalist, purchased an authorship slot for a paper sold by International Publisher. When Litoy, who made the purchase as part of an investigation into paper mills, confronted his two co-authors, who specialize in engineering and chemistry, about why they had contributed to a paper on entrepreneurship, both said that it was their first time using the services of the company. But neither admitted any wrongdoing.

Paper mills continue to make it easy for authors to take shortcuts. Science Publisher, a company registered in Riga, offers co-authorship slots on already written (and sometimes already accepted) papers, in a variety of fields. Prices start from around $550, depending on the field, journal and position in the list of authors. Services are advertised on the company's website, LinkedIn page and Facebook page.

The company reassures potential buyers that the advertised title and abstract will be rewritten, to ensure that no one finds out that the paper has been purchased. On its website, photos of at least two purported staff members were copied and pasted from a stock-photo site and an entirely unrelated magazine.

A reporter for Nature's careers team corresponded with Science Publisher about an advertised position as a research-paper author. An employee asked whether she had any ready-made manuscripts, and whether she could provide extra services such as responding to reviewers' comments.

In the Latvian business registry, Igor Vasilev — whose passport was issued in Volzhsky, in the Russian region of Volgograd — is named as the company's owner. The Russian business registry indicates that a person of the same name and from the same region was previously chief executive of the company ANO Publishing House “Scientific Review”, which offers services similar to those provided by Science Publisher. Abalkina thinks that the Latvian company is a front for the Russian one.

Science Publisher denies any connection to Vasilev, or even that the company is based in Latvia. A staff member responded to an inquiry from Nature's careers team with hostility and suspicion, accusing the editor of “commercial espionage” and calling him a “fraudulent impostor”.

In one of its final e-mail communications with the team, a staff member for Science Publisher who described themselves as John Palomarez, director of Academic & Publisher Relations, wrote: “Show your press credentials of Nature on camera? Will you send the proof video of you or any personally [sic] how seeking our Company on behalf of Nature? We're waiting.”

Afterwards, the address listed on the website was changed from Riga to London, although it retained the Latvian phone number. Reporters representing Nature visited both the Riga and the London address. There were no traces of the company at either location.

Many US hospitals rely on medical AI tools that assist with diagnoses and other tasks.Credit: Hilary Swift for The Washington Post via Getty

Artificial intelligence (AI) already helps clinicians to make diagnoses, triage critical cases and transcribe clinical notes in hospitals across the United States. But regulation of medical AI products has not kept up with the rapid pace of their adoption, argue researchers in a report published 5 June in PLOS Digital Health1.

The authors point to limitations in how the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves these devices, and propose broader strategies that extend beyond the agency to help ensure that medical AI tools are safe and effective.

More than 1,000 medical AI products have been cleared by the FDA, and hospitals are rapidly adopting them. Unlike most other FDA-regulated products, AI tools continue to evolve after approval as they are updated or retrained on new data. This raises the need for continuous oversight, which current regulations have limited capacity to ensure.

The discussion is especially timely amid recent signs that the federal government might scale back AI regulation. In January, President Donald Trump revoked an executive order focused on AI safety, citing a need to remove barriers for innovation. The following month, lay-offs affected staff in the FDA's division responsible for AI and digital health.

Without proper oversight, there is a risk that medical algorithms could give misleading recommendations and compromise patient care. “There have to be safeguards,” says Leo Anthony Celi, a clinical researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the report. “And I think relying on the FDA to come up with all those safeguards is not realistic and maybe even impossible.”

The criteria used by the FDA to review and authorize AI medical tools are often less rigorous than those for drugs. And because other countries rely on the FDA to inform their own decisions, its approach could have global implications. According to the FDA, only those tools that might pose a higher risk to patients are required to go through a clinical trial, for example. Another concern is that medical algorithms often perform poorly when applied to populations that differ from the ones they were trained on. Because of these limitations, regulatory approval does not ensure that a medical AI product is beneficial for the people it is intended to help, Celi says.

Google AI has better bedside manner than human doctors — and makes better diagnoses

Ideally, hospitals should assess how well the algorithms perform in their own patient populations, and train clinicians to interpret the outputs and respond appropriately before adopting these technologies. “One of the biggest challenges is that the vast majority of hospitals and clinics do not have the resources to hire AI teams” to perform such tests, Celi says, adding that a study published this year2 found that many hospitals are buying AI tools ‘off the shelf' and using them without local validation. “That is a recipe for disaster,” he says.

Cock of the walk? Gender norms and stereotypes influence who gets ahead. Credit: Juana Mari Moya/Getty

Patriarchy Inc.: What We Get Wrong About Gender Equality and Why Men Still Win at Work Cordelia Fine Atlantic (2025)

In 2021, white men managed around 95% of US hedge-fund assets. In 2024, only one of the 40 largest banks in the world had a female chief executive. And in an average UK week, men spend more of their time in paid work or education than doing unpaid tasks such as household chores or taking care of children; for women, it's the reverse.

How did we get here? We know the answer, as psychologist Cordelia Fine tells us in her engaging book Patriarchy Inc. Yes, the culprit is patriarchy: gender influences who gets power, status, money and access to opportunities. But where this patriarchal framework stems from and how to build a more equitable society are harder to pin down.

Sex and gender in science

Sex and gender in science

Fine sets out to dismantle two existing “false visions” for gender equality. The first of these is the view that men and women are ‘different but equal', a stance that emerged in the 1990s. The second is the concept of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) — a framework of policies and initiatives to increase workplace representation of people from marginalized groups — which has spread like wildfire in the business world and beyond since the 2010s. Fine focuses on critiquing ‘business DEI' — but, in so doing, misses the chance to explore more effective ways to improve gender equity.

The various strategies that business DEI has sprouted to improve gender diversity in the workplace, such as diversity workshops and numbers games of equal-representational hiring, are aimed more at boosting productivity than at helping women. The approach is also often tokenistic, and fails to prompt much change: stereotypes and gendered norms continue to influence who gets ahead.

Views about how gender bias arose tend to fall into two camps, explains Fine. Many anthropologists and psychologists point to biology and evolution to justify the widespread gendered division of labour: men tend to be stronger, they say, and women more caring. Others insist that cultural conditioning is at the root of gendered roles. In this world view, children pick up norms about what being a girl or a boy is supposed to mean through messaging from their parents, carers, peers and friends, from the media and books around them. They learn from an early age who typically sews clothes or writes computer code.

Fine proposes a compromise: both evolution and social conditioning, she suggests, led to the division of tasks by gender. She argues that this has helped societies to succeed in certain situations: everyone is more efficient when roles are clearly defined. But in my field — behavioural science — extensive research has shown how it has also created status hierarchies, in which men continue to assume ‘important' leading roles (often well-paid) while women are pushed into supportive, invisible ones (often remunerated poorly or not at all).

Although Fine doesn't discuss it, many feminist movements have long challenged gender norms and the gender binary more generally. And many scholars, including me, have been critiquing the insular and superficial approaches of DEI for a while. But clearly, women continue to carry much of the invisible mental load in the workplace and at home.

Yet, at the same time, other pockets of society are strengthening gender norms. There is more pressure on women than on men to have children. Once they do, women are expected to carry the majority of the caring responsibilities. Moves to take away women's bodily autonomy and choices, along with regular media panic about falling birthrates, contribute to this divide. And toxic ideas of masculinity — that men need to be providers, as well as leaders at work and at home, for example — are gaining traction, perpetuated notably by Internet influencers.

‘Different but equal' approaches to gender equality lose sight of within-group differences.Credit: Eduardo Gonzlez/500px/Getty

In any case, it's a mistake to attribute inherently different abilities to women and men simply because of the sex they were assigned at birth — not least because it ignores within-group differences. Not all women are the same. And beyond individual differences, we know how gender norms are racially grounded and how historic legacies of oppression have played out. Black and Brown women often report being held to different expectations from their white colleagues, as I describe in my 2022 book Hysterical. Efforts to ‘define' gender through biological parameters — such as testosterone levels, used as a primary indicator of eligibility for women's sports — typically take white European women as a baseline, even though typical ranges can vary with race and ethnicity.

More broadly, the idea that there is some sort of ‘feminine' way of thinking and working has hindered efforts to tackle gender inequalities. It pigeonholes women, putting them into new boxes rather than disrupting the ones in which they have long been held captive.

Fine touches on the idea that gender equality will improve the lives of everyone — not just those of women. This can at first seem counter-intuitive, because men are at a clear advantage in the current patriarchal framework; on the face of it, it might seem as if giving equal rights to women means limiting men's rights. I wish Fine had laid out more clearly how gendered norms can also harm men by stifling them into a specific role. Emotional vulnerability, for example, is deemed unsuitable for men, a position that can lead to mental-health issues.

Black women on the academic tightrope: four scholars weigh in

And so gender equality should be the goal in itself. But organizations don't work to break gender barriers just for the greater good — they want to see value and profit. It is to get them on board that some have endeavoured to ‘sell' equality work by highlighting that diverse teams perform better. Although originally well-intentioned, this approach has moved away from the original goals of DEI and created new forms of gendered labour. It is mostly women, and people from other marginalized groups, who carry the load of DEI initiatives, for example through informal mentorships.

Plasma membrane integrity is vital for nearly all aspects of cell functioning1. Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. The screen identified NINJ1, a protein recently proposed to regulate pyroptosis and other lytic cell death3,4, as the top hit. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. NINJ1 level on the plasma membrane is inversely correlated to the amount of force required to rupture the membrane. In the pyroptosis context, NINJ1 on its own is not sufficient to fully rupture the membrane, and additional mechanical force is required for full PMR. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.

Metrics details

Van der Waals layered materials have emerged as a platform for exploring exciton condensation, a phenomenon that reflects quantum coherence and collective behaviour. Unlike traditional quantum Hall systems, 2D layered materials offer a unique opportunity to observe exciton condensation without external magnetic field and at relatively high temperatures, making them highly attractive for both fundamental studies and potential applications. This Perspective focuses on recent advances in understanding the electrical transport behaviours of exciton condensates in 2D layered materials and the strategies proposed to achieve high-temperature exciton condensation, while addressing the challenges and discussing potential future developments in this area.

Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and related carbon nanorings (CNRs) represent iconic molecular entities in molecular nanocarbon science. While theoretical studies predict that the introduction of nitrogen atoms (N-doping) onto CPP frameworks would add a number of fascinating properties, only a handful of partially N-doped carbon nanorings have been synthesized. We herein report the synthesis of a long-awaited cycloparaazine (CPA), where every para-connected aromatic moiety consists of a N-heterocycle, and two other highly N-doped CNRs. The evaluation of optoelectronic and structural properties coupled with theoretical studies uncovered the impact of both the amount and positioning of N-doping onto the nanorings properties; far less ring strain, red-shifted UV–﻿vis absorption and fluorescence, smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps and both higher reduction and oxidation potentials than pristine CPPs. Ultimately, new potential applications of highly N-doped nanorings were examined in non-covalent supramolecular property engineering with Lewis acids and as energy storage materials.

Since their discovery in 19911, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have found wide applications in various fields of material science such as in organic electronics, polymers or energy storage devices, etc2,3,4,5,6. Along these lines, N-doped structural congeners (NCNTs) have also been successfully prepared7 and studied8,9,10. However, accessing them by either post-treatment or in situ-synthesis only give rise to randomly N-doped structures. It is known that electrical, magnetic, mechanical and optical properties of CNTs and NCNTs heavily depend on their structure, the alignment and the diameter of the tubes11,12. Still, the structurally uniform control of the tubes key parameters during their construction remains an unsolved problem and a straightforward way of separating CNTs has also not been developed to date (Fig. 1a)13.

a State-of-the-art of nitrogen-incorporation in carbon nanotubes and rings. b Synthesized N-doped carbon nanorings and the use of their nitrogen lone pairs. c Our approach of synthesizing a cycloparaazine.

Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are considered as simplest sidewall segments of an armchair CNT14 and they possess unique radially oriented cyclic π-systems, which cause outstanding optical, electronical, self-assembly and charge transport properties (Fig. 1a)15,16,17,18,19. Despite the synthetic interest in this molecule class since the 1930s20, first preparative accesses were only achieved in the late 2000s by three groups independently in different ways (Jasti/Bertozzi21, Itami22 and Yamago23). In contrast to CNTs, CPPs are atom-precisely defined wherefore their structure dependent properties can be synthetically altered straightforwardly via changing their architecture16. Over the past 16 years, diverse derivatives of this molecule class were disclosed24, including different sized rings ([n]CPP; n = 5–16, 18, 20, 21)14,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32, donor- and/or acceptor-substituted congeners15, polyaromatic33,34,35,36 and heteroaromatic37,38,39,40,41 containing cycles, as well as chiral33,42,43, antiaromatic43, bridged44,45, branched46,47,48,49, connected50,51,52 or interlocked carbon nanorings53,54. These findings led to the examination of CPPs and derivatives in electronic applications55,56, as (biological) fluorophores57,58 or as solid state emitters59,60. Additionally, CPPs were envisioned as template structures in the size- and structure-selective bottom-up synthesis of CNTs61.

Despite these achievements, the selective incorporation of heteroatoms and especially nitrogen atoms have only been sparsely investigated15. In 2010, Bachrach and Stück proposed in a theoretical study that N-containing nanorings should show highly interesting properties (Fig. 1b). For example, the ring strain energy should be significantly lower, as compared to their all-carbon congeners for steric reasons62. Two years later, we reported the synthesis of the N-containing carbon nanoring (CNR) 1. The nitrogen lone pair of the bipyridine entity enabled both protonation, which alters the photophysical properties by a bathochromic effect, qualifying the respective derivative as pH-responsive probe, as well as Pd-ligand63. Jasti and co-workers later synthesized other pyridine-containing CNR-congeners 2. It was found that moderate N-doping alters the carbon nanorings properties only slightly. However, N-methylation generates donor-acceptor nanoring 3 with the phenylene backbone as donor and the pyridinium salt as acceptor moiety, causing both a bathochromic shift in absorption and fluorescence, as well as an increase in reduction potential38,64. Additionally, the same group reported a bipyridine-doped [8]CPP, which could be applied to construct the dimeric metal-bridged structure 4 and the CNR-containing Ru(bpy)32+ derivative 5 (Fig. 1b)65. Furthermore, Quinton, Poriel and co-workers investigated the structural and electronic properties of CNRs in dependence of varying azines (pyridine, pyrimidine) in the rings peripheries66. Recently, the Jasti group also facilitated the coordinative ability of pyridinic nitrogen lone pairs in an active template strategy towards N-doped CNR-catenanes67. During the review-process of this manuscript, the preparative access to a cone-shaped all-azine carbon nanobelt was reported by Tong, Wang and co-workers68. However, the true cycloparaazines (CPAs)62, where every para-connected aromatic moiety consists of a N-heterocycle, remains an unachieved goal today (Fig. 1a).

Herein we report the preparative access to a CPA 6 through a gold-mediated macrocyclization of the bisboronic ester-functionalized N-heterocyclic linker 7, that is subsequently para-connected throughout reductive elimination from the Au-complex 8 (Fig. 1c). Additionally, two other highly N-doped CNRs could be prepared applying the same approach and all three rings were examined regarding their optical, electronical, structural and theoretical properties. Comparison of those properties with the all-carbon [9]CPP sheds light on the impact of both the amount and positioning of the N-doping onto the ring's properties. Ultimately, new potential applications were outlined by examining these NCNRs in supramolecular complexation with Lewis acids and as charge storage materials.

We first evaluated whether established strategies to access CPPs15 can also be applied for the synthesis of CPAs. Generally, those can be subdivided in two main strategies (Fig. 2a): One strategy relies on the application of proaromatic L-shaped building blocks, which are first connected to the less-strained macrocycles 9 or 10, that are afterwards aromatized to strained CNRs21,22. Necessarily, the L-shaped units are converted into phenylenes that are incorporated into the nanocarbon framework (Incorporation strategy, Fig. 2a red), which disqualifies these protocols for the construction of CPAs. The other strategy relies on the formation of metalorganic macrocycles 11–13 as intermediates that undergo reductive C–C bond formation to the desired compounds23,69,70. Therein, linear aromatic bismetalated (SnR3, B(OR)2 or Li) precursors undergo transmetalation with preformed metal complexes (Pt(COD), Au(dcpm), Ni(dnbpy)) whose chelating ligands induce the formation of macrocyclic structures 11–13. Thus, the metal complexes inducing the cyclic nature are formally traceless (Traceless strategy, Fig. 2a blue) rendering this class of reactions eligible for the general synthesis of CPAs.

a State-of-the-art of CPP syntheses. b Retrosynthetic considerations for CPA synthesis.

Nitrogen lone pairs are prone to coordinate metals. However, to obtain the desired metalorganic macrocycles 11–13, the respective ligands (COD, dnbpy, dcpm) are inevitably necessary for the transformation. Therefore, metal ligation to the N-atoms of CPA building blocks must be suppressed. The Yamago method23 using cyclooctadiene (COD) and our method69 that operates with bipyridine (dnbpy) ligands will not be compatible, due to interference of the coordination abilities through a pyridine substrate (see Supplementary Information (SI) 3.21 for details). However, phosphine-gold coordination as applied in the Tsuchido-Osakada approach70 is generally strong, rendering this strategy promising to access CPAs. Following this approach, stereoisomerically symmetric bisboronic precursors needed to be synthesized (see SI chapter 3 for details) for the self-assembly with bis-Au-dcpm complex 14 in order to avoid regioselectivity problems. Since boronates at the 2-pyridine position are unstable under aqueous conditions71,72, a suitable starting material should contain the boronic moiety at the pyridine 3-position. Thus, the CPA-forming reaction would then represent a 3,3'-bipyridine bond formation (Fig. 2b).

The Tsuchido-Osakada method70 that is derived from earlier work of the Toste group73 has not yet been used for pyridine-couplings. Pleasingly, we found that the bis-gold-bisphosphine complex 14 reacted with 3-pyridine boronic acid (15) to give the desired complex 16 in 56% yield74. Noteworthy, the analogous reaction with a 2-pyridine boronate failed (see SI 3.3.). Oxidation of 16 with PhICl2 (17) in CDCl3 afforded 3,3'-bipyridine (18) in 81% yield (see SI 3.4 for details). This model reaction clearly revealed that the P-Au complexation is not interfered through monodentate pyridine complexation and the 3,3'-bipyridinic bond formation is generally feasible (Fig. 3a).

a Au-mediated 3,3'-bipyridine synthesis through 16. b Unsuccessful synthesis of [6]CBPy (21). c Successful synthesis of [9]CPA (24), [9]CPP-Py (25) and [9]CPP-Pyr (26). The conformation of the Au-macrocycles 20, 23, 28 and 30 were assigned tentatively based on the reported all-carbon congeners (see SI 6.6 for full details)70,74.

Encouraged by these preliminary results, we extended this strategy towards the CPA synthesis and chose the 2,2'-bipyridine bisboronic ester 19 as linker moiety. The triangular gold-bipyridine macrocycle 20 was obtained in 51% yield. However, after oxidation of macrocycle 20, only traces of the desired [6]cycloparaazine (21, [6]CBPy) could be observed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (see SI 3.8 for details) and its isolation was not possible (Fig. 3b). DFT calculations of the ring strain of [6]CBPy (21) via the homodesmotic reaction method75 (B3LYP/6-31 G(d) level of theory, see SI 5.1 for details) revealed that 89.7 kcal/mol additional ring strain has to be overcome during the demetalative cycle formation. With this, the ring strain of [6]CBPys (21) is significantly smaller than that of all-carbon [6]CPP (96.0 kcal mol–1), which is yielded in 76% under comparable conditions70. Therefore, we assumed that not just the strain alone but also the intrinsic nature of the azines plays a crucial role in the unsuccessful synthesis of 21 (see SI 3.8 for full discussion). However, after examining numerous parameters — including reaction conditions, possible intermediates, and various electronic factors (see SI 3.8. for details) — we shifted our focus to ring-enlarged nine-membered derivatives. Since the bisboronic precursor 7 needs to be symmetric, we formally inserted a 2,5-pyrazine in between two pyridine units and selected bispyridinyl pyrazine 22. To this end, we developed a new synthetic route to the designed linker 22 which facilitates a specific Miyaura borylation-Stille coupling sequence (see SI 3.22. for full details). The self-assembly towards the corresponding Au-macrocycle 23 proceeded well, but an inseparable mixture with a structurally related side product resulted reproducibly, which could not be separated. This suggests that the Tsuchido-Osakada approach is also slightly interfered when chelating substrates such as 22 are applied instead of non-coordinative hydrocarbons (see SI 3.12. for details). Fortunately, the sequential oxidation with PhICl2 (17) and subsequent reductive elimination cascade of the mixture yielded the desired [9]CPA (24) in 8% yield over two steps.

To check the general applicability of this method and to evaluate the effect of the different degree of nitrogen incorporation and positioning on the properties of the compounds, we additionally synthesized two other nine-membered CNRs 25 and 26 through analogous approaches. Both heterocycles bear six nitrogen atoms. In [9]CPP-Py (25), these are located on six different arene entities applying the 1,4-di(pyridin-2-yl)benzene bisboronate 27 as the precursor (self-assembly: 28, 62% yield, reductive elimination: 25, 66% yield). [9]CPP-Pyr (26) carries six nitrogen atoms equally positioned on three heteroarenes when using the 2,5-diphenylpyrazine bisboronate 29 (self-assembly: 30, 88% yield, reductive elimination: 26, 74% yield) (Fig. 3c). Since the rings 25 and 26 do not consist entirely of azines and neither the starting material nor the product contain chelating bipyridine moieties, alternative methods for synthesizing CNRs (see Fig. 2) could also be viable. While the Tsuchido-Osakada approach was found to be both straightforward and highly productive, additional attempts to synthesize other cycloparaazines applying this strategy were unsuccessful due to either an unproductive reductive elimination from the respective Au-macrocycle or failed syntheses of the bisborylated polyazine linkers (see SI 3.8. & 3.24 for details), leaving untouched synthetic space for future endeavors.

With the synthesized NCNRs 24–26 in hand, we set out to examine their structural parameters via X-ray diffractometric analysis of single crystals and compared those to calculated data. Proper single crystals of [9]CPA (24), [9]CPP-Py (25) and [9]CPP-Pyr (26) were obtained from CH2Cl2, tetrahydrofuran (THF)/n-hexane and benzene/n-pentane solutions, respectively (Fig. 4a). [9]CPA (24) crystallizes in an overall tubular packing driven by intermolecular CH−N interactions in the tubular alignment and intermolecular π−π interactions between the tubes (see noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot). Interestingly, [9]CPP-Py (25) crystallizes in a 1:1 ratio in two forms: in one dipole-minimalized structure with three nitrogen pointing to both sides (gray structure) and the other structure has a ratio of 4:2 pointing in both directions (orange structure). This results in a herringbone overall packing with intermolecular CH−CH and CH−π interactions. Instead, the constitutional isomer [9]CPP-Pyr (26) crystallizes in a tubular fashion driven by intermolecular CH−N and π−π interactions. Noteworthy, the NCI plots of all three rings 24−26 show no intramolecular N‒H interaction between adjacent pyridines/pyrazines and phenylenes which is an experimental hint of the lower ring strain energy compared to pristine [9]CPP due to lower steric repulsion (see intramolecular NCI plots, SI 6.5.). The ring strain in all N-doped nanorings 24–26 is significantly lower than for their all-carbon congener (see SI 5.2. for details) (Fig. 4b). Comparison of calculated structural data (on the B3LYP-D3/6-31 G(d) level of theory) with the crystallographic data for NCNRs 24−26 and CPP shows generally good agreement. Typically for CNRs with an odd number of incorporated rings30, geometric parameters (α, β, θ and Ø) of 24−26 show characteristic broad distributions indicated by the respective standard deviations given in parenthesis (Fig. 4b) (for a full overview of all measured parameters see SI 6.4, tables 11−18). Most interestingly, the average torsional angles θ of all N-doped rings 24−26 are significantly smaller compared to those of all-carbon [9]CPP. The most heavily N-doped [9]CPA (24) shows the smallest θ overall due to less intramolecular CH−CH steric repulsion (see postulation of Bachrach and Stück62, Fig. 1b).

To understand the heteroatomic influence on the physical properties of 24–26, we performed optical, electrochemical and theoretical investigations and compared those to literature-known [9]CPP.

The UV–vis absorption and fluorescence emission of all the N-doped nanorings 24–26 are red-shifted compared to [9]CPP (λmax,abs = 341 nm, ɛ = 1.41 × 105 m–1cm–1; λmax,em = 503 nm, ΦF = 0.6276, τ = 8.12 ns76) (Fig. 5a). The all-azine ring 24 absorbs at λmax,abs = 363 nm, but its extinction coefficient (ɛ = 2.13 × 104 m–1cm–1) is nearly seven-times lower than that of [9]CPP. The emission of the dodeca-N-doped ring 24 is also bathochromatically shifted at λmax,em = 527 nm. Its fluorescence quantum yield is decreased to ΦF = 0.26, but the fluorescence lifetime (τ = 7.67 ns) is similar to that of pristine [9]CPP. In contrast to 24, [9]CPP-Py (25) absorbs at a significantly lower wavelength of λmax,abs = 355 nm (ɛ = 9.55 × 104 m–1cm–1), but still red-shifted compared to [9]CPP. The emission occurs at λmax,em = 512 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of ΦF = 0.18 in a lifetime of τ = 4.07 ns. Surprisingly, its constitutional isomer [9]CPP-Pyr (26) shows completely different properties with the strongest overall red-shift in absorption at λmax,abs = 372 nm (ε = 4.97 × 104 m–1cm–1) as well as in fluorescence λmax,em = 532 nm (ΦF = 0.12, τ = 4.00 ns). These results stand in contrast to those of modestly N-doped carbon nanorings, where only slightly altered photophysical properties compared to pristine CPPs were reported38. As [9]CPP-Pyr (26) shows the strongest effect where six nitrogen atoms are equally centered on only three of the nine incorporated aromatics, it is obvious that also the positioning of the N-doping is highly relevant. The N-doped carbon nanorings 24, 25 and 26 show only a weak solvatochromic effect in the tested solvents (dichloromethane, THF, toluene and chlorobenzene) (see SI 7.1. for details). Noteworthy, the fluorescence quantum yields ΦF and lifetimes τ of nanorings 24–26 are significantly lower than those of pristine [9]CPP, resulting in nonradiative decay being much favored over radiative decay (Fig. 5c).

See SI 5.3., Tables S3−S5 for all transitions. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

As the red-shift of N-doped CNRs is generally attributed to the electronegative nitrogen atoms contributing with a greater effect to the molecules LUMOs than HOMOs38, we performed time-dependent (TD)DFT calculations on 24–26 at the B3LYP-D3/6-31 G(d) level of theory (see SI 5.3. for details) (Fig. 5d). Noteworthy, the orbitals of the strongly electronically depleted [9]CPA (24) lay significantly lower than for those of the other NCNRs 25 and 26. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of 24–26 rise from [9]CPP-Pyr (26, 2.98 eV) to [9]CPA (24, 3.03 eV) and [9]CPP-Py (25, 3.13 eV) (Fig. 5c). The HOMOs and LUMOs of all N-doped CNRs 24−26 are equally distributed over the whole ring structures. This suggests that the electronical difference of the azines (pyridine/pyrazine) and phenylenes is surprisingly not large enough for displaying a donor-acceptor type character in 24−26 since no characteristic distinctive HOMO–LUMO orbital separation is visible. This is supported by only minor solvatofluorochromic effects observed for 24–26 in different solvents (see SI 7.1. for details). For [9]CPA (24), HOMO–1 and HOMO–2 as well as LUMO +1 and LUMO +2 are fully degenerate. Instead, for [9]CPP-Py (25) and [9]CPP-Pyr (26), the orbitals are only nearly degenerate. Figure 5d shows the NCNRs 24−26 main transitions with their major contributions (coefficients >0.4) color-coded (for a full overview about all transitions, see SI 5.3., Tables S3−S5). Although the absolute values deviate slightly, the calculations are overall in good agreement with the observed experimental properties (for full discussion, see SI 5.3.). Despite being Laporte-forbidden, the HOMO→LUMO transition also contributes very slightly in all nanorings causing small shoulders between 400–450 nm in the visible region.

Additionally, the observed spectroscopic properties are also clearly macroscopically visible. The solid-state color under ambient light of all four nanorings is quite similar yellow since the absorption difference in the visible region is quite marginal. All N-doped nanorings 24–26 show only a slight solid-state fluorescence. Contrary to this, the pristine [9]CPP shows stronger solid-state fluorescence in agreement with its much higher quantum yield. Additionally, the N-doping-induced red shift is clearly macroscopically visible in solution shifting the emitted light from green to yellow (Fig. 5b).

The electrochemical properties of nanorings 24–26 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 6a). To ensure comparability, reductions were evaluated in THF and oxidations in CH2Cl2, respectively. As anticipated, all NCNRs 24–26 showed higher reduction and oxidation potentials than [9]CPP due to their electron-deficient nature. Importantly, while literature reports the reduction of [9]CPP to be irreversible77, we found that both oxidation and reduction of [9]CPP are reversible (see peak current ratios, Fig. 6c). This might be attributed to the measurement being conducted under ultra-inert conditions in a glovebox. [9]CPP-Py (25) shows a first reversible reduction at Ered1/2rev: –2.05 V, a second irreversible reduction at Ered,irrev: –2.38 V and an irreversible oxidation at Eox,irrev: 0.96 V. Its constitutional isomer [9]CPP-Pyr (26), with a lower HOMO–LUMO gap (see Fig. 5c), shows a first reversible reduction proceeding at Ered1/2rev: –2.00 V, a second irreversible reduction at Ered,irrev: –2.37 V and an irreversible oxidation at Eox,irrev: 0.91 V. Contrary, [9]CPA (24) is irreversibly reduced at Ered,irrev: –1.65 V, followed by multiple additional reductions at insignificantly smaller potentials. These measurements show that [9]CPA (24) is electrochemically rather unstable due to multiple irreversible reductions proceeding at similar potentials. The oxidation of the most electronically depleted ring 24 proceeds appropriately also at the largest overall potential Eox,irrev: 1.08 V irreversibly (Fig. 6c). Next, the separation of oxidation and reduction peaks (ΔEp,red) belonging to the reversible reductions Ered1/2rev was examined. This value is, for reversible redox processes, inversely proportional to the number of transferred electrons. The data revealed those to be in the range of 51–55 mV (only reversible events). By comparing these values to the one-electron-process of the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (101 mV), it was revealed that the reversible reductions of the N-doped nanorings 25 and 26 as well as [9]CPP are two-electron reductions from the neutral species to their dianionic derivatives (Fig. 6b).

In cyclic voltammetry, testing the reductive and oxidative behavior in the same solvent is generally highly desirable or even mandatory for some electrochemical applications. Therefore, we investigated the redox behavior of [9]CPP-Py (25), [9]CPP-Pyr (26) and [9]CPP also in CH3CN as its electrochemical stability allows the measurement of both oxidation and reduction in the same solvent. Unfortunately, however, [9]CPA (24) does not show sufficient solubility in CH3CN. The table in Fig. 6d summarizes the observed electrochemical parameter of those rings in CH3CN. Most importantly, the observed redox potentials in CH3CN are slightly shifted compared to the ones measured in THF and CH2Cl2, respectively. This illustrates that for appropriate comparability values measured in the same systems (solvent, conducting salt) should be considered.

Encouraged by those measured properties, we addressed potential applications for our N-doped nanorings 24–26. Our prior study reports that simple protonation of N-doped CNR 1 with a Brønsted acid alters photophysical properties (see for comparison introduction section and Fig. 1b)63. We now envisioned that our nanorings 24–26 could show affected properties via complexation with different amounts of a Lewis acid such as tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) (Fig. 7a)78,79. We commenced our studies with a 1H NMR titration experiment with [9]CPP-Py (25) wherein complexation became obvious. The complexation led to characteristic peak broadening and shifting of the signals of all hydrogen atoms attached to a pyridine, while no change of the phenylene hydrogen atoms was observed (Fig. 7b). Following, the UV–vis absorption and fluorescence titration study in fact revealed that property engineering can be triggered in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 7c). The addition of BCF causes a continuous red-shift in the UV–vis spectrum, lowering of the extinction coefficient as well as broadening of the absorption spectrum (from λmax,0equiv = 355 nm to λmax,10equiv = 375 nm). Interestingly, the fluorescence maximum is bathochromically shifted upon addition of 2 equivalents of BCF (from λmax,0equiv = 512 nm to λmax,2equiv = 546 nm) and the fluorescence quantum yield is also decreased (see SI 9.3. for details). However, when more than two equivalents of the Lewis acid are added, the emission undergoes a blue-shift and the quantum yield is increased (see SI 9.3. for details). Macroscopically, this emission color change is also visible from deep green (λmax,0equiv = 512 nm) over orange (λmax,2equiv = 546 nm) to yellow (λmax,10equiv = 534 nm) (Fig. 7d). This unique spectral effect might be attributed to an induced push‒pull effect between the, throughout BCF-coordination electronically depleted, pyridine moieties and the more electronically rich phenylene rings. This causes a narrowed HOMO–LUMO gap with thus energetically lower, red-shifted absorption as supported by (TD)DFT calculations (see SI 9.4. for details). Moreover, the induced push‒pull effect results in reduced orbital overlap causing the decreased fluorescence quantum yield. With larger amounts of BCF being coordinated to the N-doped nanoring, the dihedral angle θ increases due to steric repulsion causing hindered rotation. Therefore, non-radiative decay modes are more unlikely resulting in a higher probability for a radiative decay, thus explaining the enhanced fluorescence quantum yield (see SI 9.5. for full details). A similar optical phenomenon is visible for [9]CPA (24) in CH2Cl2, though the blue-shift occurs only after addition of 5 equivalents of BCF (see SI 9.2. for details). Interestingly, when [9]CPP-Pyr (26) is tested under otherwise identical conditions, nearly no supramolecular property engineering effect is visible in neither the 1H NMR titration nor the UV–vis and fluorescence studies (see SI chapter 9 for details). This suggests that the less Lewis-basic pyrazine moiety is far weaker binding than pyridine. Additionally, performing those titration studies of the N-doped ring 24−26 in different solvents (toluene, THF and chlorobenzene) showed varying property engineering effects. [9]CPP-Py (25) shows the unique red-shifted/blue-shifted emission in CH2Cl2, toluene and chlorobenzene, but [9]CPA (24) only in CH2Cl2. [9]CPP-Pyr (26) does not show this effect in any solvent. All rings 24−26 show non-affected properties in THF (see SI 9.2. for details). Of note, since BCF forms a super-Brønsted-acidic adduct with traces of water80,81, we cannot rule out that also partial protonation of the N-doped nanorings 24−26 proceeds. However, a control titration experiment with the Brønsted-acid trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) showed a different spectral change for which much more equivalents (300 equiv) of acid were needed (see SI 9.2. for details). Therefore, we suggest that mostly the Lewis acidity of BCF induces the observed non-covalent band gap engineering.

Additionally, the reversible reduction of [9]CPP-Py (25), [9]CPP-Pyr (26) and [9]CPP itself stimulated our interest to test them as charge storage materials. Recently, Chen, Du and co-workers82, and the Esser group83 applied polymer-incorporated carbon nanorings as anode or cathode material in lithium-ion or organic solid-state batteries, respectively. However, the charge storage properties of pristine carbon nanorings themselves in solution are underinvestigated so far. Thus, H-cell cycling in CH3CN was conducted to gain further insights into the long-term stability of the reduction process. [9]CPA (24) was not evaluated due to irreversibility of its reduction (see Fig. 6a for comparison), and [9]CPP and [9]CPP-Pyr (26) both showed only poor long-time stability. However, [9]CPP-Py (25) exhibited completely different behavior than both its all-carbon congener and its constitutional isomer 26. After 100 cycles the normalized discharge capacity is still at 36% ([9]CPP: 6%, [9]CPP-Pyr (26): 10%) (Fig. 7e). Although not ideal for an application in a battery, yet this constitutes a great improved electrochemical stability and could therefore stimulate further research. We propose that smaller analogs, like our N-doped rings, represent valuable model substrates for elucidating the origins of the frequently observed superiority in electrochemical properties exhibited by nitrogen-doped nanocarbon materials against their all-carbon congeners84,85,86,87. Thus, this result highlights the relevance of precise nitrogen doping over random doping.

We further examined this electrochemical behavior by looking into the number of transferred electrons during reduction and oxidation events. The cyclic voltammograms suggest that the reduction takes place as a two-electron process (see comparison Fig. 6b). This two-electron reduction from [9]CPP-Py (25) to [9]CPP-Py2– dianion (252–) could also be observed during the first charging of the H-cell. However, in the following oxidation and reduction events, only one electron is transferred (Fig. 7f). This suggests that a first charging event is needed to enter into the operating charge storage mode between dianion 252– and radical anion 25•–. In contrast to this, for [9]CPP, roughly four electrons are transmitted in the charging event, but only one electron is transferred during discharging. In the following charging event again, more electrons are needed as received in the former discharging, disqualifying this system as a charge storage material. To get further insight into the electrochemically involved species, we performed spectroelectrochemical analysis of the process. For [9]CPP-Py (25) a new species appeared with a λmax,abs around 540 nm (Fig. 7g). Comparison of this absorption spectrum with a calculated one suggests that this spectral change arises from the dianionic species 252– (see SI 10.2. for details). Additionally, for the H-cell cycling of [9]CPP-Py (25), an 1H NMR of the charged species shows no signal at room temperature, but clearly showed characteristic88, broad, upfield-shifted signals (4.0–6.5 ppm) corresponding to the dianion 252– at –80 °C (Fig. 7h) which fit well to calculated data, and a typical EPR-signal was obtained for radical anion 25•– (see SI 10.3. for details).

The enhanced performance of [9]CPP-Py (25) compared to both other rings might be attributed to the fact that the ΔE between the desired, first, reversible reduction and the undesired, second, irreversible reduction is slightly larger ([9]CPP-Py (25): 0.43 V; [9]CPP-Pyr (26): 0.38 V; [9]CPP: 0.36 V; all values measured in CH3CN) (see comparison Fig. 6c). This therefore allows more selective reduction to the desired dianion and most likely the smaller ΔE results in unselective overreduction to the respective tetraanion, a process which was chemically already described for CPPs89. Therefore, future research endeavors could be concentrated on increasing this ΔE while keeping the reduction potential as low as possible. Our studies indicate that N-doping might be beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical performance, but also show that too much ([9]CPA (24)) or the wrong nature ([9]CPP-Pyr (26)) of the dopant is also deteriorating. Regarding this, pyridinic doping is likely superior over pyrazinic doping.

Furthermore, we also showed that the [9]CPP-Py•– radical anion (25•–) can be fully oxidized to neutral [9]CPP-Py (25) when a higher potential is applied (Fig. 7i) and its corresponding 1H NMR spectrum showed complete back formation of uncharged species 25 (Fig. 7h). Single energy point calculations of all involved species showed that both reduction steps are energetically downhill (see SI 10.4. for details). For [9]CPP-Py2– dianion (252–-), the singlet state is approximately 6 kcal/mol more stable than its triplet state (see SI 10.4. for details). Additionally, it is known that the reduction of carbon nanorings results in a structural change towards quinoidal-type structures90, causing in-plane aromaticity with a surprising stability91. In fact, NICSiso calculations at the HF/6-31 + G(d,p) level of theory confirmed that also for dianion 252–- the aromaticity is increased from NICSiso = –2.30 for neutral 25 to NICSiso = –15.29 (see SI for details). Thus, the aromaticity-breaking back oxidation of the charged species is energetically uphill. Upon oxidation, the molecule undergoes substantial conformational rearrangement transforming from the nearly planar quinoidal structure 252− (θ = 3.4°) via the intermediate radical anion 25•– (θ = 12.4°) to the neutral form 25 (θ = 20.9°) (see SI 10.4). Notably, the associated increase in ring strain is significantly larger (∆≈ 6 kcal mol–1) for the second oxidation leading to the selective monooxidation to the [9]CPP-Py•– radical anion (25•–) under H-cell conditions (Fig. 7J).

In conclusion, we have developed a synthetic access to an all-N-heterocyclic nanoring (24) through an Au-macrocyclization method. Additionally, other highly N-doped CNRs 25 and 26 were synthesized using the developed method. Although additional attempts to synthesize other CPAs were unsuccessful using the Tsuchido-Osakada approach, it remains the only CNR construction strategy that allowed the synthesis of a CPA derivative. In our hands, CPA derivatives were not accessible through other established methods (Jasti/Bertozzi, Itami, Yamago)21,22,23. The measurement of UV–vis and fluorescence spectra showed red-shifts for all N-doped structures compared to [9]CPP. However, quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes are decreased. This is due to the effect of electronegative nitrogen atoms contributing stronger to a LUMO-lowering than on their HOMOs resulting in overall smaller HOMO‒LUMO gaps, as investigated by (TD)DFT-calculations. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that both oxidation and reduction potentials are higher compared to [9]CPP, albeit only the reduction is reversible. The strongly electronically diminished [9]CPA (24) shows very poor electrochemical stability by multiple irreversible reductions at close potentials. The synthesized nanorings 24–26 were additionally examined in non-covalent supramolecular property engineering with BCF, wherein only pyridine-containing nanorings 24 and 25 showed affected properties by coordination with the Lewis acid. Instead, the properties of pyrazine-derivative 26 were not affected. Furthermore, the reduction of nanorings 25, 26 and [9]CPP was analyzed in more detail to assess their potential as energy storage materials. It became evident that selective N-doping has a significant impact on the long-term electrochemical stability, which is crucial for integrating nanocarbon materials into real-world applications. Of note, N-doped carbon nanotubes have already found applications in various batteries82,83,84,85, but their controlled atom-precise synthesis remains highly problematic today. We therefore hope that our analysis of N-doped nanorings could help to get a broader general understanding of N-doping in nanocarbon chemistry.

Most importantly, all experiments in our comparison study revealed that next to the bare number of dopants their positioning is highly relevant for inducing property changes. This stands in contrast to the fact that most N-doping in nanocarbon chemistry proceeds randomly. Therefore, we herewith would like to encourage further research in related fields and expect impactful breakthroughs since the heteroatoms allow the formation of structures inaccessible for pristine nanocarbons.

Under an argon atmosphere, a bis-borylated linker 7 (1.0 equiv), bis-Au-dcpm complex 14 (1.0 equiv) and Cs2CO3 (6.0 equiv) were suspended in a mixture of PhMe/EtOH/H2O (4:1:1, 0.02 m) and stirred at 50 °C for 24−72 h. The mixture was allowed to cool down to ambient temperature, CH2Cl2 was added and the formed precipitate was filtered off. The filter cake was washed with H2O and EtOH, and dried on high vacuum to yield Au-macrocycle 8. Under an argon atmosphere, the Au-macrocycle 8 (1.0 equiv) was dissolved in C2H2Cl4 (1.7 µm) and chilled to 0 °C. PhICl2 (6.0 equiv) was added as solid in one portion and the resulting mixture was stirred for two hours while the temperature was allowed to rise to ambient conditions. Afterwards, all volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining yellow solid was purified via preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) to yield the respective N-doped carbon nanoring as bright yellow solid.

Developing robotic hands that adapt to real-world dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and machine intelligence. Despite notable advances in replicating human-hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (P < 0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering promising perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behaviour.

Precise sensory–motor control in real-world scenarios is fundamental to machine intelligence and embodied artificial intelligence (AI)1,2. A hallmark challenge in this field is the control of dextrous robotic hands3. Despite advances in mechatronic systems and sophisticated finger designs that enable enhanced dexterity4, the limited availability of rich sensory feedback fundamentally restricts their ability to adapt during dynamic interactions5,6. Understanding and addressing this sensory limitation is crucial for deploying robotic hands in real-world scenarios that demand nuanced control and rapid adaptation.

The robotics community has long recognized this challenge, approaching it through increasingly sophisticated hardware and control strategies. On the hardware front, researchers have developed intricate mechanical designs that closely mimic human-hand kinematics7,8,9,10,11, primarily relying on proprioceptive sensing for joint-level feedback. These hardware advances, often combined with visual perception, have enabled various control paradigms: from planning-based methods that execute precise finger gaiting12,13 to learning-based approaches that develop control policies through training14,15,16 and recently to large language models that provide high-level task reasoning17. However, a fundamental limitation persists: without the direct sensation of local contacts—crucial information for both modelling and control—these systems fail to handle unexpected physical interactions5.

The solution may lie in understanding human hand control, which achieves remarkable precise control through a sophisticated tactile perception system. This biological system comprises two key elements: a dense array of tactile sensors embedded throughout the skin18,19,20 and specialized neural processing in the primary somatosensory cortex that rapidly interprets and integrates this massive sensory input20,21,22. This combination enables humans to instantly detect and respond to subtle contact changes during manipulation, a capability that current robotic systems have yet to replicate.

Drawing direct inspiration from this biological architecture, we present F-TAC Hand (Full-Hand Tactile-Embedded Biomimetic Hand), a system that bridges the sensory gap in robotic manipulation. The core innovation lies in its comprehensive tactile sensing capability, featuring high-resolution coverage (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of the hand surface. This is achieved through the effective integration of 17 vision-based tactile sensors in six optimized configurations, where sensor covers serve dual purposes as both sensing elements and structural components. The hand maintains full human-like dexterity, demonstrated by its high Kapandji score23 and ability to perform all 33 human grasp types24. Complementing this hardware, we developed a generative algorithm that produces human-like hand configurations, creating a rich knowledge base for object interaction. The integration enables closed-loop tactile-informed control that processes high-dimensional contact data for precise, adaptive manipulation.

To rigorously validate F-TAC Hand's capabilities, we focused on multi-object grasping—a task that epitomizes the challenges of dextrous manipulation5,25. While single-object manipulation has been successfully addressed by one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) parallel grippers26,27,28, simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects presents two distinct challenges: it requires both precise contact detection across the entire hand and strategic motion adjustments to prevent object collisions. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand directly addresses these challenges. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates significant performance improvements over non-tactile alternatives (P < 0.0001), particularly in scenarios involving real-world execution noise and dynamic object interactions.

Our work advances the field through two primary contributions: a practical demonstration that full-hand tactile sensing can be achieved without compromising hand motion capabilities, and comprehensive empirical validation of its benefits. By solving the technical challenges that previously restricted tactile sensing to simple grippers, this research enables unprecedented investigations into sophisticated tactile-embodied intelligence6. More broadly, our results provide concrete evidence for the critical role of rich sensory feedback in intelligent behaviour, suggesting promising directions for developing embodied AI systems beyond purely computational approaches29,30.

F-TAC Hand advances the state of dextrous robotic hands through its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities while maintaining a full range of motion. The hand achieves human-like tactile coverage, with sensing elements extending across 70% of the palmar surface at a density of 10,000 taxels (the pixels in camera CMOS) cm−2 (Fig. 1), notably surpassing current commercial solutions such as Shadow Hand, which provides only five-point feedback over less than 20% of its surface11 (comparison with other tactile arrays is available in Supplementary Section 1). This extensive coverage is achieved through an array of vision-based tactile sensors in multiple configurations (see exploded view in Extended Data Fig. 1a and physical dimensions in Supplementary Section 1), featuring specially designed covers that align with the hand's phalanges and palm to minimize mechanical redundancy while replicating the natural kinematic structure of the human hand (Fig. 2a). Each of the five fingers incorporates three DoFs, contributing to the hand's total 15-DoF configuration that enables human-like dexterity. A specialized electronic module enables large-scale sensor reading acquisition while minimizing space, weight and cabling requirements (Extended Data Fig. 1b). The hand's dimensions mirror those of an adult human hand, measuring 194 mm from wrist to middle fingertip (Fig. 2a), and its modular design architecture allows for easy adaptation to different physical dimensions while maintaining functionality.

F-TAC Hand is a dextrous robotic hand featuring a high-density tactile sensing array that matches human capabilities, as benchmarked against physiological data from ref. 19. Detailed illustrations of the sensor construction and assembly process are provided in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1. Similarly to its biological counterpart, it leverages sophisticated tactile feedback to accomplish complex manipulation tasks, such as precise in-hand object pose arrangement, enabling simultaneous and stable grasping of multiple items, a capability highlighted as challenging but crucial in ref. 5.

Offsets in rotation due to cable and joint alignment are also shown. d, Top-down-view comparison of F-TAC Hand and human finger flexion. e, Despite the numerous sensors, F-TAC Hand retains its mobility, as evidenced by a successful Kapandji test23, where the thumb fingertip sequentially touches specific points on the hand as numbered in the figure. PP, proximal phalanx; MP, middle phalanx; DIP, distal interphalangeal; PIP, proximal interphalangeal; MCP, metacarpophalangeal.

Building upon its extensive tactile sensing coverage, F-TAC Hand also achieves comprehensive motion capabilities that match state-of-the-art dextrous hands9,10,11. The hand implements full mobility using just five slim cables (Extended Data Fig. 1c) with substantial payload capacity (Fig. 2b). Each cable controls the flexion and extension of a finger (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e), working in concert with stiffness-tuned springs at each joint (Fig. 2c) to replicate the coordinated yet semi-independent movements characteristic of human hands31 (Fig. 2d). An additional degree of actuation enables thumb opposition, expanding the hand's motion versatility (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Detailed fabrication procedures are provided in ‘Tactile sensor fabrication' and ‘F-TAC Hand fabrication' in Methods. The hand's dexterity is demonstrated through two evaluations: the Kapandji test23, completing all ten designated thumb-to-hand contact points shown in Fig. 2e, and the successful execution of all 33 human grasp types (Fig. 3).

Empowered by its smart design, the workspace of F-TAC Hand enables it to perform all 33 human grasping types, as documented in ref. 24.

The hand's tactile sensing system utilizes the photometric stereo principle32,33, converting light intensity variations into surface gradient information (Fig. 4a). Contact surface geometry is reconstructed through a two-stage process. First, an array of encoder–decoder neural networks (Fig. 4b) maps physics-based relationships between surface gradients and intensity variations for each sensor. Next, a Poisson solver generates high-fidelity surface geometries, visualized as normal maps (Fig. 4c). The detailed sensor characteristics are available in Supplementary Section 1.

a–d, Raw tactile sensor readings from the configuration shown in Fig. 1a (a) are processed by neural networks (b) to reconstruct contact site geometries (c), visualized as normal maps. The neural networks, trained on simulated data (d) generated by a physics-based image formation model, enable efficient and precise mapping of extensive raw data to geometric information at the contact interface. e,f, When grasping an object (e), F-TAC Hand captures detailed contact information through its advanced tactileer sensing capabilities (f). g, This rich tactile feedback enables F-TAC Hand to accurately perceive and interpret object characteristics, as demonstrated by its precise estimation of in-hand object poses.

The unprecedented scale of F-TAC Hand's tactile sensing system required development of efficient calibration solutions. We addressed this through a physics-based image formation model (detailed in Supplementary Sections 2 and 3) that generates synthetic readings of elastomer deformations during contacts (Fig. 4d). This approach enables efficient neural network training (Fig. 4b) and accurate sensor calibration.

The integration of fine-grained tactile sensing with robust motion capabilities enables F-TAC Hand to effectively grasp diverse objects, including challenging cases such as crystal balls (Fig. 4e), while simultaneously capturing detailed contact information (Fig. 4f). These sensory data enable accurate object pose estimation during manipulation (Fig. 4g). Additional demonstrations are provided in Supplementary Video.

Through this combination of dense tactile arrays and advanced motor capabilities, F-TAC Hand achieves unprecedented biomimetic fidelity, advancing both robotic manipulation capabilities and our understanding of human manual dexterity.

While F-TAC Hand's high articulation enables sophisticated manipulation, it presents unique challenges in grasp planning. The increased number of DoFs makes traditional mechanical equation-based methods computationally intractable34. Learning-based alternatives35, though avoiding complex analytical solutions, require extensive training data that are both costly to collect and potentially biased by human demonstration preferences—a particular challenge for highly articulated dextrous hands.

We model the robotic grasp generation of rigid objects as sampling hand poses from a Gibbs distribution conditioned on object geometry. Each grasp is associated with an energy value derived from force closure criteria, which evaluates how well the grasp can resist external forces. Lower energy values indicate better grasping capability; see ‘Probabilistic formulation for grasp generation' in Methods and Supplementary Section 4 for details. Due to the hand's high number of DoFs and the non-convex nature of the problem36, we sample grasps from random initializations and apply a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to reduce energy and escape local minima, converging to low-energy, high-quality grasps; see ‘Exploration algorithm for complex energy landscape' in Methods for details. We validated the approach using a diverse test set of 23 objects, including spheres, cylinders, cuboids and irregular shapes (Fig. 5a). By executing the algorithm from various initializations, F-TAC Hand's biomimetic kinematics (Extended Data Fig. 2) and varied object geometries result in diverse grasping poses (Supplementary Video).

a, A total of 23 objects, varying in dimensions and geometrical complexity, are chosen to assess the efficacy of the grasp generation method. b–d, The landscape of possible grasps is depicted as a disconnectivity graph, generated using the ADELM algorithm. e, For the pliers, the diversity in grasp strategies mirrors its common usage in daily human activities. f, This diversity in grasping strategies is maintained even when the object possesses complex geometric features. g, Comprehensive categorization of the generated grasps for all 23 objects, on the basis of human grasp types adopted from ref. 24. The results collectively cover all 19 common grasp types, implying the human-like diversity of the generated grasping strategies.

The resulting grasping poses are analysed through the Attraction–Diffusion Energy Landscape Mapping (ADELM) algorithm37 to visualize the complex energy landscape defined in equation (2), as shown in Fig. 5b–d. In this visualization, circles represent local minima (areas of low energy), where each local minimum contains at least one feasible grasp. The circle's size indicates how many similar grasps exist within that local minimum. The circles are colour-coded according to the majority grasp type on the basis of ref. 24: power, precision and intermediate. The vertical connecting bars between circles represent energy barriers between different local minima, where shorter bars indicate easier transitions between grasping poses, while longer bars signify transitions that are more difficult to achieve. Direct comparisons between generated grasps and human demonstrations (Fig. 5b–d) in the boxes below validate the human-like nature of our solutions. This approach maintains its effectiveness even for challenging cases such as pliers and adversarial objects38 (Fig. 5e,f), with comprehensive energy landscapes presented in Extended Data Fig. 3.

To quantitatively assess the human-like diversity of our approach, we analysed 1,800 generated grasps according to the taxonomy of ref. 24, categorizing them into 19 common grasp types (Supplementary Section 5). The resulting distribution (Fig. 5g) demonstrates comprehensive coverage across the human grasp repertoire, from frequent strategies such as power sphere and precision sphere to specialized configurations such as distal type and palmar grasps.

Further analysis using contact maps39 reveals natural clustering patterns that align with human grasp classifications. By applying dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis and visualization via t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (Extended Data Fig. 4), we observe distinct groupings of power and precision grasps, with intermediate grasps appropriately positioned near the boundary defined by a radial-basis-function-kernel support vector classifier. This distribution mirrors human grasp categorization patterns, where intermediate grasps share characteristics of both primary types (computational details in Supplementary Section 6).

The demonstrated ability to generate diverse, human-like hand configurations provides F-TAC Hand with both optimal and near-optimal control strategies. This algorithmic foundation, working in concert with the low-level controller, enables enhanced dexterity and adaptability in real-world manipulation scenarios.

The integration of advanced tactile sensing with diverse grasping strategies enables F-TAC Hand to implement a closed-loop sensory–motor feedback mechanism, allowing real-time adaptation to environmental changes. The implementation details are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 7 and described in ‘Context-sensitive motor controls' in Methods.

We demonstrate F-TAC Hand's capabilities through multi-object grasping5, a critical benchmark for hand dexterity that surpasses the limitations of 1-DoF parallel grippers. This challenging task demands precise contact detection and strategic adjustments to avoid collisions—capabilities that remain elusive for current AI systems5. While recent advances13,25 show promise, managing the stochastic nature of real-world objects, especially those with complex geometries, remains challenging. F-TAC Hand overcomes these limitations through precise contact-point identification (Fig. 6a).

a, F-TAC Hand's ability to grasp multiple objects simultaneously in a human-like manner. b, Despite execution noise, F-TAC Hand can optimize object transport through multi-object grasping. c, Real-world disturbances significantly increase second-grasp collision rates (inset: collision detection point in red), highlighting the necessity of tactile monitoring. d, Tactile-informed adaptation significantly improves second-grasp success rates. Plots c and d show 60 independent technical replicates (blue dots), each representing a unique object combination tested across 10 trials. Box plots show 25th–75th percentiles (box), median (centre line) and minimum/maximum values (whiskers). Shaded areas (orange in c, green in d) show kernel-density estimations of data distribution. The identical P values (2.1 × 10−17) displayed in the two panels derive from one-sided paired t-tests (t(59) = 11.8) comparing perfect versus real-world execution (c) and with versus without tactile-informed adaptation (d). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.

To evaluate real-world performance, we mounted F-TAC Hand on a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm for multi-object transport tasks (Fig. 6b). The goal is to grasp as many objects as possible in one go to maximize transportation efficiency. While optimal strategies exist under ideal conditions (red route in Fig. 6b), real-world variables—such as imperfect robot positioning and object perception—require adaptive motor control. The other coloured routes in Fig. 6b illustrate actual scenarios where F-TAC Hand encountered wrong object positions but leveraged its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities (Fig. 4g) to assess situations and dynamically switch to alternative strategies that accommodate available space, even if theoretically suboptimal. Additional demonstrations of adaptive behaviours, including responses to finger impairments and ball size adaptation, are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Video.

We quantified the impact of tactile sensing through extensive experiments involving 60 object combinations across 600 real-world trials. Initial grasps were programmed from a disembodied AI perspective, using theoretically optimal strategies without considering environmental dynamics. Each combination underwent ten real-world trials, with tactile feedback assessing in-hand object positions and potential collision risks. Collision detection involves two steps: using tactile information to estimate the grasped object's pose as shown in Fig. 4g, and then checking whether the union of the grasped object geometry and the next target object geometry is null. The observed collision rate in real-world execution (M = 0.465, s.d. = 0.306) differed significantly from theoretical predictions (M = 0.000, s.d. = 0.000), highlighting the substantial gap between simulation and reality, t(59) = 11.8, P = 2.1 × 10−17 (Fig. 6c).

F-TAC Hand's adaptive capabilities become particularly evident when comparing tactile-informed versus non-tactile-informed control. Upon detecting collision risks, the system rapidly (~100 ms) switches to alternative strategies that might be suboptimal in theory but practical in reality. In scenarios with potential collisions, the non-tactile-informed approach inevitably fails, while the tactile-informed approach maintains productivity through adaptive replanning. The tactile-informed approach achieved perfect adaptation (M = 1.000, s.d. = 0.000) compared with significantly lower success rates without tactile feedback (M = 0.535, s.d. = 0.306), t(59) = 11.8, P = 2.1 × 10−17 (Fig. 6d). Notably, in collision-free scenarios, the two approaches demonstrate comparable execution times, with tactile-informed collision checking adding only ~1 s of processing time, indicating that tactile sensing provides critical robustness with minimal computational overhead during normal operations. The detailed method and the logic chain are available in ‘Context-sensitive motor controls' in Methods.

F-TAC Hand represents a substantial advance in robotic sensory–motor integration, achieving unprecedented integration of comprehensive tactile sensing with human-like dexterity. Its high-density tactile coverage (70% of palmar surface, 10,000 taxels cm−2) substantially exceeds current robotic hand capabilities. This exceptional sensing is achieved through the effective integration of vision-based tactile sensors, physics-based calibration methods and specialized electronics—all while maintaining full motion capabilities.

Recent advances in tactile sensing33,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 have primarily focused on parallel grippers. While these sensor-equipped grippers demonstrate enhanced capabilities in specific tasks—such as cable following26, surface following27 and articulated object manipulation28—their low-DoF mechanical structure fundamentally limits their dexterity for complex manipulation.

In contrast, F-TAC Hand's integration of comprehensive tactile feedback with high articulation enables more sophisticated manipulation, as demonstrated by its successful multi-object grasping under uncertain conditions. The closed-loop sensory–motor feedback enables context-sensitive adaptations, significantly improving performance in dynamic real-world scenarios. This combination of sensing and adaptability is essential for practical robotics applications requiring safe and efficient environmental interaction.

The design philosophy behind F-TAC Hand emphasizes replicability, aiming to catalyse broader research in tactile-enabled manipulation. Its achievement of human-like capabilities opens possibilities in prosthetics, teleoperation, collaborative robotics and human–robot interaction. The hardware's compact, modular architecture facilitates efficient data acquisition and calibration while being adaptable to various robotic platforms. The training-free stochastic optimization approach for grasp generation remains platform independent, enabling rapid deployment across different hand designs (Extended Data Fig. 6). While our current implementation assumes known object geometry, this was a deliberate scope decision to focus on tactile-informed adaptive control rather than geometry reconstruction. Pre-grasping geometry acquisition could be readily integrated using existing vision techniques49,50, and real-time reconstruction during manipulation represents a promising direction for future work. This combination of diverse grasping capabilities and environmental adaptability makes F-TAC Hand particularly suited for complex manipulation tasks.

Beyond technical achievements, our results suggest that practical AI requires tight integration between sensory processing and strategic adaptation. The demonstrated importance of comprehensive tactile feedback in achieving human-like dexterity aligns with cognitive and neuroscientific perspectives that emphasize the essential role of physical interaction in intelligence51,52,53,54.

The tactile sensor design for F-TAC Hand's distal phalanx (Extended Data Fig. 1a) addresses key challenges in miniaturization and integration. A custom camera module using a single flexible flat cable for both power and data transmission resolves traditional cabling constraints. The sensor housing's U-shaped clevis and tang structure enables the interconnection necessary for anthropomorphic articulation.

Contact detection relies on analysing elastomer surface deformation through reflected light intensity. To achieve uniform illumination in the confined phalanx space, we developed a specialized Lambertian membrane. This membrane combines an air-brushed spherical aluminium film (mill-resistant matte oil with 1-μm spherical aluminium powder) with a clear silicone base (Smooth-On Solaris parts A&B, 1:1 ratio). The illumination system comprises surface-mounted Lumileds LUXEON 2835 Color Line light-emitting diodes (red, green, blue and white) arranged around an acrylic support, enhanced by light-diffuser films. An OV2640 image sensor with a 160° wide-angle lens provides colour-compatible imaging, while 7-mm × 7-mm × 4-mm heat sinks ensure thermal stability.

The complete sensing system architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1b) integrates these components with a custom control module. The module interfaces with cameras through digital video ports, maintaining 240-px × 240-px image buffers. Spatial resolution of 0.1 mm per pixel is achieved, verified through known-object calibration. An expanded Serial Peripheral Interface bus coordinates sequential camera captures, with USB connectivity for PC data transmission and U2D2 protocol for servo control.

The tactile components are integrated into anatomically scaled phalanx covers matching adult hand dimensions. This modular, single-cable design overcomes traditional challenges in implementing high-resolution, extensive tactile sensing in robotic hands.

F-TAC Hand's structure (Extended Data Fig. 1c) integrates 17 compact vision-based sensors in six configurations to achieve human-hand proportions. The four fingers—index, middle, ring and little—share a common architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1d) with three serial revolute joints: metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal, each offering 0–90° range. These joints utilize aluminium shafts supported by deep-groove ball bearings, with screw-bushing fixation and torsion springs maintaining a 0° rest position.

The thumb design (Extended Data Fig. 1e) features an additional carpometacarpal joint DoF, enabling 90° motion range with a 45° offset from its proximal interphalangeal joint axis. The two-part palm base facilitates assembly and houses compact tactile sensors, with the upper region incorporating dual cameras in a single sensor for enhanced perception (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

Finger actuation employs a cable-driven mechanism, with a single cable routed along both sides of each finger's phalanxes, converging at the palm base. Torsion springs facilitate a return to rest position upon cable relaxation. Each finger is powered by a DYNAMIXEL XC330X-T288-T servo motor. For experimental validation, F-TAC Hand mounts onto a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator.

The generation of grasp configurations for multifingered robotic hands presents notable challenges, particularly when maximizing dextrous capabilities. Instead of relying on data-driven approaches that demand extensive annotated datasets, we formulate grasp generation as a Gibbs distribution sampling problem:

where H = (T, q) represents the hand's pose and joint configurations, O denotes the target object, E(H, O) defines the grasping energy function and Z is the intractable normalizing constant. The hand's surface geometry S(H) is computed through forward kinematics.

This energy function combines two weighted components—grasp quality energy Egrasp and physical plausibility energy Ephy:

To assess the quality of the grasp, we use force closure criteria to define Egrasp(H, O):

where x = {xi} represents frictional contact points on S(H), and FC(x, O) assesses force closure formation on the object.

Ephy enforces physical constraints by penalizing hand–object penetration and joint limit violations:

where \({d}_{O}^{{\rm{SDF}}}(v)\) defines the signed distance function from point v to object O, and \([{q}_{j}^{\min },{q}_{j}^{\max }]\) specifies joint limits for each of the J joints.

This probabilistic formulation enables scalable generation of diverse, effective grasp configurations.

The nonlinearity of hand kinematics and contact-point selection creates a complex energy landscape for E, making naive gradient-based sampling prone to suboptimal local minima. We address this through a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm that alternates between contact-point sampling and gradient-based pose optimization.

The algorithm initializes with random hand pose H and contact points x ⊂ S(H). Through L iterations, it updates H and x to maximize P(H, O). Each iteration stochastically chooses between updating the hand pose via Langevin dynamics or replacing a contact point with a uniform sample from the hand surface. Updates undergo Metropolis–Hastings acceptance criteria, favouring lower-energy configurations.

This combination of stochastic updates enables escape from local minima, while Metropolis acceptance guides sampling toward low-energy configurations. An algorithm efficiency analysis is detailed in Supplementary Section 7.

Extended Data Fig. 7 demonstrates adaptive control in a four-ball transport scenario, where ball repositories are weighted and combined by volume. Initially, at t1, F-TAC Hand plans to grasp a golf ball and softball using its little finger and remaining digits. To illustrate the control mechanism, we introduce a manual perturbation during golf-ball acquisition, causing F-TAC Hand to secure the golf ball with its index finger at t2. The occupation of the index finger invalidates the planned softball grasp (light grey in Extended Data Fig. 7), necessitating a strategy revision. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand detects the situation and adapts by executing an alternative approach—grasping a yoga ball using its thumb, index and middle fingers. While this solution was initially considered suboptimal, it demonstrates the system's capacity for real-time adaptation to unexpected conditions.

We adopt the modified Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) norm to establish the coordinates for the palm base and finger phalanxes. The transformations between these coordinates are represented in DH tables. In these tables, ai−1 is the distance along Xi−1 between Zi−1 and Zi, αi−1 is the angle about Xi−1 between Zi−1 and Zi, di is the distance along Zi between Xi−1 and Xi, and θi is the angle about Xi between Xi−1 and Xi.

We examine the grasp relationships among six example objects (pawn, vase, multimeter, board eraser, coffee bottle, and Coke can) using a large disconnectivity graph. This landscape comprises 79 basins, each categorized into one of three grasp types (Power, Intermediate, Precision) based on the majority of grasps it contains. Within each basin, similar grasp strategies are observed across different objects, as illustrated in (a)-(f).

Visualization of grasp samples with t-SNE reveals that most Power grasps and Precision grasps are clustered separately, with Intermediate grasps lying in between. This map indicates a strong alignment between the generated results and human definitions of grasp types.

Our algorithm generalizes to various hand types without requiring specific mechanical structures or training samples. a, eight objects are used for testing with four different hands: b, two-finger EZGripeer56, c, Barrett 3-fingered Gripper57, d four-finger Allegro Hand58, and e, anthropomorphic Shadow Hand11.

F-TAC Hand employs a two-stage strategy for multi-object transportation. It adjusts for in-hand position variations due to perturbations, dynamically adapting its second-stage strategy to prevent collisions and maximize efficiency (Light gray in the grasping repository indicates that grasping strategies are rendered infeasible at the current time).

If you've had a passing interest in Apple over the past year, you've likely heard of the company's struggles in the AI race. Apple Intelligence, which arrived slightly late after the launch of the iPhone 16, fell short of expectations, and Apple has yet to deliver the much-improved Siri it promised at WWDC 2024. Siri got a new look and an integration with ChatGPT, but its ability to understand your personal context via emails, messages, notes, and calendar was “indefinitely” delayed earlier this year as Apple is reportedly facing several challenges.

Even if Apple were to deliver a better Siri, would people use it? Despite arriving first, Siri has long been derided by iPhone owners, often the butt of a joke, as Google Assistant and Alexa rose to the top. But if Apple wants its customers to take the supposed improvements coming to the voice assistant seriously, it should consider taking a page from Google and killing it off for something new.

Google has no problem with pulling the plug when things aren't working or priorities change. In fact, the search giant has a history of killing so many of its services that there's a website dedicated to tracking all the gravestones. One of its most recent terminations? Google Assistant.

Nearly 10 years since its debut, Google Assistant is in the process of being phased out from every ecosystem it was a part of. Wear OS smartwatches? It's being replaced soon. Android Auto? In the coming months. It's already no longer the default assistant on Android phones. By 2026, it's unlikely we'll see the branding anywhere anymore. So ends the reign of arguably the most effective voice assistant of its time, gone without a care in the world.

But Google's decision to kill it, instead of keeping the Google Assistant name, may have been smart. “It's primarily branding,” says Chris Harrison, who directs the Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. “But it underlines a technology reason, which is that the previous generation of these assistants really weren't very much like assistants. Asking for the weather and setting a timer—not very sophisticated. You wouldn't really ask a personal assistant for those mundane tasks.”

Gemini is completely different. It can rummage through your emails to find the location of your kid's soccer match, parse through large documents, and when paired with a camera-enabled device, can understand what you're seeing and offer help. Its capabilities are vastly superior to what Google Assistant could do. Apple's goal is to achieve similar results in a more privacy-friendly way—so that when you have Siri connect to ChatGPT, your data is not passed off to OpenAI.

“Apple thought Siri's capabilities would grow, but that didn't really materialize; Siri kind of atrophied out of the gate,"" Harrison says. “Now, we're in this new generation of things that are really much more like assistants—they can do reasoning, personalization.” But while Google Assistant and Gemini both have voice interfaces and at a first glance may share a similar look, they're two different applications. “Simply renaming it Google Assistant 2.0 would not spur people to use it in a fundamentally different way.” It seems that switch to Gemini has been key to moving customer understanding along.

However, it's fair to say that Apple and even Amazon's Alexa have had a cultural cachet that Google Assistant never enjoyed. It wasn't unusual to hear Siri or Alexa's name in a movie or TV show; they were much more recognizable than Google's generic-named voice assistant. This may be why Amazon decided to keep the Alexa branding and simply add a “+” icon to denote the new souped-up version of Alexa powered by the latest large language models—and perhaps why Apple is still hanging onto Siri.

This might have all been OK if Apple actually delivered on its promise and released a functioning, much-improved Siri when it originally said it would. With a massive marketing push to put Apple Intelligence in everyone's mind (maybe a regretful move), it would have been a great opportunity to wow users with a much-improved Siri. Months later, customers are left wondering why Siri—new look and all—still lags behind.

But the broader problem affecting all large language models isn't just the branding, but the user interface. Harrison compares it to the days of command-line computing and the shift to the graphical user interface (GUI) in the '80s and '90s. It wasn't the graphics that made the latter more popular, but the discoverability and explorable interface. In the command-line era, you had to remember how to do anything. With GUI, you could put anyone in front of a computer, and they'd be able to figure out how to navigate the operating system.

If you put someone in front of ChatGPT or Gemini, say it's an incredible tool, and tell them to ask it anything, they'll just stare blankly at the blinking prompt. “It's like we've gone back 30 years in interface design. They have no idea what to do or say."" Harrison says he did this exact experiment with his parents: They asked what the weather was tomorrow, and the AI responded that it didn't have that information.

“We've regressed in discoverability,"" he says. “A regular person, not the tech people, if all they've been doing is setting timers with Siri for the past 10 years, and now they have to think about it in a fundamentally different way—that's an extremely hard problem. Some sort of renaming of the application is going to be important.""

Saying goodbye to Siri would be a big move for Apple—after all, it has spent more that a decade investing in it. But most people today still use it for playing music, checking weather, and setting timers, and aren't even pushing the boundaries of its current, relatively limited, capabilities. It's hard to see that changing anytime soon, even if Siri's feature-packed next generation arrives as promised.

“For 99 percent of the planet, this kind of AI revolution has totally gone over their head,” Harrison says. Like the 10-year transition from command line to graphical user interfaces, rethinking the way we use these personal voice assistants will take time and education, but maybe a new name will help Apple with the transition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Researcher Figured Out How to Reveal Any Phone Number Linked to a Google Account","https://www.wired.com/story/a-researcher-figured-out-how-to-reveal-any-phone-number-linked-to-a-google-account/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

A cybersecurity researcher was able to figure out the phone number linked to any Google account, information that is usually not public and is often sensitive, according to the researcher, Google, and 404 Media's own tests.

The issue has since been fixed but at the time presented a privacy issue in which even hackers with relatively few resources could have brute forced their way to peoples' personal information.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

“I think this exploit is pretty bad since it's basically a gold mine for SIM swappers,” the independent security researcher who found the issue, who goes by the handle brutecat, wrote in an email. SIM swappers are hackers who take over a target's phone number in order to receive their calls and texts, which in turn can let them break into all manner of accounts.

In mid-April, we provided brutecat with one of our personal Gmail addresses in order to test the vulnerability. About six hours later, brutecat replied with the correct and full phone number linked to that account.

“Essentially, it's bruting the number,” brutecat said of their process. Brute forcing is when a hacker rapidly tries different combinations of digits or characters until finding the ones they're after. Typically that's in the context of finding someone's password, but here brutecat is doing something similar to determine a Google user's phone number.

Brutecat said in an email the brute forcing takes around one hour for a U.S. number, or 8 minutes for a UK one. For other countries, it can take less than a minute, they said.

In an accompanying video demonstrating the exploit, brutecat explains an attacker needs the target's Google display name. They find this by first transferring ownership of a document from Google's Looker Studio product to the target, the video says. They say they modified the document's name to be millions of characters, which ends up with the target not being notified of the ownership switch. Using some custom code, which they detailed in their write up, brutecat then barrages Google with guesses of the phone number until getting a hit.

“The victim isn't notified at all :)” a caption in the video reads.

A Google spokesperson told 404 Media in a statement “This issue has been fixed. We've always stressed the importance of working with the security research community through our vulnerability rewards program and we want to thank the researcher for flagging this issue. Researcher submissions like this are one of the many ways we're able to quickly find and fix issues for the safety of our users.”

Phone numbers are a key piece of information for SIM swappers. These sorts of hackers have been linked to countless hacks of individual people in order to steal online usernames or cryptocurrency. But sophisticated SIM swappers have also escalated to targeting massive companies. Some have worked directly with ransomware gangs from Eastern Europe.

Armed with the phone number, a SIM swapper may then impersonate the victim and convince their telecom to reroute text messages to a SIM card the hacker controls. From there, the hacker can request password reset text messages, or multi-factor authentication codes, and log into the victim's valuable accounts. This could include accounts that store cryptocurrency, or even more damaging, their email, which in turn could grant access to many other accounts.

On its website, the FBI recommends people do not publicly advertise their phone number for this reason. “Protect your personal and financial information. Don't advertise your phone number, address, or financial assets, including ownership or investment of cryptocurrency, on social media sites,” the site reads.

In their write-up, brutecat said Google awarded them $5,000 and some swag for their findings. Initially, Google marked the vulnerability as having a low chance of exploitation. The company later upgraded that likelihood to medium, according to brutecat's write-up.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","I Joined Every Class Action Lawsuit I Could Find, and So Can You","https://www.wired.com/story/i-am-hunting-online-for-free-class-action-money-and-so-can-you/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

In early April of this year, after more than a decade of litigation and a $90-million settlement, Mark Zuckerberg sent me forty bucks on Venmo.

To be clear, it wasn't Zuck personally. That $40.67 was my cut of the payout from a class action lawsuit: the “Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation” case (not to be confused with the “Facebook, Inc. Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation,” payment pending). Since January, I've secured other payouts of $21.65, $20.04 (twice), $14.81 and $12.60 as a result of class action settlements, and there are almost certainly more to come.

If you spend enough time on the internet, odds are that you too have stumbled into the class action expanded universe. You're not alone: According to a recent defense attorney interest group report, there was $42 billion in class action settlements reached last year, “the third highest value we have tallied in the last two decades, trailing only the settlement numbers from 2023 ($51.4 billion) and 2022 ($66 billion).” Given the proliferation of corporate monopolies, legal cases brought against tech companies will naturally include more and more claimants and bigger and bigger settlements. Ads marketing these lawsuits are popping up on social media and, while most people ignore them, there are Facebook groups, lawyers, and hunters like myself, all dedicated to chasing down these payouts.

On top of that, a change in federal rules in 2018 laid the groundwork to make email the most common class-action notice delivery method—so it's entirely possible that right now, hiding in a spam folder, there's an unread message declaring that you're already part of one. Open the email, enter your class member code, maybe provide some receipts (unless it's a “no-proof” settlement), and pick your delivery method; they have Venmo, Zelle, prepaid cards, paper checks, direct deposit, etc. After a couple of years, boom! Instant money.

But while applying to get some of that money has never been more convenient, the vast majority of eligible claimants will never see a dime: A 2019 study by the Federal Trade Commission put the claims rate for class actions at an outrageously low 4 percent by weighted mean.

Take cases about data breaches or privacy violations. There were more than 250 million users in the class of those affected by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal—essentially, everyone in the US with a Facebook account. Out of the eligible class size of 250 million, only 17 million valid claims were filed. There's the spate of recent “social media addiction” cases looking for more class members by (ironically enough) advertising on Instagram, plus the semi-recent class action that chastised the once-mighty Juul for targeting teens, and the very, very recent Lopez v. Apple Inc. settlement, which could give folks $20 per Siri-enabled device if you sign up by July 2.

Many people ignore these messages—assuming they're a scam, or thinking the payout isn't worth the hassle. But other people, like April Phelps, are filing claims with gusto.

“I check daily,” says Phelps, a Memphis-based health care worker who estimates she's received almost $8,000 since 2023 by keeping up with the various postcards, emails, and online advertisements that work to bring eligible claimants into a class action. “Out of a seven-day week, no more than about two and a half hours—probably 30 minutes or so a day—just to scroll through and see if there's been any updates or any new settlements that impact me. I'll check my junk mail too, just to make sure.”

I found Phelps on a 30,000-plus-member Facebook group set up by Top Class Actions, a news site that tracks and offers updates on various ongoing class actions. People in the TCA Settlements & Payouts group help confused first-timers navigate eligibility, answer questions about when settlement payments might come in and post updates about case results. These kinds of sites are what I recommend to people who ask, because since 2021, I've become “class action guy,” reminding family members to file claims, check their spam folders, and get that money.

Technically, I was party to my first class action all the way back in 2016, with litigation related to the Aliso Canyon gas leak, which WIRED reported as the “worst climate disaster in US history” at the time. That process was mainly via email and on the phone, and the payout took seven years to show up—but in the meantime, I kept searching for “settlement” in my email.

In 2021, that led me to Mansour v. Bumble Trading Inc., a settlement in California based on claims that Bumble was discriminating against male users by only letting women message first. I signed up, waited for my payout, and after that was Rivera et al. v. Google LLC (Google photos storing face data without consent), plus Sosa v. Onfido (biometric privacy violation), California v. Vitol (manipulated gas prices), even Milan v. Clif Bar & Co. (misleading labels on Clif Bars), and my beloved Facebook Internet Tracking Litigation.

It's not that I have a personal vendetta against these companies. I still eat the Clif Bars. But by gosh, the law says I'm owed some money, these companies probably did do something wrong (even if they don't admit it), and frankly, the payout feels a bit like winning in a legal system designed for people to lose. Why wouldn't I take it?

That's close to the story I was told by Phelps, as well. She says she's been on the lookout for class actions since 2021, when she found out she was party to litigation against Blue Cross Blue Shield via a notice hidden in her junk mail.

“More people need to start paying attention, because if you miss a deadline, in some cases, for a $10,000 cheque, you're going to be upset,” she says. “I wish I was getting $10,000, but some people are eligible to receive that, and they don't take it seriously because they don't do their research.”

Phelps says that the most helpful avenue for staying informed has been the smattering of groups on Facebook, where people answer questions, offer advice, and upload pictures of payouts: Venmo, Zelle, prepaid cards, and paper checks. Phelps says the group helped her evangelize a couple of friends and her mom into class action consciousness.

“It's not like these are poor defenseless companies, right? They committed an error,” she says. “If more people pay attention, honestly, I feel like these manufacturers or these businesses will stop being so quick to offer things to us without doing their research.”

Despite how helpful these groups have been for some people, they're still a poor substitute for an official government portal, says Amanda M. Rose, a professor of law at Vanderbilt University.

“There's been a lot of enthusiasm for technology solving these problems, although we see … that it hasn't necessarily borne itself out,” she says.

Rose adds that a federally run website and support system (ClassAction.gov, say) could help increase claim rates, cut down on confusion, and create a database for researchers looking to make policy suggestions on public oversight of class actions. Without that infrastructure, the void is filled by third-parties (like the absurdly named “ClaimClam,” called out by the DC attorney general last year), who can use AI to identify potential class members in lawsuits and settlements, get them to submit claims via their platform and then take a cut of their settlements. ClaimClam also charged consumers “15%, and in some cases 40%,” of their claim, while also misleading them to think that settlements were guaranteed, and hiding that the law firm they were recommending was also co-owned by the same founder, according to a settlement between the company and the office of the DC attorney general. Even the top aggregator sites, like ClassAction.org or the aforementioned TopClassActions.com, are private companies that can earn referral fees from law firms for offering info on the class actions.

The lack of a federal database also makes it difficult to track down claimants who have changed addresses, determine if the legalese has been effectively translated into plain English, or figure out if the notices are getting past the spam filter—and all of these problems are exacerbated by a glaring lack of data on record. Are the claims settlement administrators who are charged with finding eligible class members doing a thorough job? According to Rose, solving these issues has always been a problem, but no one in particular is keeping track.

“You can't even have an intelligent public policy debate about these matters without having better insight into them,” says Rose.

That argument touches on one of the core pillars in American jurisprudence supporting class actions—as a type of public service in the form of a deterrent.

“At least in our legal culture, we have decided that we should make it possible for people with small value claims to bring them all together,” says Deborah Hensler, professor of dispute resolution at Stanford Law School.

“Perhaps a large number of people have claims, but the claims are worth fairly small amounts of money. Maybe they lost $25 each? A corporation could make a lot of money by collecting lots and lots of $25,” she says. “But individually, going to court for $25? Forget it.” Thus, class actions.

According to Hensler, class actions in one form or another have been part of US law for centuries. A dispute in 1820 over the estate of a deceased general, West v. Randall, is widely considered the first, though Brown v. Board of Education, which ended legal segregation in 1954, is probably the most well-known example. She considers their prevalence to be a function of an American court system that has fewer barriers to entry than many others, including much lower court filing fees, the option for lawyers to advertise, and legal representation on contingency (which is widely regulated or outright disallowed in many other countries).

“When you have a system that is so law-oriented, and you have a lot of lawyers and you have a way for people to find lawyers, even if they don't have very much money, then you have a way for lawyers to make money by taking people's cases,” Hensler says. “Then when some issue arises—like Facebook privacy—there are some lawyers who say ‘That's interesting, maybe I could bring a class action.'”

Because the legal precedent is so complex, Hensler says there are many laws on the books allowing class actions to be brought for everything from the aforementioned privacy violations to the spate of recent class actions with wide political implications, like J.G.G. v. Trump, where a judge ordered deportation flights of Venezuelan men to be turned back, an order the Trump administration ignored.

“The current cases are on behalf of people who are claiming they have been improperly, illegally treated by the Trump Administration,” Hensler says. “They're trying to get the courts to say ‘Stop doing this,' not just for one person, but for all the people like them.”

Aside from their use in recent immigration cases, class actions as legal tools are actually in a bit of a hard place. The Class Action Fairness Act, signed into law by the Bush administration in 2005, made it easier for defendants to shift their cases to federal court from the state level, a move that ultimately made class actions harder to certify, slower to resolve, and more expensive to pursue.

Instead, plaintiffs' lawyers have shifted toward mass torts, mass-claim litigation, and multidistrict litigation—approaches that involve coordinating large numbers of individual claims, rather than trying to certify a single class. In the pre-internet era, coalescing that many claimants would be Sisyphean; in 2025, it's almost smooth sailing.

“The underlying issue is that modern society produces mass injuries, mass complaints, mass everything,” Hensler says. “We've done a pretty good job in this country of trying to come up with procedures for dealing with this ‘mass claim' phenomenon—a better job than virtually every other country in the world—but we haven't figured it out yet.”

Something that shouldn't be hard to figure out is that regardless of the particular legal avenue, the class or mass action notifications are just going to keep coming—so people like Phelps and I will keep scanning social media and checking our spam folders. Maybe in a couple more years, I'll get a notification about another forty bucks. And until then, I'll keep scrolling, filing, and quietly cashing in, because if corporations can profit off our data, habits, and mistakes, the least we can do is get paid back when they screw up.

It's not justice, exactly—just the version we're left with in a system where accountability is slow, flawed, and monetized. But until something better comes along, I'm not leaving free money on the table. You shouldn't either.

Air fryers are nice, but they take soooooooo long to cook wings. And where's my smart app? And why can't I bake a pizza?

I had precisely zero of these thoughts until last month. That's when the Dome 2 arrived at my doorstep—a king-sized, retro-futuristic air fryer from Silicon Valley kitchen startup Typhur that sorta looks like an alien spaceship as imagined by a little boy in the 1960s. But that shape is maybe fitting: In some ways, this Typhur can feel like the air fryer of the future.

At the very least, the Dome 2 is the rare air fryer that feels new. I've tested two dozen air fryers in the last six months alone, and the Dome is one of only a couple to offer any particular innovation since Philips rolled out the first air fryers 15 years ago.

I've got a few gripes with the Dome's control panel, granted. It's also a Hoover for counter space, and it costs as much as a cheap laptop. But thanks to an innovative two-burner design and some smart temperature control, the Typhur Dome 2 can cook crispy wings faster than any air fryer I've ever used. It will grill a mean cheese sandwich, char a fillet of meat, and tan the bottom of a frozen pizza. And its brushless motor makes it preternaturally quiet, often more hushed than the ambient noise of my house. And a self-clean feature means it's been mostly smoke- and smell-free for the time I've used it. Here's the rundown.

The first thing you'll notice about the Dome 2 is its shape. It's different, and not just because of the squared-off bulbousness of its exterior. (I still can't decide whether it looks more like a B-movie flying saucer or the head of a cartoon robot.)

The 5.6-quart air fryer basket is shallow, but broad enough to lay out a 12-inch pizza or two dozen party wings. This broad basket allows you to spread out food into a single layer across the bottom of the basket, offering even airflow. Which is to say, the Dome leans in hard to exactly what an air fryer does and is, with the main trade-off that it's now very difficult to air-fry a whole chicken. If you're a whole-chicken air-frying person, you'll have to spatchcock the heck out of it.

The temp is also accurate, a rare quality among air fryers. (Instant Pot and Philips also keep accurate temp.) The Dome 2 stays within 10 degrees of target temperature, as measured by a wireless ThermoPro TempSpike Pro ($106) I've found to be accurate for tracking ambient oven temps. The Dome 2's success should maybe be no surprise: Typhur's other main product is a line of wireless thermometers that rank among WIRED's favorites.

On the one hand, I could wish for a window to watch the cook without opening the basket. On the other, the Typhur is well-shielded. The fan noise is low enough I don't hear it if I'm standing by the fridge. Heat vents out the back, so the device's surface doesn't get overly hot. And smells are likewise shielded: This is now my preferred way to cook bacon, because the grease doesn't smell up the house for hours. The bacon fat, collected at the bottom of the basket, is reusable.

So far, so good. But what sets the Dome 2 apart from almost every other air fryer—including the previous generation Dome—is the added dual burner that allows the device to heat from both the top and the bottom of the frying basket. Only a few basket fryers have tried out this feature, including a Cosori Dual Blaze ($180) that had a hard time keeping accurate temp during my air fryer testing.

This adds up to two main qualities for the Dome 2: Food cooks fast. And food cooks evenly. Bacon crisps up like the air in Wisconsin. Even truly crappy crinkle fries will do the same. Wings air-fry to done after 14 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, about four minutes faster than other basket fryers. Add two more minutes to fry them “hard,” the way they do it in the wing belt extending from Ohio to the hot wing's birthplace in Buffalo.

But especially, the dual burners add versatility. Each of the device's settings now has multiple variables to play with. You can toggle the speed of the convection fan. But you can also change the distribution of power to the top or the bottom burner.

Typhur lets you control this the way sophisticated toaster ovens like Breville's do: through settings like “grill” or “broil” that modulate both fan speed and primary heat source. The grill setting combines the crispness of an air fryer with direct heat from the bottom of the basket—meaning I can brown and even lightly grill-char a pair of chicken legs at 450 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to deliciously crispy-fatty skin. This is also how the oven does pizza and pancakes, heating each from below but at a much lower fan setting to avoid drying out the crust or batter.

This said, Typhur doesn't make its settings overly easy to parse, except via a recent blog post that still requires a little parsing. I'd love if the device or app offered indicators to show which burners were most active, and the speed of the fan, for each setting. But for now, below is a handy chart explaining the various cooking modes.

In general, the higher the fan speed, expect more browning or crisping on the surface as the air draws across the surface and steals the moisture—which is the main reason air fryers are so effective at creating crispy food. That said, too much fan can dry out the food over time.

Fan Speed and Heat Source for Each Cooking Mode on Typhur Dome 2

But you won't get full use out of the Dome 2 unless you pair it to your phone. Many functions aren't accessible from the eight-button control panel on the device itself. The app's most straightforward bonus is a 48-deep menu of recipes designed specifically for the Dome 2. These range from simple recommendations for bacon, chicken legs, or asparagus to air fryer cakes and cookies, and chicken cordon bleu.

Once you choose a recipe, you can tweak both temperature and time, based on how much food you've added or how thick you've sliced your bacon. Then click start, and the device's setting will pair up with the recipe on the app. You'll still have to physically press start on the device, as a safety measure.

But many useful functions are app-only, including dehydrate, bake, and roast—plus an added Steak preset. No baking or steaking if the Wi-Fi's down! (The Wings and Bacon presets, oddly, are the buttons on the device that are most similar to the baking function.)

The self-clean function, which heats the oven at high temps to burn gunk off the heating elements, is also app-only. The basket and griddle grate are coated with PFAS- and PTFE-free ceramic nonstick, and it's pretty easy to wipe clean—but the self-clean, meant for monthly use, is a good backup for the oven interior.

Price aside —this Typhur isn't cheap—reliance on the app is one of the main sticking points on an otherwise terrific device. (Though I'd also like more visibility on fan speed and primary burners.) I've accepted, for whatever reason, that my Google TV is a brick without a remote or a phone app. But I guess I still want to be able to bake cookies when my phone's dead. Maybe I need to learn to stop worrying and love the smart kitchen.

As Apple prepares to unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 on Monday, several rumors have surfaced, including a potential new name for the operating system, a dedicated gaming app, and a virtual health coach. This could be a big update, with a dramatic redesign inspired by the Vision Pro — and more.  

Here's a roundup of the most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. And be sure to check out our live coverage of the keynote right here. 

Sources told Bloomberg that Apple plans to rename its operating systems to reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26.

Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that's reportedly inspired by Apple's Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg — the company reportedly refers to the new interface as Liquid Glass. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple's entire ecosystem (including CarPlay) with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience.

Additionally, there are three apps expected to undergo the most changes — the Phone app, Camera, and Safari. For instance, the Phone app is rumored to introduce a new option that allows users to merge their favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemails into a single view. Meanwhile, both the Camera app and Safari are anticipated to have more visual updates, such as a transparent address bar for Apple's browser app.

Apple is also rumored to be releasing a gaming app that will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store's game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the company acquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends.

Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as a personal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake.

Apple could improve iPhone battery health with AI-powered battery management. This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it's fully charged.

Another rumor suggests that reverse wireless charging is being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone.

According to 9to5Mac, the Messages app is set to get an Apple Intelligence-powered translation feature that can automatically translate messages as soon as they hit users' inboxes. 9to5Mac also reports that Apple Intelligence could power a polling feature that lets people in group chats vote and offers AI-generated poll suggestions. 

Additionally, Messages may also add the ability to set a background image, following in the footsteps of WhatsApp and Instagram.

Apple may bring its Preview app from macOS to iPad and iPhone users, allowing them to annotate and edit PDFs. This will reportedly be a preinstalled app, per Bloomberg.

As Bloomberg reports, Genmoji could gain a small yet exciting feature that allows users to combine existing standard emojis, such as a basketball going into a trash can. 

One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressive Siri capabilities highlighted in Apple's 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The company stated in March that the new features are delayed. 

While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. 

This story was originally published June 3 and will be updated as more rumors come out.

A security researcher has discovered a bug that could be exploited to reveal the private recovery phone number of almost any Google account without alerting its owner, potentially exposing users to privacy and security risks. 

Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it fixed the bug after the researcher alerted the company in April. 

The independent researcher, who goes by the handle brutecat and blogged their findings, told TechCrunch that they could obtain the recovery phone number of a Google account by exploiting a bug in the company's account recovery feature.

The exploit relied on an “attack chain” of several individual processes working in tandem, including leaking the full display name of a targeted account, and bypassing an anti-bot protection mechanism that Google implemented to prevent the malicious spamming of password reset requests. Bypassing the rate limit ultimately allowed the researcher to cycle through every possible permutation of a Google account's phone number in a short space of time and arrive at the correct digits.

By automating the attack chain with a script, the researcher said it was possible to brute-force a Google account owner's recovery phone number in 20 minutes or less, depending on the length of the phone number.

To test this, TechCrunch set up a new Google account with a phone number that had never been used before, then provided brutecat with the email address of our new Google account. 

A short time later, brutecat messaged back with the phone number that we had set.

“bingo :),” said the researcher.

Revealing the private recovery phone number can expose even anonymous Google accounts to targeted attacks, such as takeover attempts. Identifying a private phone number associated with someone's Google account could make it easier for skilled hackers to take control of that phone number through a SIM swap attack, for example. With control of that phone number, the attacker can reset the password of any account associated with that phone number by generating password reset codes sent to that phone.

Given the potential risk to the wider public, TechCrunch agreed to hold this story until the bug could be fixed. 

“This issue has been fixed. We've always stressed the importance of working with the security research community through our vulnerability rewards program and we want to thank the researcher for flagging this issue,” Google spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch. “Researcher submissions like this are one of the many ways we're able to quickly find and fix issues for the safety of our users.”

Samra said that the company has seen “no confirmed, direct links to exploits at this time.”

Brutecat said Google paid $5,000 in a bug bounty reward for their finding.

PayPal is partnering with hotel payment provider Selfbook to let users search for and book hotels within the PayPal app.

The company said that it will let users pay through PayPal at checkout and offer exclusive discounts to users within the app. Users can also use PayPal Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) for select hotels that have enabled the feature.

People using the PayPal app will be able to go to the Offers section and search for hotels with filters like travel dates and number of guests using an in-app browser.

Users will see hotels that use Selfbook's payment suite on these apps, but it is not clear if Selfbook is making its entire catalog available to PayPal users.

For PayPal, this is a move to upsell another offering to users within the app. The company said that with its payment products, it has observed an 84% uptick among people who pay online for travel. 

“We're excited to go big in travel with Selfbook and help PayPal customers discover new merchants and save money through unique rewards and discounts,” Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal said in a statement.

PayPal also said that Selfbook will soon integrate the payment checkout products within its workflow outside the app. What's more, Selfbook will use PayPal's enterprise payment suite to power credit card payments for its hotels.

Selfbook is also using PayPal as a payments partner within Perplexity, which unveiled a feature that lets users discover and book hotels within the chat in March.

“Paying for a hotel has traditionally been the most fragmented part of travel—search one place, book another, pay somewhere else,” Khalid Meniri, Selfbook's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch over email. “With PayPal, we're collapsing all of that into a single flow embedded directly into AI-powered experiences like Perplexity. It's not just more convenient for travelers, it gives hotels a direct line to their guests, better margins through no commission, and more control over their brand,” Meniri said.

Posted:

Qualcomm has agreed to acquire Alphawave Semi, a U.K.-based semiconductor company focused on high-speed data center connectivity, for around $2.4 billion.

According to Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, the deal will help Qualcomm grow its data center business. 

“The combined teams share the goal of building advanced technology solutions and enabling next-level connected computing performance across a wide array of high-growth areas, including data center infrastructure,” Amon said in a press release.

Qualcomm's acquisition of Alphawave, which makes a range of wired connectivity and compute technologies, comes a few months after the bigger chip company bought the generative AI division of Vietnamese startup VinAI, as well as internet of things company Edge Impulse. Qualcomm has sought to diversify its portfolio as it faces headwinds, including a weakening smartphone market — smartphone processors make up a big portion of Qualcomm's revenue — and potentially tariffs.

The deal is expected to close during the first calendar quarter of 2026.

Claude's blog is no more. 

A week after TechCrunch profiled Anthropic's experiment to task the company's Claude AI models with writing blog posts, Anthropic wound down the blog and redirected the address to its homepage. Sometime over the weekend, the Claude Explains blog disappeared — along with its initial few posts.

A source familiar tells TechCrunch the blog was a “pilot” meant to help Anthropic's team combine customer requests for explainer-type “tips and tricks” content with marketing goals. 

Claude Explains, which had a dedicated page on Anthropic's website and was edited for accuracy by humans, was populated by posts on technical topics related to various Claude use cases (e.g. “Simplify complex codebases with Claude”).  The blog, which was intended to be a showcase of sorts for Claude's writing abilities, wasn't clear about how much of Claude's raw writing was making its way into each post. 

An Anthropic spokesperson previously told TechCrunch that the blog was overseen by “subject matter experts and editorial teams” who “enhance[d]” Claude's drafts with “insights, practical examples, and […] contextual knowledge.” The spokesperson also said Claude Explains would expand to topics ranging from creative writing to data analysis to business strategy.

Apparently, those plans changed in pretty short order.

“[Claude Explains is a] demonstration of how human expertise and AI capabilities can work together,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch earlier this month. “[The blog] is an early example of how teams can use AI to augment their work and provide greater value to their users. Rather than replacing human expertise, we're showing how AI can amplify what subject matter experts can accomplish.”

Claude Explains didn't get the rosiest reception on social media, in part due to the lack of transparency about which copy was AI-generated. Some users pointed out it looked a lot like an attempt to automate content marketing, an ad tactic that relies on generating content on popular topics to serve as a funnel for potential customers.

More than 24 websites were linking to Claude Explains posts before Anthropic wound down the pilot, according to search engine optimization tool Ahrefs. That's not bad for a blog that was only live for around a month.

Anthropic might've also grown wary of implying Claude performs better at writing tasks than is actually the case. Even the best AI today is prone to confidently making things up, which has led to embarrassing gaffes on the part of publishers that have publicly embraced the tech. For example, Bloomberg has had to correct dozens of AI-generated summaries of its articles, and G/O Media's error-riddled AI-written features — published against editors' wishes — attracted widespread ridicule.

HN has had many discussions about this, including The time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44180533 - (927 comments) a few days ago.

Normally, when you have expenses, you deduct them off your revenue to find your taxable profit. If you have $1 million in sales, and $900k in costs, you have $100k in profit, and the government taxes you on that profit.Section 174 says you can't do this for software engineers. If you pay a software engineer, that's not ""really"" an ""expense"", regardless of the fact that you paid them.What you've actually done, Congress said, is bought a capital good, like a machine. And for calculating tax owed, you have to depreciate that over several years (5 in this case).Depreciating means that if you pay an engineer $200k in a year, in tax-world you only had $40k of real expense that year, even though you paid them $200k.So the effect is that it makes engineers much more expensive, because normally when a company hires an engineer, like they spend on any other expense, they can at least think ""well, they will reduce our profit, which reduces our tax obligation,"" but in this case software engineers are special and aren't deductible in the same way.In the case of the $200k engineer, you deduct the first $40k in the first year, then you can expense another $40k from that first year in the second year, the third $40k in the third year, and so on through the fifth year. So eventually you get to expense the entire first year of the engineer's pay, but only after five years.The effect is that companies wind up using their scarce capital to loan the federal government money for five years, and so engineers become a heavy financial burden. If a company hires too many engineers, they will owe the federal government income tax even in years in which they were unprofitable.These rules, by the way, don't apply to other personnel costs. If you hire an HR person or a corporate executive, you expense them in the year you paid them. It's a special rule for software engineers.It was passed by Congress during the first Trump administration in order to offset the costs of other corporate tax rate cuts, due to budgeting rules.

- A business is usually taxed on its profits: you deduct your revenue from the cost of producing that revenue, and the delta is what you are taxed on.- In software businesses, this usually means if you spend $1M in software development to develop a web app, and it makes $1.1M in that year, you'd get taxed on the $100K profits.- However, a few years ago, the IRS stopped allowing the $1M to be deducted in the year it was incurred. Instead, the $1M was to be amortized over 5 years, so now the business can only count $200K as the deductible expense for that year. So now it's going to be taxed on ""profits"" of $900K. Assuming the tax rate is 50%, that means the business owes $450K in taxes, even though it has a total of $100K in the bank after the actual expenses were paid. So it would have to either borrow to pay taxes or raise venture capital, meaning that VC-funded companies would be advantaged over bootstrapped ones!- The letter's goal is to bring things back to how they were (and how they are for all other businesses): let businesses deduct their actual expenses from their actual revenue, and tax that actual profit.I am neither a lawyer nor an accountant, this is just my understanding of this issue.

Some big tech companies affected have laid off teams around the world, perhaps in order to mitigate the numbers looking bad to investors; so in a way, this adversely affected tech employees globally.Every country should have such a rule for software businesses, which is an industry where all the cost has to be upfronted, so that bootstrapping is facilitated. There are plenty of smaller markets where the VC model is not
the most appropriate funding instrument.

And it's transferable -- if your company fails, there are companies out there that will buy the rump of your company to realize the unrealized tax refunds.Which is why it's usually fairly straightforward to get a factor loan to pay those $450K in taxes -- it's backed by an asset.Factor loans are usually expensive with a high interest rate.   Because you can get a factor loan, the taxes are not going to immediately bankrupt the company in the short term, but the high interest rates are going to hurt in the long term.Not a lawyer nor an accountant.

The traditional capital asset treatment applied to software leaves a lot to be desired. Some software is a capital asset, but much just isn't. Or at least should be considered to depreciate rapidly.


reply




reply



The IRS is using a theory of value where software (1) is a capital asset (okay, sure), (2) has a six-year deprecation schedule (uhhh why not 5 like everything else?), and (3) is valued at the exact cost of all inputs to it, including salaries (uh oh).This is unlike how capital assets are valued for any other industry! And it has the effect that hiring a second lawyer is “cheaper” (for five years anyway) than hiring a second developer.

Is your dismay that it's unfair compared to other industries or that the policy doesn't reflect reality that software is a capital asset that has a lifetime longer than 6 years for many companies?


reply



Using salaries as a proxy for value of the asset encourages only the safest shovelware bets, discouraging risk taking lest your asset be taxed at substantially higher than it's worth.Avoiding that risk-adverse dynamic is why Section 174 was written the way it was since the 50s to encourage R&D, and it's paid off in spades.

Well, that framing is just wrong. The companies are paying taxes over what those employees created, not over the employees. Does the company own the software?> The IRS is using a theory of value where...Notice that all of your 3 points are exactly like any other kind of capital.Most countries exclude salaries from the income calculation because it has good practical consequences (both on making accounting cheaper and on incentivizing companies to hire), not because of any theoretical problem.

The same is true for all true R&D, which is why historically the government has tried to provide protections for R&D work to incentivize people to not just churn out the safe bet over and over again. Patents fall into this category, but software patents are (rightly) hard to come by. Through 2022, the risk of software development was offset by the ability to expense the costs and avoid a tax bill, and this was good policy if your aim is to encourage innovation.The capital asset theory could still work if there were some way to appraise the value of the actual asset you created. But absent such a way, this thinking is deeply flawed for all but the most shovelware of jobs.

If you start the year with 0$ in your bank. After the end of the year you have made $200k in revenue. However you ""spent"" $200k on software salaries. However, because these are software costs, they must be depreciated over 5 years, so only 20% of that $200k software cost can be applied as depreciation cost which is considered an expense. So your net income for this year is $200k revenue - $20k depreciation expense = $180k. Your 15% tax on this is $27k.So you made $200k and spent all of it on software, so your bank account is 0, but you owe $27k in taxes.

That being said, I do think there's a little sloppiness/dishonesty in what is categorized as ""R&D"" in the software development. Is code maintenance R&D? Bug fixes? Performance improvements? Is it a ""capital asset"" no longer under R&D once it hits production? This aspect has always seemed too gray given how much money is at stake in taxes.But again, this complexity is an advantage for larger more established firms with legal departments and the infrastructure in place to document everything in order to handle audits. Which, in my view, is a form of regulatory capture.One potential argument I can see is that maybe this balances out since presumably the more established firms would have less ""R&D"" as a fraction of expenses to deduct in the first place?

They're literally aren't any. Treating payroll expenses as depreciating assets is insane, and that's why it isn't done in any other context. That sounds like a biased explanation, but it's genuinely the truth: it was stuck in the Trump's tax bill to help it evade budget balancing rules, but was designed to be so awful that a future Congress would “surely” repeal it, after the TCJA had passed successfully. This sort of horse-trading happens all the time with budgets, but for whatever reason, this provision was never repealed.

The Section 174 changes altered the accounting method that software development companies must use for calculating their profit for tax purposes. Starting in 2022 software dev must be treated not as an expense but as an investment in an asset, such that you're now required to amortize the expense over 5 years instead of deducting it from your revenue the year you spent the money.The gigantic problem with this change is that without the ability to expense software development expenses as expenses, a new software startup can very easily be considered profitable in their first year because only 10% of their software development-related expenses get to be counted as expenses.And note that, contrary to what you say, most white-collar work is not treated this way, and software is further singled out from other R&D-type work in that it is the only type of work that is explicitly called out in the section as being required to be marked as R&D. So we're not asking for software to be treated specially, we're asking why it suddenly changed in 2022 to be treated specially in an extremely negative way.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204565

Some examples of white collar work that builds long-lived assets but where the work isn't required to be amortized over long periods of time:- marketing collateral development, unless it is done by engineers- development of standard legal documents like contracts- development of HR policy- development of financial processes & associated reporting, unless done by engineers- art development (e.g. for packaging and other collateral)- building customer lists, unless it is done through software by engineers- developing service offerings (e.g. Costco membership)Software is not fundamentally different than any of these other white-collar assets that are used to build companies, except that it typically requires more ongoing maintenance.

That's how it should be, and that's also how it actually was until relatively recently. A new law went into effect that treats software differently. I believe Congress was looking for an easy way to generate extra tax revenue by tapping into the wealth of rich tech giants. Whatever the intent, the workers ended up being the ones who suffer because now hiring people has worse tax consequences than it used to.So all that people want is to undo that, to take away that special rule that applies only to software, and put it back like it was.

When you pay people to get work done for a business, that paid work is an expense.You can deduct expenses from your income to calculate your profits.IIRC the problem is that software development is not being classified as an operating expense, now, but rather a ""research"" capital expense, and the deductions then have to be amortized over a number of years.

This is untrue. The rule is not about taxation, but deductions/expenses. If your expenses cover most revenue, you owe little in taxes. With this rule, a particular type of expense (software engineering salaries) is no longer deductible from revenue to calculate taxable income over which taxes are owed. So you might previously owe no taxes, but now you do. The deduction might carry over to the next few years and eventually (after 6 years) you will reach the same point - assuming your salaries don't go up and your business doesn't grow. The remainder in deductions will be returned after the business stops employing software engineers. I'm not sure why anyone would want the tax code to incentivize a business outcome that all of us would consider failure.

The UK eventually put out guidance that business as usual development isn't really ""research and development"", but afaik there hasn't been a serious crackdown on the practice.It seems kind of absurd to pretend that most work that developers do is pioneering the profession.R&D tax breaks make sense, both to encourage genuine research but also to prevent brain-drain.Not taxing (or tax credits / refunds ) for line-of-business software isn't really excusable.It's bad that the law in the US has been changed in a cliff-edge way though.

That said, here's my perspective on 174 (which should be reverted to full deduction on the year the expense is incurred).You do not have to amortize 100% of your engineering costs. Not even close.Here's the key:  Development costs incurred to remove uncertainty are amortized.  
  All other costs are deductible during the tax year where they are incurred.

How does this work?You are going to design a new robot arm.In January, you spend $100K to ""remove uncertainty"". In rough strokes, this means discovering all the things you don't know and need to know for this robot arm to become a product. This amount will be amortized over five years under 174.Now, with uncertainty removed, you spend an additional $1.1MM from January until December for engineering implementation. No uncertainty being removed. Just building a product. This is 100% deductible that tax year.Analogy: You want to build a new brick wall with specific properties. You spend $100K to develop a new type of brick and $1.1MM to build the wall using that brick. The $100K is amortized, the $1.1MM is deductible in one shot.BTW, at year 6 the amortization schedule reaches steady-state and you are amortizing the full $100K every year. In other words, the impact of 174, if treated intelligently, is the time value of money until steady state is reached for the engineering costs incurred to remove uncertainty.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.174-2

My understanding is that previously, software dev salaries would be counted as a business expense in the year they are paid. Now they are amortized over X years on the tax paperwork. As a result, a lot of software companies suddenly show relatively high income, and have a large increase in their tax burden. This is especially hard for startups that were “on the edge” of making it. If the salaries go back to being an expense in the year the salary is paid, the tax burden will decrease again, because apparent company income will be less.

I'd say most of foreign devs in the US are actually L-1 that is actually worse because L-1 prohibits the dev from changing jobs unless the dev gets a new visa.


reply



H1B rules around changing jobs means that even if the employee joins at a market-level salary when they come to the US, they tent to stay at the same company much longer and can be exploited. The new company has to go through a lengthy paperwork process to allow the visa holder to switch jobs. Also, since the tech world tends to use things like stock options / RSUs / monetary bonuses for large parts of compensation package and those do not count towards ""salary"" you may have a situation where an h1b holder on paper seems to be paid fairly but in practice get only about 40-50% of what their peers get.If they were allowed to change jobs freely they would be able to negotiate their compensation fairly. The companies would be less intensified to hire H1Bs to save money and would also consider local talent for same positions. Everybody would win: both H1B visa holders and their families and American workers, too. The only losers would be consulting firms (not a huge loss, to be honest, most of their employees are overseas anyway, so the can absorb the cost) and BigTech (they have enough money, anyway).There are other problems for H1B holders, like getting a green card is something their employer, and not them, can do - another area for abuse. And then some nationalities have to wait much longer to go through this process then others (essentially, the US migration service says that the country has too many people from India and Pakistan already, thank you very much), and there are other issues I don't recall.

So, that said: H-1B shouldn't exist for software. The point of it is to fill jobs that cannot be filled by an American for some reason; a condition that doesn't exist in software development. Hire immigrants as software engineers, fine. But find a way to do it that isn't bullshit.

But make no mistake, they're still animals and are not predictable. I would never bring a dog with me outside to do anything other than go for a walk, always on a leash. They really dont belong in public spaces. I've seen and heard too many stories of dogs suddenly not being the perfect precious animal their owner claims and it bites or attacks another animal or person. Then when they do the owners insist the victim must have done something wrong and take zero responsibility.


reply



This seems a bit extreme. I think dog owners have a responsibility to make sure their animal is trained and able to be controlled near people, but outdoor public spaces (parks/plazas, cafes with outdoor seating whose management is dog friendly), seem fine.However, the responsibility for your dog's behavior extends even outside of public space. I was bitten by a dog in the lobby of a friend's building. The dog was leashed and presumably just returning from a walk. Later, I heard that some inspections in that building had to be rescheduled because a dog bit one of the inspectors while inside one of the condos (not sure if it was the same dog). Being in a non-public space in no way reduces the owner's responsibility.

No, they treat them as better than people.Because in their value system, animals are moral objects but not moral subjects. By that, I mean that actions done to animals can have moral weight. If you take a sick kitten and nurse it back to health, you are a good person. If you kick a puppy, you are a bad person.But the animal itself (according to this culture) carries no moral responsibility. If a dog bites someone, it's not an evil dog. It's not the dog's fault. It was just raised poorly, or traumatized as a puppy, or the owner should have kept it leashed better, etc.Thus animals are always morally pure, but people can be bad people. I kind of get where the value system is coming from: animals really are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to power and agency, so it does make sense to think of them as mostly receivers of moral actions. But some people take that really far.

It was just raised poorly, or traumatized as a puppy, or the owner should have kept it leashed better, etc.Thus animals are always morally pure, but people can be bad people. I kind of get where the value system is coming from: animals really are on the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to power and agency, so it does make sense to think of them as mostly receivers of moral actions. But some people take that really far.

We absolutely don't deserve them.With no cognitive dissonance, I can also recognize that some dogs can be dangerous, and in extreme cases, need to be put down.  However, I would point out that the vast majority of misbehaved dogs can and should be trained out of their bad behavior, so it's nearly always their owners' responsibilities.

As a lifelong rescuer of pit bulls and other ""problem"" dogs, I can see how that role I've picked for myself aligns and contrasts with how others view human-dog relationships.

Don't think scare quotes are appropriate here. Pits are problem dogs; they are the violent schizophrenics of the dog world. Hope you reconsider your stance every time some child gets his face gnawed off  by one of these land sharks.

To be honest I think that's what attracts many inappropriate owners to them.Two pit stories:I saw a fat guy walking a relatively small pit and took my dogs off to the side, about 20 feet away to let them pass.  The pit pulled out of his (inappropriately fastened) muzzle backwards (they are smart dogs) and took a dead no-bark run at my terrier.  I had my 35 lb terrier in the air and kicked that dog as hard as I could in the side to get the situation under control.Our neighbor had a BIG pit named Thor (big guy, he could control the dog, but kept him leashed out front.). Thor got off leash once and came over and messed w/our goats.  We had one goat (the smallest) who we kept horns on and Thor found out the hard way that that goat wasn't going down w/o a fight.  Thor survived but didn't mess w/the goats any more after that.Again, I like most of the pits I've met, but I see a lot of irresponsible owners.

The chances of someone surrendering their dog to which they are bonded after reading a comment is unlikely. The chances of someone with the opposite opinion adopting a pitbull are similar.

I don't think so.

We don't have enough data to be conclusive one way or the other, but if you look at the occurrence of strays and breed ownership by socioeconomic status, pit bull breeds are also very high on these lists.This tracks with human data to some extent: people from lower socioeconomic groups are more often perpetrators and victims of violence.Looking at breed specific violence and coming to a conclusion about temperament is very similar to looking at race specific graduation rates and coming to a conclusion about intelligence.

Why not? There are breeds that are taller or shorter, high-energy or low-energy, great hunters or awful hunters, and so on. And it's not a mystery why some breeds got this way: they were specifically bred for it.

there are dozens of breeds in each of these categories — we don't have a single breed of dog that's 5x faster than all the others

we have a good relationship with the children we raised, along with their children. Our dog, however, is always with us and it just feels good to watch after her. We don't consider her a child, just a very good, non-verbal friend.

There is certainly an imbalance between dog and human authority/autonomy/agency, but that is not the only dynamic in the relationship. And it's not necessarily the defining dynamic, nor is it consistently applicable.

The parent-child relationship is asymmetric in ways that are often not as visible to the child as they are a parent. There's a reason why for generations, parents have been responding to their childrens' arguments with ""when you're a parent, you'll understand"".

As in many things, most people are willing to ignore any aspect that is not what's in their face, and appealing to them.There are many other aspects to the thoughtless use of other animals to assuage a human's mental illness.One of the main ones is projection: the animal can't speak, or otherwise precisely express themselves. Into this silence, the human is able to inject whatever narrative they desire. This leads to people claiming that the animal is much more responsive to their needs, and provides greater solace than another human. This solace is purely in the mind of the beholder. No one knows what the dog is thinking, therefore it's thinking exactly what we want it to think.Another aspect of the entire pet issue, that I haven't seen otherwise mentioned in the comments, is the disruption to the public peace caused by many dogs. I have seen a couple of comments about dog shit, which is a major problem, but noise is also a significant issue.Both of these are primarily the fault of negligent owners, which are the overwhelming majority of modern US pet owners.

I thought that was ridiculous because these are just animals. It sucks when they die but it's not the end of the world.Another car nearby killed a little child and her father and that one was much more horrific to me.But now it makes sense: to these people the two incidents were equivalent. I suppose that is normal, what with all the stories of animals caring for the young of other animals. Neotenic characteristics seem to have cross-species impact.Very cool. Thank you for sharing this.

Dogs took advantage of this situation and they evolved to hijack our paternal and maternal instincts. Now there is selection pressure. But note dogs reproduce much much faster than humans so this will be an evolutionary arms race where dogs get cuter and humans become less interested in dogs. The first round comes when the people who have dogs instead of kids fail to reproduce. Also Expect an increase in dog allergies over time.

This never gets reconciled with the reality of factory farms and mass meat production. It's certainly a type of cognitive dissonance. In a hundred years we might look back on the now with horror (more generalized anyway).


reply



People who grow up even on small, non-factory farms see these animals as products for sale or economic assets, not companions. And even the dogs and cats are likely to be utilized for work as much as companionship.

You don't have to go a hundred years - most non-western societies look at western fascination with dogs and pets with horror, especially when couples with low rates of marriage, population collapse etc.

I believe there are a few things leading many people to choose pets instead of children to fulfill their desire to nurture:1. The trauma theory of psychology.Pop psychology today seems to assume that babies are born perfectly mentally healthy, except for any genetic mental illnesses they inherited from their parents. Then at some point, if they're unlucky, they experience some sort of trauma, often at the hands of their parents. That trauma inflicts a mental illness on them. They can treat it with therapy and/or meds, but the assumption is that the illness is irrevocable. (Don't believe me? The next time you're talking to a friend and they bring up therapy or mental health medication, ask them when they think they'll be cured and can stop.)The implication here is that as a parent, you've got basically nowhere to go but down with regards to your kid's mental health. If you are yourself perfectly mentally healthy and pass on no predispositions to your kid, and you parent them flawlessly 24/7 for eighteen years and dodge every possible trauma, then congrats you didn't fuck them up. Anything less than that and you're a bad parent. Which leads to...2. Impossible parenting standards.Media is constantly filled with all of the various ways a parent can do a bad job. Start the car moving down the driveway before they have their seatbelt on? Bad parent. Let them walk to the park on their own and risk being abducted? Bad parent. Give them access to junk food? Bad parent. Don't put them in enough extracurricular activities to pad their college application letter a decade from now? Bad parent. Too many extracurricular activities so they don't have enough free time in which to learn initiative? Bad parent.It is unending and demoralizing the ways in which parents are made to constantly feel they are inadequate. When I was a kid, if another kid fell playing and broke their arm, it was just ""OK, kids get hurt."" Today, it's ""Why did you let them do that?"" Parents have never spent more time with their children than they do today, but our culture still tells us it's not enough. Or, if it does, they tell us it's too much.Mix that with the previous point, and having a kid with any mental health challenges is not just a tragedy but your fault as a parent.3. Long-term pessimism.I know many people who truly do believe the world is fucked because of climate change and politics. Not only do they not believe any potential children of theirs would be raised in a world worse than they one they grew up in, they don't even have faith that world will be functionally habitable at all.Best case, they believe their children may thrive only because they happen to be born into privilege while other children in poorer locations will suffer catastrophically from climate change. So the best outcome they can imagine is a profound failing of moral justice.Meanwhile, consider pets:1. Rescued from trauma.Most pet owners get their pets from shelters. The animal may actually have had trauma before being adopted, but the owner wasn't morally responsible. Instead, they are the rescuer that saved the animal from further trauma. If the animal bounces back and has great behavior, then it's a testament to the amazing resilence of animals and the benefits of compassionate ownership. If the animal always has behavioral issues, well it's not their fault they were traumatized and what a good owner they have to take care of them in spite of those challenges.2. High but meetable standardsStandards for pet ownership are certainly high here too. Long gone are the days of putting the dog in a doghouse in the backyard and giving them a scoop out of the giant cheap bag of Alpo every day. Pets are expected to be fed healthy food, kept inside and safe, given good vet care, and lots of interaction and enrichment.Those standards are high but attainable. You can just do those things and feel like a good pet owner. And the pet will certainly make you feel like a good pet owner. Their expectations are low and it's easy to exceed them.3. Shorter life spanIf you believe the world is doomed, then a living being that will never outlive you and have to figure out how to make its without your support is a blessing. You don't have to feel guilty about the fact that in a thousand tiny ways, you contributed to climate change that will end up harming a loved one decades from now.

It is unending and demoralizing the ways in which parents are made to constantly feel they are inadequate. When I was a kid, if another kid fell playing and broke their arm, it was just ""OK, kids get hurt."" Today, it's ""Why did you let them do that?"" Parents have never spent more time with their children than they do today, but our culture still tells us it's not enough. Or, if it does, they tell us it's too much.Mix that with the previous point, and having a kid with any mental health challenges is not just a tragedy but your fault as a parent.3.

Declining birth rates are clearly a response to the deterioating economic conditions of most people. Stagnant real wages, skyrocketing costs, ever-more inaccessible housing and so on. Housing debt, student debt, medical debt. The cost of childcare can reach $3000/month per child. If you want your child to have the best opportunities, it may well cost $1 million or more between all those costs to raise a child. At a time when people can barely provide for themselves.Of course pets are surrogate children for some people. And even that's being ruined by capitalism as private equity moves into the vet space to squeeze every last dollar from people.Another aspect to this is social control. One reason Western societies have been relatively stable is the method of control is treats, basically. Social media, pets, smartphones, etc all mollify the masses. In more totalitarian societies, the threat of violence is a more typical method of control. Think of something like the Stasi in East Germany.The profit motive is destroying the treats. If you're on the verge of homelessness and can barely feed yourself, skyrocketing costs of pet ownership are a real issue. We're rapidly approaching a point where people think they'll never be able to retire and really have nothing to live for.Rather than the ultra-wealthy being slightly less wealthy so the rest of society, which is necessary for their wealth to exist, can have something good in their lives, we're instead becoming increasingly oppressive. Over-policing, militarizing police, crushing protests (as per this last weekend in LA), etc.Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better. And to think, all a lot of people need to be happy is a roof over their head, not having to have 3 jobs and being able to have a dog.

They drain resources and get free care while offering no benefit other than satisfying maternal urges which were designed to work on human babies. Puppies are 100 percent part of the reason for the westernized world's population problem.

The economy IS a factor.But sinking resources into a dog that offers no evolutionary or biological benefit IS ALSO a factor.There is no other way to look at this. You are committing an act of irrationality if you refuse to see dogs from a biological perspective.Porn sits in the same area. Hijacking biological instincts to prevent reproduction.We are looking at multiple causal sources that prevent us from having more children. In the same way men use porn to assuage our sexual urges, many women use dogs to help assuage their maternal instincts.

Third places and opportunities to meet people are greatly reduced because everything's taken over by venture capital chains and so expensive, and even if you meet someone the odds of the two of you making enough money to afford to raise a child is low.If you have that money, you're probably educated enough to see that life for your child will be significantly worse than life for you right now - the rise of authoritarianism, climate change, the active ongoing destruction of American economic power and soft political power, the concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands, disinformation causing massive chunks of the country to oppose science, education, and other things, discrimination based on gender and race....we're in for some very hard times and it takes a certain mindset to decide that you want to subject a child you love to all of it.It's not the dogs.

I'm very disappointed to see such wide adoption of pets, especially dogs, as “replacements” of children in adult lives. I do not think it's healthy for adults to do this because it infantilizes the adult. It is actually very sad, almost pitiful to see it happen. I think pets are wonderful for children because it helps them to develop a connection with living beings that aren't humans, to see emotions are a universal trait.More frequently I see now grown people wheeling their dogs in baby carriages. If this is some cosmic-scale humor by nature because we have overpopulated the planet and it's intentionally sabotaging the environment, then I'm afraid the joke is on us.

While there are some surface level similarities to owning a pet and having children, it's absurd to conflate the two as if they are equivalent.

An example: a social media post of someone mourning their child's death, folks commenting about the death of their pets as if it were comparable:https://www.reddit.com/r/petfree/comments/1kzlt3o/people_arg...> My three year old killed by a drunk driver. A lady said I know how you feel, my dog died last year> Idk about you but I loved my dogs more than anything. I felt guilty for a long time bc I sobbed for days after each was put down but didn't cry at my cousin or grandfather's funeral> I loved my dog and mom exactly the same, and their deaths both felt the same> It's been scientifically proven that a dog death can effect you more than a human one

By explicitly calling out that ""[they] are wonderful for children"" you are implicitly calling into question their value for adults. Whether that was your intention or not, it's certainly how I read your statement.

On r/poveryfinance and similar subreddits, one can always find someone complaining that they're about to become homeless because they can't afford rent, begging others to please tell them what line item can be cut from their budget to make it work, the conceit being that they consider every item essential. Mixed in among the electrical and water and costs of commuting to work will be $100/month for dog food or cat litter or whatever.Not only is there no value there, there is, quite often, anti-value. And this is just the quantifiable stuff, these people follow their dogs around picking up their feces with their hands.

Plus nobody enforces a lot of health and safety laws anymore, it's not uncommon to see dogs in grocery stores for example, despite it being illegal and gross.

What exactly are people not achieving when they have a dog?I bought my first home in my twenties, have a very high paying job, I have good friends, I play music sometimes, I grow my own food, I can cook better than most restaurants, I am happy most of the time, I am reasonably physically fit and can climb a mountain (literally).What meaningful progress is my dog holding me back from?

GP was referring to this group of people whose lives consist of only work and their pets.  Clearly you do not fall into this group.  In fact, given your lifestyle (a healthy, balanced one), I'd say a pet has great potential to further enhance personal development.


reply



What I've seen is they aren't getting into real relationships or developing hobbies, and are instead becoming attached to their pets. I know it's dismal but the loneliness associated with being single is supposed to motivate you into improving yourself and finding a partner. By spending money and a few hours a day with your pet, you're not doing other (potentially more real) things.

If that connection with their dogs is what brings them personal fulfillment, why is that not meaningful?  And can they not personally develop within that chosen life path?

What are people not building too that you think they should? What have you built that's so great?

The issue is.. pets are still pets. And to your point, unbehaved dog can be dangerous to its immediate surrounding. I won't go into details, but our dog is very protective of our kid, so there are places I will not take it ( or at least not without precautions ).. and this is what I see less and less: responsible behavior.But I will say this, dog was a great training for a kid, when it came for us, because we saw some very similar issues repeat themselves.The issue is what it has always been: people.

What I'm really poking at here in the joke behind the rant sort of way is a suspicion, a conspiracy by nature to suppress our reproduction capabilities by slowly not only making us infertile in greater numbers, but steering us towards adopting pets instead of humans as a prank, to make us see the animals we are in an animal kingdom.

I would not blame nature for this. I'm not particularly conspiracy-minded (humans are generally too stupid for supervillain-style conspiracies), but people did this.

Who doesn't love Lego? Appealing to folks of all ages, Lego makes for wonderful gifts or collectors items. I find myself just really enjoying the process of it all. Popping on a podcast or some music while I just tune out and build. You take each piece of the instructions one step at a time while you can see your progress moving along in real time. It's pretty mindful and therapeutic as you put this cool thing together in front of you while your mind wanders and your real-life stressors momentarily go away. Plus, Lego's got awesome sets covering every franchise under the sun — Marvel being one of its most popular. Speaking of, this Lego Marvel Captain America's Shield set is currently 20% off, bringing the price down to just $160.

See at Amazon

It's the iconic shield of Cap himself. And it's not made out of vibranium. No, it's made of something much tougher and even more deadly if you accidently step on—Lego. At a life-size measurement of 47 centimeters (18.5 inches), this Lego set is massive. It contains a total of 3,128 pieces to put together the red, white, and blue symbol of heroism. It's built for display as it comes with a stand marked with a Lego Infinity Saga plaque.

Also included is a minifigure of Captain America. Falcon has taken over the title and shield, but this minifigure is of the first Captain America as he appeared during the first decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films as portrayed by Chris Evens. The minifigure has his own shield. In his other hand, you'll find Mjolnir—the hammer of Thor. Marvel fans will remember the showstopping fight between Captain America and Thanos in 2019's Avengers: Endgame in which Cap proved himself worthy to wield this mighty weapon.

The Lego builder app can make the building process easier and more immersive than ever before. Zoom in and rotate sets in 3D while tracking your progress of the build in front of you intuitively. It's a really cool way Lego has kept up with modern consumer expectations. You can check it out on the Lego website.

The long and short is that Marvel is cool and Lego is fun. For a limited time, you can get the Lego Marvel Captain America's Shield set with its Chris Evans minifigure for the discounted price of $160—a savings of 20% that amounts to $40. And be sure to check out the other Lego Marvel sets on sale at Amazon.

Floating in orbit above Mars, NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured a panorama of the Red Planet's biggest volcanoes, Arsia Mons, peeking over a sea of clouds. The picturesque moment offers an exceptionally rare view of a Martian volcano, showing the landform at an angle in space that captures the planet's horizon.

“We picked Arsia Mons hoping we would see the summit poke above the early morning clouds. And it didn't disappoint,” Jonathon Hill, the operations lead for Odyssey's camera and a mission planner at Arizona State University's Mars Space Flight Facility, called the Thermal Emission Imaging System, or THEMIS, said in a statement. THEMIS can view Mars in both visible and infrared light.

Launched in 2001, Odyssey has been circling around Mars for over two decades, studying the Martian surface. But in 2023, the orbiter began taking breathtaking panoramic views of the Martian horizon. Because THEMIS can't pivot to get these stunning views, the orbiter flips on its side, rotating a full 90 degrees. That way, it captured Mars' “limb,” the edge of the planet's horizon. This is THEMIS' fourth limb observation since 2023.

Odyssey captured the image on May 2, just before dawn. In it, Arsia Mons stands 12 miles (20 kilometers) high and measures 70 miles (450 km) in diameter. For comparison, Earth's tallest volcano, Mauna Loa, stands 6 miles (9 km) above the seafloor and measures 75 miles (121 km) in diameter.

Arsia Mons is also one of Mars' cloudiest volcanoes and the southernmost of the three Tharsis volcanoes that form Tharsis Montes, or Tharsis Mountains. These mountains are often surrounded by water ice clouds, particularly early in the morning. The clouds form when air expands as it blows up the sides of the mountain and then rapidly cools.

This view also allows scientists to study Martian weather and phenomena like dust clouds and how they change over the course of the seasons. Odyssey might be able to capture a few more of these panoramas before its eventual retirement, likely at the end of this year.

Apple has long possessed a tradition of premium pricing and hardly ever offers deep discounts, preferring instead to maintain its prestige brand name and perceived quality. But as Amazon reinstated Apple's complete lineup, the world's largest online seller has been more aggressive on pricing cuts, even on freshly released products like the AirPods 4.

Since Sunday afternoon, both models of the AirPods 4 (with and without active noise cancellation) are available at an all-time low price, and it is a great time to invest in Apple's new wireless earbuds. The standard AirPods 4 model without ANC now costs $99 from its original $129 price which is a discount of 23%. If you're looking at AirPods 4 with ANC, they now cost $148 from the original $179 price (17% off).

See AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon

Both models of the AirPods 4 are filled with the latest technology that raises the bar for wireless sound. The standard model comes with Bluetooth connectivity, personalized spatial audio, and a water and sweat-resistant construction, and they are ideal for fitness use and daily wear. They also boast a USB-C charging case, an improvement from previous generations, and Apple's H2 chip which delivers greater sound quality, faster connectivity and improved battery life. With the charging case, users can get 30 hours of overall listening time, ready to last through long commutes, travel, or even a day at work and play.

AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation take it further by incorporating adaptive audio, transparency mode, and wireless charging compatibility. Adaptive sound smartly blends transparency mode and noise cancellation and automatically adjusts to your environment for a seamless listening experience. Transparency mode allows listeners to stay aware of their environment without needing to remove the earbuds, especially useful for noisy situations. Wireless charging adds convenience with the ability to charge earbuds without needing to dig out cables.

You will love the seamless setup for iPhone owners: Due to Apple's deep integration within iOS, pairing the AirPods 4 is literally as easy as opening the case close to your iPhone. The H2 chip also facilitates quicker device switching so that users can transition easily from their iPhone to iPad or Mac without skipping a beat. Personalized spatial audio is powered by dynamic head tracking and produces theater-quality sound that adapts in response to the movement of your head, so music, movies, and calls sound more lifelike.

Water and sweat resistance of the AirPods 4 makes it a reliable sidekick to accompany runners and gym-goers. The USB-C charging case future-proofs the device but it also makes it easy for users to locate compatible charging devices as USB-C is already becoming a mobile standard. With 30 hours of battery life, the designers have ensured that the users will enjoy uninterrupted sound for days in a single charge, a feature that is unparalleled in the noisy wireless earbuds space.

Amazon's price reduction on the AirPods 4 is rare for Apple products, particularly so soon after they released. Now is the perfect time to grab this deal before it is gone, make sure you get yours as soon as possible.

73 pages of it.

The legal battle between Micron and YMTC has taken a new turn as Micron attempts to overturn earlier agreements and court rulings, citing national security concerns. Under those prior rulings, YMTC gained access to 73 pages of Micron's confidential 3D NAND technology documentation, but now Micron wants to reverse that and leave YMTC without such access. While Micron's petition may seem unusual in the digital age, as observed by PatentlyO, there might be a reason behind the move.

Micron has petitioned the Supreme Court for 'a writ of mandamus,' challenging lower court rulings that allowed Yangtze Memory Technologies Company (YMTC) to receive 73 pages of printed copies of Micron's confidential documents during discovery as part of the 2023 litigation under which YMTC accused Micron of patent infringement. Micron's arguments claim that the district court ignored key provisions of the protective order and therefore failed to consider national security concerns associated with disclosing sensitive semiconductor information to a Chinese state-supported company that is on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List.

Micron's argument began with the nature of the dispute. In the 2023 case, YMTC alleged that Micron's 3D NAND memory products infringed several of its patents. Discovery proceeded under a jointly agreed-upon protective order that limited access to highly sensitive materials, such as source code, to outside counsel and experts, excluding company employees. It also restricted printed copies to 1,500 pages overall and no more than 30 consecutive pages.

""YMTC demanded 10 times more printed pages of source code for Micron's latest-generation chips than it had for earlier-generation chips,"" a statement by Micron reads.

Eventually, YMTC requested 73 printed pages from Micron's '150 Series Traveler Presentation,' containing information about Micron's latest and upcoming 3D NAND devices. Although numerically compliant with the protective order's page limits, Micron objected, claiming that the request was excessive, unnecessary, and dangerous given the nature of the information and YMTC's links to the Chinese government. Nonetheless, the court ruled that Yangtze Memory could get access to the printed 73 pages. Now, while an avid reader of Tom's Hardware is probably fluent with copying via a wide range of means, gaining hardware copies under a protective court order does not mean that one can make copies, at least legally. These are for eyes only — if everyone follows the rules. 

Under the protective order, only authorized individuals, in this case, YMTC's outside counsel and experts, can handle the originals. Also, no duplication of printed copies is allowed, no scanning, no photocopying, and no electronic reproduction; this is strictly prohibited.

In addition, every page is Bates-numbered and tracked; any duplication would be a violation of the protective order and subject to court sanctions, including penalties, adverse rulings, or contempt of court. If YMTC or its legal team were to make unauthorized copies, they would be in serious legal trouble, and there is no evidence they have. Nonetheless, Micron wants this decision to be reversed.

Alphawave Semi's technology will bolster upcoming chips with Qualcomm Oryon CPU and Hexagon NPU tiles.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Fabless chipmaking giant Qualcomm is set to grow yet stronger with a $2.4 billion agreement to acquire Alphawave Semi now inked. Qualcomm's freshly acquired wholly-owned subsidiary is best known for its high-speed wired connectivity and compute technologies. This deal appears to offer great synergies, particularly in the wake of Qualcomm confirming its reentry to the data center market in mid-May. Please keep this news between you and us, for now, dear readers, as Qualcomm's press release date indicates this acquisition announcement was supposed to hit the wires tomorrow. (Or it's a typo)

Qualcomm was already poised to make a big splash with its new data center processors. Its Oryon CPU cores have a great reputation for processing power and efficiency. Moreover, it should follow up with second and third generation Oryon cores from its Nuvia team in the coming months.

The chipmaker also has a potent Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in the heart of the Hexagon processor. This has also been earmarked for deployment in any upcoming data center processor. Qualcomm's Hexagon NPU is designed for AI inference, machine learning, a multimedia processing prowess. It is also highly efficient, with its roots in the mobile Snapdragon range of SoCs.

Alphawave Semi is a UK-based company that was founded in 2017. In its own words, it claims to “design industry-leading, high-speed connectivity solutions.” Its product portfolio has been tuned to address data center, AI, 5G, networking, autonomous vehicles, and flash storage markets.

In today's press release, Cristiano Amon, president and CEO of Qualcomm, makes clear that the technology that will be onboarded from Alphawave Semi will be “complementary to our power-efficient CPU and NPU cores.” Going forward, Amon sees the combined teams working in concert to enable “next-level connected computing performance” in segments such as the data center market.

With the agreement as it stands, the two parties expect to complete the acquisition by Q1 2026. There are the usual arrays of financial, legal, and regulatory hurdles to cross now with a sizable multinational deal like this.

Last but not least, while this acquisition deal is interesting in its own right, the implications on the competitive landscape of the server processor market might be even more stirring. It remains to be seen the size of the splash Qualcomm can make, though, as it will have a tough fight against incumbent and innovative tech giants like Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Google, and Amazon.

Max out your PCIe Gen 4 bandwidth with this fantastic SSD deal on a superfast Gen 4.0 M.2 SSD from Crucial. The T500 was one of the last hurrahs on Gen 4, with read and write transfer speeds that could match and even exceed the performance of popular SSD stalwarts such as Samsung's 990 Pro and Western Digital's SN850X. What makes this T500 deal so good is that it's cheaper than the previously mentioned competition and also comes with an attached heatsink.

You can find this deal on the Crucial T500 2TB SSD + Heatsink at Amazon for just $132. On checking the Camelizer (Amazon's price-checking tool extension), we can note that this is one of the best prices we've seen for this SSD since late 2023, when the drive was released.

If you'd like more information on this SSD, then take a look at our review of the Crucial T500. We put the drive through our suite of benchmarking tests to see how it performs in comparison to the competition. We awarded the T500 an impressive 4 stars for its excellent all-around performance, software, and encryption support, but were disappointed at the original launch MSRP price of the drive.

Crucial T500 2TB M.2 SSD + Heatsink: now $132 at Amazon (was $209)The Crucial T500 is one of the more recent Gen4 SSDs, making the most of its Gen4 bandwidth.  With sequential read/write speeds of 7400/7000 Mbps, the T500 is no slouch and is more than enough for top gaming performance in both PC and PlayStation 5.

The Crucial T500 uses the Phison E25 controller and features 232-layer Micron TLC memory. The popular 2280 M.2 form factor is highly compatible with the majority of motherboards that support an M.2 slot, and thanks to the thin single-sided design, this SSD is also a great fit for devices where space is a premium commodity, such as laptops or the PlayStation 5 console.

That empty folder was more important than it looked


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you accidentally deleted the mysterious folder Microsoft warned all users to absolutely not delete, the company has now released a PowerShell script to help you restore it. The folder in question, ‘inetpub', began appearing on users' system drives (C:\) after the April 2025 security update for Windows 10 and 11.

While the folder does not appear to have any files, Microsoft confirmed that it plays a critical role in enabling protections for CVE-2025-21204, a security vulnerability in the Windows Update Stack.

To help users who may have deleted the folder, intentionally or unintentionally, Microsoft has shared a PowerShell script to restore the folder with the correct access control lists. Notably, this process does not require users to manually enable Internet Information Services (IIS), the web server platform with which the folder is associated.

To run the script, open PowerShell as Administrator and execute the following command to enable signed scripts and modules -

Next, copy and paste the following to download the script -

After successfully running the script, the inetpub folder should be created.

Back in April, the appearance of the inetpub folder left many users scratching their heads. Microsoft later clarified that the folder is a required component for securing systems against CVE-2025-21204, which involves “improper link resolution before file access” in the Windows Update Stack. This vulnerability could essentially allow an authorized attacker to gain elevated privileges if exploited.

While users can also recreate the folder by enabling IIS through “Turn Windows features on or off,” doing so adds additional system folders that many may prefer to avoid. That's why Microsoft's script-based method is the recommended approach if the folder has already been removed.

Even though the folder is empty and IIS may not be in use, deleting inetpub can compromise the effectiveness of the security patch, leaving systems potentially vulnerable. Microsoft emphasizes that the folder should not be removed under any circumstances.

The LoDoCo2 trial found a reduced cardiovascular risk with low-dose colchicine in patients with chronic coronary disease. In this substudy, attenuation of pericoronary adipose tissue did not differ between patients receiving low-dose colchicine and those receiving placebo; however, people taking colchicine had a higher volume of dense calcified plaque, indicating improved plaque stability.

Low-dose colchicine was associated with an overall higher volume of calcified plaque, particularly dense calcified plaque, as well as a lower burden of low-attenuation plaque in participants treated

with colchicine and low-intensity statins,” the researchers wrote. “Although the cross-sectional design of the study limits causal inference, these are features of plaque stability and may partly explain the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events associated with colchicine in patients with chronic coronary disease.” 

This study was led by Aernoud T L Fiolet, MD, PhD, of University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands. It was published online on May 19, 2025, in Heart.

The researchers conducted this cross-sectional analysis at the end of treatment, without any baseline or temporal studies. This study had relatively fewer women than the proportion of women with cardiovascular disease in the general population. Additional imaging modalities were not used to confirm the findings from CCTA.

This study received grants from the Australian National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Withering Stichting Nederland, the Netherlands Heart Foundation, and the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.

 June 09, 2025  

PHOENIX — Two new datasets support the use of potent disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during pregnancy in women with active multiple sclerosis (MS), reinforcing a growing shift toward treatment when the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risks.

Both studies — one involving the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab and the other the integrin receptor antagonist natalizumab — are observational, but they provide a foundation for taking a proactive rather than reactive approach to treating pregnant women with active MS, said Riley M. Bove, MD, associate professor of neurology, University of California San Francisco.

Bove emphasized that a “we-don't-know” approach is no longer acceptable when counseling pregnant women with active disease. As first author of the ofatumumab study — presented on May 29 at Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting— she followed up with a lecture the next day, explaining that evidence is now available to guide treatment decisions.

While significant knowledge gaps remain about the relative risks of DMTs to fetal development and pregnancy outcomes, it is well established that women with active disease “will be harmed if we do not help,” Bove said.

She and others now believe that the available data, even if observational, are relevant and useful in guiding decisions that affect both maternal and fetal health.

The new data on ofatumumab and natalizumab offer a clear example.

In an ongoing registry, ofatumumab exposure has been documented in 669 pregnancies.

Of these, 221 were reported prior to 2023, allowing for assessment of both short- and long-term outcomes. In most cases (87%), exposure occurred during the first trimester.

Adverse outcomes were reported, including spontaneous abortions in 12.6% of cases, preterm births in 9.6%, and minor congenital malformations in two infants (< 1%).

However, these rates are “in line with the background rates observed in the general population,” Bove noted. She emphasized that such data are important when weighing treatment decisions against the known risks of active disease, which can lead to irreversible brain injury in the mother.

The natalizumab data, presented as a late-breaking abstract at CMSC on May 30, reflected 16 years of experience at a single center. Tracking began in 2008, when two pregnancies were identified in women already receiving natalizumab.

Through 2024, no increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed, while natalizumab treatment was associated with meaningful improvements in MS disease control.

A total of 58 pregnancies in 43 women have been tracked at the Rocky Mountain MS Clinic in Salt Lake City, according to Katrina Bawden, FNP-C, a nurse practitioner who has been involved since the registry began.

She noted that outcomes were analyzed in women who discontinued natalizumab after learning they were pregnant as well as those who continued treatment into the third trimester.

Among the 38 pregnancies in which natalizumab was stopped, 13 women experienced clinical relapses, and four others showed new lesions on MRI. In contrast, among the 20 pregnancies where treatment was continued, there were no relapses and no MRI evidence of disease activity.

Pregnancy complications were observed, including one fetal malformation and 10 miscarriages, but Bawden noted that these figures — like those in the ofatumumab registry — are consistent with background rates.

“Of the three fetal deaths, all occurred in those who discontinued natalizumab,” she said. She noted that all 10 of the women who miscarried had healthy term full term deliveries in a subsequent pregnancy while remaining on natalizumab.

Compared to the start of the tracking period, Bawden said the data have prompted clinicians at her clinic to reevaluate the benefit-risk balance of using natalizumab during pregnancy.

“Women at the Rocky Mountain MS Clinic who become pregnant while treated with natalizumab, using shared decision-making, are now given the option of continuing natalizumab every 8 weeks throughout pregnancy with the last dose scheduled at 34 weeks' gestation,” Bawden said.

Caring for pregnant women with MS is a complex challenge, given the incomplete information available. However, Bove — co-author of a 2024 paper on practical considerations for weighing the risks and benefits of DMT use during pregnancy — said that strictly following drug labeling is not helpful in guiding clinical decisions.

She noted that current recommendations are inconsistent across drug classes, vary between the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, and often fail to reflect the latest science — resulting in guidance that is ultimately “illogical.”

Moreover, labeling continues to evolve, and pregnancy-related use of DMTs remains a dynamic area, with new data — such as the recent studies presented at CMSC — shaping clinical strategies.

Bove emphasized that it is the clinician's responsibility to stay informed as the evidence develops, in order to support shared decision-making. This includes staying up to date on when to treat active disease during pregnancy, when to restart therapy if it was paused, and how to weigh the benefit-risk profile of DMTs for women who choose to breastfeed.

When making MS treatment decisions during pregnancy, the adage “first, do no harm” has traditionally focused on fetal risk. But Bove pointed out that withholding treatment may, in many cases, pose greater harm to the mother, underscoring the need for a balanced discussion that considers risks to both mother and fetus.

Bove reported financial relationships with Alexion, Biogen, Genentech, Horizon, Janssen, Merck, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and TG Therapeutics. Bawden reported financial relationships with Amgen, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, TG Therapeutics, and Biogen, which provided funding for assembling the data she presented.

Between 2013 and 2024, syphilitic uveitis remained a rare but serious manifestation of syphilis in the United States, predominantly affecting men, older individuals, and patients with concurrent HIV, and frequently resulting in low vision and blindness.

“Our findings reinforce the need for ordering syphilis testing at uveitis presentation and the prompt initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy thereafter to prevent irreversible ocular damage,” the researchers wrote.

The study was led by Lucy Ruoxi Zhou, of the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. It was published online on June 4, 2025, in the American Journal of Ophthalmology.

The reliance on electronic health record databases may have introduced coding variability and inaccuracies. The requirement for syphilis testing to occur within 1 month after a diagnosis of uveitis potentially excluded patients tested before or on the same day as their diagnosis or those experiencing diagnostic delays longer than 1 month. This study could not assess prescribed treatments and changes in clinical endpoints, including improvement in vision or resolution of macular edema after treatment.

 June 09, 2025  

All stakeholders in healthcare now aim to make the sector greener, and several ongoing initiatives show that real changes are possible.

Recently, the 2024 Global Report from The Lancet Countdown issued an urgent warning that human health is threatened by climate inaction. Experts have cautioned that we have reached a “point of no return” as global warming systematically undermines public health worldwide.

However, what happens when the health system itself is polluted? Data from the Ministry of Health show that the healthcare sector accounts for approximately 4.4% of net global greenhouse gas emissions, roughly 1.6 gigatons of CO2. What is being done about this?

According to a new report by Health Care Without Harm, in collaboration with Arup, “The Health Sector's Climate Footprint: How the Health Sector Contributes to the Global Climate Crisis: Opportunities for Action,” the largest contributors are the United States (546 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent), China (342 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent), and the European Union (248 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent). More than half of this footprint stems from energy consumption, such as electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning systems, combined with operational emissions.

Other significant sources included agriculture (9%, including food service in health centres and cotton cultivation for surgical gowns), pharmaceuticals, and chemicals (5%, excluding production energy transport [7%] and waste treatment [3%]). A further 1% of the health sector's global climate footprint, or nearly 4 million metric tons of emissions, is derived from anaesthetic gases (0.6%) and metered-dose inhalers (0.3%).

The ECODES report “Reduction of GHG Emissions in the Healthcare Sector Focus on Scope 3 of the Carbon Footprint” categorises emissions into three types of scopes. According to Health Care Without Harm, Scope 1 covers direct emissions from daily operations, such as burning fossil fuels for heating, cooling, and anaesthetic gases; owned vehicle exhaust; and fugitive emissions from air conditioning and cold storage systems, accounting for approximately 17% of the total. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the acquisition and consumption of electrical energy by healthcare facilities, including electricity, steam, refrigeration, and heating, accounting for approximately 12% of the total emissions. Scope 3, the largest category, includes the production, distribution, and disposal of goods and services consumed by the sector, such as medical supplies, medicines, equipment, and associated transport.

Several initiatives have been launched from international, national, regional, public, and private perspectives. The Global Green and Healthy Hospitals Network (GGHH) includes more than 1900 members in over 80 countries, representing approximately 70,000 hospitals. GGHH supports its members in conducting sustainability projects by providing access to a wide range of exclusive and innovative tools and resources.

In May 2025, GGHH published a report on the “Chemical recycling of plastic waste from the healthcare sector,” evaluating recycling technologies, toxic by-products, carbon footprint, and economic viability to identify the best options for healthcare plastic waste.

In Spain, the AIMPLAS Technological Centre in Valencia, Spain, is engaged in circular economy and decarbonisation projects, producing biocompatible, biodegradable, injectable, and resorbable materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and their copolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(ε-caprolactone) — PCL — and PLA-PCL, using various technologies such as synthesis and reactive extrusion. These biopolymers offer sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics and significantly reduce non-biodegradable pollution.

In 2025, Granada-based Athisa opened Spain's first sustainable healthcare waste treatment plant in Ciudad Real, Spain. One of its milestones is the management of solid cytostatic waste, which, unlike traditional incineration methods, uses advanced oxidation with an ozone-like oxidant that does not generate hazardous waste. This alternative avoids the emission of greenhouse gases and the generation of hazardous ash, which is typically deposited in specialised landfills, representing a more sustainable option than incineration.

The Ministry of Health launched the National Information System on the Healthcare Carbon Footprint. This tool collects and provides data on the calculation of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions from processes that occur in different healthcare centres during a given year.

In March 2025, the Ministry resumed carbon footprint workshops on the carbon footprint in healthcare centres as part of the Strategic Health and Environment Plan. From Health #ForTheClimate (ECODES) on this key initiative for decarbonisation of the healthcare sector.

In a public-private partnership, the MAPIC+s project (ECODES and GSK) aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the National Health System and drive environmental sustainability. MAPIC+s offers a roadmap for healthcare organisations by integrating sustainability into strategic plans, forming sustainability committees, replacing single-use materials, and reducing fluorinated gases, with case studies from Spain.

Eli Lilly and Company and DHL Freight launched a project to reduce CO₂ emissions on international routes. By using biodiesel vehicles and carefully planning routes, they aim to lower emissions from shipments between Eli Lilly and Company's Alcobendas plant in Madrid and destinations in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The pharmaceutical industry is also working to reduce the environmental impact of anaesthetic gases and metered-dose inhalers. Efforts are underway to accelerate the shift to near-zero carbon propellant inhalers, with the next generation expected to be launched by 2025.

However, as Carlos Almonacid, MD, vice president of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery, emphasised at a recent press conference, good clinical control offers both environmental and economic benefits. This leads to a reduced use of rescue inhalers, which typically have a higher carbon footprint, thereby supporting healthcare system sustainability. It also conserves healthcare resources and minimises patient travel to medical centres, thereby lowering pollution associated with transportation. These factors, in turn, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, improve treatment adherence, and build trust in the healthcare system.

In January 2025, the Ministry announced the “Green Anaesthesia” working group; the objective is to continue advancing the sustainability of the healthcare system and to develop a document of best practices and solutions to achieve “better anaesthesia for patients and the planet,” an estimated 2% of the National Health System's carbon footprint and approximately 10% of the direct emissions from health centres.

Mónica García, MD, Minister of Health of Spain, and a public-sector anaesthesiologist for 20 years, reaffirmed her “conviction that it is possible to reduce anaesthesia's environmental impact without compromising care quality, patient health, or professional practice. That is why we convened this working group.”

Another major step in reducing the environmental footprint is moving towards digital health. However, experts caution that the environmental impact of technologies such as artificial intelligence must also be considered.

Speaking to El Medico Interactivo, Miguel Ángel Casermeiro, secretary of the Spanish Association for Environmental Impact Assessment, noted that the digital sector is expected to become one of the main consumers of energy, as shown by the rising energy demand in this field.

Many data centre projects are currently underway in Spain, positioning the country as a key player in the global management of digital resources. “This new digital health landscape must also be assessed in terms of its energy use,” he said.

At the same time, Casermeiro emphasised that “Digital health will also yield significant savings in travel and information handling — potentially reducing diagnostic tests — leading to substantial savings for the National Health System.”

Similarly, Jaime del Barrio, MD, president of the Digital Health Association, told El Medico Interactivo that while “digital health has environmental impacts throughout its life cycle, including production, transportation, operations, and end-of-life management. However, the development and implementation can have a positive effect, significantly reduce the carbon footprint, and making the healthcare sector more efficient.”

Potential climate change scenarios could nearly double the global incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), based on estimates from a new study presented at American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference.

Although high ambient temperatures have been linked to negative health outcomes including reduced sleep duration and quality, the association between increased average ambient temperatures and the severity of OSA remains unclear, wrote Bastien Lechat, PhD, a research fellow in sleep health at Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia, and colleagues, in their abstract.

Previous cross-sectional studies have shown an association between temperature and OSA severity, which prompted the idea for the current study, Lechat said in an interview. “We have access to a consumer database (125,295 users) of an FDA-cleared wearable device validated to estimate OSA severity,” he said. Given the unique nature of this dataset (with approximately 500 repeat measurements per user), the researchers believed that the data would be ideal for estimating the effect of temperature on OSA severity, he said. “Additionally, considering the impact of obstructive sleep apnea on health and productivity, we aimed to estimate the burden associated with a potential increase in OSA prevalence due to rising temperatures, and this novel contribution from our group allowed us to quantify the societal and economic costs for different climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he noted.

In their new cross-sectional study, the researchers reviewed data from 116,200 adults in 41 countries who used an FDA-approved under-mattress sensor to estimate the severity of their OSA. The dataset included a median of 509 OSA measurements per individual; these were compared against 24-hour ambient temperature data from climate models. The mean age of the study population was 49 years; 77% were men. OSA was defined as an apnea hypopnea index score ≥ 15.

The prevalence of OSA ranged from 15% to 32% across the countries. Overall, temperatures in the 99th percentile vs the 25th percentile were associated with a 70% increased risk for OSA (mean odds ratio, 1.70) and a 45% increase in odds of having OSA on any given night (mean odds ratio, 1.45).

The association was significant in 29 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, but was stronger in European countries compared to the United States or Australia. However, across the 29 countries, the increase in OSA in 2023 associated with higher temperatures was estimated to account for an average of nearly 800,000 healthy life years lost because of death or disability, as well a mean loss of $32 billion USD in workplace productivity.

The researchers also developed scenarios based on projected temperature increases of at least 1.8°C or higher above pre-industrial levels. They determined that this increase would result in an additional 1.5- to 3-fold increase in the global burden of OSA by 2100.

“We were surprised by the magnitude of the association between ambient temperature and OSA severity,” Lechat told Medscape Medical News. “The effect size was higher than in previous studies, which we believe is likely due to our longitudinal data and robust time-series analysis design. This provides support for a potential causal association between high temperature exposure and OSA severity,” he noted.

Lechat emphasized the two main findings from the study: That extreme temperatures are associated with an increased likelihood of having OSA on a given night, and the burden of OSA on society in terms of wellbeing loss and economic loss.

“To put this into context, by 2100, under the most likely climate scenario, the wellbeing burden of OSA is estimated to nearly double in most countries because of rising temperature,” Lechat told Medscape Medical News. “These results highlight the critical urgency of limiting global warming in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Our findings also emphasize the immediate need for targeted measures to alleviate the health and economic impacts of the growing OSA prevalence associated with rising temperatures,” he said.

The results highlight the urgency of limiting global warming to reduce the burden of warming-related increases in OSA prevalence, as well as the need for effective interventions to reduce the impact of high temperatures on OSA severity, said Lechat. The study findings also emphasize the importance of diagnosing and treating OSA in the community, as most of the burden stems from the high rate of undiagnosed and untreated patients, he added.

The findings were limited by several factors including the cross-sectional design. “Additionally, we had limited data from lower- and middle-income countries, so we plan to work towards collecting appropriate sleep and temperature data worldwide,” Lechat told Medscape Medical News.

“We would like to develop intervention studies to mitigate the effect of temperature on OSA, and we also would like to understand the physiological mechanisms that could explain the higher severity of OSA due to higher temperatures,” Lechat added.

“High ambient temperatures have been linked to reduced sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation, and poorer sleep quality; however, the effect of rising temperatures on obstructive sleep apnea has not been studied,” said Arianne K. Baldomero, MD, a pulmonologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in an interview. “Investigating this relationship is important, as the global burden of OSA is already significant; with further temperature increases, we can expect this burden to grow even greater,” said Baldomero, who was not involved in the study.

The difference in the magnitude of associations between European countries and the United States or Australia, with Europeans experiencing a stronger link between rising temperatures and OSA, was interesting and somewhat surprising, and warrants further investigation, Baldomero told Medscape Medical News. In the meantime, clinicians and public health officials should be aware that higher ambient temperatures are associated with increased OSA, she added.

The current study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and effective management of OSA, especially during warmer periods, said Baldomero. “Ongoing research is needed on sleep disturbances associated with these warming temperature trends,” she said.

Limitations of the study included the reliance on under-mattress sensors that may not capture all OSA cases, Baldomero noted. “Further research should explore physiological mechanisms, differences in magnitude of associations by region, and test interventions to mitigate temperature effects on OSA,” she said.

This study was supported by Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Baldomero had no financial conflicts to disclose.

 June 09, 2025  

While youth overdose deaths from any substance rose by 40% between 2018 and 2022, deaths involving only synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, increased by 168% and surpassed deaths from polydrug combinations, a new study showed.

“Before we looked at the data, we thought we would find that the majority of fatal youth overdoses involved fentanyl combined with other substances, such as prescription opioids or cocaine. Instead, we found the opposite — that most deaths were caused by fentanyl alone,” study co-investigator Noa Krawczyk, PhD, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York City, said in a press release.

“These findings highlight the changing risks of the drug supply and the need for better access to harm-reduction services to prevent deaths among youth,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Megan Miller, MPH, Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York City. It was published online on May 20 in Pediatrics.

This study was limited by potential residual misclassification in mortality coding practices, small sample sizes for examining youth who identify as more than one race, and lack of information about sexual orientation.

This study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Krawczyk reported receiving compensation for expert witness testimony as a part of ongoing opioid litigation. The other investigators reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

About 40% of patients with diagnosed heart failure did not pursue future cardiology consultations, regardless of the initial severity of their condition. A single follow-up cardiology visit can reduce 1-year all-cause mortality by 6%-9%, with additional visits showing increased benefit as the severity of heart failure increases.

“Despite having an HF diagnosis, 40% of patients do not see a cardiologist annually, regardless of disease severity. Simple stratification based on hospitalization history and diuretic use effectively predicts outcomes. Tailoring the annual number of [heart failure] consultations according to this stratification could optimize resource use and reduce avoidable modelled deaths,” the researchers wrote.

“This group represents a significant opportunity to improve survival outcomes with only a modest increase in the total number of consultations. Healthcare systems could formally assess the impact of this annual consultation through large-scale cluster trials, allowing for an evaluation of the broader population-level benefits of this approach,” they added.

The study was led by Guillaume Baudry, MD, of the Université de Lorraine in Nancy, France. It was published online in the European Heart Journal and presented at the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (HFA-ESC) 2025 meeting in Belgrade, Serbia.

Researchers excluded patients residing in nursing homes due to their advanced prognosis and unavailability of healthcare utilization data, which may have led to an underestimation of morbidity and mortality. The study did not include heart failure patients who had not been recently hospitalized and did not submit long-term condition paperwork. Important clinical data such as ejection fraction, heart failure phenotype, and prognostic biomarker values were unavailable.

The researchers reported receiving fees and grants and other relationships with various pharmaceutical companies including Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, and Pfizer.

Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was a valuable predictor for oncological outcomes and morbidity among European patients with gastric cancer undergoing multimodal curative-intent treatment. A low PNI was associated with decreased odds of achieving Textbook Outcome (TO) and an increased risk for 90-day mortality.

""PNI was a valuable predictor for oncological outcomes and morbidity among European GC [gastric cancer] patients undergoing multimodal curative-intent treatment,"" the authors wrote. ""While low PNI was associated with decreased odds of TO achievement and increased risk of 90-day mortality, further prospective large-scale and nutritional intervention studies are warranted to standardize the PNI threshold and improve its clinical applicability as well as surgical outcomes following oncologic surgery,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Zuzanna Pelc, Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. It was published online on May 28, 2025, in the International Journal of Cancer.

The retrospective design limited the ability to reassess the PNI after surgery to evaluate trends during multimodal treatment. The studied cohort's heterogeneity, with half of the patients omitting neoadjuvant chemotherapy, may have affected result interpretation. The PNI cutoff of 45.5 showed moderate discriminative ability for predicting TO, suggesting that it should be interpreted within a broader clinical context rather than as a standalone predictor.

While weight loss is often the goal of weight management, weight management in older adults should go beyond weight loss to focus on functional health outcomes, comorbidity improvements, and harm reduction. 

Weight management in older adults requires greater mindfulness and clinical nuance than in younger populations, owing to the increased risk of potential harm. Aging is commonly accompanied by a rise in medical complexity — older adults are more likely to live with multiple chronic conditions and to take several medications, which adds important layers of consideration when pursuing weight loss interventions.

Over 50% of older adults have three or more chronic diseases. These overlapping conditions demand coordinated, multidisciplinary care. Within this context, clinicians must consider how meaningful weight loss might improve obesity-related complications, while also weighing the potential for unintended consequences that can arise from rapid or unmonitored changes in health status.

Polypharmacy is a common concern in geriatric care and adds to the complexity of weight management. Among adults aged 65 and older with Medicare insurance, the median number of prescription medications was four. Older patients may be prescribed medications associated with potential weight gain, such as first-generation antihistamines or beta-blockers. 

Polypharmacy not only increases the risk of adverse drug-drug interactions but also necessitates vigilant monitoring during weight loss, particularly when medications are weight-dependent. A case report on thyrotoxicosis in the setting of 30% weight loss with tirzepatide highlighted the importance of adjusting weight-based medications like levothyroxine. 

Because obesity is the root cause or contributor to several other cardiometabolic diseases, obesity treatment has been demonstrated to improve several weight-related consequences. The Look AHEAD trial of adults with type 2 diabetes reported an average 8.6% weight loss and associated improvements in blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic status. Obesity pharmacotherapy advances, which now grants access to 15%-20% weight loss thresholds, have been associated with de-escalation of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies. In a secondary analysis of trials for semaglutide 2.4 mg, 34% vs 15% of participants experienced a discontinuation or dose reduction in their anti-hypertensive medication, while maintaining normal blood pressures. While such observational data is insufficient to establish recommendations, they implore attention: As weight loss is achieved, medication regimens should be regularly reviewed for potential deprescribing to reduce the risk of overtreatment, adverse effects, and polypharmacy-related complications.

Beyond cardiometabolic disease, sarcopenia— the age-related decline in muscle mass and function — is another critical consideration. Clinicians should focus on evidence-based nutrition and physical activity recommendations demonstrated to preserve lean mass and function. Higher protein intake has been consistently demonstrated to preserve lean mass or improve body composition in the setting of weight loss. High protein diets (ie, greater than 0.8 g/kg/d) are commonly recommended alongside a progressive strength training program. 

In a weight loss study of adults with obesity, participants were randomized to a high protein supplement vs an isocaloric supplement and participated in a resistance exercise program 3 times/week for 13 weeks. While weight loss and fat mass loss between groups did not differ, those on the higher protein supplement (1.1 g/kg/d of protein) gained 0.4 kg +/- 1.2 kg of appendicular muscle mass while those on the isocaloric supplement (0.85 g/kg/d of protein) lost 0.5 +/- 2.1 kg (P =.03). 

Similar studies focusing on resistance training have replicated these benefits across studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials that enrolled older adults with obesity compared weight loss via caloric restriction alone vs weight loss via caloric restriction plus resistance training; resistance training reduced 93.5% of the lean body mass loss associated with calorie restriction. Additionally, the strength-to-lean body mass ratio improved when resistance training accompanied calorie restriction compared to calorie restriction alone (20.9% vs -7.5%). 

However, muscle preservation is only half the story. Bone health is an equally important concern during weight loss in older adults. Rapid or sustained weight reduction can have unintended effects on bone density, which in turn can increase the risk of fractures. Few studies have examined the incidence of fracture rate after long-term and sustained weight loss. In the aforementioned Look AHEAD study of adults with type 2 diabetes, no significant difference in incident fracture rate was observed over a median of 9.6 years (373 participants randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention vs 358 randomized to standard diabetes education), but a composite of the first occurrence of a hip, upper arm, or shoulder fracture was found to be 39% higher in the intervention group. Long-term outcome studies examining risk of fractures with medical weight management have not been conducted, but the increased risk of fractures observed among individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery informed guidelines to recommend earlier, repeated osteoporosis screening and higher vitamin D supplementation to optimize bone health. 

Overall, obesity management in older adults requires a careful and tailored approach that is attentive to comorbidity management and that prioritizes risk mitigation. Increasingly, the effects of obesity on all aspects of a person's quality of life is being recognized, and patients should be informed on how weight loss may interact with coexisting medical conditions, medication regimens, and musculoskeletal health. Clinicians who treat obesity in older adults should be prepared to manage patients across these intersections, or coordinate care with registered dietitian-nutritionists, exercise physiologists, endocrinologists, and primary care professionals.

The use of probiotics and prebiotics, alone or combined (synbiotics), was associated with a significantly greater decrease in symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with depression compared to nonuse, a new meta-analysis showed.

Although the current analysis suggested a promising role for these substances, future studies “should focus on comparing probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics to standard treatments, identifying effective strains, and incorporating objective measures better to understand their impact on depression and anxiety symptoms,” the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Reza Moshfeghinia, MD, MPH, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. It was published online on May 24 in Journal of Psychiatric Research.

Significant heterogeneity existed in the diagnosis of depression among the included studies, with variation in diagnostic criteria and assessment tools potentially influencing the results. Additional limitations included the use of various strains and doses of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; reliance on self-reported measures; and the lack of objective data in some studies.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

MANCHESTER — Two ongoing cardiology trials in the UK are facing substantial recruitment challenges, researchers reported at the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS) Annual Conference 2025.

The BRITISH study has enrolled fewer than one third of its targeted 2504 patients over 2 years. Meanwhile, CRAAFT-HF has recruited just 22 of its 1200-patient goal since launching in December 2024.

“We are running behind schedule,” said Andrew Flett, a consultant cardiologist at University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust and principal investigator for BRITISH. “We're running at about 50% of where we should be, and we're putting in every effort to try and improve that.” 

CRAAFT-HF's chief investigator, Pier Lambiase, professor of cardiology at University College London, said that the trial's eligibility criteria were “evolving” and being adjusted to boost recruitment.

CRAAFT-HF is comparing surgical vs medical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in people with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 50%.

The trial is still in its vanguard phase, with 14 centres open for an average of 4.5 months. The aim was to have at least 120-215 patients recruited across 10 sites within the first year.

Despite a large potential pool of patients with heart failure and AF seen in clinics, “only about 5% are referred for ablation,” Lambiase said.

To improve recruitment, proposed changes include:

“We've learned very quickly that this is threatening the trial,” Lambiase said. “It's a lot of work to get the patient recruited, start optimal therapy, repeat the [echocardiogram], make sure they're still in the trial.”

He estimated that the revised criteria could have added 62 patients — tripling current enrolment.

Lambiase remains optimistic, citing remote follow-up protocols and international collaboration plans with centres in Canada, Australia, Sweden, and Spain. 

Expanding the pool of associate principal investigators to include nurses and pharmacists may also help accelerate recruitment.

The BRITISH study, active since 2023, is running at 46 of its planned 50 UK sites and actively recruiting.

It aims to determine whether scarring detected via cardiovascular magnetic resonance is associated with reduced mortality in patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy and severe systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤ 35%) who receive implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

Flett reported that of the 390 patients enrolled so far:

Flett said this is “the best-treated heart failure population in a heart failure trial that I'm aware of,” noting high rates of evidence-based therapy:

The median age is 66 years. Most participants are White (93%) and male (80%).

The underrepresentation of women — just 20% of the current cohort — is “a major source of concern,” Flett told Medscape News UK. 

The BCS and the British Heart Foundation Clinical Research Collaborative have previously highlighted the need to include more women in clinical trials. A consensus paper in the journal Heart, published at the start of the BCS annual conference, outlined strategies to improve female participation. 

However, Flett noted that nonischaemic cardiomyopathy is more common in men. “We're going to recruit the patients that are there, and most of them are men,” he said. If we had “the luxury of plenty of patients, we could obviously hold back on male recruitment,” he added. 

Efforts are also underway to increase the number of female principal investigators (PIs). Currently, just 6 of the 46 site PIs are women. 

Recruitment could take another 2-3 years at the current pace. Plans are being considered to open additional sites in Australia and to remind UK centres of the importance of balanced gender recruitment. 

The BRITISH and CRAAFT-HF studies are funded by the British Heart Foundation. Flett and Lambiase had no conflicts of interest to disclose.

 June 09, 2025  

Malaria parasites can hide in people's bodies for years or even decades without causing symptoms by shutting down the genes that make them visible to the immune system, a new report found.

This discovery explains how people can remain infected years after developing malaria and spread the disease through mosquitos that bite them, said Kirk W. Deitsch, PhD, professor with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York City, and co-author of a study published in Nature Microbiology.

“What's probably happening in a place like Africa, where there's a lot of malaria transmission, is that people we thought didn't have malaria actually had these invisible parasites at really low levels in their system,” Deitsch told Medscape Medical News.

The implications for elimination campaigns are significant. Currently, “when we try to do a malaria elimination campaign, [we] treat the kids, the ones who are sick,” he said. The study suggests “that we need to treat all asymptomatic people, the adults, because they're carrying these cryptic parasites that nobody knew about before.”

The researchers sought to better understand how malaria persists in the body.

“There were these weird cases where a person who grew up in, let's say, Africa, had malaria several times, were no longer infected, and moved to the States. They lived in the States for a decade, maybe 12 or 13 years, and then they give blood for a transfusion, and the recipient of the transfusion gets really bad malaria,” Deitsch said.

“So clearly, those parasites have been hiding in this person for more than a decade, and nobody knew why. How are they hiding? Where are they?”

Study authors focused on the var gene, which expresses an adhesive surface protein on the infected red blood cells in malaria. The protein is “sticky,” allowing infected cells to attach to blood vessel walls and avoid being filtered out by the spleen, Deitsch said. But the parasite pays a price because the immune system can detect the sticky protein.

Previous methods of analyzing the genetics of malaria looked at millions of parasites together. “If you want to know which gene is being turned on in that population, you take all those parasites, you extract all the RNA from the population, and you look at which gene is turned on,” Deitsch explained.

For the new study, researchers analyzed the malaria parasite at the single-cell level. “We isolated single parasites and then looked at which gene is being expressed by just that individual parasite,” he said. “We found there was always a group of parasites that had turned off the entire [var] gene family and were expressing no genes at all.” 

As a result, the red blood cells didn't produce the surface proteins, allowing them to be “invisible” and evade the immune system.

The parasites don't turn invisible right away, Deitsch said. Instead, they constantly switch to different sticky proteins, like a criminal changing disguises, as the immune system swings into action. “As soon as your antibody titer begins to rise, they just switch to a different adhesive protein.”

“The parasite only has so many copies of this adhesive protein that they can put out to the surface over their lifetime. So they run out of genes after about a year and a half or so.”

Scientists used to think this meant the infection would be cleared. “Everybody always assumed that once the parasite runs out of these genes, that the infection is over. You clear the infection, and then you're okay.”

Deitsch used the metaphor of a criminal who has a closet full of 50-60 disguises. “When you get to the last one, then you've run out, and the cops have figured out all your previous disguises. At the back of the closet, there's an invisibility cloak. They can put that on, and then the cops can't see you at all.”

These invisible parasites exist at very low levels. “Those parasites don't go to very high levels because your spleen is continuously filtering them,” Deitsch explained. “But what they're able to do is maintain this low level of infection for a long time.”

The only sign of continued infection may be a slightly enlarged spleen “because the spleen is continuously clearing a lot of these invisible parasites by filtration,” Deitsch noted.

The findings suggest that anti-malaria efforts should treat entire populations with anti-malaria drugs, even healthy people, Deitsch said. And drugs could be developed to make the hidden parasites become visible to the immune system.

However, neither strategy is simple, he said.

What's next? “We're going to continue working on the molecular mechanisms that mediate this process [and explore] how the parasites control their chromosomes and their genes to go into this silent, invisible state and then switch back out into a different state,” Deitsch said.

Researchers are also studying basic questions about how parasites coordinate their disguise changes. “There are literally trillions of parasites in the circulation of a sick individual, and they seem to coordinate switching their disguise,” Deitsch said. “They all know to go to the same next disguise.”

Karine Le Roch, PhD, MS, director of the Center for Infectious Disease and Vector Research, University of California, Riverside, who was not involved with the paper, told Medscape Medical News that it's “a rigorous, innovative, and impactful study that advances a long-standing question in malaria biology.”

The report “addresses a major paradox in malaria biology and offers a compelling explanation for asymptomatic chronic infections, which have long been poorly understood,” she said.

Anna Bachmann, PhD, a research group leader at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, also praised the study.

Bachmann, who didn't work on the paper, said it suggests “that P falciparum may possess even more sophisticated strategies to maintain long-term infections than previously understood.”

She added that the findings have implications regarding whether migrants need more extensive screening and treatment for acute and chronic infections.

“Many parasitic infections in refugees from sub-Saharan Africa have been found to be clinically almost silent, leading to the recommendation that screening practices need to be improved, particularly with respect to parasitic infections,” she said. “This is primarily to improve the health of migrants, but it could also become relevant in the context of a potential reintroduction of malaria in nonendemic regions as currently being observed in parts of the United States and southern Europe.”

The National Institutes of Health supported Deitsch and another author via grants. Deitsch is a Stavros S. Niarchos Scholar and recipient of a William Randolph Hearst Endowed Faculty Fellowship Grant, and the William Randolph Hearst Foundation supported his institution. Another author received support from the Swiss National Science Foundation. The other authors had no disclosures.

 June 09, 2025  

A large Danish cohort study showed no significant increase in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) among children fathered by men taking valproate during spermatogenesis, challenging earlier safety concerns and current UK restrictions on valproate use in men.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, the decision to restrict the drug in women and in men younger than 55 years was made in January 2024, after the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued new guidance on the drug's use.

“Paternal exposure to antiseizure medication in association with conception is unlikely to pose any major risk for the offspring,” the investigators led by Jakob Christensen, DrMedSci, consultant neurologist at Aarhus University Hospital and professor at Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark, noted.

The study was published online on May 22 in JAMA Network Open.

In the US and Europe, there is strong guidance about avoiding valproate in pregnant women and women of childbearing age due to an elevated risk for birth defects and other developmental problems.

In January 2024, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) safety committee (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee [PRAC]) expanded precautionary measures on valproate use to men considering fatherhood. The advisory was fueled largely by an observational study by the contract research organization IQVIA.

The study showed that about 5 out of 100 children had an NDD when born to fathers taking valproate during the 3 months before conception compared with about 3 out of 100 when born to fathers treated with lamotrigine or levetiracetam.

Last summer, Christensen and colleagues were unable to replicate the IQVIA results in a study using a subset of the same IQVIA data. However, at the time, only limited information about the IQVIA study was publicly available.

Once additional information from the IQVIA study became available, the researchers tried again to replicate the findings, aligning their methods more closely with the IQVIA study.

Despite using the same methodology and incorporating additional data, they were still unable to replicate the IQVIA findings. Their conclusion remained unchanged — there was no statistically significant increased risk for NDDs.

Specifically, among 961 children exposed to paternal valproate monotherapy and 1401 exposed to lamotrigine or levetiracetam, there was no significant increase in risk for NDDs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54).

“This finding remained robust across analyses of specific NDDs, analyses of valproate dose, analyses accounting for time trends, analyses allowing for polytherapy, analyses expanding the definition of NDDs, analyses restricted to fathers with epilepsy, and analyses with a restricted exposure window,” Christensen and colleagues reported.

Restricting analyses to fathers with epilepsy of unknown cause yielded a higher risk (aHR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.13-5.44), but this association was no longer significant in analyses matched on birth year (aHR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.00-5.44).

Additional sensitivity analyses (restricting exposure window, excluding children with epilepsy or maternal epilepsy, and accounting for polytherapy) consistently showed no elevated risk for NDDs associated with paternal valproate exposure.

“We've examined this issue from many angles and still find no evidence supporting the concern behind EMA's recommendations,” Christensen said in a news release.

Reached for comment, Aatif Husain, MD, epileptologist, neurologist, and sleep medicine specialist at DukeHealth, Durham, North Carolina, said, “There seems to be a fair amount of literature” suggesting no increased risk for NDDs in children whose fathers use valproate.

“A recent systematic review that included 10 other studies came to this same conclusion,” said Husain, who wasn't involved in the Danish study.

Taken together, the data “would probably move EMA to relook at their guidance to see if it needs to be modified,” he said.

Medscape Medical News reached out to the EMA press office for comment and received the following response.

“As with every medicine authorized in the EU, EMA continues monitoring and supervising the safety of these medicines. This includes monitoring information from various sources, such as spontaneous reports, clinical studies, scientific literature, and management of safety signals, which consists of a set of activities to determine whether there are new risks associated with an active substance or a medicine or whether known risks have changed. Should there be any updates, EMA will communicate them via the PRAC Highlights.”

Husain told Medscape Medical News that neither the FDA nor the American Epilepsy Society has issued guidance on valproate use in men “because the data has not been strong enough.”

Funding for the study was provided by the Independent Research Fund Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Lundbeck Foundation, Danish Epilepsy Association, and Central Denmark Region. Christensen received speaking fees and travel support from UCB Nordic and Eisai AB. Husain reported having no relevant disclosures.

 June 09, 2025  

A new combination modality demonstrated excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with endoscopy in a prospective study of at-risk veterans screened for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a small comparative study in US veterans found.

BE is up to three times more prevalent in veterans than in the general population.

This and other minimally invasive approaches may reduce patient anxiety and increase screening rates, according to investigators led by Katarina B. Greer, MD, MS, of the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System and Case Western University in Cleveland. Such screening platforms are expected to open a window on improved prognosis for EAC by offering well-tolerated, office-based testing, the authors wrote in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Greer and colleagues compared standard upper endoscopy with EsoCheck (EC), a nonendoscopic esophageal balloon cell-sampling device coupled with EsoGuard (EG), a DNA-based precancer screening assay, with standard upper endoscopy, an FDA-approved minimally invasive alternative.

Sensitivity and specificity of combined EC/EG for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)-detected BE/EAC were 92.9% (95% CI, 66.1-99.8) and 72.2% (95% CI, 62.1-80.8), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 32.5% (95% CI, 18.6-49.1) and 98.6% (95% CI, 92.4-100), respectively.

“With its strong negative predictive power, this screening modality could be a first-line tool available to a greater number of patients,” Greer and associates wrote. “Data from this test support the notion that EC could be performed as a triaging test to increase the yield of diagnostic upper endoscopy 2.5-fold.”

The US rates of EAC have increased more than six-fold in the past four decades and continue to rise. In 2023, 21,560 cases of EAC were diagnosed here. The prognosis for EAC is still poor, with fewer than 22% of patients surviving beyond 5 years.

Current guidelines recommend sedated EGD for patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and additional BE risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and family history. This strategy, however, often fails to detect BE when symptoms are well controlled with over-the-counter or physician-prescribed therapies, Greer and colleagues noted. It also fails to detect BE in individuals without GERD, who comprise 40% of those who develop EAC.

Fewer than 5% of EACs are diagnosed as early-stage lesions caught by surveillance of patients with previously detected BE.

The researchers recruited veterans meeting American College of Gastroenterology criteria for endoscopic BE and EAC screening at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

Of 782 eligible veterans, 130 (16.6%) entered the study and 124 completed screening. Common reasons for nonparticipation included completion of upper endoscopy outside of the VA healthcare system, lack of interest in joining a research study, and no recommendation for screening from referring gastroenterology or primary care providers. Eligible candidates had gastroesophageal reflux disorder plus three additional risk factors, such as smoking, higher BMI, male sex, age 50 years or older, and family history. The mean number of risk factors was 4.1.

“Available data suggest that family history is the strongest predictor of BE diagnosis, as prevalence of BE among those with family history was 23%,” Greer's group wrote. “This points to high priority of pursuing screening in patients with family history of the condition, followed by patients who share multiple risk factors.”

All participants completed unsedated EC-guided distal esophageal sampling followed by a sedated EGD on the same day. The prevalence of BE/EAC was 12.9% (n = 14/2), based on standard EGD.

“The study was not powered to prospectively determine EC diagnostic accuracy for subgroups of nondysplastic and dysplastic BE and EAC. These data are reported for this device in development studies but not available for our study population,” the authors wrote. In comparison, they noted, the Cytosponge-TFF3, another nonendoscopic screening device for EAC and BE, exhibited lower sensitivity of 79.5%-87.2%, depending on lesion length, but higher specificity of 92.4%.

Baseline scores on the short-form six-item Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 (STAI-6) revealed notable levels of periprocedural anxiety. STAI-6 scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety. In the VA study, scores ranged from 20 to 60, and most domains constituting the scores were the same before and after the procedure. Participants did, however, report a statistically significant decrease in sense of worry after EC and reported good tolerability for both EC and EG.

Offering an outsider's perspective on the study, Joshua Sloan, DO, an esophageal gastroenterologist at University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, said that with the acceleration of US rates of EAC, developing a nonendoscopic screening tool to improve identification of Barrett's and perhaps early EAC is important. “The study by Greer et al helps support the use of nonendoscopic screening with EsoCheck and EsoGuard to identify these conditions,” he told Medscape Medical News. “It will be interesting to see similar studies in the non-VA population as well. As the study notes, veterans are an enriched population with a higher prevalence of Barrett's esophagus.”

Ultimately, Sloan added, “the hope is to increase our ability to identify and manage BE before it becomes EAC. Nonendoscopic screening tools have the potential to increase diagnosis and funnel the appropriate patients for endoscopic surveillance.”

“Calculations regarding effectiveness of the two-step screening strategy afforded by EC indicate that the burden of screening would be reduced by at least half (53%),” the authors wrote. Since the estimated size of the US screen-eligible population ranges from 19.7 million to 120.1 million, noninvasive tools could significantly decrease EGD procedures. A formal cost effectiveness analysis is being conducted and will be published separately.

This study was funded by a Department of Defense award.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr has threatened to bar federal scientists from publishing in top medical journals. This move risks backfiring on two major fronts. First, it will only accelerate private industry's sway over the scientific record. Second, launching new, government-run journals will demand vast resources and years of effort — and still won't earn the credibility of established publications.

With nearly five decades in medical and scientific writing, editing, and publishing — across nonprofit and commercial organizations, legacy print and digital platforms, and both subscription-based and open-access models — I write from experience.

To see the flaws in Kennedy's proposal, we need to understand what works and what doesn't in science publishing. Primary, peer-reviewed medical/scientific literature has evolved and thrived in a culture of self-criticism, through letters columns, corrections, retractions, and open debate. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), The Lancet, and JAMA remain the gold standards in medical publishing because of their rigorous peer review, global reach, and editorial independence from government or corporate influence. 

Here's where RFK Jr's main objection with the current system seems to lie. The Secretary has portrayed medical journals as hopelessly corrupted by industry. Extensive firewalls, guidelines, and rules have been established to govern the relationship of industry to medical journals. They rest largely on honest disclosure with authors, editors, and readers paying attention. Cracks in those barriers are not unknown. 

But the solution lies in strengthening these firewalls, not sidelining them. A ban on government employees from submitting to NEJM, The Lancet, JAMA, and other top-tier titles will deliver more power — not less — to pharmaceutical, device, and biotech companies to set the scientific agenda. Far from reducing “corruption,” such a misguided policy would magnify the role of the very stakeholders RFK Jr decries. And if federal grant support diminishes, the research that is published will become increasingly supported by industry, compounding the mistake. 

The notion of creating new government-owned medical journals from scratch is not an absurd idea. But Kennedy's illusion of fast-tracking NIH-affiliated ""preeminent journals"" that stamp federal‐funded work as unquestionably legitimate is a gargantuan endeavor. Building editorial boards, peer‐review standards, submission platforms, indexation in PubMed, and marketing to researchers worldwide takes years of work from countless individuals and would cost a substantial amount of money. 

Even then, a journal's reputation rests on trust and perceived independence. Readers judge not only the science but also the integrity of the editor–owner relationship. The hazard is that the owner (the government) would have to be trusted by the readers, or no one would bother reading these publications. A government “house organ” would likely be viewed skeptically if the federal government can withdraw or prohibit publications at will.

Banning federal scientists from submitting to journals the administration doesn't like does not cleanse the literature of industry influence — it deepens those ties. And while government-run journals might one day exist, they won't arrive fully baked, credible, or conflict-free. Better to invest in the proven mechanisms of editorial independence, enhanced peer review, and clearer disclosure than in a rushed, state-controlled alternative destined to struggle for trust and impact.

If RFK Jr wants a better list of reforms, here's what I suggest: 

These steps aren't as sexy as proclaiming publishing bans for government scientist or launching new journals on whose mastheads you can put your own name. But they have the virtues of solving real problems and not making existing problems worse — which, as a physician, seems like something I've heard before somewhere …","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Breakthrough AI transforms how people with visual impairments experience the world, giving them tools to discover, understand, and experience the beauty of unfamiliar places like never before. 

Study: AI system facilitates people with blindness and low vision in interpreting and experiencing unfamiliar environments. Image credit: Angel Santana Garcia/Shutterstock.com

A team of researchers from China developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven system that can potentially help visually impaired individuals explore, understand, and relish unfamiliar environments surrounding them. The study is published in the Nature Portfolio Journal Artificial Intelligence. 

Exploring natural environments, such as parks, has a significant positive impact on physical and mental health. However, people with low vision or blindness are often excluded from these benefits because appropriate assistive aids are not available to help them proactively engage with them.

Existing assistive solutions developed to guide visually impaired individuals primarily focus on providing functional assistance, such as navigation and obstacle avoidance, allowing them to engage with nature passively.

Visually impaired individuals often feel helpless while exploring unfamiliar environments. This usually means they rely on family members, friends, or volunteers for assistance, which impairs their ability to actively explore and understand unfamiliar environments, as well as to remember and communicate with other visually impaired individuals about their journey.  

A team of China-based researchers developed an AI-driven System named VIPTour to offer visually impaired individuals a sense of independence in unfamiliar environments.

VIPTour is an AI-driven system containing a set of lightweight, portable, consumer-grade devices (a camera and a smartphone) and a novel deep-learning algorithm network called FocusFormer. Efficient multisensory interaction techniques, such as audio and hierarchical tactile interaction, drive the interaction between visually impaired users and the VIPTour system.

FocusFormer considers aesthetics, freshness (novelty), and basic needs (including navigation and safety) as the main factors in extracting meaningful information from complex, unfamiliar environments and excluding redundant visual details. This reduces the cognitive load on visually impaired users.

FocusFormer transforms vast amounts of information into a structured, sparse, and hierarchical personalized graph. Based on this well-structured graph, FocusFormer interacts with visually impaired users through a smartphone application, understands their preferences, and provides personalized assistance through an adapter.

It is trained with thousands of public tourism videos from sighted tourists in a self-supervised manner, which is beneficial for effectively reducing aesthetic bias.

The VIPTour system also has options for recording, storing, and sharing experiences, facilitating emotional communications among visually impaired individuals, and promoting the exchange of knowledge and experiences within their social networks.

VIPTour's core technical innovation lies in its multi-attention FocusFormer network. This approach utilizes a background subnetwork to filter out commonly seen objects, an attraction subnetwork to identify highlights, a freshness subnetwork to discover novel features, and a needs subnetwork trained on surveys conducted with visually impaired participants. These subnetworks combine to select, rank, and present the most relevant information for each user.

The VIPTour system also utilizes a BLV-in-the-Loop Adapter, which updates its recommendations in real-time based on individual user feedback, such as “likes” and “dislikes,” thereby enabling personalization.

The VIPTour system was tested on 33 individuals with blindness or low vision, and self-reported emotional experiences were collected for analysis.

Regarding assistive performance, the study found that the VIPTour system effectively helped visually impaired individuals actively explore and thoroughly understand unfamiliar environments, empowered them with accurate and long-lasting recollections, and enabled them to communicate with their peers.  

By extensively analyzing self-reported experiences, the study found that the participants using VIPTour successfully achieved a 67.9% increase in positive emotional response, a 94.7% increase in arousal, a 772.73% increase in cognitive mapping accuracy, and a 200% increase in long-term memory accuracy.

In user evaluations, the VIPTour system's usability scores were consistently above 80 out of 100, comparable to or better than those of other assistive tools for visually impaired individuals.

Physiological measures, including electrodermal activity and heart rate variability, showed significant improvements with VIPTour use, indicating enhanced emotional engagement.

The study highlights the potential uses of the AI-driven VIPTour system in providing visually impaired individuals with an enjoyable and memorable experience while actively exploring unfamiliar environments. These experiences can significantly boost their emotional state and improve their overall quality of life.

Existing evidence suggests that presenting organized and engaging information can enhance a person's pleasure level and facilitate deeper memory retention. Humans have a natural tendency to process well-structured and meaningful information, which makes their experiences more enjoyable and memorable.

This human tendency may be explained by the concept of cognitive fluency, which indicates that clear and organized information presentation reduces the cognitive load on individuals. Subsequently, this helps them channel mental resources towards understanding and integrating the content. This improved processing fluency induces a positive response, as individuals perceive the information more pleasantly.

Furthermore, the interaction between novel and familiar information influences the effect of organized and interesting information on memory. Novel information stimulates curiosity and enhances attention, while familiar information provides cognitive comfort and coherence.

Presenting the information in a structured and engaging way can balance novelty and familiarity, which helps maintain individuals' interest and engagement.

The self-supervised training of FocusFormer with thousands of unlabeled public tourism videos has effectively captured cognitive fluency, revealing the statistical relationships between different concepts in tourism scenes. This approach eliminates potential bias in tour preference labeling and trains the model to extract only relevant contextual information.

These personalized design considerations of FocusFormer have enabled the VIPTour system to successfully model the desired cognitive fluency, thereby improving the tourism experience for visually impaired individuals.

It is worth noting that VIPTour's impact depends on the quality of the underlying AI techniques, such as object detection and semantic graph generation. Future improvements in these methods could further enhance the system's performance.

Detection of melanoma and a range of other skin diseases will be faster and more accurate with a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool that analyses multiple imaging types simultaneously.

University of Queensland researchers including Professors H. Peter Soyer and Monika Janda were part of a Monash University-led team that developed the tool, which improved skin cancer diagnosis accuracy by 11 per cent when used by dermatologists in a reader study.

 'PanDerm' analyses multiple types of images, including close-up photos, dermoscopic images, pathology slides and total body photographs.

A series of evaluations showed the model helped non-dermatologist healthcare professionals improve diagnostic accuracy on various other skin conditions by 16.5 per cent. 

It could also supported clinicians to detect skin cancer early, identifying potentially concerning changes before clinician detection.

Professor Soyer said the tool could be particularly valuable in busy or resource-limited settings, or in primary care where access to dermatologists may be limited.

Differences in imaging and diagnosis techniques can arise due to different levels of resources available in urban, regional and rural healthcare spaces.

The strength of PanDerm lies in its ability to support existing clinical workflows.

We have seen that the tool was also able to perform strongly even when trained on only a small amount of labelled data, a key advantage in diverse medical settings where standard annotated data is often limited.""

Professor H. Peter Soyer

Trained on more than two million skin images, data for the model was sourced from 11 institutions in multiple countries, across 4 types of medical images. 

First author and PhD student Siyuan Yan from Monash University said the multimodal approach was key to the system's success.

""By training PanDerm on diverse data from different imaging techniques, we've created a system that can understand skin conditions the way dermatologists do; by synthesising information from various visual sources,"" Mr Yan said. 

With skin conditions now impacting 70 per cent of the global population, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial and can lead to better treatment outcomes. 

Unlike current models, which are trained to perform a single task, PanDerm was evaluated on a wide range of clinical tasks such as skin cancer screening, predicting the chance of cancer returning or spreading, skin type assessment, mole counting, tracking lesion changes, diagnosing a wide range of skin conditions, and segmenting lesions. 

Alfred Health Victorian Melanoma Service Director, Professor Victoria Mar, said PanDerm showed promise in helping detect subtle changes in lesions over time and provide clues to lesion biology and future metastatic potential. 

""This kind of assistance could support earlier diagnosis and more consistent monitoring for patients at high risk of melanoma,"" Professor Mar said.

""In real-world hospitals or clinic settings, doctors use diverse ways and different types of images to diagnose skin cancer or other skin conditions.""

Though showing promising research results, PanDerm is currently in the evaluation phase before broader healthcare implementation.

The team plans to establish standardised protocols for cross-demographic assessments and further investigate the model's performance in varied clinical settings, with a particular focus on ensuring equitable performance across different patient populations and healthcare environments.

The research led by AI and machine learning experts at Monash University also included collaboration with researchers and clinicians at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Alfred Health, Medical University of Vienna, NVIDIA AI Technology Centre in Singapore, University of Florence, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW Health Pathology and Hospital General Universitario de Alicante in Spain. 

The research is published in Nature Medicine.

Shift Bioscience (Shift), a biotechnology company uncovering the biology of cell rejuvenation to develop new therapies for age driven diseases, today announced the publication of new research identifying a novel, single-gene target for cellular rejuvenation. Capable of reversing cellular aging across multiple cell types, without inducing dangerous pluripotency pathways seen in other approaches, SB000 is well positioned as a target for safer, next-generation cell rejuvenation therapeutics, with broad application across age-driven diseases.

Existing approaches to cell rejuvenation primarily focus on the Yamanaka Factors (OSKM), a combination of genes that can be used to reverse cellular aging but are known to induce pluripotency that may result in tumorigenesis, limiting their use in a therapeutic setting. In this seminal study, SB000 demonstrated cellular rejuvenation at both methylome and transcriptome levels across multiple cell types without evidence of pluripotency. Not only is this approach safer when compared to OSKM, it also demonstrated comparable methylome rejuvenation, consistently across multiple cell types.

The discovery of SB000 marks a major milestone, both for Shift and for the cell rejuvenation field more broadly, and demonstrates the power of our unique, dataset-driven approach to target identification. Offering comparable efficacy to the Yamanaka Factors without the safety concerns associated with pluripotency, SB000 is well positioned as a target for next-generation, safer cellular rejuvenation therapeutics, helping us bring about a future where we have substantial control over the aging process and age-related diseases. We are pleased to progress SB000 on to proof-of-concept studies and expect this paper to be the first in a series of publications as we uncover the previously hidden biology of cellular ageing and rejuvenation.""

Dr Daniel Ives, CEO, Shift Bioscience

Shift Bioscience will now proceed with further studies to progress SB000 as a therapeutic target, including research to confirm efficacy across an even broader range of disease-relevant cell types, and to advance to in vivo proof-of-concept rejuvenation studies.

Taking antipsychotic medications as prescribed lowers the risk of a car crash for drivers with schizophrenia, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250020.

Schizophrenia can cause hallucinations and disorganized behaviour that affect the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. Most people with schizophrenia are prescribed antipsychotic medications that improve many of these symptoms. Researchers hypothesized that these medications may also reduce the risk of a motor vehicle crash - but only if patients continue to take the medication as prescribed.

Dr. John A. Staples and colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, used 20 years of population-based health and driving data to examine 1130 motor vehicle crashes involving drivers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and prior treatment with antipsychotics. They found that taking antipsychotic medication as prescribed significantly reduced the odds of a crash.

We found that perfect adherence to antipsychotic medication (relative to complete nonadherence) was associated with a 50% reduction in the odds of a crash. We believe our results suggest that antipsychotic medications reduce crash risk among individuals with schizophrenia.""

Dr. John A. Staples, University of British Columbia

The findings have important implications.

""Our results provide one more reason for doctors and family members to encourage people with schizophrenia to take their antipsychotics as prescribed. We think our results also suggest that health systems should put more resources into programs to support antipsychotic adherence among people with schizophrenia,"" says Dr. Staples.

He adds, ""If a driver with schizophrenia isn't taking their medications as prescribed, should their driver's licence be temporarily suspended? This approach deserves some consideration. But we also know that people with schizophrenia are often marginalized, with limited opportunities for employment and social engagement. Taking away their driver's licence might make them more isolated. We think more research is needed so that policy-makers can understand these risks before enacting a policy that might be coercive or harmful.""

With the advent of extensive 3D biology studies, we are at a pivotal moment in transitioning from 2D biology-based research to more accurate and reliable 3D models.

Image Credit: S. Singha/Shutterstock.com

The shift towards utilizing complex organ-like structures developed from stem cells or tissue samples is becoming essential; these organoid models are leading the way to next-generation, animal-free research methodologies.

Organoids show significant potential in various applications, including disease modeling, drug discovery and development, personalized medicine, cell biology processes, and genetic disease research. In the field of cancer research, there is particular interest in patient-derived organoids (PDOs), which are created using cells sourced from patient-derived samples such as biopsies and surgical resections.

Tumor heterogeneity and genetic variations within tumors challenge drug treatment strategies and often require multiple lines of therapy, which can lead to the development of resistant cell populations.

While several traditional in vitro assays exist for drug response studies, there is a growing need for improved combinations of 3D models, biological handling systems, and assays to better capture the complexity of in vivo conditions.

These improvements should address common pain points such as timely handling of complex 3D models, scaling up workflows, automating assay steps, enhancing data acquisition, and enabling deeper analysis for therapeutic drug discovery.

In this article, colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids were chosen as the model system for drug response studies, using established anti-cancer compounds to evaluate the effectiveness of robotics-based assay development.

The BioAssemblyBot® 400 (BAB400) was utilized to automate CRC dome assays, allowing for standardized processing and uniform distribution of patient-derived CRC organoids. The organoids were cultured and treated over a six-day period, during which an image-based endpoint assay was conducted to analyze drug responses.

The BAB400 pipette hand was employed to dispense organoids into Matrigel® domes. Subsequently, organoid cultures were monitored over a six-day period through imaging for time-course observation and endpoint assays.

Researchers from University of California San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that children living with multiple sclerosis (MS) show signs of accelerated biological aging, even in their teenage years. The research published online recently in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, is the first to examine whether MS causes early aging in a pediatric population - offering new insight into the disease and its long-term progression.

We found evidence that children living with MS experience accelerated biological aging. Compared to young people without MS, youth with MS had evidence of accelerated epigenetic age, a measurement of DNA chemical modifications associated with aging. We know that aging is related to the development of a less treatable form of MS and that adults with MS face both normal aging and accelerated aging from the disease.""

Jennifer S. Graves, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study, professor and vice chair of neurosciences and division chief of neuroimmunology at UC San Diego

MS is a lifelong autoimmune disease that attacks the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The research team used DNA methylation markers - molecular changes that indicate biological age - to analyze blood samples from 125 children with MS and 145 children without MS. In contrast to chronological age, which reflects the number of birthdays, biological age tracks how quickly the body is wearing down on a cellular level.

The study focused on children and teenagers not yet impacted by the processes of normal aging and age-related illnesses like hypertension and diabetes. Despite appearing outwardly healthy, children with MS showed DNA patterns indicating they were biologically older than their peers.

The researchers found differences in four different epigenetic clocks and signs of accelerated aging in MS patients in models of two clocks most sensitive to health-related stress and inflammation. Epigenetic clocks are age-predicting algorithms that calculate epigenetic age as an estimate of chronological age or age-associated clinical events such as disease or all-cause mortality. The most affected kids appeared to be aging up to two years faster biologically than their healthy peers, even though their average chronological age was just 15.

Biological age has already been linked to disability progression in adults with MS. This study suggests the process may start much earlier than previously thought, potentially even before visible symptoms of progression appear. And that could change the way MS is treated.

""This is a whole new concept in MS,"" said Graves. ""Aging isn't something we think of affecting teenagers. But these kids are accumulating cellular damage that may not show up clinically until years later, when they suddenly transition from doing fine to disease progression in their 30s. It is a significant finding to see this accelerated aging in children. If we can understand the interplay between the immune system, the brain and aging - and break that open - we might be able to put MS into full remission in the future.""

The researchers hope future studies will track patients over time to see how early biological aging contributes to long-term disability. They also plan to explore how social stressors, obesity and environmental exposures may accelerate aging in children with MS, especially given the higher prevalence of pediatric MS among lower-income families.

Additional co-authors on the study include: Christopher Goyne, M.D. and Ashley Fair at UC San Diego; Defne Yilmaz, M.S. and Lisa F. Barcellos, Ph.D. at UC Berkeley; Jonathan Race, Ph.D., Allison Schuette, M.S., T. Charles Casper, Ph.D. at University of Utah; Stacy Caillier, John Rose, M.D. and ​​Emmanuelle L. Waubant, M.D., Ph.D. from UCSF; Gregory Aaen, M.D. from Loma Linda University; Aaron Abrams, M.D. and Mary R. Rensel, M.D. from the Cleveland Clinic; Leslie Benson, M.D., Tanuja Chitnis, M.D. and Mark Gorman, Ph.D. from Brigham and Women's Hospital; ​​Timothy Lotze, M.D. from Texas Children's Hospital; Lauren Krupp, M.D. from NYU Langone Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center; Soe Mar, M.D. from Washington University in St. Louis; Jayne Ness, M.D. Ph.D. from The University of Alabama at Birmingham; Manuel Rodriguez, M.D, Jan-Mendelt Tillema, M.D. and Yolanda Wheeler, Ph.D., from the Mayo Clinic; Teri Schreiner, M.D. from University of Colorado; and ​​Amy T. Waldman from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","As cannabis users age, health risks appear to grow","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250609/As-cannabis-users-age-health-risks-appear-to-grow.aspx","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 10:38:00 GMT","

Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California-San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.

""She had problems falling asleep, and she'd wake up in the middle of the night,"" he said. ""So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies"" — edible cannabis candies.

""She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,"" Han said.

Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then one more — a total of four over several hours.

Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to ""start low; go slow,"" beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.

The woman started experiencing intense anxiety and heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia. Frightened, she went to an emergency room.

Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined the woman wasn't having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she'd grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took?

""As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,"" Han said. ""Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.""

Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia now allow cannabis use for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as the district, recreational use is also legal. As older adults' use climbs, ""the benefits are still unclear,"" Han said. ""But we're seeing more evidence of potential harms.""

A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons: to relieve chronic pain, insomnia, or mental health issues, though evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said.

In an analysis of national survey data published June 2 in the medical journal JAMA, Han and his colleagues reported that ""current"" cannabis use (defined as use within the previous month) had jumped among adults age 65 or older to 7% of respondents in 2023, from 4.8% in 2021. In 2005, he pointed out, fewer than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous year.

What's driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the perceived risk of cannabis use has declined. One national survey found that a growing proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that ""these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.""

The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls ""wisdom"" customers, 55 or older. Rise Dispensaries ran a yearlong cannabis education and empowerment program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary.

The industry has many satisfied older customers. Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson's disease. ""I'd frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,"" she said. ""It makes you crazy.""

Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn't help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects. ""I don't worry about sleep anymore,"" she said. ""I've solved a lifelong problem.""

But studies in the United States and Canada, which legalized nonmedical cannabis use for adults nationally in 2018, show climbing rates of cannabis-related health care use among older people, both in outpatient settings and in hospitals.

In California, for instance, cannabis-related emergency room visits by those 65 or older rose, to 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019 from about 21 in 2005. In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2021, and more than 26 times among those 65 and up.

""It's not reflective of everyone who's using cannabis,"" cautioned Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. ""It's capturing people with more severe patterns.""

But since other studies have shown increased cardiac risk among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, ""there's a number of warning signals,"" he said.

For example, a disturbing proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis screen positive for cannabis use disorder, a recent JAMA Network Open study found.

As with other substance use disorders, such patients ""can tolerate high amounts,"" said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. ""They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations"" and may experience withdrawal if they stop.

Among 4,500 older veterans (with an average age of 73) seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, researchers found that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the previous 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for mild, moderate, or severe cannabis use disorder, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance misuse and have ""higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD"" that could lead to self-medication, she said.

Current VA policies don't require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.

Moreover, ""there's increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,"" said Myran, citing his team's study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals.

Compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, research shows these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of that for the general population.

Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had a 23% higher dementia risk than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.

None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn't specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information.

""It's very frustrating that we're not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption, and on amounts of use that seem lower-risk,"" Myran said. ""It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.""

Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products compared with the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.

""If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn't use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,"" he said. ""Because that is true of all medicines.""

Immunotherapy is gaining traction as a prominent approach to cancer treatment. These therapies encompass the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor-engineered T-cells (CAR T-cells), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other genetically modified T-cells to specifically target cancer cells.

While significant progress has been made with immunotherapy for blood cancers, its effectiveness in treating solid tumors remains limited.

A key factor contributing to this low success rate is the solid tumor microenvironment (TME), where suppressive cytokines hinder the tumor-killing capacity of T-cells. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the role of the TME in T-cell responses to develop more effective cancer therapies.

The advantages of using three-dimensional (3D) patient-derived organoids (PDOs) stem from their ability to replicate the physical and chemical cues of the tumor microenvironment (TME)—factors that are absent in traditional 2D monolayer cultures.

Research indicates that PDOs respond to drugs in ways that closely mirror the responses of the original tumors, highlighting their potential to improve therapeutic outcomes.

As physiologically and pathologically relevant cancer models, PDOs better capture the key characteristics of primary tumors. This makes them a more suitable platform than 2D models for evaluating the effectiveness of T-cell–mediated killing.

Despite the advantages associated with PDOs, substantial obstacles hinder their widespread implementation in drug discovery. The production of organoids is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor. Furthermore, organoid culture requires specialized manual skills, leading to significant variability among operators.

To address the challenges associated with large-scale applications of PDOs, a semi-automated bioprocess has been developed for the large-scale expansion of assay-ready organoids. 

In the study discussed here, a method to evaluate T-cell invasion in solid tumors using PDOs was devised.

Utilizing bioreactor-expanded patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids (CRCs), activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with CellTracker and introduced to CRCs (stained with MitoTracker) in a 96-well microtiter plate, with monitoring occurring every four hours for three days via a high-content imager.

To quantify T-cell invasion, an image analysis method to measure the distance of each T-cell to the nearest organoid was established. The findings indicated that stimulated T-cells demonstrated a shorter interaction distance compared to non-stimulated T-cells. These results highlight the utility of bioreactor-expanded organoids in large-scale T-cell-based screening assays.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI tool predicts acute child malnutrition up to six months in advance","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250609/AI-tool-predicts-acute-child-malnutrition-up-to-six-months-in-advance.aspx","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 16:49:00 GMT","

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that predicts acute child malnutrition up to six months in advance could help combat the condition in Kenya and across Africa, nearly half of deaths among children under five linked to acute undernutrition - most of them in low- and middle-income countries - according to the World Health Organization.

However, gaps in data can make it difficult to know where to focus resources in countries like Kenya.

Five per cent of children in Kenya are acutely malnourished, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic Health Survey, a level considered a public health concern.

Scientists have come up with a machine learning model that uses clinical health data and satellite imagery to forecast malnutrition trends across the country.

The tool was developed by a team from the University of Southern California (USC), in collaboration with Microsoft's AI for Good Research Lab, Amref Health Africa, and Kenya's Ministry of Health.

Lead researcher Laura Ferguson, director of research at the USC Institute on Inequalities in Global Health, says the goal is to equip health authorities with early warnings that support effective prevention and treatment responses.

""The tool is designed to predict malnutrition across counties in Kenya [and]… prepare prevention and treatment strategies,"" Ferguson told SciDev.Net.

To make these forecasts, the model pulls data from the government's District Health Information Software System (DHIS2) and combines it with satellite imagery to pinpoint where and when malnutrition is likely to occur.

Unlike traditional models that depend solely on historical trends, this AI tool integrates clinical data from more than 17,000 Kenyan health facilities.

It achieved 89 per cent accuracy for one-month predictions and 86 per cent accuracy over six months, marking a significant improvement over baseline models.

The tool can also integrate publicly available data on agricultural vegetation derived from satellite imagery into the model, to indicate available food sources, Ferguson added.

Encouraged by the results in Kenya, the researchers hope the tool can be adapted for use in nearly 125 other countries that also use DHIS2 — particularly in the 80 low- and middle-income nations where malnutrition remains a leading cause of child mortality.

""This model is a game-changer,"" said Bistra Dilkina, associate professor of computer science and co-director of the USC Center for AI in Society.

""By using data-driven AI models, you can capture more complex relationships between multiple variables that work together to help us predict malnutrition more accurately,"" she explained.

To maximise the impact of the tool, collaboration across sectors is key, says Samuel Mburu, head of digital transformation at Amref Health Africa, who also worked on the project. He suggests aligning health services with agriculture and disaster management efforts.

""Continued investment in digital health infrastructure and training is also critical,"" Mburu told SciDev.Net.

Peter Ofware, Kenya country director for Helen Keller International, a US-based non-profit focused on nutrition and health, agrees that integrating vegetation data with DHIS2 improves forecasting accuracy.

""This improves the accuracy of forecasts,"" said Ofware, who did not participate in the research.

""However, DHIS data, which is their primary source, has many limitations in quality —especially for malnutrition.""

Children are typically only screened for malnutrition in facilities where treatment is available, which limits how representative the data is, he added.

CARY, N.C. – Star power will be on display in The Soccer Tournament's women's and men's championship games, where $2 million total will be up for grabs in a doubleheader on Monday, June 9, at WakeMed Soccer Park.

Both the men's and women's championship can be seen live on ESPNU as well as ESPN+.

The second annual $1 million women's bracket championship will see US Women, led by former U.S. national team stars Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger, and Heather O'Reilly face off against Bumpy Pitch FC at 7:00 p.m. ET. The men's championship between Bumpy Pitch FC and Pumas de Alabama will follow at 8:30 p.m. Both matches can be seen live on ESPNU and ESPN+.

Looking to defend their 2024 women's tournament title, US Women have reloaded with more U.S. women's national team stars, and five current players from the University of North Carolina. After joining the US Women staff in 2024, Carli Lloyd decided to lace up the boots this year, making her first competitive appearance since retiring in 2021. Lloyd has scored two goals in five games, including the game-winner in Target Score Time against Streetball FC Canada in the quarterfinals.

Bumpy Pitch FC is the first team in TST history to have a men's and a women's team advance to the $1 Million Championship game.

Bumpy Pitch's women's roster features a number of collegiate stars, including players from Florida State University, Stanford University, and other top universities.

On the men's side, the lifestyle brand has assembled a squad of Major Arena Soccer League players, and is led by Cristian Martinez Borja, the Colombian who leads the race for the TST Golden Boot.

Bumpy Pitch FC's opponent in the men's championship, Pumas de Alabama, is a rising force in the U.S. amateur soccer scene. Their roster features a number of players from 2024 TST Champions La Bombonera.

Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups.

U.S. Men's National Team standout Weston McKennie defended teammate Christian Pulisic on Monday after Landon Donovan made indirect comments toward the current captain.

While commentating Portugal's celebration after the team won the UEFA Nations League final Sunday on Fox Sports, Donovan said, “This is what it means to represent your country. … I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

While Donovan didn't name Pulisic, it's clear the former USMNT captain was referring to the latest one. Pulisic decided to take the summer off after two straight 50-match seasons with AC Milan instead of joining the national team for the Concacaf Gold Cup later this month. Donovan, himself, also took a brief sabbatical from the team in 2013.

“Obviously, none of us take for granted playing for the national team. None of us want to lose games,"" McKennie told USA TODAY Sports on Monday, from Juventus headquarters in Italy preparing for the Club World Cup. ""All of us want to compete. And for me, it's a little bit, I won't say sad, but as a former national team player, I think as a national team player pool – previous, present – I think it's more about trying to build or even say something like that to a person directly rather than putting it out there.

“That's just my opinion because we've all been through those moments, even when comments about us losing the Nations League were made by many players from before, but they've had the same thing on a bigger stage with not qualifying for the World Cup.”

McKennie is also not participating with the USMNT this summer to help Juventus compete in the FIFA Club World Cup. Juventus is in Group G of the tournament and will play Al Ain (United Arab Emirates) on June 18 in Washington D.C., Wydad AC (Morrocco) on June 22 in Philadelphia, and Manchester City (England) on June 26 in Orlando during the group stage.

Still, McKennie is keeping an eye on his teammates with the national team led by new coach Mauricio Pochettino.

The USMNT lost a friendly to Turkey 2-1 on June 7 in East Hartford, Connecticut. The Americans will play Trinidad and Tobago on June 15, Saudi Arabia on June 19 and Haiti on June 22 in the group stage of the Gold Cup.

McKennie believes the USMNT has a good group of players who are ambitious with room to grow before World Cup 2026, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. He believes the team needs to find its identity by practicing in a competitive environment.

“You fight for each other. You run for each other. You sacrifice for each other,” McKennie said. “I think with the group that we have and some of the players that have been there a little bit longer, including myself, need to start not thinking that we're young anymore. We're veterans on the team, and we need to start acting like that. And take control.

""And show the way, and show the culture that the U.S. men's national team has presented before because we've always been known as a country to fight, never give up, maybe not have been the best talented-wise. But now we have a lot more talent. And so now, we just need to add that grit and grind, and competitive nature back into the system.”

As for Donovan's comments, McKennie sided with Pulisic while reiterating their desire to suit up for the national team because of its significance.

“No names were named,” McKennie said. “Coming off a long season, a stressful season, obviously, some players feel a different way about it, and some players feel another way. But the comments are comments. Everyone has their own opinions, and that's life, and that's football.

“Obviously, like I said before, none of us take for granted that we get to represent a national team because it's one of the biggest honors that we can have in the sport of football. ...

“So, any chance that we get, we want to play. But obviously, if you don't feel like your body is in the right condition, and you don't feel like your body is in the best form or shape or whatever, to be able to do that at 100%, and you feel like you're risking injury, then it's better to let someone else go in that is completely 100%.”","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

The US men's national team host Switzerland Tuesday night in their 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup send-off match at Nashville SC's GEODIS Park.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's 27-man roster includes 16 players from Major League Soccer, giving veterans and rising stars alike the chance to impress against a high-level European opponent before facing continental foes.

After this friendly, the USMNT begin their Gold Cup group on June 15 against Trinidad & Tobago at San Jose's PayPal Park.

Pochettino & Co. will seek a bounce-back performance after falling to Türkiye, 2-1, on Saturday in the program's first match since finishing fourth in the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League.

Despite the setback, several players boosted their USMNT profile – most notably Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Jack McGlynn, who opened the scoring less than a minute in with a stunning left-footed strike.

Saturday's match also marked the senior international debuts of New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese, Orlando City fullback Alex Freeman, and Philadelphia Union homegrowns Quinn Sullivan and Nathan Harriel.

Switzerland are ranked 20th in the FIFA World Rankings, a year after reaching the UEFA Euro 2024 quarterfinals and just under three months before beginning their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign.

Coached by former Swiss international defender Murat Yakin, the Rossocrociati defeated Mexico, 4-2, on Saturday in their first friendly of the June international window.

Breel Embolo, Zeki Amdouni, Dan Ndoye and Fabian Rieder all scored for Switzerland, who hope to make it two straight wins against co-hosts of next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

...

It's a new week, which means new drama for the U.S. men's national team. And this time, Christian Pulisic's father, Mark, is getting involved.

In the wake of the USMNT star's absence from the Gold Cup roster, Pulisic has been subjected to criticism from all sides of the U.S. soccer community. Pulisic — who was coming off a career year at AC Milan — had asked head coach Mauricio Pochettino to leave him off the Gold Cup roster in order to rest and recover this summer.

Yet, the Gold Cup represents the final competitive tournament the USMNT will have before next year's World Cup. It is also the last remaining extended training camp together. And with a new coach trying to implement his system, it was a terrible look for Pulisic to ask for it off.

On Sunday, Landon Donovan watched as a 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo helped lead Portugal to a UEFA Nations League title — a newer tournament with little prestige relative to other UEFA events. But the fact that the top Spain and Portugal players were willing to play for their national teams in that when USMNT players opted to skip the Gold Cup — well, it had Donovan frustrated.

Donovan said of Ronaldo:

""He's tired. He's out there grinding. Hurt himself in the process, and I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

It was an obvious swipe at Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Antonee Robinson who all are skipping the Gold Cup without injuries or Club World Cup obligations. Mark Pulisic saw those comments, and he put together the most Soccer Dad response.

In an Instagram post of a ChatGPT screenshot, Mark asked for information about Donovan's sabbatical in 2012. The post was liked by Christian as well.

Back then, Donovan wanted time away from the game to focus on his mental health. He had already played a major role in three World Cup runs for the USMNT, but then-head coach Jurgen Klinsmann held the absence against Donovan and left him off the 2014 World Cup roster.

Donovan notably did not skip out on his team during the last competitive opportunity before a World Cup. He took part in World Cup qualifying matches in the lead-up to 2014 and participated in the 2013 Gold Cup. He was on the final squad for friendlies before the shocking revelation that he was left off the roster heading to Brazil.

Pulisic's situation is entirely different, and it was yet another poor display from a USMNT parent to use the sabbatical against Donovan.

And judging from the ""like,"" Christian doesn't recognize that difference either.

A war of words appears to have erupted on social media between former U.S. Men's National Team forward Taylor Twellman and team legend Landon Donovan, in the wake of the latter's latest criticism of the current generation of stars.

The USMNT's 2-1 friendly loss to Turkey on Saturday, their third in a row under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, clearly left a sour taste in Donovan's mouth. During later coverage of Portugal's dramatic Nations League Final win over Spain, Donovan pointed to the dedication and fight of Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. as something he felt the USMNT was missing.

""This is what it means to represent your country,"" he said on FOX Sports. ""And if you don't want to take this, as a professional soccer player and someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in.

""This is what it means. He's (Ronaldo) 40 years old, he played a long a-- season, he was out there grinding and hurt himself in the process. And I can't help but think about some of our (USMNT) guys on vacation right now not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's p------ me off.""

While Donovan abstained from naming specific players he took issue with, it seems highly likely he was referring, at the very least, to Christian Pulisic, who is absent from the USMNT's summer roster as per his request for a break. Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Yunus Musah was also made unavailable for selection for unspecified personal reasons, while Fulham's Antonee Robinson was also made unavailable and has since undergone minor surgery.

Donovan's on-air comments went down poorly with his former USMNT teammate turned broadcaster Taylor Twellman, who subsequently took to social media to criticize the LA Galaxy legend.

“While I agree with a lot of what Landon Donovan said about playing for your country, we can't forget that his “sabbatical” during WCQ nonetheless led to him being left off the World Cup roster in 2014,” he wrote, including a link to an article which covered former USMNT boss Jurgen Klinsmann's comments on Donovan's costly absence.

“He needed a break and Klinsmann didn't forget. Many at the time were wondering why and how was this happening in the moment. But it did. I gave LD the benefit of the doubt as I will with the current players….”

Twellman's comments, which Donovan has yet to respond to, came shortly after the four-time MLS Cup winner admitted when speaking with fellow ex-international Tim Howard that his break from USMNT soccer came at a point in life where he was close to suffering a mental breakdown.

“I got in 2013, I had played probably 14 straight years of 11 plus months of soccer. 40-plus games a year. And I don't, I've have never said this publicly, but I was on the verge, and I think I've mentioned this to you, I was on the verge of a real breakdown where it could have got scary for me,” Donovan explained on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast, when prefacing his criticism of Pulisic's absence.

Donovan went on to add that should there be serious issues behind the scenes for any missing players, such as Pulisic, he sympathised. However, as there was no evidence to suggest this was the case, he added, “I'm going to assume for sake of this conversation, that's not going on, but I am admitting I could be wrong with that.”

He then went on to criticize Pulisic for requesting a break whilst simultaneously continuing to play for Milan in what was a largely meaningless season-ending game.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Christian Pulisic's dad hits out at Landon Donovan over controversial USMNT absence","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/christian-pulisic-landon-donovan-dad-1197760","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 17:08:00 GMT","

Landon Donovan's latest criticism of Christian Pulisic appears to have hit a nerve within the AC Milan star's family, with his dad Mark now having come out swinging.

U.S. Men's National Team legend Donovan called out “players who chose to skip the Gold Cup,” with Christian being the highest profile player to have done so, during FOX Sports' broadcast of Portugal's recent Nations League Final triumph over Spain.

After Cristiano Ronaldo helped his side secure the title on penalties following a 2-2 draw, Donovan cited the former Real Madrid star's passion as an example of what he felt was missing from the current USMNT, which lost 2-1 to Turkey on Saturday.

""This is what it means to represent your country,"" Donovan said. ""And if you don't want to take this, as a professional soccer player and someone who gets the opportunity to wear that jersey and take it seriously and responsibly, then don't come in.

""This is what it means. He's (Ronaldo) 40 years old, he played a long a-- season, he was out there grinding and hurt himself in the process. And I can't help but think about some of our (USMNT) guys on vacation right now not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's p------ me off.""

While Donovan may not have named Christian, he has previously been critical of the Milan midfielder's request for a summer break, and it seems clear this latest dig was likely at least partially aimed at the 26-year-old.

But it appears that Christian's inner circle has heard enough, with his dad Mark having taken to social media to fire back at Donovan. In a post on Instagram, he shared a screenshot seemingly asking an AI chat why Donovan previously took a sabbatical, seemingly in reference to his break from international soccer in early 2013.

“Landon Donovan took his sabbatical because he was feeling both physically and mentally exhausted after years of intense competition and the pressure that comes with being a top athlete,” the response read.

“He'd been playing professionally from a young age and had participated in multiple World Cups, so he felt the need to step back and take some time for himself. This break allowed him to rest, travel, and ultimately return to the game with a refreshed mindset.”

Mark captioned this screenshot, “This guy is .. talking about commitment.. look in the mirror + grow a pair and call names out or are you afraid next time you want an interview you will get rejected again.” What's more, Christian then appeared to ‘like' the post.

As for Donovan, he recently opened up on his Unfiltered Soccer podcast, which he co-hosts with Tim Howard, on exactly what drove his decision to take a break in 2013, admitting that he was close to a “breakdown.”

“I got in 2013, I had played probably 14 straight years of 11 plus months of soccer. 40-plus games a year,” he said. “And I don't, I have never said this publicly, but I was on the verge, and I think I've mentioned this to you, I was on the verge of a real breakdown where it could have got scary for me.”

Chelsea and Manchester City are the two English teams in the 2025 Club World Cup, with Premier League champions Liverpool not eligible.

Both Chelsea and City secured their places by winning the Champions League between 2021 and 2024.

Clubs from Europe were given 12 of the 32 places at this summer's tournament.

Four were intended for the Champions League winners in the qualifying period - from 2020-2021 to 2023-24 - and eight to the next best teams in the competition.

As Real won two Champions Leagues in the four-year qualifying period, the nine best 'non-winners' were awarded Club World Cup qualification.

Only two teams from each nation are allowed to qualify - unless more won each continent's equivalent Champions League during the qualifying period.

As Chelsea and City both won the Champions League in the qualifying period, they have taken England's two spots.

Of teams not to win the Champions League between 2021 and 2024, Liverpool were the fifth-best performing team across Europe.

Red Bull Salzburg - the 15th best team not to win the Champions League - were the lowest-ranked side to be granted a spot in the Club World Cup.

Liverpool, RB Leipzig, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and AC Milan all finished higher than Salzburg, but all come from countries from which two sides had already qualified.

While Chelsea will play at the Club World Cup, Liverpool will not

EPL

FIFA Club World Cup champions in 2022, Chelsea are relishing the chance to make history by winning the first edition of Gianni Infantino's expanded tournament in the United States.

Group D opponents Los Angeles FC, Flamengo and Esperance de Tunis will inspire little fear in Enzo Maresca's expensively assembled squad, but even if they match expectations and advance as winners, the degree of difficulty will rise sharply in the knockout stage for a club emerging from two seasons outside the UEFA Champions League.

Chelsea are determined to show the best version of themselves in the Club World Cup, and not just because of the lucrative financial rewards on offer. This tournament also presents a golden opportunity to reclaim their seat at elite club football's top table after a bumpy few years.

Follow the Club World Cup on The Athletic this summer…

A stirring end to the season has Chelsea feeling very good about themselves as they head to the United States.

Maresca's young team ground out the results they needed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the Premier League campaign, then justified their status as overwhelming favourites to win the UEFA Conference League with a comprehensive dismantling of Real Betis in the final in Wroclaw.

Chelsea's group stage opposition at the Club World Cup may remind them of the level of team they faced in the Conference League en route to beating Betis. It will certainly be closer to that than to the weekly examinations that Maresca's side encounter in the Premier League, which may allow them to ease their way into their best rhythm.

It would be foolish to discount Chelsea as threats to win the competition — this is a club who have won every major domestic and European honour and their golden age lasted for much of the first quarter of this century. But with different owners, a relatively inexperienced coach and the youngest squad in the competition, they are best classified as fringe contenders.

Chelsea qualified for this summer's Club World Cup by lifting the Champions League in May 2021. That triumph in Porto feels like a lifetime ago, given just how much has happened at Stamford Bridge since: sanctions, a club sale and an almost total overhaul on and off the pitch. Club captain Reece James is the only surviving member of that team in Maresca's squad.

In the first three years of its ownership, the consortium led by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly has moved fast and broken things. Virtually every trace of the Roman Abramovich era has gone and the revolution has been painful, with Chelsea plummeting to 12th in the Premier League in 2022-23 and finishing sixth in 2023-24 while spending aggressively on transfers.

A fourth-placed finish this season, coupled with a first trophy for Clearlake and Boehly to celebrate, creates the impression that the new Chelsea that will grace the Club World Cup stage is ready to compete again, even if it looks nothing like the old one.

Chelsea play a Pep Guardiola-influenced style: a possession-focused, positional game. The nominal starting formation is a standard 4-3-3 but one of Maresca's full-backs will usually ‘invert', often into the base of midfield and sometimes into one of the attacking half-spaces.

In possession, the goal is for Chelsea to arrange themselves with a three-man defence and a three-man attack with a midfield box between them, creating the possibility for overloads around opposing formations. The goalkeeper is also encouraged to act as an '11th outfielder' in possession to facilitate playing out through and around pressure.

Maresca's aim is to control games by creating numerical superiority on the ball.



Maresca has risen fast to the Chelsea job. A midfielder who enjoyed a decorated but nomadic playing career, he was encouraged to go into coaching by Manuel Pellegrini when the two men were at Malaga in 2011. Seven years later, Pellegrini got Maresca on to a Premier League touchline, hiring the Italian as part of his backroom staff at West Ham United.

No wonder, then, that Maresca still calls Pellegrini his “professional dad”. Guardiola, however, has been every bit as impactful on his coaching journey, both in the season Maresca spent coaching Manchester City's elite development squad to the Premier League 2 title in 2020-21 and in Maresca's experience as Guardiola's assistant in the 2022-23 treble-winning campaign.

Those stints at City bookended a short, failed spell as coach of Parma and primed Maresca for his next opportunity to strike out on his own. He made the most of it, guiding Leicester City to promotion from the Championship as title winners in 2023-24 and attracting admirers among the Chelsea hierarchy in the process.

Maresca was a bold choice to succeed Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge, and his first season at Chelsea had plenty of challenges — not least the open hostility of supporters less than enamoured with his style of play at times. But he delivered a top-four Premier League finish and a trophy, and comes into the Club World Cup in a strong position.

He may have looked out of sorts for much of 2025, but Cole Palmer remains the undisputed star of this Chelsea team.

That reality was underlined by his thrilling assists for the two goals that turned the Conference League final on its head: the first a beautiful in-swinging cross with his left foot on to the head of Enzo Fernandez, the second a brilliant turn followed by a pinpoint delivery with his right to meet Nicolas Jackson's run to the near post.

“I was just sick of getting the ball and going backwards and sideways,” Palmer explained after the match. He is the only Chelsea player capable of changing a game simply at his whim.

There are a number of candidates given the youth of Chelsea's squad, but the player most supporters will be intrigued to watch in the U.S. is Andrey Santos. The dynamic Brazilian has blossomed on loan at BlueCo sister club Strasbourg and could bring some much-needed physicality and goal threat to Maresca's midfield.

Chelsea fans have cultivated a vibrant repertoire of songs about their team, individual players and rival clubs over their long history. One particularly rousing supporter anthem is Carefree, bellowed to the tune of the English hymn Lord of the Dance':

Carefree, wherever you may be, 

We are the famous CFC, 

And we don't give a f**k, 

Whoever you may be, 

Cos we are the famous CFC.

Four years ago, when The Athletic asked this precise question of Chelsea fans on X, the answer was emphatic, with Tottenham Hotspur garnering 58.6 per cent of the vote.

Spurs serve both as Chelsea's favourite punchline and their preferred punching bag. It's one of football's stranger rivalries that dates back to the 1960s, when Tottenham — with the help of Chelsea youth products Jimmy Greaves and Terry Venables — triumphed in a 1967 FA Cup final meeting and were seen as the more glamorous and successful club.

The roles have long since reversed, but the animosity endures.

Chelsea were the first club (along with Arsenal) to wear numbered shirts for a league match, against Swansea Town on August 25, 1928.

Chelsea have not been the neutral's easiest choice since the 1990s, when they charmed with Gianfranco Zola and a cosmopolitan collective of charismatic veterans. Abramovich's disruptive billions instead made them compelling villains and the vast transfer spending of Clearlake and Boehly has done little to endear them to anyone not affiliated with Stamford Bridge.

But if you want a reason to cheer for Chelsea, just watch Palmer. His nonchalant genius is of the Gianfranco Zola lineage, and forms the essence of why football is worth your time.

LAFC begin their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup campaign against English Premier League giants Chelsea on Monday, June 16 at Atlanta United's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

In Group D action, the Black & Gold will also face ES Tunis (Tunisia) at Nashville SC's GEODIS Park on June 20 before closing out the group stage at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida against Flamengo (Brazil) on June 24. The top two teams per group reach the knockout phase.

This summer's expanded Club World Cup features 32 teams from six confederations vying for silverware and portions of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. The final is set for July 13 at MetLife Stadium.

How they qualified: 2020-21 UEFA Champions League winners

A member of the traditional ""Big Six"" English clubs, Chelsea are among the most successful teams in the country with 35 major pieces of silverware. That includes a Club World Cup title in 2021, as well as lifting the 2025 UEFA Conference League in late May.

In the Premier League, Chelsea reclaimed a top-four spot after missing out on Champions League qualification in the previous two years. Head coach Enzo Maresca found a recipe for success during his first season in West London, building on the work of his predecessor and current USMNT manager, Mauricio Pochettino.

The Blues boast a star-studded squad, headlined by the likes of Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo. This summer, they acquired rising English striker Liam Delap from Ipswich Town for reportedly around $40.6 million.

How they qualified: FIFA Club World Cup play-in winners

LAFC were the last team to qualify for the Club World Cup, courtesy of their epic 2-1 comeback victory over LIGA MX powerhouse Club América in the play-in match. Denis Bouanga was the hero at BMO Stadium after Igor Jesus' late equalizer forced extra time.

Now, the Black & Gold will look to increase their global profile and chart a tournament run. This comes during Steve Cherundolo's final season in Los Angeles, with the head coach returning to Germany at season's end.

LAFC carry a 10-game unbeaten streak across all competitions (5W-0L-5D) and have seen Bouanga hit his stride after a slow start by the two-time Best XI forward's standards. Additionally, DP striker Olivier Giroud will aim to impress against his former club after spending several seasons at Chelsea.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Music superstars J Balvin, Doja Cat and Tems will perform a half-time show at the Club World Cup final in New Jersey next month, as football follows the example of the Super Bowl.

Colombian singer Balvin, US rapper Doja Cat and Nigerian star Tems will cram their performances into the 15-minute half-time break.

The line-up has been curated by Coldplay's Chris Martin, and the event will hope to emulate the success of the long-running Super Bowl half-time show, which has featured stars including Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna and The Weeknd in recent years.

Teams including Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain will take part in the tournament across the US from 15 June to 13 July.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: ""This show will be unforgettable - not just for its spectacle on a landmark night, but also for the lasting impact it will make.""

Previously an annual tournament contested by seven teams, the Club World Cup has been expanded to 32 teams and is aiming for an increased global profile.

Superstar player Lionel Messi will take part for US team Inter Miami, although the team's participation has raised some eyebrows.

There will be no Cristiano Ronaldo, though, who has declined offers to play for various teams. The 40-year-old is out of contract with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr at the end of June.

Swift said she was ""sad and grossed out"" when the music mogul bought the rights to her past work in 2019.

Ed Sheeran is also on the Louis Theroux podcast this week, and it's the finale of I Kissed a Boy.

Sabrina Carpenter, Haim, Wolf Alice and CMAT all also performed at the festival in Barcelona.

Isle of Wight Festival organiser John Giddings says artists need to be able to ""deliver"" to a crowd.

The former Beatle returns to his hometown of Liverpool to join Springsteen on stage at Anfield.

Doja Cat, Tems and J Balvin will headline the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup Final Halftime Show, with the sports organization and Global Citizen announcing Monday (June 9) that the three musicians will take the stage for one of the most-watched sporting events on Earth.

This year's final will take place July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., with the halftime show set to air live in a free broadcast on DAZN.com. The lineup was personally curated by Chris Martin of Coldplay to benefit FIFA Global Citizen's Education Fund, which launched in April with a mission to raise $100 million for children's education and soccer programs all over the world.

“From Medellín to MetLife — I'm honored to headline the first-ever halftime show of the FIFA Club World Cup final,” Balvin said in a statement. “It's a historic moment — for me, for Latin culture and for every kid who dreams big.”

Tems added, “We're going to bring the world together for a beautiful moment — to celebrate football, feel the unity that music brings and improve the lives of millions of children through the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund.”

The lineup reveal comes a couple of months after it was first announced that Martin would be spearheading the Super Bowl halftime show-esque concert, building on his history as the Global Citizen Festival's international curator. The nonprofit organization is producing the show in partnership with Live Nation, Done+Dusted and DPS.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino previously teased that the production would be the “best halftime show ever.”

“We're thinking big,” he added in a March interview with FOX 5. “We'll have 2 billion viewers from every corner of the world. It's like 20 times the Super Bowl. So, we are very excited about that. You have to watch it — that's the surprise. It will be global, different languages, different countries.”

Filed under:

It's non-stop. Real Madrid continue their season into June and July, without much rest, and a ton of injuries still lingering.

If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

These observations — where I look at Real Madrid's history, its players on loan, Castilla, tactical tidbits, and other relevant thoughts — are now a regular thing. All previous editions can be found here.





There is more football now than ever — with seemingly no end in sight. If anything, the number of games will increase before they decrease.

This season is unprecedented. Two additional Champions League games were added to the slate, and four if you were seeded into the playoff zones after the group stage. The first ever Club World Cup this summer will see 32 teams meet in the USA for more gruelling games — nearly one month of football — and for the bigger teams like Real Madrid, a likely long stay on US soil as the team progresses beyond the initial three games.

It's unclear what pre-season looks like after the Club World Cup, especially for teams that make it far in the tournament. The Premier League has rejected a request from teams to delay the start of next season in order to incorporate more rest and preparation. 

Per club sources, Real Madrid will not plan any pre-season games after the Club World Cup, stating “there is no time.” 

(There is a small chance this could change, but it's unlikely, and in the club's words, “it's too difficult”).

By Spring time every year, the pre-season schedule is made public. The Club World Cup is in a weird twilight zone — almost an extension of the current season rather than the start of a new one. The tournament wraps up mid-July, which is usually long before any pre-season even begins.

Part of scrapping pre-season games may come down to how seriously Real Madrid, and, other teams, will take the Club World Cup. What is seen as an annoying ‘extra' tournament, will likely go down as a big success, despite our complaints about the unnecessary amount of football on the calendar. There won't be any significant sporting events the tournament will be competing with for eyeballs. Every team will try to win. There is real prize money involved. Beyond money, there is real drive within Real Madrid to be the first-ever winners of the competition, setting the tone for it to be ‘their's' — much like the Champions League is.

If Real Madrid bounce from the tournament early (unlikely if they bring their A-team and A-game against inferior teams on paper), the club may arrange some last minute pre-season games, probably behind closed doors, within Spain before the season starts to get the blood pumping again before the 2025 - 2026 season gets underway. It will be a far-cry from pre-arranged tournaments with advanced ticket sales.

But the whole scenario does raise concerns about everyone's preparation for the following season. Last summer, most of Real Madrid's team barely had a pre-season, and some didn't have one at all. Last pre-season in the USA, during the Soccer Champions Tour, Real Madrid filled their team sheets with Castilla players. 

Nothing wrong with that — in fact it's welcome. But the South American stars joined late after Copa America, as did the Europeans after the Euros. Some, like Mbappe, didn't join at all. The team came out of the gates slow, unpolished, and without ample time to integrate Mbappe. Match fitness was lacking.

The introduction of the Club World Cup now adds something extra on ‘off years' where the are no international tournaments. Don't be surprised if the remaining rare summers where nothing is planned, FIFA or UEFA will eventually figure out a way to add something — introducing a revolving tournament every summer. 

What is the solution? FIFA or UEFA could work with teams to decrease games, but there is too much money involved, and the financial implications of gutting games from the calendar don't reflect well on the bottom line for executives higher up (and ‘smaller clubs' are generally ok with so many games that reward them financially. They need the money and relevancy more than big clubs do). Taking games off the slate means they'd likely have to charge more for remaining games. Offering / securing bigger TV deals to compensate for less games will likely mean the consumer will pay more for their package.

FIFA will also argue and urge clubs to use the money to build more depth and rotate more to combat more games. Fine. But are bigger squads, a dilution of stars, more games, and just a higher quantity of everything actually good for the sport overall? Does more quantity decrease the quality? 

It's impossible not to bring up the main argument against the overwhelming football schedule: deteriorating health. Football is heading into uncharted territory when it comes to dealing with such an astronomical number of ACL injuries.

In February, The Athletic reported that the number of ACL injuries has skyrocketed in the last decade, and, that this season was the worst in Premier League history:

“The average number (of ACL injuries) across the six seasons between 2017-18 and 2022-23 is just 6.3; between 2012-13 (when Premier Injuries' data collection began) and 2016-17, the average was 10.4,” Elias Burke of The Athletic wrote. “As it stands, the Premier League is on track to end the campaign with 13.” 

More games, more fatigue, and less time to recover can contribute to the rise of season-ending blows.

No one knows this better than Real Madrid. When Real Madrid lost all three of Eder Militao, David Alaba, and Thibaut Courtois early in the 2023 - 2024 season, Carlo Ancelotti said it was “unprecedented” in his coaching career. This season alone, Real Madrid lost Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao (again), and Joan Martinez to ACL tears. Fielding any sort of ‘Once de Gala' — especially over a the course of more than a couple games — has proven to be impossible in the last couple years.

Xabi Alonso won't have that luxury for months, literally. He will be without several important players due to injury this Club World Cup. Even if everyone returns before the season starts, Alonso will lose Jude Bellingham as the Englishman recovers from shoulder surgery. If we're lucky, we'll see Alonso's best XI sometime before Christmas. 

(The club has placed a big bet on winning the Club World Cup by delaying Bellingham's shoulder surgery. One realistic option was to shut him down the day after the league Clasico loss in May. Speaking to club sources over the past year, there was always a dilemma on how to deal with Bellingham's surgery. The moment he goes under the knife, there's a 2-3 month recovery process. He could potentially avoid the surgery altogether and play through the pain with a shoulder strap, but it affects his mobility and performance greatly. Had the surgery been done in May, he would've been back for the start of next season. Real Madrid's first three games in the Club World Cup are against teams they should beat with or without Bellingham — so really they're prioritizing a handful of knockout games over 10-12 La Liga games next season.)





“Constantly adding international matches and competitions has broken the calendar,” Jerome Perlemuter, General Secretary at World Leagues Association said in September. “We only have 365 days in a year, which means very simply that if you keep adding matches, at some point there is no more space – national leagues cannot organise their competitions properly anymore and players pay for it with injuries.”

This is one of those seemingly unfixable problems. If it was up to one league, one regime, you could enforce reform. But it's almost impossible with so many hands in the pot: FIFA, UEFA, Leagues, Federations — they all have their own set of fixtures they want to vomit on the calendar in return for financial gains. You'd have to almost erase everything and start the sport from scratch, or bring everyone together to consult on a unified solution — something difficult to do.

“It's important to remember FIFA organize about only 1% of the footballing calendar,” a spokesperson from FIFA told me for this story. “We are always looking at ways to work with teams and players and have conversations about maximizing players' health.”

FIFA feels most of the blame of the overwhelming football calendar, and the major injuries that come with it, are not down to them — but others.

“Some leagues in Europe — themselves competition organisers and regulators — are acting with commercial self-interest, hypocrisy, and without consideration to everyone else in the world,” FIFA said in July of 2024 in a statement in reply to FIFPro and 37 European Leagues jointly filed an antitrust complaint against FIFA. “Those leagues apparently prefer a calendar filled with friendlies and summer tours, often involving extensive global travel.”

But others argue that FIFA can still step in to regulate, and, unlike UEFA, have taken an authoritative, rather than collaborative approach.

“The problem of the overloaded calendar is not caused by league competitions, but by FIFA, with its new format and duration of the tournaments, and by UEFA with the Nations League and the new UEFA club competitions with the increased number of dates and games,” Luigi De Siervo, Serie A Chief Exeuctive said. “But the difference is that UEFA had a strong consultation with all the stakeholders — leagues included — and decided on a reform in the format of club competitions after a long discussion.

“FIFA imposed their new format and competitions without any discussion, consultation and without accepting to have any form of relationship with the other competitions organisers.”

You will never have a perfect solution to keep everyone happy. Smaller teams don't have the same complaints about their stars being worked into the ground, nor can they afford to say no to additional games. Bigger teams always ask for the biggest slice of the pie because of the marketability they bring to the table. League and Federation executives just want more of everything, namely: games and money.

Could European football adapt an NFL model? The NFL has a short blitz of games (17 games, around five months), and generates an astronomical amount of money. In 2023, the NFL generated $18.7 billion in revenue — far and away the most of any major North American sports league, as well as European football as a whole. They bring in a considerable amount through TV deals. The demand from loyal consumers is high. The NFL generates more than FIFA and the Premier League combined.

Real Madrid's pre-season planning dilemma won't be unique to them alone. Every team will have to endure the grind. PSG and Inter, the two Champions League Finalists Real Madrid may have to go through to win this summer's tournament, just finished their season May 31st. Inter are on their last lungs. PSG had nine players featuring in the UEFA Nations League Semi-finals, to varying degrees.

But as things stand, despite all the struggles in maintaining squad health amid a wild calendar, there is some optimism with regards to the squad heading to the USA this Saturday. Eder Militao, Dani Carvajal, and David Alaba completed part of the training in Xabi Alonso's first session as a Real Madrid manager. Antonio Rüdiger is making a push to return in time — though things look more grim for Eduardo Camavinga as of now. 

But Alonso will have time to train with the stars and most of the squad before the first game kicks off in Miami against Al-Hilal on June 18th. Real Madrid should have enough in the tank to win their first three games. Things will get really interesting once they get past those fixtures. If I had to guess, and this is a wild prediction based on the groups and potential seedings, Real Madrid could play Juventus in the round-of-16, River Plate in the quarter-finals, Chelsea in the semi-finals, and PSG in the final. (Don't quote me on this, but the bracket could shake-out this way or not, football is wildly unpredictable — regardless of the path, it's going to be fun if Real Madrid keep advancing.)

Once Real Madrid return from the USA — and we are far away from knowing the timeline or the state of the team at that time — Alonso will have a unique situation where he has a month plus change to work with his squad in training, with no pre-season games, before the 2025 - 2026 season kicks off.

Group L qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continues Monday with a key clash between Croatia and Czechia.

Czechia currently sits atop the group with a perfect record, three wins from three matches. Croatia, which joined qualifying later due to UEFA Nations League obligations, has played just once so far but made a strong statement with a dominant victory. With Montenegro (currently in second place) idle this matchday, a win on Monday would allow Croatia to jump into second and tighten the race at the top.

Czechia has dominated so far. It opened play with a surprisingly close 2-1 win over the Faroe Islands, needing a late goal from Patrik Schick to secure the victory. Since then, they've found their rhythm, cruising past Gibraltar 4-0 and controlling the match in a 2-0 win over Montenegro on June 6.

Croatia, which didn't play in the first window due to UEFA Nations League commitments, finally joined the qualifiers earlier this week and made an immediate impact with a dominant 7-0 win over Gibraltar. Five of those goals came in the second half, as Gibraltar simply couldn't hold off Croatia's relentless attack.

For Croatia, it's about building momentum toward another deep World Cup run, after all, they finished second in 2018 and third in 2022. Czechia, on the other hand, is looking to return to the World Cup stage for the first time since 2006 and solidify its resurgence on the international scene.

Group J qualifying for the 2026 World Cup continues Monday when Belgium takes on Wales in a key battle for the UEFA spots in the 2026 World Cup.

Wales currently leads the group with seven points, having won two matches and drawn one from its first three games. Belgium, meanwhile, has only played once so far, a draw, after missing the first qualifying window due to its participation in the UEFA Nations League.

That leaves Belgium in fourth place with one point, but with games in hand and plenty of time to climb the table. A win on Monday, for example, would put them just one point behind second-place North Macedonia.

Wales opened group play with a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan, then followed that up by drawing 1-1 with North Macedonia in a strange game that was scoreless when the 90th minute arrived. This week, the team beat Liechtenstein 3-0 to assert itself as the top team in the group.

As for Belgium, the team's lone game in qualifying play was on June 6 against North Macedonia. The team led until the final minutes thanks to a Maxim De Cuyper goal, but North Macedonia just managed to squeeze in a tying goal.

Belgium is aiming to qualify for its fourth straight World Cup, continuing a run that began in 2014. Meanwhile, Wales is on course to reach its second consecutive World Cup, something the nation has never accomplished before.

In June 2025, TikTok users claimed FIFA, the international soccer governing body, decided to relocate scheduled U.S.-hosted 2026 World Cup matches to Mexico or Canada — countries that are already hosting some matches. According to social media users' posts and videos, this consideration followed FIFA receiving thousands of complaints from players, coaches and fans who refused to travel to the U.S. due to concerns over stringent immigration policies imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.

For example, in early June, a TikTok user published a video (archived) announcing FIFA decided to no longer allow the U.S. to host World Cup matches in 2026. The clip received over 1.5 million views.

The clip's narrator recounted the story as follows:

FIFA has decided to hold the World Cup in 2026, and it will not be held in the United States. FIFA has decided to take away the United States' qualification as the host country of the cup, and the responsibility directly lies with President Trump. The organization is facing a major mechanical problem after thousands of players, coaches and fans announced that they would not travel to this country, which is due to the policy. Trump's crazy immigration has generated fear, tension and negative reactions at the international level. Athletes and delegation members are afraid of being arrested.

Or even with valid visas, fans all over the world consider the United States an unsafe place. For a major event like the World Cup, the situation is so serious that several countries have announced that they will boycott the event. If it is still held in the United States, it will be a direct blow to the spirit of football unity. This is why FIFA has already taken action. The official move of the competition to Mexico and Canada offers safer and more popular conditions for both players and fans.

The United States was originally the main contractor and thus lost the world's largest sports event. All of this was due to the political crisis caused by Trump's policies. Leave your comments and share this news.

Other users also shared this rumor on Bluesky (archived), Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived), TikTok (archived) and X (archived).

However, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo, as well as The Associated Press, CNN, Fox News and The Washington Post, found no credible reporting about FIFA seriously considering relocating U.S.-hosted World Cup matches outside the U.S., at least not as of this writing in early June 2025. Rather, this matter marked the latest chapter of users sharing false or unfounded rumors, including some posts featuring the use of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools.

Snopes contacted FIFA's media relations representatives to inquire about the rumor's accuracy and will update this article with more information as it becomes available.

The aforementioned lookups of search engines located some relevant news regarding Trump's policies and the 2026 World Cup, though again no reports confirmed the central claim about FIFA deciding to move U.S.-hosted games to Canada or Mexico.

For example, in March, FIFA President Gianni Infantino met with Trump at the White House, with FIFA reporting Trump reaffirmed support for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup tournaments.

On April 25, The Associated Press reported U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the Democratic Party in Oregon, asked the Trump administration to reconsider policies impacting travelers arriving in the U.S., including citing upcoming sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

In early May, NBC News reported members of Trump's Cabinet warned World Cup visitors to the U.S. not to overstay their visas. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also cast the tournament as ""an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place,"" adding, ""We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together.""

On May 13, Politico (archived) reported the details of a letter (archived) the Human Rights Watch organization addressed to Infantino. The letter cited Human Rights Watch's ""grave concerns"" about Trump's immigration policies, and urged Infantino to be ""prepared to reconsider the hosting decision"" if the safety of fans and players couldn't be guaranteed. Other reports told of concerns about long visa appointment wait times, as well as European countries issuing travel advisories for the U.S.

Two days later, on May 15, Reuters (archived) reported Infantino reassured that ""the world is welcome in America,"" referencing the 2025 and 2026 tournaments.

Trump's travel ban, which targets 12 countries and adds restrictions on others, includes exceptions for ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.""

Portugal successfully lifted the UEFA Nations League trophy after beating Spain via a penalty shootout in a thrilling final match. Drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams failed to win it during extra time, but Roberto Martinez's men held their nerves during the shootout.

Selecao das Quinas were determined to put on another strong display after beating Germany in the semifinal stage. However, they were facing a much tougher task from the hungry and determined Spain outfit.

Despite Portugal's determination, it was La Furia Roja that got things under control early on as they went 1-0 up through Martin Zubimendi. However, Cristiano Ronaldo and co got their act together and drew level five minutes later from Nuno Mendes' effort.

Spain raised their game again and regained their advantage just before half half-time break, this time from Mikel Oyarzabal's goal. In the second half, Portugal managed to improve their performance further and got back on level terms once again, thanks to Ronaldo's equaliser.

After drawing 2-2 in regular time, both teams continued to look for that important winning goal during extra time, but neither was successful. As neither side was able to win in regular time plus the 2×15 minutes, the game went to penalties.

After a pretty tight shootout, it was Alvaro Morata, who cost Spain the game as it was his missed spot kick that sealed the deal for Portugal. Martinez's men got all of their penalties spot on, including Ruben Neves' decisive fifth kick, which made it 5-3.

Coco Gauff offers advice to Lois Boisson after defeating her to reach the French Open final. (0:49)

Lois Boisson, the revelation of the French Open, has rocketed 296 places up the WTA rankings after her fairy-tale run at Roland Garros.

The Frenchwoman, who was 361st before making it to the semifinals at the clay-court Grand Slam last week, jumped to 65th in the latest edition of the rankings published Monday.

Coco Gauff defeated Boisson in the semifinals en route to her first French Open title. There was no change at the top of the rankings, with Aryna Sabalenka leading the pack ahead of Gauff and her fellow American Jessica Pegula.

Sabalenka lost to Gauff in the Roland Garros final.

A wild-card entry in Paris, Boisson upset the third-seeded Pegula to reach the quarterfinals, then defeated sixth-ranked Mirra Andreeva before Gauff ended her unexpected run.

After retaining his title on Sunday in the longest-ever final at Roland Garros against top-ranked Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz remained in second spot in the men's ATP rankings behind his Italian rival.

Despite the loss, Sinner increased his lead to 2,030 points because Alcaraz, as the defending champion, was unable to add any points. Sinner gained 500 points by reaching the final, having lost in the semifinals last year.

Third-ranked Alexander Zverev dropped 900 points after his loss to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. Djokovic moved up to fifth place behind fourth-ranked Jack Draper.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner lit up Court Philippe-Chatrier in their thrilling five set French Open final.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in the French Open final, with the Spaniard saving three championship points to do so.

This five hour and 29 minute final has received a huge reaction, with Coco Gauff and Roger Federer messaging Alcaraz after he defended his French Open title.

The highly dramatic final between Alcaraz and Sinner has received much praise for the level they produced and now a big prediction has been made about their Grand Slam future.

Both the Grand Slam titles this year have been won by Alcaraz and Sinner, who defended his Australian Open title earlier this year.

When discussing this French Open final on the Nothing Major podcast, former world number 21 Steve Johnson was asked if he thinks Alcaraz and Sinner can win 18 of the next 20 major tournaments.

Johnson could not argue against that happening and sent a warning to the rest of the ATP Tour.

“It is hard to bet against that,” said Johnson. “Their level is astonishing and then when they get to play one another it just gets played. 

“It's one of those things we are lucky as tennis fans and spectators that we get to watch these two guys at 21 and 22 years old do this in a sport that they haven't even both hit their primes yet, which is amazing for those two guys and scary for the rest of the tour.

“I don't think these guys are going to lose matches at slams. First, second, third round to anyone. These guys are way too good. They are too competitive. They don't take days off. It's crazy to think that I believe Sinner is 91-3 against everyone else in the last couple of years and he is 0-5 against Carlos. Those are insane numbers for himself.”

Since the start of the 2024 season, all six of the men's Grand Slam titles have gone to either Sinner or Alcaraz.

The top two ranked ATP players have evenly split these major titles, with Sinner winning all the Grand Slams on hard courts, while Alcaraz has dominated the natural surfaces.

Sinner lost his first Grand Slam final to Alcaraz at the French Open, with the other major runners-up including Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz.

The next Grand Slam tournament is Wimbledon, where Alcaraz is a two-time defending champion.

Sinner's best result at the grass court major is reaching the semi-finals, and he will be looking to better that when the tournament begins on Monday, June 30.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","The Base Line: Alcaraz wins legendary French Open final while Gauff reigns victorious","https://www.flashscore.com/news/tennis-french-open-atp-singles-the-base-line-alcaraz-wins-legendary-french-open-final-while-gauff-reigns-victorious/x6HMyD1M/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 07:41:14 GMT","

A match that will be remembered for the rest of time, Carlos Alcaraz inflicted a first Grand Slam final defeat on Jannik Sinner after a truly miraculous and barely believable 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-3, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) victory over his Italian opponent, winning his second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam crown.

The Spaniard looked down and out as he stared down the barrel. He had never come back from two sets down before, and Sinner was playing at a scarily high level. However, he dug as deep as he possibly could, saving three championship points in the process, as he reigned victorious in a five-hour and 29-minute thriller - the longest final in Roland Garros history and the second longest in Slam history.

Sinner will be absolutely devastated after missing those golden chances in the fourth set, but Alcaraz has this freakish ability to just produce top gear and reach otherworldly levels when he really needs to. Time and time again, he has done that in his career, showing the most phenomenal mental strength. His performance in the final set tiebreak was a sight to behold, as he raced to a 7-0 lead with perfect tennis. 

It will go down as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time, and this new modern-day rivalry is truly blossoming. A rivalry that will hopefully start transcending the sport and capture the hearts and imaginations of new fans. 

Alcaraz has now beaten Sinner five times in a row, and the world number one will be desperately trying to work out a way to beat this martian. However, he should take heart in the fact that he was so close to winning on a surface he has struggled on against an opponent whose favourite surface is clay. Who is for a rematch at Wimbledon next month?

Meanwhile, over on the women's side of the tournament, American Coco Gauff capped off a fine clay-court season with a dramatic 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the final, winning her second Grand Slam and her first here in Paris.

It was a tough match to watch, and in typical Gauff fashion, she didn't play the best tennis throughout the tournament, yet she keeps finding ways to win. Her athleticism, tennis IQ and mentality continue to be unmatched, and she was able to grind down and frustrate Aryna Sabalenka, who made 70 unforced errors and seemed to lose her cool.

At 21 years old, she is forging a superb career for herself on the court, and she carries herself magnificently off it.

It was utter heartbreak for Sabalenka though, who was the favourite throughout the tournament, especially after beating three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek in the final.

However, she was just unable to manage the windy conditions and the retrieval skills of Gauff, and she was extremely emotional following the match.

In her press conference, she was extremely critical of her own performance, and also downplayed Gauff's too. 

""It was really honestly the worst tennis I've played in the last, I don't know, in the last I don't know how many months,” she said. “Conditions were terrible, and she simply was better in these conditions than me. I think it was the worst final I ever played.

“Today was just, yeah, I mean, honestly sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow magically the ball lands in the court, and you kind of, like, on the back foot. Yeah, it's just, you know, like - it felt like a joke, honestly, like somebody from above was just staying there laughing, like, let's see if you can handle this.

“I don't know, I think if Iga would win against me the other day, I think she would go out today and she would get the win. Yeah, it just hurts. Honestly hurts. I've been playing really well, and then in the last match, go out there and perform like I did, that hurts.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas' torrid form just shows no sign of slowing down. Once a finalist at the French Open and someone who was so good on the clay, the Greek suffered an abysmal second-round exit to world number 167 Matteo Gigante, meaning he himself dropped to 26 in the rankings - his lowest in nearly seven years.

Following his defeat, Tsitsipas announced the high-profile appointment of former player Goran Ivanisevic as his new coach - the man who helped Novak Djokovic to nine Grand Slam titles. He will be hoping that he can turn his fortunes around.

Another player who has reached the final at this tournament - on two occasions - Casper Ruud also fell in the second round in shock fashion to Nuno Borges. The Norwegian seemed to be struggling with injury, but it was still a massively disappointing result for him, and he has also dropped down to 16th in the world as a result.

On the women's side of the draw, world number nine Emma Navarro was dumped out in the first round after suffering a brutal 6-0, 6-1 defeat at the hands of Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. To see such an incredible fighter like Navarro succumb to a loss like this was a major shock, but all credit to her Spanish opponent, who played some brilliant tennis.

After Rafael Nadal's damp squib of a send-off in the Davis Cup finals at the end of the 2024 season, the French Open announced ahead of the tournament that they would be holding a special ceremony for the all-time great. Nadal won a staggering 14 French Open crowns, and they wanted to celebrate him in style.

And they did just that. With the crowd all donning orange shirts to represent the colour of the clay, Nadal cut an emotional figure as he gave a speech and a highlight reel was played of his greatest moment.

But then, to the delight of everyone watching, his greatest rivals and fellow legends of the game, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray took to the court to share the moment with him, which produced some fantastic images.

Last but not least, the French Open unveiled a plaque with Nadal's footprint right next to the court on Philippe-Chatrier, making him a permanent fixture at his favourite venue. Nadal couldn't contain his emotions as this was revealed, capping off a magnificent ceremony and moment.

There were some absolutely magnificent rallies on the claycourts of Paris this fortnight, with players forced to battle and dig deep to win points.

Holger Rune produced a jaw-dropping around-the-net shot, Djokovic rolled back the years to win a mesmerising 41-shot rally against Alexander Zverev, while Gauff showcased her never-say-die attitude and brilliant backhand to steal a point against Sabalenka in the final.

The clay-court season has now come to an end, and the ATP and WTA Tours move very quickly onto the grass, with Wimbledon already fast approaching.

In London, Queen's Club welcomes back a women's tournament for the first time in 50 years, which is sure to be a fantastic occasion. Qinwen Zheng, Keys, Navarro and Elena Rybakina are the top seeds.

Over in Hertogenbosch, Liudmila Samsonova and Ekaterina Alexandrova are the top seeds, while Daniil Medvedev and Ugo Humbert headline the men's tournament.

Finally, there is a heavyweight cast in Stuttgart, with Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime leading the way.

A pulsating French Open came to a dramatic conclusion on Sunday, with Carlos Alcaraz battling back in a legendary final to stun Jannik Sinner and defend his title.

Here, we look at the big winners and losers from a fascinating fortnight of men's singles action at Roland Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz: An astonishing comeback and an astonishing triumph for Alcaraz, who is now one of just four men in the Open Era to win five majors before turning 23. It is hard to see the Spaniard slowing down anytime soon.

Alexander Bublik: The Kazakh picked up two hugely impressive top-10 wins to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final, reminding everyone just how talented he is. Let's hope we see more of this tennis from him in the future.

Frances Tiafoe & Tommy Paul: Best-ever Roland Garros runs for Tiafoe and Paul saw both men reach the last eight, as part of a strong US campaign in Paris. Both will be eyeing up a strong grass-court season.

The 6 men to win the French Open final from two sets down: Alcaraz joins Djokovic, Borg

ATP Rankings: Sinner's consolation, Alcaraz's title, Draper and Paul's new milestones, Ruud -8

Alexander Zverev: Another Grand Slam chance goes begging for Zverev, who fell into his passive patterns of play in his quarter-final exit to Novak Djokovic. It looks less and less likely that the German will win a major title.

Taylor Fritz: Expectations were low for fourth seed Fritz heading into Roland Garros, but an opening-round exit to Daniel Altmaier was underwhelming. The American now has to defend a heap of ranking points this summer.

Stefanos Tsitsipas: After a stunning second-round loss to Matteo Gigante, Tsitsipas now finds himself outside the top 20 for the first time since 2018. The Greek will hope his partnership with Goran Ivanisevic can revitalise his career.

Casper Ruud: Injury contributed to the end of Ruud's Roland Garros, with his second-round loss to Nuno Borges his earliest exit at the event since 2018. The Norwegian is another whose Grand Slam hopes may be fading.

Jannik Sinner: The world No 1 proved he was as sharp as ever throughout a dominant run to the final, but is now just the third man in the Open Era to miss championship points in a Grand Slam final. How will he process such a loss?

Novak Djokovic: Djokovic's motivation and hunger should not be questioned, and his tennis in Paris was arguably his best of the year. But, despite a strong display, he couldn't take a set off Sinner in the semi-final. It is understandable why he may be contemplating his long-term future in the sport.

Lorenzo Musetti: Musetti's strong clay-court season ended in heartbreaking fashion, pushing Alcaraz early on before injury forced him to retire in his first French Open final. Hopefully, it is not a long-term issue for the Italian.

Emma Raducanu has admitted to being a little jealous of the ATP Tour for being able to play at the Queen's Club. After a long hiatus, the WTA Tour has triumphantly returned to the West Kensington venue for the first time since 1973.

The Queen's Club is already known for its highly regarded men's tournament - a consistent winner of the best ATP 500 accolade - and now female players are eagerly seizing their chance to shine. Raducanu joins the likes of Australian Open winner Madison Keys and Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen on the fabled grass courts, who have previously shared their envy at the ATP players' chances to compete at the venue.

Keys found it too tempting to resist the WTA 500 at Queen's, especially given that her friend and ex-tennis pro Laura Robson is leading the event as tournament director. She admitted to pangs of jealousy each time her ATP friends played the west London leg of the tour.

She said: ""Obviously, when Laura asked for me to play the tournament, it was a pretty quick yes. I'm happy to be here, and I've always loved the grass swing, so to start here for the first time in many, many years is really fun.""

She added: ""I've always heard amazing things about the tournament and I've always been pretty jealous because the guys just rave about how great it is here and they love playing here. So, I'm really looking forward to being able to play here.""

Zheng, meanwhile, also admitted that her grass-court experience is limited, and that she has never made it to a quarter-final on the surface. Yet, the world No. 5 couldn't resist joining the historic first women's event at Queen's Club as the WTA Tour graces its lawns.

The Chinese sensation said: ""I watched the men's event Queens and I'm really happy. The first time for the women, in my generation, that we can play in Queen's in such a special club.

""It's amazing for us that we can start first and we have the experience to play on such beautiful grass. I think it's a very classic, old, traditional place, and it's a special club because you have all the neighbourhood around, which is an amazing design from a long, long time ago.""

Donna Vekic, a grass-court aficionado who stormed into the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, has also always dreamt of the ladies taking centre stage at the iconic venue. The Croatian ace said: ""It's very historical and this club, when I watch the men's tournament, it's always amazing and I always wished that we had a chance to play and now we do, so I'm very excited to be playing here.""

But perhaps no one is more thrilled than Britain's own tennis stars, who've grown up with eyes glued to the ATP event and are now set to dazzle their home crowd at this esteemed tournament. Raducanu couldn't help but reveal a touch of envy towards ATP players in the past, admitting with a smile: ""A little bit, healthy. But it was great seeing the guys play here, of course.

""When I was young, I came here with my dad. I was like hunting the brownies on the ground and not so interested in the tennis. But now to be back here and competing is a different feel for sure.

""It's kind of interesting how it feels because you're at home, you don't necessarily feel like you're playing a tournament or a match tomorrow. But I think it is also really good to switch off and just to have comforts everywhere.""

Elsewhere, British No. 1 Katie Boulter added: ""I've actually always said to myself, I wish there was a women's event here, I wish I got the chance to play on this court, because you can feel the history and you can feel how incredible it is.""

The Spaniard was two sets down and staring down the barrel against world number one Jannik Sinner, but after saving three championship points in the fourth set, Alcaraz mounted a truly remarkable comeback to win in a final set tiebreak, 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 in a whopping five hours and 30 minutes. It is the second-longest Grand Slam final of all time.

Sinner will be absolutely heartbroken after missing his huge chance in the fourth set, and he has now lost his first Slam final. For Alcaraz, he is a five-time major winner and has won his second here in Paris.

Read our full match report of the final here.

20:47 CET - This match is getting the climax it deserves. We are heading to a final-set tiebreak to decide the French Open champion

20:33 CET - I can't believe what I am witnessing. With Carlos Alcaraz serving for the match, it is Jannik Sinner's turn to break back and make it 5-5 in the decider. What is going on?

19:47 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has an early break in the fifth set! All the momentum is with him now in this phenomenal match.

19:38 CET - Absolutely astonishing scenes here at the French Open as Carlos Alcaraz takes the fourth set 7-6(3), with this sensational final heads to a fifth set. Jannik Sinner will be devastated that he didn't take his chances, and now there is all to play for in the last set of this tournament.

19:22 CET - Incredible scenes here at Roland Garros, with Carlos Alcaraz saving three championship points on his own serve, then breaking back at 5-4 to bring it back level at 5-5. We are not done yet! Heartbreak for Jannik Sinner but jubilation for Alcaraz.

19:04 CET - A potentially HUGE moment in this match. Jannik Sinner has the first break of the set to take a 4-3 lead, and he is just two games away from his first French Open title.

19:01 CET - Midway through the fourth set, the pair are locked at 3-3. Incredible tension around Philippe-Chatrier.

18:29 CET - Jannik Sinner has lost a set of tennis at a Grand Slam for the first time since the Australian Open fourth round! Carlos Alcaraz produced an exceptional set to win it 6-4, breaking Sinner to love in the 10th game. Huge pressure now on the world number one as Alcaraz attempts a seismic comeback.

18:26 CET - Right in the nick of time, Jannik Sinner has broken back! Carlos Alcaraz was serving to take the third set at 5-3, but the Italian pounced. What a crucial few games we have coming up.

18:05 CET - And just like that, Carlos Alcaraz has broken again to go 3-1 up! Is this the start of a miraculous comeback?

17:52 CET - But Carlos Alcaraz has broken right back with some brilliant tennis! What a start to the second set!

17:46 CET - Just like at the start of the second set, Jannik Sinner has an early break at the start of the third. Carlos Alcaraz is in trouble.

17:40 CET - Jannik Sinner has just won a huge and utterly critical second set against Carlos Alcaraz, hitting top gear in the tiebreak to go 6-4, 7-6(4) up. After being broken back when serving for the set, he kept his cool in typical Sinner fashion to regather himself, and has now put himself in a strong position to clinch his first French Open title against a player whose level seems to be constantly fluctuating. 

Remember: Alcaraz has never won from two sets down before. He has a mountain to climb.

17:18 CET - Carlos Alcaraz has broken back at the perfect time! With Jannik Sinner serving for the second set at 5-3, the Spaniard has capitalised on some poor serving from his opponent to get back into the contest.

16:43 CET - And now an early break for Jannik Sinner at the start of the second set! The Italian is oozing confidence and has a 2-0 lead.

16:31 CET - After a sensational set that lasted just over an hour, Jannik Sinner has landed the first real blow, winning it 6-4. There was some otherworldly tennis on show, but Carlos Alcaraz produced a few really poor errors in the 10th game to give his rival the set. Can the defending champion bounce back?

16:11 CET - Jannik Sinner has the break back in the very next game! Brilliant from the world number one.

16:05 CET - There is the break for Carlos Alcaraz! It has been a high-quality start to the match, and the Spaniard has first blood, taking a 3-2 lead!

15:40 CET - A stunning 12-minute first game has seen Jannik Sinner just about hang onto his serve. How about that for a start!

15:27 CET - Right then, we are underway! Let's hope it is a classic!

15:10 CET - World number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz are about to head out to the court to contest the 2025 French Open men's final!

Stay tuned to the Tennis Tracker for major updates throughout the match or follow it point-by-point via the link below.

13:26 CET - Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini are the women's doubles French Open champions! The Italian duo have followed up their triumph in Rome with victory here in Paris, beating Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1.

On the same court in which they clinched Olympic Gold just under a year ago, they are victorious once more. For Errani, it is her ninth Grand Slam title in doubles, while Paolini has her hands on her very first. A great moment for both of them, as Italian tennis continues to thrive.

11:30 CET - Welcome back to the Tennis Tracker on the final day of the French Open, and what an absolute treat there is in store.

Before the tournament began, every tennis fan would have wanted to see world number one Jannik Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the showpiece event, and that is exactly what has happened.

Sinner has had a near-flawless run to the final. Taking part in his second tournament since returning from a drugs ban, the Italian hasn't dropped a single set and saw off 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in a high-quality last-four clash.

His relentless and suffocating brand of tennis has been too much for anyone, and he will be looking to produce that against an opponent who has beaten him in their last four meetings. Victory would see him win his first French Open and fourth Grand Slam, which would take him level with Alcaraz.

It hasn't been as plain sailing for Alcaraz, who has dropped a set in four of his matches. He didn't look his best against Lorenzo Musetti in his semi-final, but eventually managed to overcome his ailing opponent, who retired with an injury in the fourth set.

However, Alcaraz tends to save his best for Sinner, and there is little doubt that the Spaniard is a better clay-court player than his rival. At one point, Alcaraz trailed the head-to-head 4-3, but now leads it 7-4. If he can continue his winning run over Sinner, he will pick up his second title at Roland Garros and his fifth Slam.

It is a match that is so hard to call, and everyone will be hoping that it is an absolute thriller. Neither player has lost in a Grand Slam final before, so something will have to give. Proceedings get underway around 15:00 CET.

French Open

Carlos Alcaraz produced a comeback for the ages to defeat Jannik Sinner and take the 2025 French Open final in a six-hour instant classic in Paris.

Alcaraz, 22, defended his title by coming back from two sets down and saving three championship points to win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2).

The Spaniard was broken twice as the world No. 1 and slight favorite Sinner started strongly on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and Alcaraz went two sets behind after being edged out of the second-set tiebreak at sunny Roland Garros.

Alcaraz won three breaks in the third set and won a dramatic tiebreak to level the match before he went 7-0 up in the championship breaker with some celestial tennis and sealed his triumph with a laser forehand.

Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner to win French Open in tennis classic

You may have heard already — but we have our own tennis podcast at The Athletic these days.

The Tennis Podcast is now part of our audio stable. Catherine Whitaker, David Law and Matt Roberts have been podcasting after every day of this year's French Open.

And they will do so again today, following that unbelievable marathon of a men's final. I have no idea how they'll manage to sum up everything that transpired in an hour, but they're pros, they'll find a way! The episode will up in the next few hours.

Sinner's tennis is often compared to Djokovic, but there's something about his mentality that also resembles the 24-time Grand Slam champion. Like Djokovic, Sinner is extremely adept at shrugging off disappointment to lock back in. 

Curiously, the clock ticked beyond three hours and 50 minutes while Sinner was serving for the match, which made the fact that Alcaraz had kept things competitive in the face of a second-set rout a couple of hours earlier significant. 

Alcaraz certainly looked the fresher in the tiebreak, and the sprint finish Sinner had been hoping for disappeared. This had become a long-distance race again, and it was Alcaraz who had the edge. 

He went down 0-2, then up 4-2, conjuring memories of the Beijing Open final last fall, when Sinner led a tiebreak 3-0 before Alcaraz won it 7-3.

Alcaraz took this tiebreak by the same scoreline and the match went into a fifth set. From there, Sinner was at the point that his sprint for the line had been designed to avoid. Again, it proved the point of no return.

If the biggest edge Sinner has on Alcaraz is the serve, the biggest edge Alcaraz has on Sinner is rhythm. Not just his variety, Alcaraz can maneuver the ball and change the cadence of a match like no other elite player.

So perhaps Sinner's greatest achievement Sunday was stopping that from happening for large swathes of the match. 

For the first two sets, Sinner's consistent hitting and aggressive court position prevented Alcaraz from getting on top of the rallies and bringing his lethal drop shot regularly into play. By the fourth and fifth, Alcaraz took over. 

Having withstood his opponent's most lethal weapon for so long, the intensity that had taken Sinner to the cusp of the title left him powerless to stop the coup de grâce — until the one he caught up in the fifth set to prolong the match.

By the end, Alcaraz had hit more drop shots than during any other match in the tournament.

Ask any player who has done it on the biggest stages in tennis. So much of beating Alcaraz lies in finding a way to snuff out the surges that he uses to steamroll an opponent, whether he's ahead or behind.

On Sunday, the first surge came an hour and three-quarters into a match that had turned into one-way traffic for Sinner, who was serving for a two-set lead at 5-3. 

Sinner got to this match by snuffing out a similar surge form Novak Djokovic in the second set Friday night. Djokovic had the crowd and the moment. Sinner played clinical tennis and smote the danger.

In the seventh game of the fourth set, Sinner shut down any ideas Alcaraz might have had that this would go the distance and looked to be on his way. He wasn't, because Alcaraz was about to unleash maybe the biggest surge of his career. 

He won 13 of the next 14 points to climb from 3-5, 0-40 down to 6-5 up. Sinner pushed it to a tiebreak, but after falling down 0-2, Alcaraz cranked out a couple of aces on his way to winning seven of the last eight points.

Sinner did find a way to stifle it Until the one last Alcaraz rise that proved impossible to quell.

Anyone might have predicted that Jannik Sinner would have the edge on short points. He's got the bigger serve and induces more errors on return than most top players and more easy second shots as well.

Through the first set and into the start of the second, Sinner more than doubled Alcaraz's tally on points of four shots or fewer, winning 32-14. For shots that lasted longer than four shots, Alcaraz was in the lead 23-11.

Even as Alcaraz wiped out Sinner's two-set lead in his stirring comeback, Sinner's advantage in the short points held firm.

It's no coincidence that during the peak of his domination, he was winning 66 percent of points on his first serve, compared with a little under 60 percent for Alcaraz. 

These two players are a level above the rest of the tour, evenly matched rivals in their own galaxy. But if there is one notable gulf, it is between their serves. Alcaraz needs to close it.

Tennis fans will be watching tapes of five points from the 2025 French Open final 25 years from now.

The match seemed so lost, it was almost silly to consider what might happen when Alcaraz stepped to the line to serve at 0-40, 3-5 in the fourth set. The celebration in Italy was about to explode.

Then came a long rally, the kind Sinner was on the short end of for much of the afternoon. He went long with a ground stroke. Interesting. Two more match points and then a chance to serve it out. Then he tried to jump on a second serve, and sent the backhand long. Hmm.

On the next point, Sinner seized control, setting up a kill shot, but it went into the net. Alcaraz had his lifeline and whipped up the crowd, promising them more tennis if they could carry him to this most unlikely rise from the abyss.

An ace and a forehand down the line to the postage stamp later, Alcaraz was alive. When he was taken to the fifth-set tiebreak, it looked as if he had wasted his resurrection. 

Instead, the Spaniard produced a tidal wave that surpassed even his great escape.

Having fended off three match points, Alcaraz found himself in the position Sinner had been: serving at 5-4 for the French Open title. This final was surely going to get a conclusion at last. Instead, Sinner broke back to 15.

Court Philippe-Chatrier was stunned, and from there the match descended into a stunning psychodrama that enshrined this young sporting rivalry's place in the global sporting world. 

None of this had seemed possible at the start of the set, when Sinner could barely move. It was as though he was somehow back from the dead. Things then went supersonic. 

The tiebreak ended a three-game drama that transposed into one of the great surges of Alcaraz's career. It may prove to be one of his greatest. After all the tension, Alcaraz found his ceiling, which is peerless in the sport and borderline unplayable. 

There was time for one final miracle – a running forehand down the line that was too ridiculous for words. Alcaraz collapsed into the clay, a champion again.

And why not?!

He added: “I feel the same (that winning was a miracle). I didn't know what I did to win the match, three match points down. My grandfather, I'm pretty sure he was watching from home. I hope he is proud of my performance.

“I tried not to think about anything else, just to go point after point with a positive mind, with everything I had inside. To overcome the problems, trying to play much better tennis than Jannik. 

“It was very difficult in some moments but I'm proud and very happy about how I dealt with everything today. To say it was one of the best finals in the history of a Grand Slam is really high status.

“I have to say there have been more or better finals, Novak Djokovic vs. Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open final. I'm just really happy to put my name into one of the longest finals, in the history of the Grand Slam, Roland Garros.

“I'm really happy, especially for Samu, his first Grand Slam as a coach. I'm gonna celebrate tonight, I'm not gonna lie!”

Alcaraz, courtside, speaks on TNT Sports.

He added: “Yeah, it was honestly amazing. To put into words is really difficult. Being two sets down against the world No. 1, the level he was playing was unbelievable. The first match I came back from two sets down.

“I just put my heart into it, tried to keep it going, not thinking about the result, just putting my tennis on. Not giving up. It was just fighting, fighting, thinking point after point. 

“At the end of the fifth set I was just playing with the heart, and I think I did OK.”

Carlos, you think you did OK?

The trophy he so dearly merits.

He deserves the crown, the Spanish supernova.

He added: “I just want to say thank you to my team, my family, I have the privilege to live great things with you. 

“I was lucky to have a lot of friends from home, from Murcia, to support. Amazing support you have given to me today, throughout the whole two weeks. Even those who are at home who couldn't come.

“Thank you very much and this trophy is yours as well. This tournament is really special, I can't wait to come here year after year. Special thank you to (tournament director) Amelie (Mauresmo), congratulations as well, it's not easy to be with us.

“To Paris, you have been really important support to me since the first practice for the first round. You were insane, unbelievable for me. I can't thank you enough. You were really important, you are in my heart and you will always be.

“Thank you very much and see you next year.”

He said: “Hi everyone. I wanted to start with Jannik. It is amazing the level you have, congratulations for an amazing two weeks, an amazing tournament. I know the hard work you put in every day. I know how hard you chase this tournament.

“I'm pretty sure you're gonna be champion here many, many times. It's a privilege to share the court with you. I'm just really happy to be able to make history with you in this tournament, in other tournaments.

“You are a huge inspiration for the kids, and for me as well. So thank you, and good luck for all that is coming in the future.”","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","tennis"

Gigi Salmon reflects on the incredible French Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff's triumph; Follow scores and reports from Queen's Club, plus watch action from the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

In her latest Sky Sports column, Gigi Salmon reflects on an incredible French Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, while also speaking about her meeting with Coco Gauff's parents Candi and Corey after her maiden triumph at Roland-Garros. She also discusses whether Britain is becoming a clay nation and Novak Djokovic's poignant wave to the crowd in what could be his last appearance at the clay-court Grand Slam.

'Where were you when…' A question that will be asked with regularity when it comes to the men's final at Roland-Garros which set a new record for the longest final in the tournament's history, pushed the players in question up to and way beyond their limits, left spectators speechless and led me to say in commentary: ""I love tennis"" - something I don't normally say out loud on air!

I had the honour of commentating on one of the best matches I have ever seen live, for Radio RG [Roland-Garros], and possibly the greatest Grand Slam final.

From high up in Philippe-Chatrier a match that started in the late afternoon sunshine in Paris finished four-hours and 29 minutes later under the floodlights.

A first Grand Slam final meeting between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the first of many, a 12th meeting overall and, if we're honest, the final most people wanted to see. When these two players face each other it doesn't disappoint, it can't, the contrast in styles, personalities and the desire to be the best.

Alcaraz, 22, has now won five Slam finals from five finals, after saving three championship points on his serve and doing something that he has never done before, coming from two sets to love down.

For his part, world No 1 Sinner recovered from not converting those championship points and then from being an early break down in the fifth to take us the distance in what is only his second tournament back after returning from his three-month suspension.

A tournament that started with a tribute to the 'King of Clay' Rafa Nadal with a plaque laid in his honour on the side the court, fittingly rounded off with a final for the ages.

I was lucky to be behind the scenes shortly after the match finished and close enough to see every emotion possible from those closest to the players, the tears of joy, sadness and pride. Many legends of the game were finding it hard to put into words what they had witnessed. When I asked tournament director Amelie Mauresmo how she felt, she replied 'speechless', before adding that she would be reflecting on a successful two weeks with a nice glass of red wine!

The atmosphere on Sunday backstage was in stark contrast to Saturday which was buzzing in the aftermath of Coco Gauff's second Grand Slam title and her first in Paris.

Gauff's three-set win over world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka stood out for its own reasons, difficult conditions, the American's comeback, Sabalenka's inability to deal with the conditions and possibly the situation, and the drama of how it played out.

After the match, Daniela Hantuchova and I spent time chatting with Gauff's parents Candi and Corey, full of pride for their daughter and how she handled everything, remembering she is still only 21.

Dad Corey for a while now hasn't sat in the box as his living and breathing every point became unmanageable in the box and in his own words: 'I don't handle it well, that's why I don't sit in the box, I bring too much negative energy, I struggle all the way through - I find a corner and I stay in it.'

He also said that her mental strength comes from her faith and having great 'spiritual strength', going on to say: 'I have great belief in myself and it can be contagious. I always think I can be the best at everything as if I don't believe it then no one will - you must just believe in yourself.'

Gauff's coach JC Faurel said that any coach who tells you they are calm in the box are lying and that he was a mess inside, while Matt Daley who joined the team last year praised Gauff for being willing to make tweaks and changes during matches. The celebrations - they all confirmed - before the Gauff's headed back to America were going to be big and lasted long into the night!

So a new Champion in Paris in Gauff, a final that may never be beaten, a fitting tribute to the 'King of Clay' at the start and, from a British point of view, four finals featuring British players.

Someone posed the question recently, 'is Britain becoming a clay nation,' a strong statement and while some good inroads are being made, we're still a long way from putting the red dirt at the top of the list of British players favourite surface.

Jack Draper came into the French Open as a contender as the world No 5 having had a fantastic clay swing reaching the final in Madrid and the quarter-finals in Rome.

But no one was picking him to win the title and to seriously challenge the likes of Alcaraz and Sinner on clay would have been very tough and he would fall in the fourth round to Alexander Bublik who played the match of his life!

It's not to say Jack can't or won't in the future, all the signs look great and there's so much to take away from the last few months.

Cam Norrie had an excellent run to the fourth round, ultimately falling to Novak Djokovic, his first-round win over former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev in five sets and nearly four hours was fantastic and having had a tough 18 months of so, there's a lot for Cam to take on to the grass including a boost in his ranking. While Jacob Fearnley continues to rack up firsts, picking up his first French Open wins and going down to Norrie in the third round.

On the women's side, all three made it through to the second round with Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal winning their first French Open matches and for Emma Raducanu she had the misfortune to run into a revived Iga Swiatek in round two.

There was, though, a title and four finals to celebrate, with Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid winning their 23rd Grand Slam doubles title together and their six successive French Open doubles title with Hewett regrouping from losing the men's wheelchair singles title earlier in the day to the world No 1 Tokito Odo.

Hannah Klugman, 16, became the first British girl to reach the final of the junior competition in Paris in 49 years, which was also her first Grand Slam singles final and there was disappointment for Joe Salisbury and Neil Skupski, who lost out in the men's doubles final, having become the first British players to reach the final at Roland-Garros since 1936.

So in conclusion are we becoming a clay nation? No! Are we starting to enjoy it a bit more? Yes!

Someone who enjoys the clay with 20 of his 100 titles coming on the surface including three at Roland-Garros is Novak Djokovic but have we seen the last of him in the French capital?

He made a point of stopping in the middle of Court Philippe-Chatrier after his semi-final loss to Sinner, to take some time to applaud the crowd before reaching down to touch the clay.

He was asked in his post-match press conference if that was him saying goodbye to which he replied: ""This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know.

""Do I wish to play more? Yes, I do. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? I don't know. That's all I can say for the moment.""

Sensible words from a 38-year-old who will be 39 when the French Open rolls around in 2026.

I have heard from people close to him that he wants to and intends to play on next year but there are other factors in play. If he secures Grand Slam title No 25, does he do a mic drop having achieved everything there is to achieve in the sport? He still has Wimbledon and the US Open to come this year and will the body continue to play ball, that ultimately led to Nadal walking away when he did.

What a couple of weeks it has been in the French Capital, ending with a match that has transcended tennis.

            For five hours and 29 minutes on Sunday, tennis fans around the world were treated to one of the most absurd spectacles the sport has ever seen.
    


            In the longest French Open final – and the second longest grand slam final – in history, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner showed once again that tennis' future is in safe hands.

            With Novak Djokovic in the twilight of his career and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal already hanging up their rackets, it would be entirely natural for fans to worry about the considerable void the three greatest players of all time will leave behind them.
    


            But as Alcaraz and Sinner crushed groundstrokes at each other on the iconic red clay of Roland Garros, displayed pinpoint precision with deft drop shots and volleys, and chased down each shot with a fierce determination, nobody was thinking about the Big Three and whether their sizeable shoes still needed filling.
    


            Instead, it was one of those special sporting moments in which everyone watching knew they were witnessing history.
    


            That Alcaraz ended up the victor – improbably coming back from two sets down for the first time and saving three championship points to eventually win 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) – was largely immaterial to the final spectacle; Sinner winning that final-set championship tiebreak wouldn't have made the match any less remarkable.
    


            Even before Sunday's epic final, John McEnroe was so impressed with what he had seen from the pair in Paris that he made the case, though admitted it sounded “semi crazy to say,” that either Alcaraz or Sinner would beat the Big Three at their peak.
    


            “You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Rafael Nadal on clay, you know, he won this 14 times – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favored to beat Nadal, at his best,” he told TNT Sports.
    


            “Now, do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible – there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

            “But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.”
    


            Boris Becker, another former world No. 1, said the current level of tennis shown by Alcaraz and Sinner is “exactly the level” the Big Three played at.
    


            There is no doubt that an intense rivalry can elevate and even transcend a sport, and tennis has been blessed with no shortage of great rivalries over the past two decades.
    


            The drama and pageantry of the 2008 Wimbledon final between Nadal and Federer and the 2012 Australian Open final between Nadal and Djokovic elevated them both beyond the status of a mere tennis final. They are now singular events that beg the question: “Where were you when…?”
    


            We could now be seeing the blossoming of tennis' next great rivalry, with the head-to-head between Alcaraz and Sinner now at an intriguing crossroads.
    


            Alcaraz leads 8-4 but, crucially, has now won five matches in a row against Sinner and currently appears to have the world No. 1's number. The Italian is 111-10 since the 2023 Beijing Open, but half of the losses are to the man from Murcia, including all of Sinner's three losses in his last 50 matches.
    


            But a large part of the fascination in watching two rivals battle it out for the duration of their careers comes from the twists and turns, as both parties figure out weaknesses and try to gain the upper hand.
    


            For example, between March 2013 and January 2014, Nadal beat Federer five times in a row, before the Swiss turned the tide to win the next six matches between the two giants from November 2015 to March 2019.
    


            The future of tennis' newest rivalry will be the subject of much debate between now and the start of Wimbledon at the end of the month, but it seems a fairly safe bet that Alcaraz and Sinner – who have now won the last six grand slams between them – will be battling it out at the top for a long time to come.
    


            Alcaraz found it hard to explain what it was like playing in a match of that standard, describing it as “amazing.”
    


            “To put it into words is really difficult,” he told Eurosport's Lesly Boitrelle and Àlex Corretja. “Being two sets to love down against the No. 1 in the world, the level Jannik was playing at was unbelievable.
    


            “It's my first time coming back from two sets to love down. Honestly, I just poured my heart into it, I just tried to keep going, not think about the result and just play my best tennis in the third and fourth, and then the fifth.
    


            “The fifth set was just not giving up, it was just fighting and thinking point after point, and at the end of the fifth I was just playing with heart. Honestly, I don't know what I did to win this match. I'm really, really happy and proud with how I dealt with everything today.”

Wimbledon will be shown on a new TV channel for the first time having been covered by the BBC for 88 years. 

While the company will still remain the principle broadcaster in the action when it comes to this year's action at SW19, a new broadcaster will show the event for the first time. 

This is courtesy of a stipulation in Ofcom's Listed Events regulations, which permits 'secondary broadcasters' at major sporting tournaments.

This year's tournament runs from Monday June 30 to Sunday July 13 and costs the BBC around £60million per year.

But a new broadcaster will have rights to show highlights in 2025.

That honour will see them take over the daily 90-minute highlights show of the action at the conclusion of each day's play. 

TNT Sports will assume the five-year deal that was originally signed by Eurosport in May last year after it bought Eurosport - which disappeared from UK viewers' screens back in February. 

The BBC have broadcast events at Wimbledon since 1937, when matches from Centre Court were shown up to half an hour each day.

Coverage will come across BBC1 and BBC2, with all matches shown on BBC iPlayer, in addition to updates via radio, online and its app.

Carlos Alcaraz will be seeking a third successive Wimbledon title after beating Novak Djokovic in each of the previous two finals on Centre Court. 

Meanwhile, Djokovic has burning ambitions of his own to win a 25th Grand Slam title and hold the outright record for the most majors won by a single player in the history of the sport. 

But it is his rival Alcaraz who will come into the tournament as favourite after his astonishing comeback victory over Jannik Sinner to lift the French Open title at Roland-Garros on Sunday. 

At one stage, the Spaniard was two sets down and had to save three championship points before completing an almighty fightback to win his fifth Grand Slam. 

As is tradition, he will appear on Centre Court during the first day of the tournament, with women's singles champion Barbora Krejcíkova doing the same.  ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

The BBC have lost their monopoly on Wimbledon coverage in the UK, with a rival channel set to also broadcast this year's singles finals. The prestigious tournament has been carried by the Beeb for the last 88 years and that will continue in 2025. It is listed as a Category A event by Ofcom, meaning live coverage must be made available to free-to-air channels.

The rule also allows for paid networks to share live coverage, as long as it continues to be shown on terrestrial television. It has allowed a rival broadcaster to secure the rights to the Wimbledon singles finals in addition to the BBC. Last year, Eurosport extended a five-year deal with the All England Club but the network went off air in the UK in February.

It was bought out by TNT Sports, who have inherited the rights package and will show the Wimbledon finals for the first time. All other matches will be shown exclusively live on the BBC, which usually includes a choice of court via the red button service.

This year, the BBC will provide comprehensive coverage of Wimbledon across its two main channels. Every match will also be shown on iPlayer, plus coverage via radio, online and the app.

The presenting line-up is yet to be confirmed, but rumours suggest Andy Murray could make an appearance as a pundit. His coaching partnership with Novak Djokovic recently came to an end, opening the door to a broadcast role at SW19.

Murray was in the commentary box in 2018 after undergoing his first hip surgery but admitted that he did not enjoy the role.

Asked about his experience by Wimbledon legend Sue Barker last year, the Scot replied: ""I didn't [enjoy it] but not because of the people I did it with. The commentary box was tiny. It was a long time to be in there. I actually didn't enjoy it that much.""

Carlos Alcaraz is looking to make it three straight Wimbledon titles in 2025, having beaten Djokovic in each of the last two finals. Jannik Sinner, meanwhile, will be looking to banish his French Open heartache by claiming the honours for himself.

Djokovic will also be hoping for a campaign to remember at the All England Club. He is one title away from equalling Roger Federer's all-time record of eight, but will go into this year's tournament as one of the underdogs.

Emma Raducanu said it was good to test out her back in an exciting doubles match with Katie Boulter at Queen's. The British pair, dubbed ‘Boultercanu', beat Wu Fang-Hsien and Jiang Xinyu 6-4 6-2 in the first round on Monday in front of a packed, intimate Court 1 crowd.

Ahead of the tournament, Raducanu raised injury fears when she confirmed that the back spasms that haunted her before Roland Garros returned as she was planning to prepare for the grass swing, and she only started playing points in practice on Sunday. But she looked like her usual self as she and Boulter sealed victory on their debut as a pair.

Raducanu, who will also play her opening singles match against Cristina Bucsa on Tuesday, said: “Yeah, it was good to test it out and see how it goes in the match.

“And I have been managing it, and I think I will continue to. Hopefully it stays in good shape for tomorrow.”

The 22-year-old has rarely played doubles in her career, once teaming up with Clara Tauson in Washington three years ago. But she let Boulter take the lead and enjoyed her return to the doubles court.

“Yeah, for me, I was actually very nervous before the match. I don't know if Katie could tell,” Raducanu added.

“But probably more nervous than the singles, because I just didn't really necessarily know what to do, but I'm really happy once we got out there. Katie made me feel so comfortable, and I'm just so pleased to get a win on the board.”

Boulter, who has previously won doubles matches at Billie Jean King Cup partnering other British players and even teamed up with her fiance Alex de Minaur at Wimbledon, was happy to contribute to Raducanu's success.

“Obviously very pleased to get Emma's first win on the board for doubles,” she smiled.

“Yeah, I thought we played some very good tennis, considering it's our first time playing. I thought the level was really high. Very happy to get our first grass court win this year.”

In round two, Raducanu and Boulter will either face No. 1 seeds Lyudmyla Kichenok and Erin Routliffe or fellow Brits Jodie Burrage and Sonay Kartal. Boulter and Burrage sealed a crucial victory for Team GB over the Netherlands at the BJK Cup earlier this year.

But the British No. 1 believes her game also complements Raducanu's on the doubles court.

She explained: “I think we both serve and return very well, and we both have great volleys. I feel like if one of us hits a good ball, we're both capitalising on that.

“So naturally I already feel a lot more confident that Emma is going to put the ball away if I've hit a good shot. I feel like we are always going to keep making it very tough for the opponents. Yeah, I feel comfortable.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Second Serve: How fun French Open whetted Wimbledon appetite","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/crk25x3yn6xo","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 12:55:09 GMT","

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko reviews the French Open and looks ahead to the grass-court season.

Everyone needed a lie down after two intense French Open finals.

When Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz both fell flat on the court after winning the respective Roland Garros singles titles, it summed up a chaotic conclusion to a thrilling tournament.

It was a French Open that delivered the lot - and whets the appetite for the Wimbledon, which is just around the corner.

Recent editions of the clay-court Grand Slam tournament have been rather predictable.

Rafael Nadal regularly handed out one-sided beatings on his way to a scarcely believable 14 triumphs over a 17-year stretch, while Iga Swiatek did similar in her four victories between 2020 and 2024.

So two exciting singles tournaments this year - both going all the way with nobody able to predict which way they would turn - were a fitting finish.

Alcaraz facing Jannik Sinner in the men's final was not a surprise. But the first meeting between the ATP Tour's standout pair in a Grand Slam showpiece ended in an all-time classic to further fuel what is fast becoming a must-see rivalry.

That rounded out a men's tournament where Novak Djokovic showed he can still have a say at the top of the game.

Sinner and Alcaraz thriller proves rivalry here to stay

Murray open to coaching return 'at some stage'

Raducanu 'wary' when she goes out after stalking ordeal

Would you rule the Serb great out of winning Wimbledon for an eighth time and matching Roger Federer's all-time men's record for the tournament? Absolutely not.

But you'd think he would need to avoid defending champion Alcaraz and world number one Sinner on the way.

Throwing in a genuine British hope with Jack Draper - who is now fourth in the world - further fuels the excitement for the All England Club.

On the women's side, Sabalenka will remain favourite despite the painful nature of her defeat by Gauff.

Sabalenka's powerful game works on any surface and, although she fell agonisingly short of a first clay-court major, you would still back her to win a non-hard court major.

But, with eight different winners in the past eight editions, the women's singles at Wimbledon has been unpredictable in recent years.

Bring it on.

The debate about the French Open night sessions reignited. No women's matches were chosen for the primetime spot, leading to accusations the tournament did not think the female stars were worthy of it.

Rafael Nadal, a 14-time champion here, was given an emotional send-off following his retirement last year. The other members of the 'Big Four' - Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - joined him on court.

She might have insisted it was not a ""miracle"", but French wildcard Lois Boisson reaching the semi-finals in her first Grand Slam tournament was incredible.

Britain's Draper might have lost earlier than expected when he was beaten by 62nd-ranked Alexander Bublik in the last 16 in Paris, but he has reached a new career high of fourth in the world.

Italy's Lorenzo Musetti moved up to sixth after reaching the semi-finals, while American Tommy Paul - up to eighth after making the quarter-finals - is the third man in the top 10 to climb to a new career high.

Britain's Cameron Norrie is the sharpest riser in the top 100, jumping 21 spots to 60 after reaching the fourth round.

It always felt Iga Swiatek's reign as the 'Queen of Clay' was under threat going into Roland Garros - and so it proved.

The four-time champion's semi-final exit means she has dropped to seventh in the world - her lowest ranking since the start of 2022.

The biggest leap in the WTA rankings came, of course, from 22-year-old Boisson.

The French wildcard started her maiden Grand Slam ranked 361st and has climbed a whopping 296 spots to a career-high 65th.

Who says the British can't play on clay?

Norrie, 29, slipped perilously close to dropping out of the top 100 before reaching the Geneva final and then the Roland Garros last 16 for the first time.

Draper reached the fourth round and Jacob Fearnley advanced to the third round on his debut - losing to Norrie - while Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal both earned their first main-draw wins.

Boulter, Emma Raducanu and Kartal each continued their upward trajectory in the world rankings, with Kartal now a top-50 player for the first time.

Doubles pair Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury continued their progress as a pairing by reaching the men's final, while Alfie Hewett was runner-up in the wheelchair singles.

Hewett fought back from heartbreak, though, to clinch a sixth successive doubles title with partner Gordon Reid.

And 16-year-old Hannah Klugman underlined her huge potential by becoming the first Briton to reach the junior final in almost 50 years.

A host of LTA grass-court tournaments have already started in the UK.

On Monday, the WTA event at Queen's - the first time that a women's tournament has been held at the west London club since 1973 - returns.

Britain's Boulter, Raducanu and Kartal headline the event, which you can follow across the BBC.

On the ATP Tour, the grass-court swing kicks off with events in German city Stuttgart and s'Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands.

Tennis star Coco Gauff won the French Open women's singles title on Saturday, becoming the first American since Serena Williams in 2015 to claim the trophy. She defeated top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in three sets.

Gauff described the nerve-racking moment she lost the first match point, saying, ""Losing the first match point, I was … felt like I was holding my breath the whole game.""

The 21-year-old explained she thought the ball was going out, but when it didn't, she knew she needed just one more opportunity.

""That first match point was crazy because she shanked it and I thought it was going out, so I kind of felt my heart rate spike up and kind of getting ready to celebrate, and the ball went in. I was like, 'Are you serious?' ... I don't know, I was just like 'give me one more chance. God, give me one more chance. I'll take advantage of it this time,' and I did,"" she said.

After her thrilling victory, Gauff wrote on Instagram, ""I learned having doubt enter your head is impossible to escape, but not impossible to overcome.""

The 21-year-old, who also won the 2023 U.S. Open final, admitted she still has self-doubt despite her wins, which she said she tries to talk openly about.

""I realize that I just try to redirect those into positive thoughts, even if you don't truly believe them. But eventually, when those moments are tough and you don't know your back is against the wall, you don't know where to lean on, you try to lean on the positivity and the belief,"" Gauff said. ""I think that's what carried me through that match and honestly throughout the whole tournament.""

The second-ranked Gauff also responded to viral comments made by Sabalenka after the match. Sabalenka told reporters she believed Gauff won because she made so many errors due to the windy conditions that made it challenging.

""I was a little bit surprised, but at the end of the day, it was tough conditions and a tough match,"" Gauff said, adding that growing up in Florida, she played in the wind often.

""I know that when I play on a windy day, you're not going to win by hitting winners, you're not going to win by playing pretty tennis because the ball is moving, your footwork, everything … feels like you're in space and you don't know what is happening,"" Gauff said. ""Honestly and also when you're playing Aryna, she's such a tough hitter, so you know she's going to hit winners. You kind of have to make her make those mistakes.""

Sabalenka has since clarified her comments and praised Gauff for her win, saying in an Instagram story that her opponent was the ""better player"" and ""fully deserved to win.""

It's the second Grand Slam for the young American, who said she's realized that she is where she belongs.

""As I got older and realized like I worked so hard off the court and on the court to be where I belong, and there's nothing easy. I had to go out and win seven matches like everyone else does. … Especially having consistent results, I think I prove that more and more each tournament,"" she said.

Most of all, she's grateful for her family's support through everything.

""Having that support system is so important, especially playing tennis and being on tour since I was 15 and still developing. I'm 21, but I still have a lot more life to learn,"" Gauff said.

Up next, Gauff said she's preparing for Wimbledon.

...

The post French Open news: Carlos Alcaraz joins Novak Djokovic company with comeback heroics appeared first on ClutchPoints.

Carlos Alcaraz was on the ropes of his heavyweight championship battle at the French Open with Jannik Sinner. He was certainly down — but not out — when he trailed badly late in the fourth set. However, despite facing a deficit of 2 sets to 1 while trailing 3-5 and serving at love-40,  Alcaraz never gave in.

He overcame those three match points, won the next game on Sinner's serve and rallied for a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) to win his second straight French Open. He joined Novak Djokovic as the only player in the open era to overcome multiple match points to win two major events.

Alcaraz was also victorious in the 2022 U.S. Open, while Djokovic won the 2011 French Open and Wimbledon in 2019.

The match against Sinner will go down in tennis history as an all-time classic. In addition to the two players fighting it out for 5 hours and 29 minutes, both players displayed scintillating  ground strokes, brilliant net play, clever drop shots and dynamic serving throughout the French Open final.

Similar to other brilliant tennis battles between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe or Djokovic and Roger Federer, Alcaraz and Sinner wowed the crowd by bringing out the best in each other.

“The match is not finished until he wins the last point,” Alcaraz said in his postmatch news conference. “A lot of times people came back from match point down in final of a Grand Slam or even in other matches. I just wanted to be one of those players who saved match point in the Grand Slam final and ended up winning.

At the start of the match, Sinner appeared to seize control with his powerful ground strokes. He won the first two sets and earned a break in the third set. Sinner was on top of his game and Alcaraz was searching for answers.

The Spaniard was urged on by the crowd in Paris and he was able to register a comeback. Alcaraz was able to comeback from an 0-2 deficit an earn the victory for the first time in his career. He is now 5-0 in Slam finals and extended his head-to-head advantage over Sinner to 8-4.

The victor explained how he was able to mount a comeback under the challenging circumstances. “When the situations are against you, you have to fight, keep fighting,” Alcaraz said. “It is a Grand Slam final. It's no time to be tired and it's no time to give up. It's time to keep fighting, try to find your moment, your good place again, and just go for it.”

 OAKMONT, Pa. — The U.S. Open long has been regarded the toughest test in golf, and this year it returns to what is arguably the toughest course in America. 

 Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh is the talk of the 125th U.S. Open, a course built in 1903 that is more about being feared than being fair. The rough is as thick as ever. The greens are as fast as any. There's also the famous Church Pew bunkers between the third and fourth holes. 

 Scottie Scheffler shot 69 in his U.S. Open debut as a Texas teenager. He missed the cut the next day in 2016. Now he's the favorite as he comes to Oakmont having won three of his last four tournaments, including the PGA Championship. 

 Here is a look at what you need to know leading up to the U.S. Open: 

 Golf's second-oldest championship — it dates to 1895 — starts Thursday at 6:45 a.m. Players in groups of three will start on the first and 10th tees, morning and afternoon. The biggest names typically start on No. 10 in the morning or on No. 1 in the afternoon to get peak TV coverage. 

 The top 60 and ties make the 36-hole cut Friday and advance to the weekend. 

 NBC and its platforms get their first major of the year, and there is wall-to-wall coverage of the U.S. Open. 

 Thursday starts on USA Network from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Peacock takes over until 8 p.m. Friday starts on Peacock at 6:30 a.m. until 1 p.m., and then NBC goes until 8 p.m. 

 Saturday has USA Network from 10 a.m. to noon, and NBC goes from noon until 8 p.m. The final round Sunday starts at 9 a.m. until noon on USA Network, and NBC takes over until the end. 

 The odds keep getting better for Scottie Scheffler, the No. 1 player in the world. BetMGM Sportsbook has him at 275. Next in line is defending U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau . 

 Rory McIlroy was the second favorite on the BetMGM Sportsbook money line last week at 700. He missed the cut at the Canadian Open last week and goes into the U.S. Open at 1200, along with Jon Rahm. They are followed by Xander Schauffele at 2200. 

 Phil Mickelson needs the U.S. Open to complete the career Grand Slam and this likely is his last appearance. The 54-year-old Mickelson is at 25000. 

 Scottie Scheffler is being compared to Tiger Woods based on modern statistics. He is being compared to Jack Nicklaus for the way he plays the game from tee-to-green with minimal mistakes. He has won three of his last four starts going into Oakmont. A victory at the U.S. Open would send Scheffler to the British Open with a shot at the career Grand Slam. 

 Rory McIlroy is No. 2 and the Masters champion, along with becoming the latest player to complete the Grand Slam. There was thought the Masters title would give him freedom because he had gone 11 years without any major. But he missed the cut in Canada last week and said he found it hard to get motivated when he was practicing. 

 Xander Schauffele is coming off a year in which he won two majors. He was out with two months because of a rib injury. But he plays this major well. Schauffele has played the U.S. Open eight times and only once has finished outside the top 10. 

 Not to be overlooked is Bryson DeChambeau as the defending champion. He loves brute tests like Oakmont. And he was in the mix in the final round at the Masters and the PGA Championship. DeChambeau won his two U.S. Opens at Winged Foot and Pinehurst No. 2 . 

 The U.S. Open trophy doesn't have a name. The winner also gets the gold medal named after four-time champion Jack Nicklaus. The prize money hasn't been announced yet, but it was $21.5 million last year, with $4.3 million going to the winner. 

 The champion also gets a 10-year exemption to the U.S. Open, along with a five-year exemption to the Masters, PGA Championship and British Open. 

 The U.S. Open has gone the longest of the four majors without a playoff. That was in 2008, when Tiger Woods famously made a 12-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to force an 18-hole Monday playoff against Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines. That took 19 holes for Woods to win. 

 Since then, the U.S. Open has gone to a two-hole aggregate playoff on the Sunday after the conclusion of regulation. That has not been used yet. 

 There's been a lot of rain in the last week that has softened the course. The weekday rounds should be reasonably dry. But there's a good chance of thunderstorms on Saturday and lingering rain on Sunday. 

 Bryson DeChambeau got up-and-down from 55 yards away in a bunker, making a 4-foot putt for a 1-over 71 and a one-shot victory over Rory McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2. McIlroy had the lead late in the round but bogeyed three of his last four holes. That included missing a 30-inch par putt on the 16th hole and a par putt just inside 4 feet on the last hole. DeChambeau captured his second U.S. Open. McIlroy left without talking to the media.

In his first Grand Slam final, at Australian Open 2024, Jannik Sinner recovered from two-sets-to-love down to complete a remarkable victory.

Eighteen months on at Roland Garros, the world No.1 experienced what it felt like to be on the other end of that scoreline.

Sinner lost in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz after five hour and 29 minutes, the longest Roland Garros final in history and the second-longest major final ever, after AO 2012.

It was a match he led by two-sets-to-love, where he went up an immediate break in the third, where he held three championship points then served for the match in fourth, and where he came within two points of victory in the fifth.

“Today I had chances… so many chances I couldn't use,” Sinner lamented after the 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6[10-2] defeat, a match being discussed as one of the great Grand Slam deciders.

“Of course, happy to deliver this kind of level. Happy about the tournament still. But obviously this one hurts.

“It's a very high-level match, that's for sure. So happy to be part of this. But yeah, the final result hurts.”

Sinner stormed into his first Roland Garros final without losing a set, and made it 20 sets in a row in Paris – and 31 straight at majors – when he won the first two against Alcaraz.

This was just his second tournament back after a three-month suspension relating to his 2024 doping case; a few weeks earlier he returned in Rome and reached the final, where he also lost to Alcaraz.

Notably, they marked the first ‘big' claycourt finals of his career.

As the reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, Sinner had built a 20-match winning streak at the Grand Slams.

He was on the brink of joining Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic as the only men in the Open era to win three consecutive majors.

“I was ready,” Sinner said.

“I was feeling much more ready than in Rome. I think we saw that. So thinking or seeing my level today, it has improved since Rome, which as I said before the match, was my main goal to see where my level is at.

“Making final, of course, difficult to accept now because I had lots of chances, but this is the good part of the sport. Also today it got me the sad part, no?

“If you watch only the sad part, you're never going to come back, no? I believe I have improved as a player since last year, which is good. So we try to keep pushing.”

After winning his first three Grand Slam finals – the aforementioned AO 2024 final, plus the 2025 AO and US Open trophies – this marked the first time Sinner tasted defeat in a major final.



His rival Alcaraz improved to 5-0 in his first five.

And the Spaniard is proving a thorn in his side; while Sinner has built a 91-3 record against the rest of the field since the beginning of 2024, he's 0-5 against Alcaraz in the same span.

“We try to delete it somehow and take the positive and keep going. There are no other ways,” Sinner said.

“As I always said before my career started, I never would have thought to find myself in this position. Was not even a dream because it was so far and was not thinking about this.

“Now I find myself here, playing the longest match in history of Roland Garros in a final. It hurts this yes, but in other way you cannot keep going crying.”

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

How long will it be before Billie-Jean King comes out and says that the extraordinary 2025 French Open Men's Singles final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will shorten their careers by at least a year? That was what BJK famously said of the 2012 Australian Open final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, the longest ever men's Major Singles Final (at just under six hours), so it is only logical that she would say the same of yesterday's classic, which was the second longest ever men's Major Singles final (at just under five and a half hours). And yet BJK and other critics of the five-set format are wrong, because the Alcaraz-Sinner masterpiece was a necessary reminder of the greatness of five-set tennis.

Yesterday's French Open Final was so incredible that many tennis analysts, including The Tennis Podcast and indeed LWOT itself, are genuinely asking whether it was the greatest tennis match ever. That is probably a classic example of recency bias, whereby the most recent example of greatness in sport or art is immediately hailed as the greatest ever.

Yet the 2025 French Open Men's Singles final was undeniably a great match, certainly taking its place in the top five of the greatest men's finals ever, alongside Federer v Nadal at Wimbledon in 2008, the aforementioned Djokovic v Nadal in Melbourne in 2012, Borg v McEnroe at Wimbledon in 1980 (a match so good that the greatest film about tennis, Borg vs McEnroe (2017), was made about it) and Djokovic v Federer at Wimbledon in 2019. As undoubtedly the greatest ever French Open men's final, it easily merits its place even in such stellar company.

The only thing that let Alcaraz-Sinner 2025 down was its ending, which is why it probably only ranks as fifth in the greatest finals ever rather than as number one. It may have featured the first ever 10-point match tiebreak to decide a Major title (the Covid-ravaged 2020 US Open Men's final between Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev was decided by a regular tiebreak, with Thiem winning it 8-6), but that was actually the worst thing about the final, because it was so lop-sided. Alcaraz almost literally sprinted into a seven-point lead and eventually won it 10-2, albeit with the very last shot being a characteristic flash of Alcaraz brilliance.

Indeed, so (relatively) disappointing was the match tiebreak that it supported the argument that Grand Slam finals should only be settled with a match tiebreak after it goes to 12-12 in the final set, i.e. after the two players have effectively played the equivalent of an extra set to try and divide them. It is precisely because Federer v Nadal in 2008 went to 9-7 in the final set and Borg v McEnroe in 1980 went to 8-6 in the final set that they are likely to remain even more highly regarded by tennis fans and tennis historians than Alcaraz v Sinner in 2025. The endings in 1980 and 2008, with Borg and Nadal finally breaking their opponent's serve after a truly epic contest, mean that they will live even longer in the memory than the ultimately disappointing match tie-break in 2025.

Nevertheless, even allowing for the (relative) damp squib of its ending, Alcaraz v Sinner 2025 was unarguably a great tennis match – indeed, one of the greatest tennis matches ever – and a reminder that all the greatest tennis matches ever are five-setters. It is simply not possible to display the epic levels of endurance, both physical and mental, that both Alcaraz and Sinner demonstrated in a three-set match.

Yet BJK is not alone in questioning the continuing relevance of the five-set format. For example, Russell Fuller, the BBC's Tennis Correspondent, has increasingly suggested that at the Majors both men and women should play three-set matches up until the quarter-finals and then they should both play five-set matches thereafter.

Although there may be some merit in extending the final matches of a women's Major in this way, there is none whatsoever in reducing any matches of a men's Major, even in the early rounds. It is because men have to play seven five-set matches to win a Major that it remains not only the ultimate challenge in tennis but arguably the ultimate challenge in all of sport. As Mardy Fish, the former US professional who reached the quarterfinals at three of the four Majors (only failing to make the last eight at Roland Garros), memorably Tweeted or X-ed during the match: “Toughest sport in the world. No clock to run out. No timeouts to call. No subs to come in for you. No one to sit there and tell you what to do… This is as good as it gets guys.”

Fish is absolutely right: a five-set Major final is “as good as it gets”, not just in tennis but in all of sport. And tennis as a sport would be absolutely crazy to do anything to reduce it.

In the increasingly frenetic 21st-century, in which we are often told that human beings (and not just young ones) have an attention span that is greatly reduced from what it was in the past, other sports and indeed arts have attempted to reduce the amount of time they take, but invariably with negative results.

The classic example is cricket. First-class or five-day cricket might just be the greatest team sport ever invented and it is certainly the most complex, because it unfolds over a considerable period of time and therefore allows for numerous changes in momentum during that time. By contrast, 20-20 or T20 cricket, in which teams play for just 20 overs each for about three hours, is a vastly reduced form of cricket (and not just in time) that is usually just a “hit-it” game more comparable to baseball or even rounders than first-class cricket. It is truly a Big Mac compared with a Michelin five-star, five-course meal.

And the same is true of art forms. The greatest examples of any art form – Shakespeare's plays, Tolstoy's novels, Francis Ford Coppola's first two Godfather films or David Simon's The Wire in television – are inevitably, indeed necessarily, long. They simply have to be long if they are to be epic – that is, encompassing the fullness of time, with all its ups and downs, and infinite switches between joy and despair and back again.

At its best, as proven again triumphantly by Alcaraz and Sinner yesterday in Paris, five-set tennis is every bit as epic as a Shakespeare play, a Tolstoy novel or a Coppola film. It is a five-act drama that seems to encompass almost the entirety of human existence, or at least the entirety of human emotion. And any attempt to end it would be utterly foolhardy – a wilful destruction of the very greatest sporting encounter that has ever been created.

In the early 1980s, David Puttnam, the great British film producer of masterpieces such as Chariots of Fire, Local Hero, The Killing Fields and Midnight Express, famously said of the increasing trend for films to be watched on television screens rather than cinema screens: “Reduce the size of the screen, reduce the size of the dream”. Well, the same principle is true in sport: “Reduce the size of the fight, reduce the size of the might”. The 2025 French Open final between Alcaraz and Sinner, the latest entry in the list of the greatest tennis matches ever played, was a necessary reminder of the greatness of five-set tennis – and it is a reminder that we should never forget.

Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second Roland Garros title on Sunday (June 8). The match lasted over five hours, making it the longest final in French Open history.

Entering the Roland Garros final on Sunday, only two men had saved championship point en route to a Grand Slam title in the Open Era. Carlos Alcaraz made it three, joining Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic.

The Spaniard had never rallied from two sets down in his career, but the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings picked the perfect time for a first. The 22-year-old saved three championship points and battled past World No. 1 Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2) in a showdown that will never be forgotten.

""The match [is] not finished until he wins the last point. It [was] just one point away from losing the match. But a lot of times people came back from match point down in [the] final of a Grand Slam or even in other matches,"" Alcaraz said. ""So I just wanted to be one of those players who saved match point in the Grand Slam final and ended up winning.

""I just believe all the time. I never have doubts about myself, even [on] those match points down. I thought, 'Just one point at a time'. Just one point and then after [another] point and then try to save that game and keep believing. That's what I thought.""

The first man to save championship point in a Grand Slam final and emerge victorious was Gaston Gaudio at Roland Garros in 2004 against Guillermo Coria. Coria served for the title at 6-5 in the deciding set and earned two championship points, but made a backhand error and a forehand error, which allowed Gaudio to surge to a 0-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 8-6 victory.

Djokovic turned the tables on Roger Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final. The Swiss served for the championship at 8-7 in the fifth set, but let slip his opportunities to lift the trophy by pushing a forehand wide before Djokovic hit a perfect forehand passing shot for a winner on Federer's second chance. The Serbian eventually triumphed 7-6(5), 1-6, 7-6(4), 4-6, 13-12(3).

The big difference in the Alcaraz-Sinner match is that Sinner did not earn championship point on his serve, nor were his chances in the deciding set. The Italian had three opportunities at 5-3 in the fourth set with Alcaraz serving to stay in the match. Learn about how Alcaraz saved the three championship points.

This was the second-longest Grand Slam final in the Open Era. The longest was the scintillating five-hour, 53-minute duel between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final, won by Djokovic. The third-longest major final was at the Australian Open in 2022, when Rafael Nadal rallied from two sets down to stun Daniil Medvedev in five hours and 24 minutes.

Wu Yibing returned to the ATP Challenger Tour winner's circle in memorable fashion Sunday.


Competing in just his fourth tournament of the year, the 25-year-old ousted countryman Zhou Yi 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the championship match of the Texas Spine and Joint Men's Championship, which was the second all-Chinese final, and first to be held outside China, in ATP Challenger Tour history.




Wu has had great success in the state of Texas, where in 2023 he won the ATP 250 in Dallas to become the first Chinese player to lift an ATP Tour trophy. In Tyler, just 90 minutes east of Dallas, Wu secured his sixth Challenger title, extending his record amongst Chinese players.


The Hangzhou native entered the week as No. 401 in the PIF ATP Rankings and after advancing through qualifying and going all the way to the title, Wu is up 121 spots to No. 280.


Zhou, 20, was aiming to become the third-youngest Chinese winner in Challenger history.

In other Challenger action, Otto Virtanen kickstarted his grass-court season by winning  the Lexus Birmingham Open. The Finn earned a 6-4, 6-4 victory against American Colton Smith, who played his semi-final match earlier in the day due to Saturday rain.


The 23-year-old Virtanen has triumphed in all seven Challenger finals he's played, making him the fourth player in Challenger history to hold a flawless 7-0 record in title matches. Former World No. 10 Pablo Carreno Busta holds the record, having won his first 11 Challenger final appearances.

Virtanen, a wild card at this week's ATP 250 in 's-Hertogenbosch, is just the second Finnish player to win a grass-court title and first since Tuomas Ketola in 2000.


“It feels amazing playing on grass. I don't think we have a single grass court in Finland,” said Virtanen, No. 101 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I have always liked the surface and enjoyed playing on it. It's a classic style and it suits my game.


“It was a good match from my side and he put me in a tough situation and I had to do my best on the very important points.”


Peru's Ignacio Buse claimed his first Challenger title at the Neckarcup 2.0 in southern Germany, where he dropped just one set all week. The 21-year-old ousted Guy Den Ouden 7-5, 7-5 in the final.

“This is such an important win for me. I've worked so hard for this,” Buse said. “It was a tough week with all the weather disruptions, but I stayed calm and I'm just really happy today.”


Hugo Dellien lifted his 14th Challenger trophy and first of this season at the Unicredit Czech Open. The 31-year-old Bolivian defeated Chun-Hsin Tseng 6-3, 6-4 in the final, spoiling Tseng's quest for back-to-back titles. Tseng last week won the Vicenza Challenger.

5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix

Exclusive Q&A with ‘F1' movie star Javier Bardem

Valtteri Bottas has given his take on whether Red Bull or Alpine could be options for him as he looks to make a return to the grid, with the Mercedes reserve driver also revealing how far negotiations went with both teams last year when searching for a 2025 drive.

After spending three seasons racing for the Kick Sauber outfit, it was confirmed in November 2024 that the Finn would depart the squad at the end of the campaign, a decision that he admits arrived “too late” for him to find another seat on the grid.

“That was the issue,” Bottas explained to F1's Beyond The Grid podcast. “[I found out] after Brazil. I think some people knew before me so that really compromised everything, and that's obviously when I knew that now it's too late to sort out anything else, so a bit unlucky there.”

Bottas went on to return to Mercedes as a reserve driver for 2025, but the 35-year-old has made no secret of the fact that he is keen to get back to racing – and one team that could potentially have a vacancy in 2026 is Red Bull, the squad having yet to decide on Yuki Tsunoda's future.

Assessing whether the Milton Keynes-based outfit could be an option, Bottas said: “I don't know if they look outside their academy. They have so many drivers. They've got their junior team as well, the [Racing Bulls]. It's a tough one because it seems like it's not an easy car to drive.

“Max [Verstappen] is doing the job. He's really pushing almost beyond the limits of the car and whoever has been alongside him hasn't looked great. I just wonder if that car, to be driven fast, needs a driver with experience.

“I think they know that I'm keen to race. They know that I would be available for next year, but I don't know their mindset on that.”

In terms of whether he spoke with Red Bull about racing for them in 2025, the 10-time race winner added: “It was put down quite quickly because I think there's certain persons or a person within the Red Bull organisation that for some reason is not a big fan of mine, but that's life.”

Another possibility could be Alpine, with two drivers – Jack Doohan and Franco Colapinto – having already filled the seat alongside Pierre Gasly in 2025 as the squad continue to assess their options.

Bottas is keen to make a return to the grid, having been watching the action from the sidelines so far in 2025

“I think probably there has been some discussions,” Bottas explained. “I haven't really been involved, but I do have a management team who are always in the background seeing what is out there. They do have a Mercedes power unit for the future, which I think is a good call.

“They're on their second driver this year and I think the next races will show how that goes. Again, I think on a struggle street, let's say, experience can always help.

“But there's lots of politics in this sport. I don't have tens of millions to pay for a seat. Depends on the team but I do have some personal partners that could potentially join me, but still, not to an extent to some others. Let's wait and see a few races and see how things go. You never know if something opens up.”

Alpine were another team that Bottas spoke to regarding the chances of racing for them in 2025, but the Finnish driver suggested that the talks did not progress to a serious level as he expected to be staying with Kick Sauber ahead of their transition into Audi in 2026.

“I spoke earlier on last year to quite a few teams because I was naturally going to the end of my contract, but never really jumped in 100 per cent, again because I was always convinced I'm going to be part of the Audi project, which obviously didn't happen,” said Bottas.

Bottas assesses chances of racing for Red Bull or Alpine as he weighs up future options

Exclusive Q&A with ‘F1' movie star Javier Bardem

After a dramatic and at times controversial end to the triple header in Spain, the teams and drivers have all had a weekend without racing before making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean. Heading to a track that has often provided drama, there are plenty of unanswered questions arriving in Montreal.

Max Verstappen was delivering an excellent performance for the majority of the Spanish Grand Prix, as he and Red Bull went on the offensive and kept McLaren on their toes with an aggressive three-stop strategy.

READ MORE: Verstappen admits Russell contact ‘shouldn't have happened' in Spanish GP as Dutch driver nears race ban threshold

Then it all started to go wrong, with a late Safety Car undoing all of the good work, as Red Bull only had new hard tyres that they could fit to Verstappen's car, and he soon started slipping through the field. A controversial collision with George Russell followed, and earned the defending champion a time penalty that demoted him to 10th at the flag.

Verstappen took to social media the day after the race to say that the incident “was not right and shouldn't have happened”. Regardless of your views on that clash, though, the reality is the three penalty points Verstappen picked up have left him just one point away from an automatic race suspension.

Race Highlights: 2025 Spanish Grand Prix

The Dutchman will be walking that tightrope in both Canada and Austria before two penalty points expire, so this is a weekend where he will really need to avoid punishment. Will that lead to a change in approach, or is the best way to deal with it not to second guess himself?

Another question that came out of the Barcelona weekend revolves around Lance Stroll, who unfortunately had to withdraw from the race on Saturday night on medical grounds.

READ MORE: Aston Martin's Krack provides more background on Stroll's injury with ‘Plan A' for Canadian to race on home soil

Stroll was advised not to race by his medical team having been suffering from pain in his right hand and wrist, with a statement from Aston Martin stating the belief that the discomfort is related to a procedure he underwent following a cycling accident in pre-season training back in 2023.

Aston Martin were unable to replace Stroll in Spain because he had qualified the car, and at such an early stage was not able to offer a prognosis for whether he would be fit to return at his home race.

It remains to be seen if Stroll will compete on home soil after missing the last race in Spain

Stroll did race through the pain in Bahrain in 2023 despite still recovering from his injuries, and was described as feeling pain again over the past six weeks, so he's previously shown his level of determination to drive, but if Montreal comes too soon then Aston Martin will have to look to their reserve options – led by Felipe Drugovich – or bring in an experienced replacement at short notice.

While there was plenty going on behind them, the two McLaren drivers were largely untroubled despite Red Bull's attempts in Spain, and it was Oscar Piastri who came out on top with his fifth victory of the season.

READ MORE: Stella gives his take on Piastri's ‘cheeky' comment and how McLaren will manage intra-team fight going forward

It was an important win for the Australian, who had seen Lando Norris cut his lead at the top of the Drivers' Championship to just three points following a win from pole in Monaco just one week earlier.

The gap is out to 10 points again, but the pair remain closely matched and are always both in the frame when it comes to pole positions and victories, even if who has the upper hand fluctuates.

McLaren have repeatedly said they are aware that at some stage the battle is going to lead to a clash on track, but so far the two drivers have kept it clean. Whether that can stay the case as we move towards the midpoint of the season remains to be seen.

There is little to separate Piastri and Norris at the top of the Drivers' Championship standings

One of the more intriguing aspects of this season has been the emergence of different teams to threaten McLaren at different venues. In Miami, Kimi Antonelli took Sprint pole for Mercedes, then Max Verstappen won in Imola for Red Bull, followed by Ferrari leading the challenge through Charles Leclerc in Monaco.

The last race in Spain saw Red Bull again put pressure on at the front, but Canada has been a happier hunting ground for Mercedes in recent years, courtesy of lower temperatures and the track layout.

Of course there are no guarantees what the weather is going to do this weekend, and we have seen very warm races in Montreal, too, but for now it's looking like being on the cooler side and that should still play to Mercedes' strengths. A year ago, George Russell was on pole position in Canada – setting an identical lap time to Max Verstappen but starting from pole because he set it first – as the top seven cars in Qualifying were covered by just 0.28s.

Mercedes are hoping for another strong weekend, and the chance to hit straight back at Ferrari having slipped to third behind Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship last time out.

Russell and Mercedes starred during Qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix last season

Last year's Qualifying session was epic enough, but the race itself was also a thriller as rain provided challenging conditions for all of the teams and drivers. There were multiple names in the frame for victory and the top four all crossed the line within five seconds of each other, with Verstappen winning out.

Even if rain doesn't play a role in the race, though, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is a great one for the drivers to fight with each other on. The layout sees a lot of long straights into chicanes or hairpins, with Turn 1, the Turn 10 hairpin and the final chicane of Turn 12 and 13 – where the 'Wall of Champions' waits on the outside – providing overtaking opportunities.

DRIVER MARKET: Who's on Cadillac's driver shortlist as they prepare for 2026 F1 entry?

The presence of concrete barriers on the outside of many of those chicanes also means mistakes are punished and drivers have to be in full control at all times – any small error can lose a car a lot of momentum and leave them vulnerable to an attack from behind.

Throw in a huge crowd in a city that really embraces the race weekend, and it's usually a special atmosphere for the Canadian Grand Prix.

He and Gunnar Weidenfels detail the blockbuster unbundling of WBD: Decision ""reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together.""


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told Wall Street analysts Monday that the “bold choice” to effectively unbundle the company he helped forge three years ago “reflects our belief that each company will go further and faster apart than they can together.”


	“We are in the midst of this generational disruption, and things are changing, they've changed significantly in the last few months,” Zaslav said.




	The CEO and WBD CFO Gunnar Weidenfels (who will become CEO of the spun out TV networks business once the deal closes) hosted an investor call early Monday, outlining the rationale that led to the looming split and detailing a little bit about what each business will look like once they deal is complete.

	“These companies will be better aligned with shareholders based on each business's individual dynamics and growth prospects, more agile, more aggressive and creative in pursuing growth and sharper in their ability to deliver consumers more of the stories and entertainment they demand,” Zaslav said, adding that they expect each business to attract very different sets of investors.


	Zaslav will oversee the studios business, which will include the Warner Bros. film and TV studios and HBO Max, while Weidenfels will manage the global networks, including TNT, TBS, CNN and the former Discovery channels, as well as Discovery+. Notably, it will also include WBD's sports rights, with the CFO suggesting that the rights could give it optionality down the line: “The U.S. sports rights will reside at the global networks, and its management team will determine how best to monetize the streaming and digital rights over time,” Weidenfels said.

	











	But as strong an asset as the sports rights are, Weidenfels will also assume one of WBD's least desirable assets: Its tens of billions of dollars in debt.


	“It's safe to assume that the majority of the debt is going to live with global networks and a smaller portion — but a not-insignificant portion — on streaming & studios as well,” he told analysts.


	The executives remained coy on how the companies will team up after the split, though they indicated that they may still work together on things like distribution and ad sales, but that each company will also focus on their own business and do their own deals.


	Zaslav says of his future company, “We feel like we've found a very compelling strategy of quality,” leaning into HBO.


	“We put HBO back in [to HBO Max] for a reason. People see us as the highest quality streaming service out there,” Zaslav added. “We have the highest quality motion picture library, TV library, as all the HBO content. And then we have the ability with Warner Bros. Television in order to augment, which we did with The Pitt, which we're doing with Harry Potter. So we're the biggest maker of television.”


	“The piece that is up and down is the motion picture business,” he added, noting that it is more hit-driven and smaller compared to the TV business.


	“We have confidence in that business, but it's probably the more difficult business in terms of margin and swings,” Zaslav added, outlining the plan moving forward. “I think the thing that I feel best about is we put real discipline around it, but our overall content is underused — our great iconic content — rather than overused. So we'll be going more and more to the best content that we have, that people see and love all around the world, whether that's Lord of the Rings or DC. [WBD film chiefs Mike DeLuca and Pam Abdy] are really looking at mining the big brands. We're still going to do a lot of original, but mining those big brands that give us a real advantage in the marketplace.”

	











	As for the TV networks, Weidenfels told investors that “I have full conviction that we will see very successful networks for many, many years to come.”


	“The desire for people to consume content, especially from recognizable and iconic brands like TNT, sport, Food Network, CNN, etc., none of that is changing,” he added.


	Zaslav said that content from the linear networks account for about 25 percent of HBO Max viewing and that the split will likely come up during carriage negotiations, though a series of deals made over the past year mean no major talks are imminent.


	“There are times when you have distributors that really just want HBO Max, and we've ended up in protracted discussions trying to create a alignment around more of our products,” Zaslav said. “And there are times when people just want the free to air and the linear services.”


	But the split is also part and parcel with potential dealmaking.


	Weidenfels told investors that once the deal closes, each company should be “free and clear” to pursue deals, unlike the WBD deal, which had a complex structure that meant it would have to wait two years to do anything meaningful.


	“We do believe the transaction provides each business with greater ability to capitalize on potential options and opportunities that may arise, but I also want to stress that there is no such plan,” he added. 


	And in the meantime, there will be even more cost efficiencies to find and deals to strike.


	“Look, the important point for me is, yes, we will have to continue to focus on efficiencies and drive efficiencies as the traditional part of that business continues to see secular pressure,” Weidenfels said. “But I also think that we do have very significant investment opportunities and there will be more opportunity for driving efficiency and and transforming those brands into a into a digital future.”

Dennis Quaid, Jacob Tremblay and Martha Plimpton also appear in the Tribeca world premiere directed by Christian Swegal.  


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	It's been a particular pleasure to watch the blossoming of Nick Offerman's acting career in recent years. The actor, who rose to fame with his hilariously droll performance as Ron Swanson in the hit series Parks and Recreation, has never stopped working. But his talent has really risen to the fore lately, especially with his heartbreaking, Emmy-winning guest appearance in HBO's The Last of Us. 


	Now, with Christian Swegal's feature debut Sovereign — receiving is world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival before its theatrical release on July 11 — he's been given his meatiest film role to date. And boy, does he run with it.

The Bottom Line

	
	Topical and disturbing.
	



Venue: Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight Narrative)Cast: Nick Offerman, Jacob Tremblay, Dennis Quaid, Martha Plimpton, Thomas Mann, Nancy TravisDirector-screenwriter: Christian Swegal

									Rated R,
								1 hour 40 minutes			






	He's playing a role for which he has some previous experience. In Parks and Rec, his character was an anti-government libertarian. But what he played for comedy then is now deadly serious in this drama inspired by real-life events. The film, set in Arkansas in 2010, tells the story of Jerry Kane, a self-described “sovereign citizen” who proselyted against laws and governmental authority via appearances on right-wing radio talk shows and traveling around the Midwest delivering seminars about property rights and avoiding taxes. It's as if Ron Swanson had gone fully around the bend.


	A widowed, unemployed roofer, Jerry constantly faces eviction and home-schools his teenage son Joe (Jacob Tremblay, Room). He's a loving but disciplinary father, hectoring his son to say his prayers every night and reminding him, “Don't forget J.C.” Like many others of his ilk, he fervently believes in gun rights, illegally owning an AR-15 that gets him into trouble when he and his son are pulled over for a routine traffic stop.

	











	He's promptly arrested, with Joe being temporarily placed in a juvenile home, where he begins to feel some relief from his father's relentless intensity. The local police chief, John (Dennis Quaid, infusing his portrayal with low-key gravitas), understatedly tells Joe, “It sounds to me like your dad doesn't like the government so much. He has some…interesting ideas.” When Jerry is bailed out several days later by his on-and-off girlfriend Lesley Anne (Martha Plimpton, warmly affecting), he's even more extremist than before, threatening to sue the cop who arrested him, refusing to recognize the authority of the court, and walking out of the courtroom during his trial.


	Director-screenwriter Swegal intercuts the story of Jerry and his son with scenes involving the police chief and his grown son Adam (Thomas Mann), who's training to be in the force. Their relationship is loving but tense, with John constantly lambasting his son for such things as picking up his newborn baby whenever he cries. For a long while it's hard to understand why the narrative is split in such separate directions, until the stories fatefully intertwine in the film's shattering climax.


	Timelier than ever in its portrait of a radicalized margin of society rebelling against governmental authority, Sovereign might have benefited from a little more backstory as to what set Jerry on his non-conformist path. But it nonetheless works well on its own terms, especially in its depiction of the complicated relationships between both fathers and their sons.

	











	Offerman is simply terrific, supplying the outsized charisma necessary to make understandable Jerry's hold over vulnerable people while conveying the humanity that explains why his son and girlfriend are loyal to him. His character's tough-love approach is effectively dramatized in a digressive but powerful scene in which he gently but firmly forces Lesley Anne to confront her terrifying fear of horses. Tremblay, displaying a compellingly intense screen presence, is equally effective as the son who loves his troubled father enough to tragically follow in his footsteps.


	Also featuring an unfortunately underutilized (but always welcome) Nancy Travis, Sovereign benefits greatly from its empathetic, non-exploitative approach to its controversial subject matter. It's uncomfortable but necessary viewing.

Both 'Gypsy' and the George Clooney-fronted 'Good Night, and Good Luck' were shut out despite landing five nominations apiece.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast, THR.com


	Early in the 2025 Tony Awards, host Cynthia Erivo singled out an “up-and-comer” who landed his first nomination this year: George Clooney.


	The Oscar-winning actor-director was going places, Erivo suggested, but just hours later Clooney, who got a number of onstage shout-outs during the awards ceremony that aired live on CBS, left the Tonys without the Broadway play receiving a single award, despite being nominated for five honors, including a best actor in a play nod for Clooney, which he lost to Oh, Mary!‘s Cole Escola.




	The play, which has been breaking records with its multimillion-dollar weekly box office grosses, closed out its run with a matinée performance before Sunday's awards, after which Clooney quickly went back to his natural hair color, which he'd dyed brown for the show, and Saturday night's performance aired live on CNN in a highly touted special.

	Similarly, the latest revival of Gypsy, which landed five nominations, including an historic 11th nod for Audra McDonald, making her the most Tony-nominated performer in history in addition to holding the record for most awarded performer in Tonys history, was also shut out Sunday night, with McDonald losing the best actress in a musical award to Nicole Scherzinger for Sunset Blvd.


	Other notable shutouts included Dead Outlaw and John Proctor Is the Villain (seven nominations each), Floyd Collins and Just in Time (six nominations each) and Real Women Have Curves (two nominations), with Real Women‘s best shot at a win coming in the score category, where it lost to Maybe Happy Ending.












	Indeed, though Maybe Happy Ending had already received multiple awards by the time Darren Criss‘ name was called as the best actor in a musical winner, his win, on his first nomination, was still somewhat of a surprise as he was in a tight race with Jonathan Groff, who was gunning for his second Tony in a row.


Death Becomes Her only won one award, for best costume design, given to Oscar-winner Paul Tazewell, despite the musical going into the Tonys in a three-way tie with Maybe Happy Ending and Buena Vista Social Club for the most nominations with 10 apiece.


	In an upset, Purpose won the Tony Award for best play, besting Oh, Mary! and John Proctor Is the Villain, starring Sadie Sink, both of which had been buzzed about — at the box office and in the industry — and considered top contenders for the Tony. But Purpose, which follows a powerful family in Black American politics recovering from scandal, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year and saw five of its cast members nominated for Tony Awards, including Kara Young, who won a Tony for the second year in a row.


Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, the playwright of Purpose, also won best revival of a play last year for Appropriate, starring Sarah Paulson.


	The play category was particularly stacked this year, however, as it also included Sanaz Toossi's English, which won the Pulitzer in 2023.

Darren Criss also won his first Tony Award for 'Maybe Happy Ending' as did 'Succession' star Sarah Snook for 'The Picture of Dorian Gray.'


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Maybe Happy Ending, a musical about two robots falling in love, was the big winner at the Tony Awards Sunday, as the ceremony also awarded a number of firsts. 


	The musical took home the top prize of best musical, with Darren Criss winning his first Tony Award for leading the show, as well as four other Tonys, including best director of a musical. Nicole Scherzinger won her first Tony Award for her role as Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd. in one of the most hotly contested categories, beating out six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald.

	“Growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong. But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last,” Scherzinger said during her emotional acceptance speech.

Sunset Blvd. also won the Tony for best revival of a musical, for Jamie Lloyd's stripped-down reinterpretation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber classic. 


	Many of the races were particularly close this year, including best play, with Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' family drama Purpose taking home the trophy over Cole Escola's Oh, Mary! and John Proctor Is the Villain, starring Sadie Sink. 


	But Cole Escola won the Tony Award for best best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play, and the play's director Sam Pinkleton also took home a Tony. 


	Running to the stage in an outfit that paid homage to Bernadette Peters, Escola, who portrays Mary Todd Lincoln as a wannabe cabaret star, thanked the other nominees they had beat out in the category, including George Clooney. 

	











	“It's an honor to be in your company. And more than that, it's been a sincere pleasure spending time with you over these warm salads at all these luncheons,” Escola said. 


	In a celebrity filled season, Sarah Snook won the Tony for best performance by an actress in a leading role in a play for one-woman production of The Picture of Dorian Gray, in which she plays all 26 roles. The Succession star made her Broadway debut with the role, after performing the role in the West End. 


	“This means so much for a little Australian girl to be here on Broadway,” Snook said. “It is billed as a one-person show, and I don't feel alone any night that I do this show.” 


Eureka Day, a dark comedy about vaccinations, took home the Tony for best revival of a play. 


Kara Young also made history as the first Black performer to win two Tonys in a row, winning best featured actress in a play for her role as Aziza, a wayward friend thrown into the family drama of the Pulitzer-prize winning play Purpose. She has also been nominated four years in a row. 


	Natalia Venetia Belcon won best featured actress in a musical for her role as famed singer Omara Portuondo in Buena Vista Social Club, marking one of four wins the show, which was also up for best musical, took home. 


	Cynthia Erivo, who was this year's host, opened the ceremony with a backstage homage to Sunset Blvd., leading into a sung gospel number alongside the Broadway Inspirational Voices choir. Erivo, who won a Tony Award in 2016 for her role as Celie in A Color Purple, then took turns poking fun at the nominees in the audience, including Clooney, who she mentioned as a first-time nominee who was going places, and then herself. 

	











	“As they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property: ‘There's no place like home.' And Broadway has always been mine,” Erivo said.


	Erivo later greeted Oprah Winfrey in the audience and told her to look under her chair, under which she had placed a gift bag and items including candy and a model car. “You get a car,” she quipped. Winners who went too long in their speeches were played off by Erivo's singing. 


	Other starry names on Broadway, including Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, starring in Othello, and Kieran Culkin in Glengarry Glen Ross, were not nominated for Tony Awards and were not part of the ceremony. 


	Bryan Cranston, Allison Janney, Glenn Close, Jesse Eisenberg, Sara Bareilles, Jean Smart and Sarah Paulson were among the Tony Awards presenters. 


	Jak Malone won a Tony Award for best actor in a featured role in a musical for his roles in Operation Mincemeat, which includes a female secretary named Hester, a feat he accomplishes only with “simple adjustments to posture, voice and energy.” He was one of several nominees to hint at the current political environment in his speech. 


	“If you watched our show and found yourself believing Hester, then I am so glad to tell you that intentionally or otherwise, you might have just bid farewell to cynicism, to outdated ideas about that old binary and opened yourself up to a world that is already up there in glorious technical and isn't going away any time soon,” Malone said in his acceptance speech. 

	











	Michael Arden, who won a Tony for his direction of Maybe Happy Ending, also pointed to how “live theater confirms that no matter how different we may be from one another, we are all connected” and called on viewers to “Support the arts. Support artists. We need you now more than ever.”


	The broadcast featured musical performances by Death Becomes Her, Buena Vista Social Club, Just In Time, Sunset Blvd, Pirates! The Penzance, Maybe Happy Ending, Dead Outlaw, Flloyd Collins, Operation Mincemeat, Gypsy, Real Women Have Curves and a reunion of the original Hamilton cast, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr and Ariana DeBose and Jonathan Groff doing double duty performing with them and with Just In Time. 


	In the first half of the Tonys telecast, Stranger Things: The First Shadow largely swept the creative awards, taking home three design awards, while Maybe Happy Ending picked up two big musical awards, with writers Will Aronson and Hue Park winning best book of a musical and best original score. 


	Paul Tazewell won a Tony for best costume design of a musical for his designs on Death Becomes Her, in the musical's only win, after winning an Oscar for his costume designs on Wicked earlier this year. 


	Tony Award-winning actor Celia Keenan-Bolger received the Isabelle Stevenson Award for her advocacy work, including LGBTQ+ activism, and promoted Gavin Creel Fellowship, named after her late friend and beloved Broadway actor, which will provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors annually.

	











	Harvey Fierstein, a four-time Tony Award winner, received the lifetime achievement in theater award, for his work including Torch Song Trilogy, the 1982 play he wrote and starred in, which broke ground for its portrayal of gay culture, as well as writing the book for La Cage Aux Folles, Kinky Boots, Newsies and more. He received a standing ovation as he walked up and teared up before saying, “Don't make Mommy cry.”


	“What I find most humbling is the thought that somehow my journey means something to you,” Fierstein said.

The 'Last Week Tonight' host is sharing his thoughts on the drama between the tech boss and the president that's playing out on social media.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


John Oliver didn't wait too long during the latest Last Week Tonight episode to turn his attention to the U.S., where he said “things have been chaotic.” Specifically, Donald Trump and Elon Musk‘s “war of words” on social media.


	A feud between the president and tech boss erupted days after Musk stepped down as head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and then openly criticized the Republican Party's One Big Beautiful Bill. The two men then proceeded to battle it out on their respective social media platforms, Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), on Thursday, sharing a flurry of digital threats and insults directed toward each other.

	In one post, Trump claimed Musk had been “wearing thin, I asked him to leave,” before adding that “he just went CRAZY.” In response, Musk claimed with no evidence that the president was named in unreleased government files about the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “Have a nice day, DJT!” the tech titan added.

	“Setting aside that Trump being in the Epstein files is not a bombshell, it is a commonly held assumption,” Oliver quipped on Last Week Tonight about the public rift. “They've basically spent a full day fighting with big ‘Real Housewife energy.'”


	The British comedian then brought up Andy Cohen, who posted on X on Thursday, “LET ME HOST THE REUNION,” referencing the drama-filled Real Housewives reunion specials he typically hosts.


	Oliver said a reunion special “makes complete sense to me because at their core, these two men are real housewives. Both of them have hair that's expensive and wrong. Both have sketchy business ventures I don't fully understand. They both spend far too much time online, and if either of them isn't the center of attention for a single second, they will die.”

	











	“Honestly, the only thing that's missing is a messy in-person confrontation where Andy Cohen gets one of them to read a tweet and the other throws a daiquiri in his face,” Oliver joked before asking, “Why can't we have this?”


	While Trump and Musk had grown close over the past year, with the Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink CEO donating around $300 million to Trump's presidential campaign and Republican candidates ahead of the 2024 election, there now seems to be trouble in paradise.

The parody king is still showing younger performers from John Mayer to Clairo how to stand out — and stay in the game.


													By
												

	Rebecca Milzoff



Am I the first person to feel strange calling you ‘weird'?”


	John Mayer — bespectacled, grinning goofily, very much nerding out — is sitting across from “Weird Al” Yankovic, interviewing the Hawaiian shirt-clad parody music king, who is sitting across from him for his SiriusXM show, How's Life With John Mayer.


	“You can call me Al, like Paul Simon says,” Yankovic says with smile, before adding that the most normal thing about him is, probably, his pancreas.

	











	It's a funny quip, but also an understatement. Let's just get this out of the way: “Weird Al” Yankovic is, beneath his accordion-playing, polka-loving surface, exceedingly normal. He likes long evening walks to get his steps in. He enjoys seeing movies and trying out new restaurants with his wife and daughter, who just graduated college. He grumbles good-naturedly about the ongoing renovation of his home in the Hollywood Hills. (“It's going to look almost exactly the same as it did before, except it cost a fortune!”) The 65-year-old artist's one attempt at rock star behavior, back in his early-'80s heyday, was comically un-vain: On a touring rider, he requested, in the spirit of Van Halen's famed ban on brown M&M'S, “one really horrible Hawaiian shirt for every show I did.” (On that run, he did 200, and a collection that now extends to a storage unit somewhere in greater L.A. began.)


	Still, if not precisely weird, Yankovic is truly singular. His catalog can be divided into two types of songs: intricately crafted, meticulously arranged, hilarious yet never mean-spirited parodies of hits by acts ranging from Michael Jackson to Coolio to Nirvana to Lady Gaga, and original pastiches, for which he deep dives into artists' catalogs to create songs that, with eerie accuracy, mimic the sounds and idiosyncrasies of those genre-spanning artists.

	











	Between the two, he has accomplished feats usually reserved for the very artists he parodies. During each of the first four decades of his career, he has had entries on the Billboard Hot 100, and eight of his albums have reached the top 20 on the Billboard 200 — including his most recent studio release, 2014's Mandatory Fun, which became his first No. 1 on the chart. He has won five Grammy Awards and an Emmy. Billboard estimates he has sold 12 million albums in the United States (based on RIAA certifications pre-1991 and Luminate data from 1991 on).


	Incredibly, he's done all this without ever changing his essential “Weird Al”-ness. “From day one, there was never even a discussion that would not be about following his singular vision,” says Jay Levey, Yankovic's manager of 43 years and sometime creative collaborator (notably, they co-wrote the now nerd canon comedy UHF, which Levey also directed). “It's hard to find any career where there's literally no compromise, but we might be able to count on one hand the number of compromises he's made in his career.”


	Sometimes, that's meant turning down lucrative deals, like the $5 million beer endorsement that Yankovic passed on in 1990 because, he feared, the brand was “trying to make me into Joe Camel.” Many times, it's meant standing up to record-label executives, like when, amid his “draconian” first album contract with Scotti Brothers (an indie then distributed by CBS), he was asked to shoot 10 music videos on a $30,000 budget simply because he'd proved he could do one for $3,000. (“I'm like, ‘No. No, I can't!' ”)


	But just as often, it's meant embracing an open-to-anything spirit that seems to almost always work out in his favor. Yankovic decided very early in his career to ask permission of any artist he parodied — not because the law required it (it doesn't) but because he simply had no interest in making enemies. With very few exceptions, it turned out, the artists said yes, even supposedly impossible-to-convince ones like “American Pie” scribe Don McLean, who OK'd “The Saga Begins,” Yankovic's 1999 parody that essentially ­summarizes the plot of Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace. “When I heard his version, I thought it was better than the original. The sound quality was superb,” says McLean, who calls Yankovic a “straight-ahead good boy” who “could be on Leave It to Beaver.”

	











	Thanks to that combination of earnest good intentions, work ethic, backbone and obsession with quality, Yankovic finds himself in an unusual position today: He's no novelty relic of the '80s, but a truly cross-generational artist. In the past six years alone, he's portrayed Rivers Cuomo in Weezer's “Africa” music video, played accordion (and appeared in the video) for teen rock band The Linda Lindas' 2024 single “Yo Me Estreso” and lip-synced dramatically in a tux in Clairo's “Terrapin” video. “Growing up with his videos was a massive thing in my generation,” says Clairo, 26. “Back when YouTube was really simple, it really hit home for us in middle school to watch his parodies. He always knew how to draw people in.”


	He and his team will prove just how true that still is when Yankovic heads out on the Bigger and Weirder Tour this summer. It's his fastest-­selling, biggest-grossing tour yet, according to his agent, Wasserman Music's Brad Goodman, and his biggest by other metrics, too: an eight-piece band (his largest yet) onstage; first-time venues bigger than any he's played before, including New York's Madison Square Garden and L.A.'s Kia Forum; a mini-Las Vegas residency (the tour will open June 13 with six sold-out nights at The Venetian); and stops both expected (Red Rocks Amphitheatre) and less so (Riot Fest) on the route. And the concert itself is a trademark Weird Al spectacle: part rock show, part revival tent, part Broadway musical, all “joy bomb,” as actor and longtime fan Andy Samberg puts it.


	Whether it becomes a springboard for the next Weird Al era is anyone's guess — including Yankovic himself. Right now, he has no further plans to release albums; and since Mandatory Fun arrived over a decade ago, he's only sporadically released new music, most recently the 2024 “Polkamania!” single (the latest in his long-running series of madcap polka medleys, this one recapping the past decade's pop highlights, all sung in Yankovic's manic tenor). Around that time, his contract of roughly 20 years with Sony ended, and he decided not to renew with the label, or sign with anyone else.

	











	“Nobody owns any piece of me,” he says, exhaling. “I'm at a point in my life where if something isn't going to be fun or a pleasant experience, I have no problem saying no, even if it's a lot of money or a lot of eyeballs. I can do literally whatever I feel like doing.”


	Then again, for Yankovic, that's always been true.


	“When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about being the next Weird Al, like it's a position he applied for and got,” says Lin-Manuel Miranda, a lifelong fan who's now also friends with Yankovic. “And then you grow up and realize, ‘Oh, there's only one of that guy.' We're not going to see ­another Weird Al.”


On an overcast April afternoon a few days after the Mayer taping, Yankovic meets me for lunch at Crossroads, a vegan spot in West Hollywood where, years ago, he ate his first Impossible Burger. He's quick to jokingly note that he is not a member of the city's “vegan elite” — still, as he walks in, a man walking a golden retriever stops his phone conversation to stare and declare, “It's that Al Yanko-vich guy!”


	Despite his talent for writing songs about junk food (“My Bologna,” “The White Stuff”) and the fact that he once consumed the world's most ungodly snack, a Twinkie Dog, in UHF (watch and barf a little), he's been vegan since the early '90s.


	Chalk it up to veganism, staying out of the sun (“I melt in direct sunlight”) or following the directions of his longtime hair stylist, Sean James, very well (he never blow-dries those famous ringlets, hence their eternally bouncy and well-defined nature), but Yankovic has an ageless quality that lends many of his fans to liken him to mythological figures. “He's Santa Claus for nerds of a certain stripe,” Miranda says, a comparison Mayer had also made (as well as to Forrest Gump). His curls may be a little grayer, but his ultra-expressive face — acrobatic eyebrows in particular — reflects his eternal curiosity and up-for-anything-ness.

	











	As we settle in for almond ricotta-stuffed zucchini blossoms and meatless bolognese, Yankovic is particularly animated recounting his previous weekend, when he made his latest surprise appearance: his Coachella debut. To close out its surreal set, the crew from the cult-favorite kids show Yo Gabba Gabba! brought out a cast of characters both human (Thundercat, Portugal. The Man's John Gourley) and not so much (cartoon mascots like Sleestak, PuffnStuf and Duo the Duolingo owl) to sing “The Rainbow Connection” with its composer, Paul Williams — and, on lead vocals, Yankovic.


	“I've had a pretty bizarre life, so it wasn't like, so unusual,” Yankovic reflects. “But it was definitely a little bit of an out-of-body experience.” He admits that the “hey kids, let's put on a show” energy was fun and that the invite wasn't a total shock (having appeared on a season-three episode as an accordion-playing circus ringmaster, he's tight with the Gabba group). Still, he speaks of such invites with a kind of humble awe.


	“Nothing I've ever done was me thinking, ‘Boy, I hope kids discover this 40 years from now,' ” he says. Starting in the '80s, he released an album almost every year “because I was afraid I would be quickly forgotten. It was drilled into me: ‘You're a comedy artist, you're a novelty artist, you're lucky if you're a one hit-wonder — you're not destined to have a long career.' I wanted to grab that brass ring every time I went around.”


	Coming up concurrently with the birth of MTV, and savvily taking advantage of it, helped Yankovic snatch that ring. He had a keen ear for (and good taste in) hits at a time when, thanks to both MTV and top 40 radio's prevalence, a monoculture reigned — and perhaps even more importantly, he knew the power of a viral video before such a thing existed.

	











	Tweaking hits like Jackson's “Beat It” (“Eat It”) and Madonna's “Like a Virgin” (“Like a Surgeon”), Yankovic created new songs that, thanks to his painstaking re-creations of their arrangements, were immediately recognizable but rewarded repeated consumption — as did their accompanying videos, in which Yankovic demonstrated his incredible eye for detail and formidable acting chops. “MTV was on like video wallpaper in the background 24 hours a day,” he says of that time. “They were hungry for content, and I was anxious to give them content.”


	Since then, Yankovic's understanding of the promotional power of visuals has remained prescient — take when, leading up to Mandatory Fun's arrival, he insisted on releasing a music video on YouTube each day (not all at once, as some advised) to whet fans' appetites for the album. And his genre-agnostic approach to making music has proved ahead of its time, too. Before hip-hop was widely accepted as pop, he was especially drawn to rap. “A lot of pop songs are very repetitive,” he says. “How can I be funny in seven syllables, you know? But rap songs, I mean, it's nothing but words, and it's easy to craft jokes that way.”


	Parodies like “Amish Paradise” (Coolio's “Gangsta's Paradise”) and “White and Nerdy” (Chamillionaire's “Ridin' Dirty”) are among his most streamed — though he's been equally adept at literally any microgenre he takes on, from just-electrified Bob Dylan (“Bob,” entirely comprising palindromes) to arty new wave (the Devo pastiche “Dare To Be Stupid”) to crunchy Detroit garage rock (“CNR,” a tribute to Charles Nelson Reilly through the lens of The White Stripes).


	“The more you listen to him, the more you get access to making [any genre of parody] sound legitimate,” says Samberg, who calls Yankovic the biggest influence on his own comedic music group, The Lonely Island. “The nature of what he does is incredibly populist. He's not snooty about it; he's like, ‘This is what the kids like, and as long as I have a good angle comedically, I'm going to do it.' And because of that, it's always appealing to young people.”

	











	Growing up in Compton-adjacent Lynwood, Calif., Yankovic listened to rock radio, but as a teenager found playing the accordion a bit solitary. (His friends' rock bands weren't really interested in an accordionist joining up.) “When you take accordion lessons, I think the high-water mark is ‘Maybe someday I'll play in an Italian restaurant or at a wedding,' ” he says with a laugh. “I guess I was shameless. I grew up a complete nerd in high school. And when you're not somebody that's socially acceptable, you kind of have nothing to lose. I kind of held on to that mentality: Like, you know, ‘Who cares?' ”


	He didn't look to any particular musician's career trajectory as one he could follow. “It was more cautionary tales” — and one was especially haunting. One of his idols was Allan Sherman, the satirical singer best known for his 1963 summer camp send-up, “Hello Muddah Hello Fadduh!” “He was the last person to have a No. 1 comedy album before me,” Yankovic continues. “He had three No. 1 albums on, like, the pop charts — incredible! But within a few years, he completely burned out. He made some terrible choices in his personal and professional life and just went off into obscurity and sadly died a few years later. So I was always more concerned about, ‘Don't mess it up. Keep doing what you're doing and just try not to make bad choices.' ”


	“In a way, we're almost always looking over our shoulders at that,” his manager Levey says. He cautiously admits that he and Yankovic have ­finally reached a level in his career where they're “no longer at the point where every year [of continued success] is a surprise,” then adds, “I don't actually even like saying that out loud because it sounds like you're taking something for granted.”


	But if Sherman was a rocket that blasted off only to burst into flames, Yankovic has been the opposite: one that, as Levey puts it, has kept steadily traveling through space — maybe sometimes at a slower speed than others, but never plummeting back down to Earth, buffeted by the most unexpected boosters. Like, say, Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, the 2022 parody of a music biopic that Yankovic co-wrote, starring Daniel Radcliffe in the titular role. Despite at first airing only on the Roku Channel, it won almost universal acclaim and a prime-time Emmy, while expanding Yankovic's universe yet again.

	











	“His longevity is a testament to his ability to be himself and stick to what his taste is, because it's so specific,” Radcliffe says. (“Bob” is his favorite Yankovic track, and he took the opportunity on set to ask his hero how he came up with all the palindromes.) “He threads a really hard-to-thread needle between wholesome fun and something … genuinely deranged and very, very strange. And in a way that is not affected.” At a time when the culture values authenticity above all else, Yankovic is a walking example of it — never not himself.


	Unwittingly proving the point, Yankovic gasps in glee as our lunch ends. “Mochi doughnuts!” He shows me a photo his wife has just texted him: a box of the treats for dessert later. Somewhat sheepishly, he explains the occasion: “Eric Idle is coming over for dinner tonight. That's my big flex for today.”


Later that afternoon, Yankovic meets me in a park near Coldwater Canyon called Tree People. He looks a little like a more aged version of his faux-Indiana Jones in UHF: Hawaiian shirt (a Goodwill buy), sensible shoes, safari hat shielding the waning sun.


	“I'm gearing up for a big tour, so I'm mostly just making sure I don't have a heart attack onstage or pass out or something,” he says of the walks he takes in spots like this. “I think I've lost 20 pounds in the past couple months just because I'm not, like, eating junk food at midnight anymore.”

	











	Yankovic's last tour outing didn't require much of a physical regimen. In 2022 and 2023, he took to smaller venues for The Unfortunate Return of the Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour, a follow-up to the first Vanity Tour in 2018. The idea, he recalls, occurred to him when “I was putting on my ‘Fat' suit for the thousandth time and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it just be nice to like, go out onstage and play the songs, sit on a stool and have an intimate evening with fans?' ”


	So Yankovic eschewed the usual production level of his tours — costumes, wigs, the parody hits — for a concept, his agent Goodman says, that the musician himself wasn't entirely convinced would work. Instead, it allowed him to visit new, smaller major-market venues (Carnegie Hall, Tennessee's The Caverns) and ­strengthen his presence in off-the-beaten-path markets (like, say, Huntsville, Ala.) while superserving his ride-or-die fans. When the concept returned in 2022, he played 162 Vanity shows globally (extending into the next year).


	“I loved it, the band loved it, the people who showed up loved it, and it definitely scratched that itch,” Yankovic says. “And now,” with the Bigger and Weirder Tour, he's back to “doing a show for everybody.”


	For Bigger and Weirder, Yankovic is in self-described “overpreparer” mode, the hyper-organized creative core of his team. “I came up with the setlist a year ago. I gave the band” — three of whom, as of our meeting, he has yet to meet — “their marching orders and said, ‘Here's the setlist, here's your charts, here's the demos, here are the rehearsal days.' ” He personally chooses and edits all the show's video content — clips of Weird Al in Pop Culture (say, on The Simpsons or 30 Rock) over the years that will play between songs and give him and the band time for the most frantic element of the show, which the audience never sees.


	“We have stage props, wigs, a lot of costume changes, and a big portion of what we need is a quick-change area behind the scenes onstage, usually 40 by 20 feet,” says Melissa King, his tour manager of nearly 20 years. On Bigger and Weirder, Yankovic will do 20 costume changes, give or take a jacket or hat; his band members will do nine; and all will occur in 45 seconds maximum.


	That backstage planning ensures that in front of the audience, the man who has spent his career parodying rock and pop stars is free to embody one himself. “When I speak to [talent] buyers and say, ‘Have you seen the show?,' if there's a pause, for sure I know the answer is no,” Goodman says. “Because if you've seen the show, it's just an immediate ‘Yeah, of course, it's incredible.' ”

	











	Onstage, Yankovic isn't just physically “working his ass off,” as Samberg says. “As a vocalist, he's f–king incredible,” Radcliffe marvels. “He has this amazing, clear tone. His range is so impressive — he does things to his voice that, as somebody who sings a bit in musicals sometimes, if I tried that I'd hurt myself.”


	Despite the “bigger” aspects of this tour — like how it will use three trucks instead of the usual one — King is still one of just 11 people comprising the crew. “It's very lean, but it works because we all work together,” she says. “Al's a genuine, kind person, and because he is, that's the way everyone in our camp is.” That ethos extends to both the fans who'll attend (“There aren't many arseholes who are Weird Al fans,” Radcliffe observes) and how Yankovic treats them: According to Goodman, he's kept maximum ticket prices for Bigger and Weirder to $179.50 and has always refused to engage with platinum ticketing.


	Right now, the tour is Yankovic's focus. When he decided against renewing his Sony contract, Levey says, they tested the waters with “very limited outreach” to a mix of indie and major labels. “And we got great offers and I brought those offers to him, and he thought about it and said, ‘I'm really loving this feeling of not being under contract to anybody … Please tell these people how appreciative I am of their generous offers and we're just not going to accept any of them.' ”


	He's now independent in the truest sense: He has an imprint, Way Moby, that's technically now his label, but he describes it more as existing for theoretical recording purposes. He figures he'll put out a single here and there, contribute to soundtracks if he's asked and, as always, remain open to what may come — like making a surprise appearance last November to duet with Will Forte on Chappell Roan's “Hot To Go!” at a charity event or developing a Broadway Weird Al jukebox musical that he says is in the very earliest creative stages, a “bucket list” project.

	











	“When [he had] the No. 1 album in the country, that was such a triumphant moment. I remember us celebrating,” Samberg recalls. “It just shows you — I don't think anyone else will really touch that space. It's his space. No one is going to say, ‘I'm going to do what Al does,' 'cause good luck. He owns that until he doesn't want to do it anymore.”


	The world, Yankovic knows, is also not the same as when he first became famous. “I got a record deal, I got on MTV, and I kind of had the market to myself,” he reflects. “Now the playing field has been so leveled that anybody can upload their material to YouTube or various portals like that. And if the stuff is good, chances are people will eventually see it. I'd like to think that if I was coming up now, I'd still do OK, but it would just be more of a challenge.”


	It's a generous sentiment, a reminder that, as Miranda puts it, one of Yankovic's many talents is also “reading the room.” But in its humility, it's also a reminder that, flooded as the market may now be with funny people on the internet, none of them, still, are doing it like Weird Al: the 65-year-old who once thought he'd play accordion at weddings and Italian restaurants, who's about to make his Madison Square Garden debut.

Finneas has spoken out after being tear-gassed while attending what he called a “very peaceful” protest in downtown Los Angeles.


	The Grammy-winning artist and producer took to Instagram on Sunday (June 8) to describe the scene, where protesters rallied against recent mass ICE raids in Southern California. “Tear-gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown. They're inciting this,” he wrote on his Story, referring to escalating tensions sparked by federal agents and military presence in the city.


	The protest was one of several erupting across the city after President Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops into L.A. — a move that California officials called unconstitutional and inflammatory.

	Among the scenes shared by Finneas: a viral video showing Australian 9News reporter Lauren Tomasi being struck by a rubber bullet while covering the unrest. Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd control munitions to disperse those gathered, with one hitting Tomasi in the leg, prompting her to cry out and grab her calf while continuing to report.

9News later issued a statement confirming the incident and affirming the safety of Tomasi and her camera operator. “While reporting from protests in Los Angeles, 9News reporter Lauren Tomasi was struck by a rubber bullet,” the statement read. “This incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers journalists can face while reporting from the frontlines of protests, underscoring the importance of their role in providing vital information.”

	California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the deployment in a letter sent to the White House on Sunday, calling it “a serious breach of state sovereignty.” He was in Los Angeles meeting with law enforcement and local leaders but did not confirm if he had spoken with Trump since the raids began.


	“What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,” said Mayor Karen Bass in an afternoon press conference. “This is about another agenda — this isn't about public safety.”

	











	The White House quickly fired back. “It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,” said spokesperson Abigail Jackson in a statement.


	Finneas, who has previously used his platform to advocate for immigrant rights and social justice, also encouraged military personnel to resist unconstitutional orders. He shared the GI Rights Hotline — 1-877-447-4487 — along with a message soundtracked by Tom Petty's “I Won't Back Down.”


	The protest he attended was one of several that grew increasingly tense over the weekend, including one outside a federal building where immigrants were reportedly detained after arriving for routine check-ins with ICE. Lawyers say some detainees were escorted to basement holding areas without notice.

Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong has joined the artists condemning ICE raids amid the ongoing L.A. protests.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong has shared a message of support amid protesters rallying against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration's recent deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.


	On Sunday evening (June 8), Armstrong posted a protest snippet from downtown L.A. via Instagram Stories, captioned with a middle-finger emoji and an ice cube. The clip featured a live recording of “F— Off,” a track from Saviors (Édition de Luxe), the deluxe version of Green Day's 2024 album, released in May 2025.

	











	The post comes amid increasing criticism of federal raids across Southern California, which saw ICE agents detaining dozens of individuals alleged to be undocumented immigrants. The crackdown was quickly followed by the unrequested deployment of National Guard troops to L.A., marking one of the first times in modern history that the Guard was sent to a state without the governor's approval.




			Trending on Billboard		







	California Governor Gavin Newsom slammed the move as a “serious breach of state sovereignty” in a letter issued Sunday afternoon, while L.A. Mayor Karen Bass echoed that sentiment, calling the situation “provoked chaos” during a press conference.


	Armstrong's statement also follows comments from Finneas, who claimed he was tear-gassed while attending what he described as a “very peaceful protest” in downtown L.A.

	











	The Grammy-winning producer and artist posted several Instagram stories, writing: “Tear-gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown — they're inciting this.” Finneas also reposted a video showing 9News Australia correspondent Lauren Tomasi being struck in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting live from the scene.


	The protests began Friday in response to ICE raids at several Los Angeles-area businesses. By Sunday, the National Guard had arrived in the city, and images of heavily armed officers confronting peaceful demonstrators, including journalists and musicians, began flooding social media.


	For Armstrong, this latest act of resistance fits squarely within a decades-long tradition of speaking out against institutional injustice. Green Day's discography is filled with political commentary, from the anti-Bush sentiment of American Idiot to more recent critiques of gun violence and authoritarianism.

Some attendees of a Tribeca Festival post-screening panel on Friday appeared to be under the impression that it was a Cyrus concert.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	Some Miley Cyrus fans who paid top dollar to attend the Tribeca Festival debut of the singer's new visual album, Something Beautiful, appeared to be under the impression that a post-screening Q&A would include a concert. When Cyrus sat down with the film's co-directors, Brendan Walter and Jacob Bixenman, and producer Pano Cosmatos to discuss the project on Friday night, they were interrupted by hecklers who demanded that she sing a song.

	











	“We thought this was a concert. We paid $800,” yelled one disgruntled attendee in a video posted on X. After initially appearing to ignore the shouts and smiling through the disruption, Cyrus looked confused and asked, “what?,” before turning to face the audience when the woman added, “Are you actually going to sing?” The interruptions continued, with a man yelping, “Miley, sing ‘The Climb!'” 


	Always happy to make her fans happy, Cyrus acquiesced and began an a cappella version of the song, telling the crowd, “You have to start it,” before giving them the first verse of the 2009 Hannah Montana: The Movie hit. “I can almost see it/ That dream I'm dreaming/ But there's a voice inside my head saying/ You'll never reach it,” she sang, gently berating the crowd for “not singing” as she finished the second verse.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Cyrus appeared unfazed by the disruptions in an Instagram pic post from the premiere on Saturday, in which she wrote, “Seeing Something Beautiful on the big screen at @tribeca @beacontheatre surrounded by the screams of the audience, was so worth every bit of effort lovingly labored into this visual album. Tonight was emotional, deep, fun & fabulous. All my favorite things, but YOU the crowd were my absolute favorite of all. I love you.”

	











	The Tribeca site clearly promoted the event as a screening of the 55-minute visual album, followed by “an exclusive conversation with Miley Cyrus,” with no mention of a musical performance. Something Beautiful will open in theaters on Thursday (June 12).

Billboard got to live the ultimate ""Loba Pack"" experience with the Colombian superstar.


													By
												

	Jessica Roiz


Assistant Editor, Latin


	One thing is to go to a Shakira concert. Another is to walk with her as part of her “Loba Pack.” It's a whole other level. 


	On Friday (June 6) morning, I received a call from Sony Music US Latin's publicity associate director. I usually don't answer phone calls, but I was curious because it's rare for him to call me too. 


	After a quick “good morning, how are you?” he cut to the chase with what literally felt like he was popping the big question: “Jess, if I get you a spot to walk with Shakira at her concert tomorrow, would you?”

	I gasped and without hesitation said “YES!” After we hung up, I smiled, and for some reason—though I've had a very fruitful and successful career in Latin music—thought “omg, I finally made it.”   


	Just hours before Shakira was set to perform her second sold-out stadium in Miami on Saturday (June 7), I received an email titled “Camina con la loba” (walk with the she wolf) with further instructions—arrival time, meeting location, point of contact, and a consent waiver to be filmed. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Once at the Hard Rock Stadium, I was unexpectedly escorted to a VIP suite, where drinks and bites were provided. Then, at around 7:50 p.m., they took me backstage to meet up with the rest of the crew that was going to walk with Shakira. Among the “loba pack” were social media influencer Jessica Judith, Miss Universe Nicaragua 2018 Adriana Paniagua, and TV personality Clarissa Molina. Yours truly from Billboard, and select Univision and Telemundo reporters were also in the mix. 

#shakira #lmynlworldtour 


	While we waited for our big moment to shine, we were handed raincoats in an aluminum foil material and futuristic sunglasses. It was also your typical 100-degree weather in Miami, but every drop of sweat, humidity, and drenched makeup was worth it—especially because the “loba pack” kept singing Shakira songs while we waited. 

	











	At 9:15 p.m., the Colombian artist showed up in a golf cart wearing a sparkly jumpsuit. She hopped off, briefly greeted her unit of empowered wolves, and we all got into position for showtime. 


	Around 50 people walked with the artist into the packed stadium. We were jumping, we were ecstatic, we were high-fiving people in the audience, we were capturing the moment on our phones. With all the attitude and energy in the world, the “loba pack” dropped off Shakira at the stage, where she officially kicked off with the magnetic, club-ready track “La Fuerte.” 


	We continued to enjoy the first song from the aisles, before walking to our seats. Once at my spot, I was in complete awe of Shak's two-hour-long spectacle, where she sang the hits, the oldies, had surprise guests Manuel Turizo, Alejandro Sanz, and Bizarrap, but above all, captivated fans with her hips that don't lie—literally.


	Undeniably, Shakira is Shakira, but now, as a certified “loba” (and thanks to this wonderful concert experience), there's no doubt in my mind why she ranked No. 1 on Billboard's “Female Latin Pop Artists of All Time” list. 


	The Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran tour will continue June 11 in Texas and wrap June 30 in California.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Jonathan Daviss is set to star as venerable hip hop artist Snoop Dogg in the definitive biopic from Universal Pictures. Best known for Outer Banks, Daviss takes the lead role days after the studio set Craig Brewer to direct the film.


	The film will be produced by Snoop Dogg, Brian Grazer and Death Row Pictures president Sara Ramaker.


	Daviss hails from Houston and played the role of Pope in the Netflix YA drama Outer Banks. In 2022, he starred in Netflix's Do Revenge opposite Sophie Turner, Maya Hawke and Austin Abrams. Previous credits include Age of Summer and Edge of the World.

	











	The film is a look at how Calvin Broadus Jr. entered into the West Coast hip hop fray. Taking the moniker Snoop Doggy Dogg (he'd later drop the middle name), Snoop brought his laid back drawling delivery and sharp lyrics to Death Row Records, where he worked with Dr Dre on his smash debut album Doggystyle. He broadened into other platforms to the point he might well be seen rubbing elbows with Martha Stewart or getting in the pool with Michael Phelps during the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he became one of the high points of that Olympiad on NBC and Peacock.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The film is the first project under Death Row Pictures' overall deal with NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios as the label moves into motion pictures. Numerous of Snoop's recent forays are tied to NBCUniversal; he's returning to NBC's musical competition series The Voice this fall, reclaiming his red chair for Season 28.


	The Snoop Dogg film becomes Universal's third outing about the formative stories of hip hop icons. The others include the Eminem-starrer 8 Mile, and Straight Outta Compton traced the roots of the seminal rap group N.W.A and its rise to become one of the most influential acts of the gangsta rap and West Coast hip hop subgenres.


	Universal SVP Production Development Ryan Jones and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project for the studio.

	











	Daviss is represented by Monster Talent, Innovative Artists and Skrzyniarz & Mallean.

Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series, produced by HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros. Television.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Warner Bros. Discovery is officially splitting into two separate companies.


	The David Zaslav-led conglom had signaled the move with an internal reorganization that grouped its businesses into Streaming & Studios and Global Networks earlier this year. On Monday — a bit earlier than many expected — it announced the separation will become an actual split along the lines of what Comcast has underway spinning out its cable networks from NBCUniversal, in a seismic reconfiguration of the U.S. media business.


	Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels becomes president and CEO for Global Networks. Both will continue in their present roles at WBD until the separation, which is expected to close in mid-2026.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world. It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history,” said Zaslav in a statement. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape.”


	Zaslav's new Streaming & Studios outfit will consist of Warner Bros Television, Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, as well as their film and television libraries. Global Networks, meanwhile, will include premier entertainment, sports and news television brands around the world including CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, top free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as the profitable Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report.


	Legacy media is responding to major shifts in the business led by the rise of streaming and faster-than-anticipated decline of linear television that has left investors confused and stock prices floundering. Comcast has said it expects the initiative for its cable spinoff, called Versant, to be completed by late 2025. The idea is that cable network groups like these two, which still throw off significant cash and revenue, could merge or be acquired by buyers like private equity firms that would manage their decline, so these splits are likely to presage a period of media M&A.

	











	Legacy media companies have been making similar moves of late. Lionsgate's split from Starz was confirmed last month.


	“This separation will invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles. This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value,” said Wiedenfels. “At Global Networks, we will focus on further identifying innovative ways to work with distribution partners to create value for both linear and streaming viewers globally while maximizing our network assets and driving free cash flow.” “We committed to shareholders to identify the best strategy to realize the full value of our exciting portfolio of assets, and the Board believes this transaction is a great outcome for WBD shareholders,” added Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of  WBD's board. “This announcement reflects the Board's ongoing efforts to evaluate and pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.”


	Benefits, WBD said, will unlock value for shareholders and create opportunities for both new businesses to thrive. They include equipping each to be faster and more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that strengthen their competitive positions; forming world-class management teams focused on creating greater strategic flexibility and focus so that each business can invest in and pursue its operational and financial goals; and enabling each company to be more agile and attract a shareholder base aligned with its growth prospects and financial profiles.


	WBD said it intends the split to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that the new companies plan to implement arm's-length transition services and commercial agreements post-separation “to facilitate the transition and maintain continued operational efficiencies.”

	Delighted Splinter Cell fans were shown a trio of clips from the upcoming animated Deathwatch series today at Annecy as Ubisoft execs gave them a peek into the making of the highly-anticipated Netflix adaptation.


	The audience at a packed Salle Pierre Lamy were shown three clips featuring the first appearance of protagonist Sam Fisher, voiced by Liev Schreiber, an epic fight scene and a car chase.


	The creative team talked the crowd through the various influences that have had such an impact on the TV version, which fast forwards Fisher's story to 2025. One of Ubisoft's flagship franchises, the hugely popular game series follows Fisher, the highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops sub-division within the NSA, dubbed “Third Echelon”, as he overcomes his adversaries. Having first been announced in 2020, the Ubisoft series will air later this year on Netflix.

	Director Guillaume Dousse said he approached the immense task of helming an adaptation of one of the world's most beloved video games by melding Michael Mann and Japanese director-animator Satoshi Kon. Live action noir properties like Ghost in the Shell were also a major influence, he added.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We took huge inspiration from live action,” he said. “There is this element of melancholy to the mise en scène. We wanted it to be full of contrasts.” 


	Dousse incorporated lengthier, fixed shots, a rarity for animation, as he cited the famous 17-minute scene in Steve McQueen's Hunger as an example of something he wanted to move towards. The creatives repeatedly stressed that the eight-episode show takes its time, going against the grain of super fast-paced narratives. The soundtrack was also hugely important, with Dousse citing  inspirations like Ozark and Tokyo Vice.


	Another slightly more unlikely inspiration for the older central character was Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise, who has been making those movies for decades and has grown up with them. 


	“It was interesting to have this ageing character, not totally like the Tom Cruise version but more realistic, and more weathered by life,” said producer Hugo Revon.

	











	Notably, Schreiber is taking on voice duties from Michael Ironside. Ironside, who voiced Fisher in the games, has previously said he is too old to return for the show. 


	Schreiber was “important for the project” as he is known for live action and the show is aiming to attract a broad audience who simply enjoy a great narrative, Revon said. “His voice comes to life,” he added of the Ray Donovan star. “It is so natural.” 


	The show brings the action to Europe and was described as a “roadtrip around Europe” by Ubisoft development manager Carl Tamakloe. 


	Fast forwarding to 2025 meant facing up to the realities of how war has changed since Splinter Cell first started out as a game.


	“We were interested in hybrid warfare,” added Tamakloe. “Fake news can destabilize a state. We wanted to be rooted in the idea that in 2025 you don't fight like you did in 2000.” 


	Without giving too much away, Tamakloe revealed some of the show will be set around the fictional Cop 31 climate conference, drawing out themes of energy and power.


	The first Splinter Cell video game was released in 2002. A series of tie-in novels following Fisher on his missions as a black ops agent were published in the mid-2000s. 


	The team were speaking on the first day of the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in the south of France, which is being attended by all the big American studios.

	“We're excited to bring together an all-star cast to voice the incredible characters in Goat,” said Peyton and Curry. “Goat is the kind of story we love to tell at Unanimous— full of heart, humor, and high-octane action that we hope audiences of all ages will cheer for.”


	Four-time NBA Champion, two-time MVP, and 2024 Olympic Gold Medalist Curry and Peyton launched production company Unanimous Media in 2018 to create content focused on family, faith, and sports.

“American Idol” runner-up John Foster is embracing his love of country music like never before.

On Saturday, June 7, the Louisiana native reaffirmed his country music roots with a visit to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Foster took to Instagram to share a photo capturing the special moment.

The “Tell That Angel I Love Her” singer stood in the center of the iconic Hall of Fame Rotunda, a place where legendary figures in country music are honored. Above him are the symbolic words “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” inspired by the timeless song of the same title.

“Visiting the Country Music Hall of Fame today reminded me why I connect so deeply with my genre,” he captioned the post. “Its history and connection to the people is unparalleled.”

Foster went on to make a vow about his passion for country music.

I promise that for as long as I live, the circle will be unbroken.

A post shared by John Foster (@officialjohnfoster)

Foster has been unstoppable following his second-place “American Idol” finish. On May 31, he shared his first-ever music video on Instagram, singing “Amazing Grace.” He wrote:

I thought it fitting that my first Post-Idol music video be ‘Amazing Grace',' because it's His Grace that's brought me this far.

He revealed that the video was taken in one go, adding that “every lyric, including the Cajun French chorus, is a thank you to God.”

Foster also performed at the Cajun Country Jam over Memorial Day Weekend and took the stage at the 19/BMG Takeover during CMA Fest on June 4.

On June 7, Foster turned his dream into reality when he made his successful Grand Ole Opry debut, cementing his name in the country music scene. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

Meanwhile, Foster's growing fan base is looking forward to what's next for the “American Idol” star. One eager fan commented on Instagram, “Good Lord willing, young man, you will go far! Your voice is amazing and your personality, demeanor, and love for the Lord will only enhance your success.”

Another wrote, “I believe we are witnessing a legend in the making! You are a special young man, John Foster!”

A fan added, “You are an incredible young man John. Love your music. You are gonna be the new heartthrob of country music.” 

Another another chimed in, “You have what it takes to be the next great country music artist and legend!”

“American Idol” Season 24 is slated to premiere in 2026 on ABC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Craig Conover Reflects on Single Life at 37","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/craig-conover-single-at-37-reflection/","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 01:53:30 GMT","

Months after ending his relationship with “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo, Craig Conover is opening up about the emotional journey that followed—and how being single at 37 has forced him to reevaluate what truly matters in life.

A post shared by Craig Conover (@caconover)

“I'm coming into a stage in my life where I don't know what my purpose is. It's funny. It's an odd way to feel,” Conover shared on the May 27 episode of the “2 Fake Seals” podcast. “I don't know. What am I here for? It's too existential for this convo, but finding myself single at 37 and [nothing] against that, I'm just saying that I think I was just like, ‘Oh, I'm gonna have a family.'”

The “Southern Charm” star continued, “What I mean is that, now, all of a sudden, I'm only answering to myself. So, what do I do with my time to make it count?”

The heartfelt reflections came during a May event benefiting Hope for the Warriors, a nonprofit organization that offers support to veterans and military families. Conover, who joined the nonprofit's board council in 2024, said giving back has become a significant part of his life—and helped him find fulfillment after personal setbacks.

A post shared by Craig Conover (@caconover)

Despite a successful career as a Bravo personality and entrepreneur, Conover said it's his philanthropic work that brings him the most joy. “I accomplished what I — I did it. I did what I wanted to do,” he said on the podcast. “I do, one day, would love to have a family and stuff. So, now it's like, ‘OK, how do you make the most out of your time now?'”

Through his brand Sewing Down South, Conover has donated more than $200,000 to charitable organizations around the world, according to Hope for the Warriors' website. 

“Whatever the cause is, it's what drives me. It's why I work really hard at Sewing Down South, to make enough money to be able to help people,” he said. “Take the business side out of it… It'll make you feel like a better person. If you're looking for purpose, go volunteer somewhere.”

Although he didn't get into specifics about his current romantic life, Conover hinted he was no longer single during a March 27 appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.”

“Are you dating?” host Andy Cohen asked.

“I am, and I'm really happy,” Conover replied. “You know, when I date, I tend to date only one person at a time, so I've been seeing someone. And I've been reminded that the universe works in crazy ways, and that everything happens for a reason.”

Conover's split from DeSorbo—first revealed in early 2025—marked the end of a multi-year relationship that began after the two met filming a Bravo crossover event. While the breakup prompted questions from fans, it seems Conover is now focused on personal growth and finding meaning through service, connection, and future dreams of family life.

“1000-Lb Roomies” is a new TLC series about two friends, Jasmine “Jaz” Wallace and Nesha Harris, who share an apartment and the desire to lose a lot of weight. In order to even begin their fitness journey, they first need to get honest with themselves about their physical reality.

In this week's new episode, Jaz is visiting her doctor, Dr. Sarvenaz Nouri, with Nesha in tow, when she finds out that some of her 630 pounds must go in order to qualify for surgery. “I'm very scared. How many days I got left to be a parent? How many days I got left to be an auntie, a sister, a daughter, and a best friend?” Jaz says in an exclusive clip obtained by PEOPLE.

Jaz finds herself with her back to the wall because she has to be locked into her fitness journey, and is already losing weight before she can have surgical help. “Our goal is to help you to get you to surgery,” Dr. Nouri says in the clip. “For the surgery, I want you to be around 500 lbs, so you do need to lose about 130 lbs before surgery.”

Jaz isn't necessarily feeling confident in her ability, and admits that she is nervous about failing, saying, “130 lbs in order for me to get this surgery, I feel like I can't do it, that's why I'm here.”

“If you don't lose weight and if you don't get the weight loss surgery to lose weight, you will not survive for that long,” Nouri warns.

In the “1000-Lb Roomies” clip provided to PEOPLE, Dr. Nouri asks Nesha if she would like to join her friend Jaz on this journey to better health. Nesha admits that the last time she weighed herself, she was 425 lbs and, unlike Jaz, she has no interest in undergoing bariatric surgery.

“It's something that I just never saw myself doing,” Nesha says. “I don't know, I'm just not for it. But that could be our goal together. If you have to be on a certain diet, I'll be on that diet with you. I got you.”

“Hearing that Jaz doesn't have long to live is scary,” Nesha says. “I feel like once you hear it from a doctor, it really kind of just makes it that much more real. It hits you. It just hits you like a ton of bricks.”

“And whatever she has to do, I'm in full support,” she adds.

Girl meets guy. Girl falls for guy. Guy might not be totally truthful with girl. So what does a modern woman do? Well, Sophie Brooks‘ “Oh, Hi!” might be the twisted answer to a very relatable dilemma.

Billed as a “subversive rom-com” to not give too much away, “Oh, Hi!” premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman star as Iris and Isaac, a couple whose first romantic getaway soon goes awry. The description teases that the “odd dark comedy takes on the highs and lows of modern dating and the ways it makes us all a little crazy.”

 










Geraldine Viswanathan and John Reynolds co-star. Brooks wrote and directed “Oh, Hi!,” with Gordon having a story by credit (she also produces). “Oh, Hi!” is screening at the 2025 Tribeca Festival June 13 and 14 before debuting in theaters this July.

Brooks, whose first film “The Boy Downstairs” starred Zosia Mamet as a woman who has to live above her ex-boyfriend in a new apartment, is no stranger to challenging the romance genre. Brooks told IndieWire that “Oh, Hi!” was inspired by “The Worst Person in the World,” “Normal People,” and the HBO adaptation of “Scenes from a Marriage” with Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac. 

 










“It's all about tone, right? It's such a thin line,” Brooks said. “The film toes this really thin line of tone and perspective. It was really important to me that both characters felt like real people and fully rounded, realized versions of themselves. It's super-vulnerable, it's incredibly human to want love and to want to give love and be loved. Sometimes women, specifically, who say that are considered desperate or crazy, and I think that's really unfair. Iris is a really brave character, and it's a perfect storm of everything kind of landing in a way at the end of the first act where you're like, ‘Oh, if those things hadn't happened, she probably wouldn't have done this crazy thing.' I hope that people can relate to like, ‘Oh, I wouldn't do this, but in a perfect storm, maybe I would.' … The goal is to do it in a funny, lighthearted way that's entertaining to people.”

She added, “Because, inherently, the movie's about miscommunication and how these two people are not on the same page, that moment, the audience is seeing his perspective in a scene where it's supposed to be about her.”

“Oh, Hi!” is produced by Brooks, Gordon, David Brooks, Dan Clifton, and Julie Waters. 

Sony Pictures Classics will release “Oh, Hi!” in theaters on July 25. Check out the trailer below.00

At a certain point in Celine Song‘s sophomore feature “Materialists,” her follow-up to her much-loved “Past Lives,” I started to fixate on something a little strange: the Manhattan office in which our lead Lucy (Dakota Johnson) spends her days trying to arrange enduring romantic matches amongst the NYC elite. At first glance, the crowded and colorful office seems luxe; it's lined with desks and filled with eager matchmakers like Lucy, bubbling with feminine energy and joy. When a match goes really well — i.e. when the couple gets engaged, the ballyhooed happy ending of all romances, naturally — a bar cart is rolled out and all the young matchmakers gather around each other and cheer for their good fortune, and for the seeming success of love itself. They've done it! Love wins! The fees they collect for their services don't hurt, either.

Yet, the more time we spend in Lucy's office, the cheaper, the sadder, the darker it looks. Those desks? They look as if they will collapse at any minute, smushed into each other as if we were at some no-nonsense nail salon, no room to breathe, no space to think. The bar cart? It's wobbly. When it all gets too much, even Lucy heads straight to the fire escape to get some air. It is, quite simply, not at all what it looks like at first blush.

Neither is “Materialists.”

You'd be forgiven for taking the marketing bait on this one (even we did!), because while Song's second film may look, on the surface, like a glossy rom-com throwback about a beautiful woman (Johnson) split between two handsome men (Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans) as they wine and dine around a glittering Manhattan, “Materialists” is not a romantic comedy. It's not even a comedy, and your read on how romantic it is will be entirely fueled by how willing you are to grapple with a subject that rom-coms seldom broach: the limits of what love can do for someone.

Cynical, sad, increasingly fucked up, and often gloriously mean, Song has turned the genre inside out to show us how shallow these stories can be. In short, imagine if the decree that a film centers on “the love you could only find at the movies” wasn't a compliment, but a stern provocation. And while Song is not always successful at this challenge, the result is compelling, dark, and worthy of considerable discussion. 

Did you really think Celine Song, already one of our best chroniclers of what love actually is, would make a shiny little rom-com about good, happy people? Please.

It opens, hilariously enough, with a vignette centered on the romantic rituals of cavepeople. Even they, Song argues, engaged in courtship activities, weighing the merits of their paramours against the needs of the real world. And when two of her cavepeople make it official, it's not so much a happy occasion as the inciting incident for several millennia of good (and bad) unions.

 










For Lucy, love is a transaction. Her clients are goods. The dating scene? It's a market. No wonder she's been so successful at matchmaking (Johnson's naturally cool reserve works wonders for the role), her work steeped in running the numbers and comparing pros and cons, assessing potential romance like one might consider a business deal. Her various clients are not always of the same mind, however, and as Song pushes Johnson through increasingly awful, impersonal, and darkly funny meetings (women who only want tall men, men who only want younger women, and worse), it's easy to see why Lucy has become so clinical. 

A flashback, inspired by running into her ex John (Evans, working in the kind of downbeat register we haven't seen from him in years) at the wedding of two of her clients, further illuminates things: John and Lucy first came to the city years ago, itching for success, and too poor to even afford not just a full evening out on the town, but the parking fees for a single stint in a parking garage. Sick to death of being poor, Lucy ended things with John. Years later, their love for each other is still apparent, but so is the financial divide between them: John has yet to make it as an actor and is instead cater-waiting at the wedding, Lucy is there as a cherished guest.

 










Also on offer at the wedding: the groom's handsome brother Harry (an appealing Pascal), the kind of “unicorn” Lucy would love to fix up with some of her very eager female clients. But Harry is taken with Lucy, even when she's crystal clear: the number one thing she is looking for in a potential husband is that he's rich. The number two thing is that he's rich. She is, after all, a materialist. Fortunately, Harry is rich! And, as we come to learn, he's also very much of the same mind of Lucy about what romance is. A transaction. A deal. A merger.

As Harry and Lucy swan about the city on increasingly luxurious dates, John lingers at the edge of Lucy's mind. What if love really was about love? Not money or safety or incredibly nice penthouses (the first night they spend together at Harry's, Lucy appears to more revved up by the swanky spread than Harry's furious kisses)? Well, Lucy sure as hell ain't the person to interrogate that. 

Until she is. As Lucy — analytic, cold, and totally aware of her emotional deficiencies — attempts to juggle a most unexpected internal war, something happens that even she could not predict or prevent. For all her planning, for all her precision, for all her “let's take the emotion out of romance and get you married!” gusto, Lucy simply can't control people and what they will do. That this horrific upheaval comes care of Lucy's work is the real kicker. If her trusted professional methods can fail so terribly, what does that say about the way she conducts her personal life?

 










That destabilization is enough to push Lucy into new spaces, both expected and not. Who will she choose? John, who might not have a pot to piss in (and, even if he did, he'd have to share it with his many roommates), but sees Lucy as she is and still wants to be with her? Harry, who fully understands how love should look and move, and only uses that as a shield to his real self? Talk about bad options.

But while Song is eager to engage with these ideas — with the very nature of love itself, no small feat — even “Materialists” can't escape the pull of wrapping things up in a tidy bow full of big reveals and bigger proclamations. Or is that all part of a deeper trick, a wilder swing? Love itself may remain a mystery, but the way “Materialists” feels about it is not. Just don't fall for the shiny package.

A24 will release “Materialists” in theaters on Friday, June 13.

It's a very big summer for fans of Dean DeBlois' animated film gems who have also felt the burning desire to see classics like “Lilo & Stitch” and “How to Train Your Dragon” reimagined in live-action form. While the live-action version of his “Lilo & Stitch” continues to dominate the box office (even as this same critic believes it should be the death knell of such remakes, oopsie), DeBlois himself is back in the mix, making a live-action debut of his own with a new spin on his classic “How to Train Your Dragon.”

This one? Well, it's good enough to pull me back from the brink of demanding that all such remakes be burnt be fire. I will likely even happily turn out for its already-announced sequel, due in 2027. Mostly, what DeBlois and his team have done is capture the tone and whimsy of the 2010 animated hit, and pushed it gently into a live-action world that feels just as (if, oddly enough, not more so) plucked out of some family-friendly fairy tale. 

 








Related Stories Big Bear Film Festival to Launch in September, Led by Former Outfest Director Damien Navarro ‘Materialists' Review: Celine Song Didn't Make a Rom-Com, She Made a (Pretty Good) Takedown of Them 

Like the animated films, DeBlois' feature is based on the Cressida Cowell series of the same name, though DeBlois takes on sole screenwriting credit this go-round. Fans of the original animated film will likely feel some serious deja vu throughout the film's running time (just a touch over two hours, and it sure feels it in its first act), as it looks and moves and feels just like the first film (it's hard to not continue to impress this point, but let's try to move on from it).

 










DeBlois has, however, made a few canny changes. The island of Berk, so far off the map that no one really knows where it is, is still inhabited by the toughest of Viking warriors, with a tweak: these baddies moved there by choice. Culled from the best and bravest of all the tribes that the Vikings proper met on their travels (which means, yes, this fierce community includes people from all over the map), everyone who lives on Berk does so because they are fully committed to killing off the flying dragon scourge that has, for so long, bothered the island's human population.

Everyone, that is, except Hiccup (Mason Thames, recent star of “The Black Phone”). Despite his proud lineage (his father is the Berk's chief, Stoick the Vast, amusingly portrayed by Gerard Butler, who previously voiced the role in the animated films), Hiccup is kind of, well, a dork. He's clumsy, he's skinny, he's got bad timing with just about everything. No one (even his father, ouch) expects him to succeed in battle, which is bad enough, and that's without considering that his long-time crush Astrid (a delightful Nico Parker) is the toughest warrior of their generation. 

While Hiccup spends his days tripping around Goober's (Nick Frost) blacksmith workshop, everyone else his age (all characters imported directly from the first films, including the twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, Hiccup's rival Snoutlout, and potential pal Fishlegs) is getting ready to learn how to fight dragons. And, you know, be an actual member of this fierce Berkian society.

 










But Hiccup has a bit of a knack with engineering, and when he cooks up a double-barreled blaster meant to take down dragons, like the horrifying Night Fury, it seems his fortunes might have changed. Alas, during one night siege (silly enough to not scare the little ones, even as the entire village repeatedly goes up in flames), Hiccup aims his weapon at the shape of a Night Fury (no one, we're told repeatedly, as ever really seen one), shoots, and … what! maybe takes it down? When he goes searching in the forest for his catch, Hiccup is shocked to discover the absolutely cutest, cuddliest beastie the world has ever seen.

If everything and everyone in “How to Train Your Dragon” looks directly copied over from their animated counterparts, Toothless the Night Fury looks fully imported in, too cute and too “animated” to quite fit into this live-action world. While the character design has been elevated a bit, more scales and fiercer teeth, Toothless still sticks out amongst his brethren, all of whom look like “Game of Thrones” also-rans. This Night Fury? He's basically a big cat. Is that a feature or a bug? We can't be sure, but expect Universal to sell a whole hunk of new Toothless plushies in the coming weeks.

Also still the same: the overall messaging of the story, about how important it is to not only recognize our differences, but to celebrate them and use them to work together for the greater good. Everyone else in Berk doesn't see Hiccup's value. And Toothless? He's got an injury that keeps him from flying. In both of their communities, these outsiders aren't seen as being of use. But! Perhaps together! That could change! It's predictable, joyful Movie Messaging, and frankly, we all could use much more of it.

 










As Hiccup and Toothless bond, the would-be warrior learns more about the dragon world as a whole, enough to really give him a boost in his dragon-slaying lessons (much to Astrid's chagrin), and turning him into something of a celebrity. But what happens when the very raison d'être of his homeland (kill dragons) runs entirely against the thing he loves most in the world (flying with Toothless, care of cleverly made rig that allows them both to soar)? 

Well, you've seen the animated film. You know what happens, and while DeBlois might occasionally struggle to find the line between family-friendly entertainment and Viking-backed battles, that he can still find excitement and joy in this well-tread story is a testament to both his work and source material. No one needs a live-action remake, but ones this faithful and sweet are not the problem. 

Universal Pictures will release “How to Train Your Dragon” in theaters on Friday, June 13.

The 78th Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall got off to a rousing start, as Oprah Winfrey blessed host Cynthia Erivo with a finger hold before the “Wicked” star took center stage to sing the original “Sometimes All You Need is a Song.” With the support of a choir, Erivo tipped her hat to the nominated movie stars (lyric: “Half of Hollywood did a play”), supplied powerhouse vocals, and brought the number to crescendo by getting the audience involved, briefly handing off the mic to Kristin Chenoweth, Aaron Tveit, and Adam Lambert, among others.

 










It was, indeed, a union of Broadway and Hollywood throughout the evening. During her opening monologue, Erivo noted that it was the most lucrative year in Broadway history (with reported ticket sales of $1.89 billion), “providing we don't run out of cast members from ‘Succession.'”

“Succession” star Sarah Snook was actually won the first Tony of the evening. In her Broadway debut, “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” Snook played 26 roles.
 










“It is billed as a one person show, and I don't feel alone any night that I do this show,” Snook said in her acceptance speech, shouting out her production's creative team.

Several of the nominated shows were, too, based off popular Hollywood films, including “Good Night, and Good Luck”, “Real Women Have Curls,” and “Death Becomes Her,” which used its cast performance to give a nod to Pride Month with the number “For the Gaze.” Several speeches paid homage to the LGBTQ+ community, as well, including Best Direction of a Musical winner Michael Arden.

“Growing up, I was called the F-word more times than I can remember, and now I'm a f*ggot with a Tony,” Arden said. “So, keep raising your voices, my friends. Keep loving and uplifting each other, standing up against intolerance any time you see it. And vote every chance you get.”

The original cast of “Hamilton” — including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Ariana DuBose, and Jonathan Groff — brought the house down with a 10th anniversary special “remix” medley.

Broadway's sparkle was cast liberally throughout the glittery festivities, and Erivo made several well-timed “Wicked” references. She also closed the show with a goosebump-inducing, revised version of “And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going.”

 










But the true 11 o'clock number of the evening was the presentation of the highly anticipated Best Actress in a Musical category. Nicole Scherzinger won for her portrayal of Norma Desmond in “Sunset Blvd,” triumphing over Audra McDonald's turn as Rose in “Gypsy.” Glenn Close previously won for the same role in “Sunset Blvd.” in 1995.

“Growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong. But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last,” Scherzinger said in her acceptance speech.

“Sunset Blvd.” also won Best Revival of a Musical. Other winners included Darren Criss, who took home his first Tony Award for “Maybe Happy Endings,” which also won Best Musical. “Purpose” won Best Play, while Best Revival of Play went to “Eureka Day.” Cole Escola won Best Actor in a Play for their celebrated performance as Mary Todd Lincoln. Jak Malone (“Operation Mincemeat”), Natalie Venetia Belcon (“Buena Vista Social Club”), Francis Jue (“Yellow Face”), and Kara Young (“Purpose”) also took home acting prizes. Harvey Fierstein was presented with an Honorary Tony Award.

Among the presenters were Ben Stiller, Lea Salonga, Jean Smart, Samuel L. Jackson, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, and Sarah Paulson.

With video surveillance and social media at a fever pitch, the time for new takes on found footage is now, and you don't have to reinvent the smartphone to do it. “Man Finds Tape” uses a traditional lo-fi approach to an elevated horror concept when a strange presence starts zapping minds in the small town of Larkin, Texas.

Written and directed by Peter Hall and Paul Gandersman, the supernatural mystery follows siblings Lynn (Kelsey Pribilski) and Lucas Page (William Magnuson) through a playful reconsideration of the unreliable narrator. The filmmakers' background as novelists steers their world toward Stephen King territory, occasionally to its detriment. But in the end, their thoroughly imagined script pays off as a well-constructed monster movie — one that freshly challenges the sometimes-freeing, sometimes-suffocating subgenre and format.

Scary clips presented without context can be terrifying, but “Man Finds Tape” breaks new ground by tangling up its audience in a complex narrative told through dozens of perspectives. The pseudo-documentary is narrated by Lynn, whose self-directed interviews and childhood home videos reflect her deep care for the main subject, her brother. But only Lucas and a handful of the faux-film's other cinematographers are human.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Having moved away from her hometown long ago, Lynn makes it clear she doesn't believe Lucas' crazy theories about Larkin when they're talking on Zoom. When she does finally come to check on him, the Page's home security system shows Lynn discovering Lucas in a catatonic state. To explain how they got there, she'll use footage from her brother's viral YouTube series, “Man Finds Tape,” and old episodes from the faith-based talk show her parents, Holly (Akasha Villalobos) and Richard (Shane Brady), produced before they died.

The mysterious illness that killed the late Pages indirectly kicked off their son's decline. It'll take his sister's intervention years later to figure out how those pieces fit together, but after Lucas finds a bizarre tape hiding in the attic — labeled with his name — the amateur videographer wastes no time posting it on the internet. Like Lynn and his parents, Lucas has fun with the video project at first. Going viral like only “real” creepypasta stories can, the spine-tingling found footage shows Lucas sleeping as a kid. Who took it? And why?

That's not enough of a narrative hook to sustain an entire feature film, something the slippery but not unruly “Man Finds Tapes” was smart enough to know. Lynn arrives on the scene hoping to find answers. Instead, more questions spark and fly as the reluctant investigator grinds away at a mystery her brother couldn't solve. Reverend Endicott Carr (John Golson) was the star of “The Salvation Hour” back when the late Pages filmed it. Lucas had to apologize after publicly theorizing Carr was the voyeur in the video tape, so now both he and Lynn are stuck dodging legal action while trying to jog people's memories.

 










Keeping a steady clip and clocking in at a blissful running time, Hall and Gandersman discover two of their movie's best moment in car scenes. The bizarre blackouts are first explained with a bizarre hit-and-run that shook Larkin months earlier. The incident was caught on camera. It happened in broad daylight. And yet, there were seemingly with no witnesses to this man's tragic death. Watching grainy storefront footage of the intersection, Lucas and Lynn begin their detective work realizing someone else fell asleep at the wheel.

We get a more intimate understanding of Lucas, and a better look at the ingenuity of these filmmakers, during a second crash scene. It's shot entirely from the floor up on a “dropped” smartphone and relies on ambient noise to sell a calamity the driver isn't awake to see coming. Wendy Parker (Nell Kessler) is Lucas' girlfriend and — wait for it — Reverend Carr's surrogate. She's also the first of many in a wacky cast of local characters the Page siblings will have to interview on their quest to understand what is making everyone pass out. Winston Boon (Graham Skipper) is the first of many to nod off mid-conversation. It's a production challenge Lynn mostly ignores and a clever textural decision that will make you wonder if the narrator is still with us.

 










Comingling Reddit posts, text messages, 9-1-1 calls, and more, “Man Finds Tape” mixes several types of media before giving its villain a satisfying physical form. Aptly credited, The Stranger (Brian Villalobos) is only part of that problem and not the centerpiece practical effects portion of this film that monster fans should look forward to. How Larkin's unseen foe goes about manipulating minds without being seen proves key to protecting the town. Figuring out what its victims can — or won't — remember is half the fun, and even somewhat lacking in personality, Lynn and Lucas sell their good nature successfully.

Heavy exposition from The Stranger, slightly evocative of the neo-western “Dark Tower” books written by King, give away the debut directors as authors. Balanced with enough ‘80s flair, that's not a bad thing overall. A pleasant combination that doesn't break the mold but nonetheless festers with originality, “Man Finds Tape” strikes a unique seriocomic tone. One minute, you're leaning in to catch hints like you're watching “Blair Witch.” The next minutes, you're digesting motifs evocative of everything from “Slither” to “The Matrix.”

That chunkiness outstays its welcome by about fifteen minutes, and even bloated, the climax never gets as action, sci-fi, or fantasy heavy as you might hope. Still, Hall and Gandersman sell themselves as indie storytellers to watch through a combination of distinctly modern POVs and familiar horror tropes. Suffice to say, the found footage mark “Shelby Oaks” swung for but missed gets hit squarely here. That awkward effort, prematurely pushed by Neon as its big follow-up to “Longlegs,” won't release until later this year. It also raises a new question: Can “Man Finds Tape” come out before then?

 










From XYZ Films, “Man Finds Tape” had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on Sunday, June 8. It is currently seeking distribution.

To revel in anarchy without an initial critical perspective about gun culture or social media addiction is the point of director Oscar Boyson's feature debut, “Our Hero, Balthazar,” co-written with Ricky Camilleri, a movie wrestling with both topics. The “Good Time” producer and “Uncut Gems” executive producer‘s first film as a director stars “Midnight Special” and “It” breakout Jaeden Martell as a spoiled New York City private-school edgelord adept at making himself cry on self-cue for his online followers.

Balthazar's (Martell) compulsion toward on-iPhone faux tears contributes to a broad satire of an ever-widening genre of curated suffering wrought by social media users. The ones who lather themselves up over causes (see Selena Gomez's tearful direct-to-camera confession about Trump's deportation policies, which went viral earlier this year) to signal their virtues, and often emptily or at least confused.

Boyson captures this phenomenon, mostly poking rather than prodding, until the film's dramatic and very bloody finish puts a not moralizing but perhaps prescriptive cap on the endgame of its own expanding satire: “Our Hero, Balthazar” follows Balthy, as he's known by his absentee mother (a perfectly uptight, power-dressed Jennifer Ehle), into a dark obsession with the also biblically named Solomon (Asa Butterfield), an internet troll with aspirations of shooting up his Texas school and maybe more.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Balthy, though, doesn't have many virtues, and here the world of edgelords and online rage-baiters is a scuzzy one that cinematographer Christopher Messina and editors Nate DeYoung and Erin DeWitt plunge us into with all the subtlety of the Safdies' clock-ticking New York crime odyssey “Good Time.” The synthy, pulsing electro art score by James William Blades further brings to mind those early Safdie movies, now generational touchstones for emerging filmmakers.

Boyson doesn't entirely peel away from the Benny-and-Josh-established aesthetic that's now the expected parlance of millennial filmmakers seeking to capture an unvarnished, on-edge New York — Boyson, after all, co-founded the Safdies' Elara Pictures before the brothers split creatively. The stylized filmmaking becomes its own sort of critical point of view here, revving up the audience and probably encouraging even a few in the room to endorse its agonized worldview via the movie's compelling craft. “Our Hero, Balthazar” is both a cautionary tale and an entertainment, and how Boyson straddles the highwire cutting between those two opposing forces is what makes this promising debut most fascinatingly restless.

It's present day, and when “Our Hero, Balthazar” begins, Balthy is weeping into his iPhone camera. “This loneliness is killing me,” he says. But it's all fakery, as staged as the active-shooter drills at Balthy's private Manhattan school, crocodile tears welled up to weaponize his narcissism against the bleeding hearts of passive, smash-the-freaking-like-button social media sheep. Balthy is barely attended to by his single mom, Nicole (Ehle), who's so distracted by a romance with a rising politico (David M. Raine) that she goes out of town with the guy on Balthy's birthday weekend. Meanwhile, Balthy's nonexistent father just cuts the checks while remaining upstate in Westchester.

 










Balthy appears to have no social life outside the internet-only interactions inside his high-rise bedroom overlooking the city. He's attracted to an activist classmate (Pippa Knowles), who sounds off on the “monetization of narcissism” after one of those school-shooting drills, but he alienates her entirely after trying to make out with her while watching dark-web-dispatched closed-circuit footage of an actual Arkansas school massacre. (As in last year's “Red Rooms,” about a woman perversely drawn to snuff films, Boyson keeps the carnage off-camera, letting the sounds of guns popping and screams overheard ooze into our imagination.)

Balthy's preoccupation with school shootings entwines him over Instagram exchanges with Texas-dwelling convenience store worker Solomon, played by an unrecognizable Butterfield in brassy bleach-blond hair in desperate need of a rinse of purple shampoo. Solomon is lonely, too, ignored by his father, a Frank Mackey-type motivational speaker who used to be an amateur porn star and now peddles a powdery testosterone supplement called Thrush. The angsty teen, who's got far too much access to firearms and fantasizes about blowing up his peers, lives with his ailing, Franzia-wine-box-guzzling grandmother (Becky Ann Baker, hilarious and sweatily confined to an easy chair). He's loathed by (and perhaps in love with) his coworker, played by a crassly funny Anna Baryshnikov who again trashily steals the scene as she did in “Love Lies Bleeding,” there as a lesbian stalker with gingivitis.

 










So Balthy, using all the AI chicanery disturbingly at his disposal, poses as a nympho online female sex bot to lure Solomon's attention via DMs and to eventually meet up with him in a sad pocket of rural Texas. Balthy goads Solomon's forming Oedipal desire to murder his father, while cautioning as Solomon suits up for the kill, “It's not even a school — nobody's gonna care.” Balthy, meanwhile, hopes that in stopping Solomon's parallel planned school shooting he can somehow win back the affections of Eleanor (Knowles), who begs Balthy to stop reaching out but seemingly hasn't learned how to block a caller.

Is Balthy a hero? Is Solomon a murderer? Or are they both just hopeless casualties of an epidemic of over-interneted incel-adjacents who've turned being online at all these days into a pervasive existential risk? Car chases and police standoffs blare and beam from Solomon's grandmother's TV, giving “Our Hero, Balthazar” an ever-on-the-edge-of-apocalypse vibe that literalizes our society-addling fixation on spectacle violence and if-it-bleeds-it-leads cable news, where the last tragedy is the latest news item.

Though hardly transgressive if you've kept up with the recent crop of indies that blend New York-at-night thriller with Gen Z-skewering social messaging (Olmo Schnabel's queer Manhattan caper “Pet Shop Boys” from last year comes to mind), the contradictions in the thrilling pleasures of this film's craft alongside its darkly comic warning letter about gun culture make for a potent if ultimately ambivalent first venture. But it's ambivalence by design, as Boyson ends his movie on a painfully inevitable, macabrely funny finale that brings the whole thing full circle, Balthy once again crying on his own command for all the world (or at least a handful of followers and news watchers) to see.

 










Martell makes a strong dramatic impression as a seriously fucked-up kid, but is he more fucked-up than any kid — or any of us — is lately? It's Butterfield's pathos and toxic teendom that give “Our Hero, Balthazar” its emotional anchor, if the film has one at all. Boyson seems more enamored with the pyrotechnics of filmmaking — and as a first-time feature director, why wouldn't he be? — than with sticking to an emotional landing. “Our Hero, Balthazar” isn't cold by any means, but the result comes off as more ethnographic in tone than the in-your-face bravado of the approach would suggest.

“Our Hero, Balthazar” premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

In the first half of the 2010s, artists like Shy Glizzy, Fat Trel, and Lightshow steered DC metro area youth toward homegrown rap, though their sound mirrored much of what was happening in Southern rap nationally. Somewhere around 2015, kids who'd come of age during those pioneering acts' ascension began developing a style that felt distinctive to the DMV. It's a shift that can't be fully understood without Sparkheem. Alongside beatmakers like Cheecho and Dolan Beats, he distinguished the sound of local street music in the mid-to-late 2010s with ominous keys, interpretations of DC's go-go drum patterns, and a barrage of sound effects that created an atmosphere of playfulness and gloom. Sparkeem's contribution to that formation is singular, though. More than his contemporaries, he's cultivated a presence in just about every micro-scene within the larger DMV underground.

The organ he incorporated into Q Da Fool's 2017 track “Backyard” feels like a direct descendant of the churchiness Zaytoven fed Gucci Mane's early trap confessionals. The mystic synths he administered on Lil Xelly's 2018 single “BBQ” creep behind the quintessential skipping hi-hats. In 2019, for Lil Gray—a rapper who inspires Sparkheem's most adventurous production—he flipped an early 2000s jingle for Maryland car dealership Eastern Motors into something you'd hear at the club. His broad reach in and outside the local scene made Sparkheem and his production partners Mannyvelli and Spizzledoe attractive to Maryland-raised R&B superstar Brent Faiyaz, who brought the three to his ISO Supremacy label. Soon after, Sparkheem contributed to Tommy Richman's “Million Dollar Baby,” one of the biggest hits of last year.

With a 4x platinum record under his belt, the producer releases Now That's What I Call Crank! 25, a 23-track mixtape co-billed with An1 that reflects Sparkheem's shine back onto the present-day DMV rap landscape. Since 2019, Sparkheem has dropped five projects similarly reminiscent of physical DJ mixtapes, each acting as a survey of the local scene's evolution—a census of newcomers and mainstays alike. This one starts with an unheard track from the late PG County rapper Goonew, whose delivery and staggered flow made it all the way to France before he was killed in 2022. Titled “Start My Day,” it flips, decelerates, and adds choppy drums to the instrumental from Britney Spears' “Toxic” beneath Goonew's signature whisper.

Now That's What I Call Crank! 25 bridges two related yet distinct eras of DMV underground rap. When Sparkheem rose to prominence in the 2010s, many of the scene's most popular artists achieved virality by finding pockets within the beats of popular songs from their childhood that hadn't yet been mined for samples. That was the Crank era. Sparkheem captures it on “Like Dat,” which recruits Landover, Maryland's Xanman (aka Xanservin) and, like Xan's best work, joins the sensibilities of 2000s R&B with the cadence of a contemporary rap singer. Here, between sweet promises of Palm Angel outfits and hazy nights out, Xan interpolates the hook from Laila!'s “Like That!” On “Do Not Enter,” Sparkheem chops up the beat from Trick Daddy's 2001 hit “I'm a Thug” while Lil Gray and DC's CartiEars cram as many words as possible into bars about living on the edge. As with Goonew on “Start My Day,” Sparkheem offers these tracks as quintessential Crank records, presenting DMV reimaginings of widely known pop songs.

In the past three to four years, many newcomers have opted to make darker, more brazen, murder-obsessed music: the Free Car era. Take Now That's What I Call Crank's “Stand Tall,” with DC rappers AC640 and Situation Slim. Compared to the lively, sample-laden Crank tracks, it feels like a high-speed chase. Sirens whirl, metal clinks, and martial drums roll while the two trade verses about never being afraid of wreaking havoc in enemy territory. Lil Dude, though considered an OG from the Crank era, is credited with pioneering the Free Car movement; he tries his hand at a Free Car beat here on “No Hookheem,” rapping relentlessly about having hitmen on call while explosions erupt in the background.

Sparkheem also features artists who don't perfectly fit either category, even if they've engaged with both. Paco Panama, one of DC's standout artists of the past few years, shows up on “Shoes Tied” to talk about his favorite subject: drug distribution and how he's been doing it since cell phones had prepaid plans. For that, Sparkheem concocts a soul-looping number that inspires visions of white fur coats, walking sticks, and classic American cars.

When I interviewed Sparkheem in 2019 about his curation philosophy, he said, “At this point, I feel like the DMV artists have a sound…. Most people would define this sound with bouncy beats, dark pianos, and a punch-in flow. And even though this is mostly accurate, I still think I go beyond this distinction.” That's only become more true in the six years since. Whether he's lacing KP Skywalka with a dreamy, nostalgic template to talk about choosing between the streets or a rap career on “Hot Outside,” bringing in Atlanta underground star Tony Shhnow for the syrupy ""Don't Slip REMIX,” or letting TTM Dawg wax poetic about a crush on “Sprinter,” Sparkheem is impressively flexible. He brings equal commitment to a track likely to end up on an MLB commercial as he does to one that'll probably never surpass house party status. Now That's What I Call Crank! 25 and its predecessors present a panoramic look into a DMV scene full of music worth cataloging.

Probably a lot of people were introduced to Baltimore-born, Germany-based songwriter Sophia Kennedy this year through DJ Koze. She's the muffled, distorted voice you hear on “Die Gondel” from his monumental Music Can Hear Us (and she's signed to his label, Pampa). While thrilling, that track's not representative of Kennedy's solo work, which now numbers three albums that could vaguely be classified as pop—“too underground for the pop world and too poppy for the underground,” she's called it—but of a diffident and understated sort. In 2025, the “art-pop” designation has become a huge tent, where radio hitmakers and slightly synthed-up folkies and hyperpop brats and no-nonsense experimentalists with full CVs all crowd in on the defining basis of having melodies. Yet Kennedy's unusually thoughtful compositions would better fit outside that tent, in the chill.

Kennedy recorded her latest LP, Squeeze Me, with long-time collaborator Mense Reents. Both artists have spent over a decade in the German pop and experimental scenes—Reents is particularly prolific as a remixer and sometime solo artist—and share a knack for playfully lo-fi, sometimes MIDI-based experimentation, mostly unbothered by trends. While Squeeze Me isn't “cinematic” exactly—the album's too subtle for such a pat label—it follows a loose cinematic arc, moving through a series of genres to experiment both with style and with levels of emotional remove.

The push-pull between intimacy and distance, playfulness and poise, vulnerability and withholding characterizes much of Kennedy's work, primarily through her two distinct vocal styles: her low register, which channels the imperious force of Grace Jones or Happy Rhodes, and a gentler mode that has the knowing, insinuating warmth of Karen Carpenter or Barbra Streisand. On Squeeze Me, that theme is also textual. The title is something Kennedy snagged off the tag for a kids' toy, finding the phrase evocative. It can be a flirtation of the Betty Boop kind—or one more specific about its tactile actions. But the words can also signify something much harsher: squeezing like a vise, or like the last few drops out of a vessel.

“Nose for a Mountain” is the prelude to the album's story: an earnest metaphorical reflection on early adulthood that likens Kennedy's aging mother to a landscape within which she continually has to resituate herself. The song has a steady rhythm and sophisticated poise, but above all is deeply earnest—the lyrics even reference Bambi. Afterward, the album retreats from that vulnerability hard. “Drive the Lorry” is chilly like mall air-conditioning, an arrangement of a practically vestigial reggae beat among various clicks and pulses whose assured lyrics—“You don't need someone to walk you down the aisle/You're the aisle”—Kennedy delivers like amusements rather than platitudinous girlbossing. “Rodeo” manages to extract sangfroid from a metaphor about cowboy tricks and a vocal of multitracked yodeling and cuckooing.

“Imaginary Friend” also begins detached and dry, its synth organ and tinny drum loop sounding almost desiccated. The track just gets jauntier as it develops: a twinkly piano, cartoon electro-buzz, and a verbose vocal that fills nearly all space in the arrangement. This all goes a long way to repress the longing for the unspecified but unrecoverable relationship with her titular “imaginary friend”; Kennedy's vocal skips briskly through lyrics like “I got lost inside a world that isn't real/And now it's broken down,” as if bypassing their full implications. But seldom does longing stay properly repressed; a brief, languid instrumental break at the two-minute mark traces the wistful contours of that emotional world as it becomes harder and harder to access.

The album's understated midpoint, “Feed Me,” is also its thematic center: “You squeeze everything out of me/Pop the air right out of my cheeks,” she sings in her softer mode against a disarmingly pleasant arrangement, making it sound romantic in a screwball kind of way—until the bridge turns the vocal into a shriek. And that shriek might seem to have settled the question of its meaning until Kennedy's refrain: “Wouldn't it be scary to realize it's you who needs me?”

The song's admission of vulnerability is strong enough to send the second half of the record hurtling back. Specifically, it hurtles backward through time, toward earnest Tin Pan Alley and Hollywood stylings. Kennedy has a low-key flair for these dramatics, and on Squeeze Me they leak out periodically—the string interlude in “Drive the Lorry,” the lurid, recurring Carla Dal Forno-esque tension in “Runner”—before the full proscenium curtain rises. But “Oakwood 21,” drowsy supper-club jazz complete with scatting, is the real deal. And the sumptuous dream-ballet instrumental of “Upstairs Cabaret” is in turn the surreal deal. She had Ennio Morricone in mind here, and matches his emotive swoon. This almost period-costumed detour into melodrama is captivating, all the more so considering how few of her art-pop peers attempt such a thing without poisoning it with irony or drugging it into a soporific drone. (One peer who has done it: Mitski, on her back-album tracks from Be the Cowboy.)

This section of the album is Kennedy at her most welcoming, but in a way that sounds either purposefully nostalgic (the fun-fair scene of “Closing Time”) or otherworldly. The moment must end, and so ends the reverie with “Hot Match,” which Kennedy called her first rock song. That may be a stretch—the pummeling Monsters closer “Dragged Myself Into the Sun” has a strong claim on that title, and “Feed Me” has fun with its classic-rock references, like a loping acoustic hook and drum breakdown that evoke “My Girl” and “In the Air Tonight” respectively. But on “Hot Match,” she fully commits to the bit, in her own way. She takes Chris Spedding's 1975 hit “Motor Bikin'” and taps even deeper into its animating force of motorbikes rule, swapping out guitars for tire squeals as the steady motorik beat lets her maintain her poise. The song is admittedly a bit displaced on the record—there's an alternate universe where this song is the massive single that gets tacked onto the end of the album. Still, no ending would better suit Squeeze Me than for Kennedy, after briefly having let listeners in, to coolly, collectedly drive away.

	Lauren Miller Rogen was 22 years old, celebrating her graduation from college the first time she noticed something was happening to her mother, Adele. It was relatively minor: “She repeated herself — she told a story a few times about a friend of hers,” Rogen says. But for Rogen, who had watched Adele care for her own parents as they slowly succumbed to Alzheimer's disease, it was the potential future that unnerved her. 


	Within two years, Adele, a first-grade teacher, would be diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at age 55. By that time, Rogen was living in Los Angeles, and dating her then-boyfriend, the actor Seth Rogen. When the couple married a few years later, Adele's condition had progressed to the point that it wasn't clear at their wedding if she even realized who Lauren was. “She knew I was the bride — she kept calling me the bride,” Lauren recalled in Taking Care, a documentary the couple made to raise awareness about the challenges that families face while caring for a person with advancing dementia. 

	











	The toll of caring for Adele was hardest on Lauren's father. “There was a time early on, before we brought care in, where we were like, ‘Oh, we're gonna lose him first.' This — caring for her — seemed like it's literally killing him,” she says. “Without being able to afford outside help, I dread imagining what would have happened.” The couple went on to found a nonprofit, Hilarity for Charity, that disburses grants to offset the cost of caring for a person with dementia.

	











	“Until we were part of the care system, we didn't realize how broken it was,” Seth says in a video they recorded on behalf of the organization Caring Across Generations, to raise alarms about the threat families face under a pair of proposals to slash health care programs for the poor and disabled that are being considered at the state and federal level, and encourage people to contact their legislators. He adds, “Millions of low income families, families of people with disabilities, families that have older adults in them, are facing this struggle every day right now.  And that is why it is so unfathomable that federal and state legislatures are making massive cuts to Medicaid as we speak.”

	“We are cutting crucial services for people who are aging and disabled,” he explains. “That means these people will be losing access or have less access to the health care they need, creating more out-of-pocket expenses and medical debt.”


	In Washington, President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which was recently approved by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, would cut roughly $600 billion from Medicaid in order to help pay for a new round of tax cuts for the wealthy.


	The Trump tax bill is projected to kick over 10 million people off Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The legislation would also limit so-called provider taxes, which states use to provide supplemental payments to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers to help pay the costs of treating Medicaid patients. The bill would additionally impose a financial penalty on states, like California, that offer health coverage to undocumented immigrants.  


	In California, the situation could be compounded by further cuts proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that would slash Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program.


	Roughly one quarter of the 5 million Americans with dementia rely on Medicaid, the country's largest payer of long-term care. Medicaid is a pillar for caregivers — some 12 percent of recipients are people who can't work because of their responsibilities caring for a family member. Their ability to access the program could be jeopardized by the Big Beautiful Bill, which would impose work requirements on all able-bodied adults under 65 in order to qualify for Medicaid.

	“Almost everyone in this country knows or loves someone that relies on Medicaid, even if they don't rely on Medicaid themselves. And we have the power together,” Lauren says in the video.

	











	“We need to reject any cuts or changes that would take more care away from families that need and deserve it,” Seth adds. “At the state level and the federal level.”

	In her documentary Call Her Alex, the media personality and Call Her Daddy podcast host Alex Cooper detailed alleged sexual harassment she said she endured during her three-season stint on the Boston University women's soccer team that began in 2013. In the film, which premiered at Tribeca Film Festival, Cooper claimed that her then-coach, Nancy Feldman, developed a fixation on her that led to “deeply uncomfortable” interactions, including verbal remarks and physical touch.


	“My sophomore year, everything really shifted,” Cooper said in the documentary, per Vanity Fair. “I started to notice her really starting to fixate on me way more than any other teammate of mine. And it was confusing because the focus wasn't like, ‘You're doing so well. Let's get you on the field. You're going to be a starter.' It was all based in her wanting to know who I was dating, her making comments about my body, and her always wanting to be alone with me.”


	Cooper noted that since she was attending Boston University on a full-tuition scholarship, she felt limited in her resources and options while navigating the alleged harassment. “I didn't follow this woman's rules, I was gone,” she said, adding: “Every time I tried to resist her, she would say, ‘There could be consequences.'” Cooper alleged that she submitted written documentation detailing her interactions with Feldman to Boston University. “They said, ‘We're not gonna fire her, but you can keep your entire scholarship and that's that.' No investigation. Within five minutes, they had entirely dismissed everything I had been through.”

	Feldman and Boston University did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment. 

	











	In the film, Cooper claims that Feldman would pry for personal details about her intimate relationships. “It was this psychotic game of, ‘You wanna play? Tell me about your sex life. I have to drive you to your night class, get in the car with me alone,'” Cooper said. “I started trying to spend as little time as possible with her. Taking different routes to practice where I knew I wouldn't run into her, during meetings, I would try to sit as far away from her as possible. Literally anything to not be alone with this woman.”

	In one scene, Cooper and her former teammate Alex Schlobohm recalled unusual game tape reviews during which Feldman would allegedly make comments about Cooper's body. “We're gonna rewind my tape every five seconds and we're gonna talk about my hair and my body,” said Cooper. She recalled Feldman making remarks along the lines of, “‘Look at those legs. Everybody, look at Alex in her uniform.'”

	When Cooper and her parents first considered pursuing legal action prior to the start of her final year at Boston University, the attorneys they spoke to warned them of the grueling process that would await them. “If I'm gonna be real with you, they will drag this on for years and this will be your life,'” Cooper recalled being told. But they did agree that “this is clearly a case of sexual harassment.”


	Cooper ultimately did not play soccer during her senior year at the university. Feldman retired in 2022 and received the declaration of “Nancy Feldman Day” in Boston on Dec. 11. “I felt a lot of anger—anger at my coach, anger at my school, and anger at the system that allowed this to happen,” Cooper said. “I don't think anyone could've prepared me for the lasting effects that came from this experience. She turned something that I loved so much into something extremely painful.”

	President Donald Trump called for the military to be deployed against anti-Immigrations and Customs Enforcements (ICE) protests in Los Angeles. The protests, which began in response to ICE raids at various workplaces on Friday, escalated over the weekend after Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops into the city over the objections of Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats. 


	“Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” Trump wrote early this morning on Truth Social. In another post, the president called for law enforcement to “ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” 


	U.S. Northern Command issued a statement on Sunday indicating that “approximately 500 Marines from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at Twentynine Palms, California, are in a prepared to deploy status should they be necessary to augment and support the DoD's protection of federal property and personnel efforts.” 


	The call from the president to deploy the military against U.S. citizens — a power that hasn't been invoked by a president since the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles — would be a serious escalation of federal involvement in what local authorities say remains a manageable, if in sporadic instances violent, outbreak of public protest. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Some Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have indicated their support for the deployment of military personnel to California. On Sunday night, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) shared a screenshot of a controversial opinion piece he wrote in 2020 calling for the military to be deployed against Black Lives Matter protests. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media Sunday night that “if violence continues, active duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert.” 

	











	The president and his administration have targeted Los Angeles and several other so-called “sanctuary cities” — cities and other state or local jurisdictions that limit its cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — as sites to conduct highly publicized ICE raids on immigrant communities. While the administration claims that they are focusing enforcement actions on criminals, acting ICE Director Tom Homan admitted today that ICE has been sweeping up migrants who just so happened to be at the location of one of their targets, including mothers, high school students, and migrants arriving to immigration court for scheduled hearings. As the administration's enforcement actions grow in intensity, and stray from the bounds of legality, Trump and his allies have claimed protests against their increasingly authoritarian tactics are effectively an illegal impediment to federal operations.

	“A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations,” Trump wrote on Sunday in a post that bears little resemblance to what is actually happening in the city. “Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.” Trump claimed on Monday that Los Angeles would be “completely obliterated” if he hadn't sent in the National Guard, and told reporters that it would be “great” if his administration arrested Newsom.


	In a Sunday press conference, Bass said that “what we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that has been provoked by the administration.” 


	“When you're at Home Depot and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans to our streets you cause fear and you cause panic and deploying federalized troops is a dangerous escalation,” Bass said. “We need to be real about this, this is about another agenda, it's not about public safety.”

	Bass added that the city remained committed to protecting the First Amendment rights of protesters, but that those legal protections “do not give you the right to be violent to create chaos are to be violent to create chaos are to vandalize property.”

	Newsom formally requested on Sunday that Trump revoke his federalization of the National Guard and withdraw them from the city. “In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, state and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property. Indeed, the decision to deploy the National Guard, without appropriate training or orders, risks seriously escalating the situation,” he wrote. 

	











	“There is currently no need for the National Guard to be deployed in Los Angeles, and to do so in this unlawful manner and for such a lengthy period is a serious breach of state sovereignty that seems intentionally designed to inflame the situation,” Newsom added.

Eddie Vedder and his wife Jill share why they've become so heavily involved in the Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) community in an exclusive clip from Matter of Time, a new documentary about the Pearl Jam singer and his efforts to raise money and awareness for those suffering from the rare genetic disease.


	In the clip, Jill Vedder reveals that she first learned about EB when the child of one of their friends was diagnosed with the disease. “We were just like, ‘This is the most crazy, brutal, intense thing I've ever seen,' and what can we do?” she says.


	“‘Okay, maybe we can talk about this, and just start small and see what happens.' I see people on the street or when I go to shows when they're playing and there's always an awesome Pearl Jam fan that will come up to me and say, ‘My god, I love what you guys are doing for the kids with EB.'” 


Matter of Time, which is premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival, is set against the backdrop of Vedder's Seattle benefit show in 2023 to raise funds for the disease, and features personal stories from parents and young patients impacted by the disease.

	











	“The closer you get to this community and the more you understand it, you cannot escape how difficult the challenges are for these families,” Eddie Vedder says in the clip. “We've had to clear some hurdles already that are examples of why you can have faith and why you can have hope, but the tricky part is patience.”


	Eddie continued, “If raising funds and raising awareness, if those things are able to fuel the process, and the scientific end of finding a cure and how to apply it. It feels like just a matter of time.” (The film shares its title with Vedder's 2020 song of the same name, a track he wrote in tribute to “everyone worldwide afflicted with EB.”)

	











	In addition to Vedder's music, Matter of Time — directed by Matt Finlin and executive produced by Jill Vedder — also features an original score by Broken Social Scene.


	“Eddie's presence is in every frame, whether he's physically there or not. His leadership, his love for Jill and their dedication to the EB community, his relentless belief that this can be cured — it shaped the spirit of this film,” Finlin tells Rolling Stone. “He doesn't just fundraise; he instills purpose. He makes the world stop and listen, then act. I think the real measure of Eddie's influence isn't just what you see onscreen, it's in what you feel after watching it: that we're all part of this, that we must be part of this.

	“This is a story of rare disease, but even more so, it's a story of rare community,” Finlin adds. “A group of people who've decided that this isn't just about surviving — it's about treatments, it's about curing. It's about taking big swings. And they've backed that hope with action. Michael Hund, the CEO of EB Research Partnership has a great quote in the film: ‘All of us in this community that have the profound honor of serving those that battle EB, our duty is to give them something to march to, that illuminates an end game.' Matter of Time is a love letter to that fight.”

	As for Broken Social Scene's score, Finlin said of working with the band's frontman Kevin Drew, “When I told him about the film, he simply asked the band, ‘Are you in?' And they were. They gave their time, their talent, and created something truly special. Their music sits alongside Eddie's performances in a way that feels seamless. The emotional current they bring to the film is something I'm deeply proud of. Honestly, I'd love to hear more of it.”


Matter of Time will premiere Thursday at the Tribeca Film Festival; the opening screening will also feature an intimate acoustic performance by the Pearl Jam singer.

	In the lobby of a Manhattan hotel, I'm waiting with Clipse's publicist to be let upstairs to talk to the Virginia duo. Surprisingly, Pusha T walks up on us, wearing all black. He's in a chipper mood, talking to us about the rollout for Let God Sort Em Out, the first Clipse album in 15 years, dropping July 11. 


	His publicist informs him that an ominous photo of him and his brother, Malice, posted online the day before at the Roc Nation offices, is going viral; I concur that I have seen it everywhere online. Push agrees, noting it “did what it needed to do.” Two days later, along with lead single “Ace Trumpets,” they revealed a partnership with Roc Nation Distribution for the independently released album. I spoke with the group last summer, where I got to hear the album (including the ballyhooed Kendrick feature) and expected it to drop sometime last year. 


	Upstairs in Pusha's hotel room, the guys tell me that the delay was due to legal wrangling over Kendrick's “Whips & Chains” verse. Though Kendrick doesn't directly address Drake on the song, Clipse (and Pusha's longtime manager Stephen Victor) have said that UMG's lyric review department were worried that a particular line was “controversial” and would become game for the Toronto artist's ongoing lawsuit against UMG, where he's alleging that the company inflated the popularity of “Not Like Us,” the 2024 diss track Kendrick levied at him. Last August, Push told Ghetto Runways that there was one more verse they were waiting on to finalize the album. Their reveal solved the ongoing mystery, sort of.

	After they negotiated a release from Def Jam (for Clipse and Pusha) after paying what Victor described as an “insane amount of money,” they inked a distribution deal with Roc Nation within 24 hours. “Hov found the business,” Push told me. And now, they're forging forth with an album (free of censorship) and a 25-date national Let God Sort Em Out tour starting on August 3 in Boston. Tickets go on sale June 13 on Letgodsortemout.com, where fans can also find out about presale information and VIP packages.

	Both men tell me they're eager for their first national tour since 2009. “I'm excited about getting back out here and seeing those people that supported us the whole time, and the people that have expressed their anxiousness to hear the Clipse” Malice says, adding, “This one is for the fans, those that waited around, those that were looking to see if we would ever come back and do music together.” 


	Malice, who showed he's still got it on “Ace Trumpets,” which features one rhyme scheme through the entire verse, says, “I hope to be able to show them this is real-time Clipse still true to life. And after all the time that has elapsed, we coming back living, showing you exactly where we are in life. I think that's a part of rap that we don't get to see often.”


	He says that while “a lot of people try to follow what's going on now,” he's assured that when it comes to Clipse music, “None of this is contrived. It's just us being us.”


Pusha, how has the past year as the Louis V. House Ambassador been for you?It's been really good. I look at all of these things like… Man, I remember rap from a very specific time, and just the access that hip hop had in certain places, and me as a house ambassador for LV is like, “Damn, I remember it was something that we could only bootleg it.” [Or] be made fresh via Dapper Dan. But that was the way to show our appreciation for a brand of that stature. But now I feel like… And not just starting with P — Well actually starting with P, to be honest, way, way, way back. I think P was probably the first with the LV deal, during the Marc Jacobs era.


	And then Virgil, and then now P back again. It's good. I feel like hip hop culture and those who have been entrenched in hip hop 360 degrees around, I feel like I'm a person who actually lives it. I live the whole idea. My favorite rapper had to dress good, he had to rap good, he had to have the fresh cut. He might've had the first kicks. He might've told you what jewelry to wear, or whatever the case may be. That's the cloth I'm from. So, to see things come to fruition, like a house ambassador at the LV, walking in the shows, and just all the things that opportunity can afford you. Man, I'm super appreciative, and love to see it, and love to see what's going to be the next step, or the next rapper, or next artist, where they're going to take it.

You mentioned walking in shows. What are some of your other expectations in that role?In that role, it's basically just, whenever I'm visible, in some way, shape, or form, support the brand. They have brand activations. Let's say for their [highest-spending] clients they may have them come all to Miami, surprise performance. You have the house ambassador, but then it becomes a business for me as an artist, because that's a whole ‘nother fee, and everything that comes along with it. But you do things like that. You represent the brand at places like F1-One, Met [Gala]. You show up and show out. 

	











How many times have you walked at fashion shows?The first time, it was good. It was with my brother. It was the first LV show for P, we were debuting the music. It was good to see that energy, and see how people reacted to the energy of the Clipse on the runway, new music, and just to watch people receive it. Man, I keep that video of just watching the faces as we're walking down the runway, watching people listen and be attentive to the music. It is great because Hov was like, “Wooo!” [Laughs] during “Chains and Whips,” he's listening. But, the crowd is usually entertainers, musicians, [and] creatives. And it's great to see how they reacted and took in the music.


So speaking of the Met Gala, how did your suit come together? How much creative input did you have on it?Pharrell basically, and the LV team, built out a whole theme. So, you go there. Whether it's beading, whether it's crystals, whatever it is, Pharrell and them put that together. And man, he was just like, “Man, what you feeling?” I'm like, “Man, it's the Met, I'm suited. I need to be all the way.” And I in turn brought in my stylist as well, Marcus Paul. He gives them his input. And it was Pharrell who was like, “No, you've got to wear this burgundy. This burgundy is for you, bro. I'm telling you, you'll kill it.” And then by the time everybody collaborated, it was the embellishments, just figuring out what was going to be the extra oomph to the suit. And I think we figured it out.


A lot of onlookers made the snow connection with the crystal beads. For sure. [Laughs]


You mentioned burgundy, do you feel like you wear a lot of colors?Never. I never wear colors. I wear black all the time. And I'm not opposed to colors. I just like the idea of a uniform. And usually I'm on the go and I'm on a mission, so that just helps me get in mode.


Did you see the Esquire piece about the suit?I didn't. My man Mike, he drives when I come to New York, he just told me about the Esquire.


Did you see the actual headline? It said, “Pusha T's Met Gala suit renewed my faith in red carpet tailoring.” How does that feedback feel?Word? Wow. Come on, man. Listen, I'm glad that he felt that way. Totally appreciative. And just so he knows: Jonathan Evans, my brother, you spoke to tailoring, that was the biggest thing. They flew from Paris to my house in Virginia to fit me. A couple days before the Met, another fitting. They felt it was off. I went down to F1 a couple days before the Met and came back up [so] they could fit it again. It was four different nips and tucks, and everything else, to get that headline. So, I'm super appreciative that he said that, because it was a very stressful time for those who were working on it. I'm glad they said that. Wow.

	











So when they're doing this process of the four different nips and tucks, are you getting what they're saying as well? Are you feeling the same way? This is the thing. So you put it on, people are critiquing as it's on you, and they're guesstimating, “Okay, maybe the button should be over a little bit more to the left,” so on and so forth. They pin it, they do everything. And then you leave with the idea that, “Okay, this is it and it's perfect. It'll be perfect.” When it comes back, maybe they were wrong, maybe it needed to be a little bit to the left this time, you know what I'm saying? And it's trial and error. And it is about how they execute, and just making sure that they leave themselves enough room to perfect, because you can't overdo it, especially with the crystals. You couldn't cut into all of that. So the idea of the dandyism for the LV camp was centered around tailoring. It was centered around it being cut and sewn to perfection, and fitting to perfection. So they were heavy on that.


So at the Met Gala, we see everybody on the red carpet. But once you actually get in, what do people actually do in there?It's dope, man. So the Met Gala, you come in, you do the red carpet. Once you do the red carpet, whatever the theme for the Met is, there's a museum installation. You walk through the museum installation. Huge. It's history. It's where the theme came from, what years, the origins. It just shows you everything from back in the day to present day.


	And then once you leave the exhibit, there's a cocktail hour. People are in a foyer drinking, food, hors d'oeuvres. And you're just seeing people, different artists. People are walking around, appreciating each other. People are looking at each other, looking at the clothes everybody got on. And then after that, you walk into the dining hall. Once you go into the dining hall, it's different tables for the different brands.


	It's like teams. So LV team, this table, Tom Brown, at this table, whatever, whatever. But people eat, people talk a little bit, mingle through the tables, and then everybody sits down to eat. And after everyone eats, there's a surprise performance. The first time I went, it was Lizzo. This time right here, was Usher and Stevie Wonder. Oh my God. One of the best performances I've ever seen.


What were they performing?They were performing their jams. Usher, all his hits. The dancers, everything. It's a surprise. It's not like [the musicians] get up from the table. No, no, no. It's like a grand entrance. It's a whole build out. It's everything. So he comes out there, he comes up from back of house. Comes up, goes crazy. Choreography, hit after hit after hit. And then he's like, “Man, we're here, we're at the Met,” talking about the inspiration. “I just want y'all to know I came from Germany to do this, because y'all told me I had the opportunity to perform with my inspiration. And I wouldn't have missed this for nothing. There's nothing that could have made me miss this.” So everybody was like, “Wait a minute, What you talkin about. There's more?” Man, Stevie walks out, his son sits him in front of the keyboard, and I'm talking about people fanned out. Leonardo DiCaprio's screaming to the top of his lungs. People are in tears, crying. And Stevie is going. He's going hit for hit, for hit, for hit, for hit. Back to back, man, for about probably another 45 minutes to an hour, just killing it. Usher come in. And it was a sing-a-long, because everybody knows the records. So Usher come and chime in. But Stevie was smoking it, smoked it.

	











Malice: [Walking in] What was this?


Pusha: The Met Gala.


Malice: Oh, wow.


Pusha: Smoked it, man. One of the best performances I had seen.


How many times have you seen Stevie live?Pusha: Oh, I haven't. I'm talking about just in general, performing. Across the board. Yeah.


That's crazy. I didn't know they had surprise performances.Pusha: You can't pull the phones out this night. You can't show nothing. You're not supposed to do none of that. Somebody, I'm sure did, but as you can see, it hasn't hit the net or nothing. I'm sure somebody did, but I didn't. I wanted to. And I was like, “Man, why? It's going to be me to fuck this up, put this out here or something.” But I didn't do it.


	The who's who of everybody, is there. And to watch the who's who be fans, to watch Diana Ross watch Stevie, it's like everybody was on their fan time. Whoever you were, for that. 


Last time I saw you all was in July, and a year later the fans are still waiting for your album. How has this year been as far as just wanting it to be out there? How have you all been navigating it?Pusha: I think we've been navigating it pretty good. I feel like I don't think we're ever in a rush to put out the music, because when it's ready and when the time is right, we know it's right. We didn't foresee these twists and turns, but I think it always works out for the best. One thing that we always know, is that the music is incredible. So we don't stress the back office stuff. We've always just gotten through off of the greatness of the music.


I know last June you all were waiting on a verse, and I know you all were expecting it later that week. When did you receive that verse that you were waiting on?Pusha: Oh man. See, I don't even know what part of the process we were in. We've received a couple verses since then. Man, I think half of the problem, is receiving the verse that we received. I think that's what has even changed up the course of this whole release.


Did the act tell you why it took so long?Pusha: Oh, no. Just a lot going on. 


How did you all feel when y'all first heard it?Malice: Loved it, man, loved it. Thought everything was incredible. I think that he overdid it.


You mentioned you added some verses to the album. Were there any other significant changes since last year?Pusha: No.


Malice: Yeah, another song, “Mike Tyson.”


Pusha: Yeah, “Mike Tyson” for sure. 


What made “Ace Trumpets” the right single to roll out the album with?Pusha: I think “Ace Trumpets” is a give back to the pure Clipse fan. For the fan who is looking for that level of rap. I think “Ace Trumpets” speaks directly to our base. No compromise, no nothing. And I feel like it's the set off. 

	











How often have you been recording Clipse records since last June?Pusha: We haven't been doing much more Clipse stuff.


So I saw late last year that you all signed to Def Jam for this project. What made Def Jam the right choice?Pusha T: There is no Def Jam. There is no longer Def Jam.


Malice: It's the Roc.


Okay. I saw that photo of y'all at the Roc Nation office yesterday. Do care to speak to what made you all pivot strategically?Pusha: The [Kendrick] feature had UMG in such an uproar. Once we turned in the album, it was like, “We're not putting this out, We're not supporting this,” so on and so forth. And they asked me to ask [Kendrick] to change his verse. And I was like, “No, it's not happening.” This went on for months. And legal over at Def Jam was like, “Listen, man, at the end of the day, you guys aren't changing it. We'll drop the Clipse.” And it was like, “No, we're not changing it.” And [then] it was like how that's going to work [for me] still over here as a soloist? I was like, “We can do business.” And Roc Nation found the business, Hov found the business. But yeah, [I'm] totally off Def Jam. For everything. Pusha T's no longer on Def Jam.


What do you think your next move solo-wise will be?Pusha: Soon after. Get through the Clipse cycle, we got touring to do. So it's a lot. Solowise, It's cued up and ready.


What was it about the verse that made Def Jam and UMG so upset?Pusha: I think just the connection of the parties. The Clipse, and [Kendrick] doing the song together was a little bit too much for them [with] what they're going through with their lawsuits or whatever they got going on. I don't know, I felt like the verse was clean, fair game, just good raps.


How are you all feeling about getting back on the road?Malice: Personally, I'm just committed to doing this leg, doing this album, with my brother, whatever that entails. Whatever we have to do. I'm excited about getting back out here and seeing those people that supported us the whole time and the people that have expressed their anxiousness to hear the Clipse. And I'm looking forward to see the reaction after such a long time.


Obviously, the hometown show will be special. Do you have any other particular spots that you're looking forward to hitting?Malice: Everywhere. Definitely hometown, like you said, but the major markets. But wherever it is, the Clipse fans, wherever, that's all that's important to me.


Pusha: I'm ready to get back overseas personally. I feel like, “Man, overseas has always shown the Clipse a lot of love.” And that festival circuit [was] the first to embrace the Clipse. I even think we were like the first rap group to ever do SXSW. So whether it's Europe, whether it's the States, that festival circuit has been really good. And to get back in the mix of that is like, “Wow.” I can't wait to see it.

	











Y'all debuted “Birds Don't Sing,” at a Louis Vuitton fashion show. Do you have any Paris Fashion Week plans tied to the album this time around?Pusha: I just think being out there and being out there for Fashion Week, I'm sure our presence will be felt. It's a great platform, so I'm sure we'll have something going on out there.


As MCs, how are you observing this Joey Badass vs. the West Coast thing? Pusha: Man, I think the guys, I think they're putting out a lot of music. If it's something that sparks the creativity of everybody else, and just the rap of it all, I think it's good for the game.


Yeah, I saw a tabulation that it was like 90 songs and 49 artists. And since then, there's been even more.Pusha: Listen, that's what I take from this whole thing, “A lot of music.” People working. I think working is a good thing though. And seeing people actually work and put pen to pad.


One of the criticisms that people have of it is, “It doesn't really seem to be rooted in anything.” How would you feel if someone came out and challenged you as an MC, for seemingly no reason?Malice: I think first and foremost, they have to be formidable. And I come from the standpoint of: I want something to gain too. I don't just want to win and beat you, I want to have something to get from it as well. 


Push, do you feel similarly?Pusha: Yeah, man, listen…


You've been through actual beef.Pusha: Yeah, I did the dance, man. I been through it.

Taylor Swift‘s Reputation has slithered its way back into the Billboard 200 albums chart at Number Five after the musician announced that she finally owns her entire catalog of music. The record previously spent four weeks at Number One following its 2017 release and has racked up 349 total weeks on the chart. It's also the one album Swift hasn't finished re-recording, though she doesn't really need to anymore.


	Last week, pre-masters victory, Reputation sat at Number 78 on the chart. The surge, per Variety, is the result of a 1,184 percent increase in album sales and a 125 percent increase in streaming, equivalent to 34.75 million streams.


	Fans are basking in guilt-free listening sessions now that Reputation is in Swift's sole possession. She purchased the album, along with the five that preceded it, from the investment firm Shamrock Capital. The firm itself ended up with her masters following a drawn-out series of sales that began with her former label Big Machine Records selling her catalog to Scooter Braun. Swift responded by setting off on a mission to cutting down the value in all of those albums by re-recording them.

	But that fight is all over now. The new battle Swift faces is figuring out how to recapture Reputation for its Taylor's Version release, if it ever received one in the same capacity as her previous albums 1989, Speak Now, Fearless, and Red. “I know, I know. What about Rep TV?” Swift wrote in her letter to fans announcing her ownership win. “Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it.”

	“The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it,” she continued. “All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.”


	Swift shared loose plans to release the extra songs that were planned for the re-recording. “There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch,” she said. “I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.”

In what makes separating facts from fiction difficult, it has now emerged that the US military misled the public and even its own personnel about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) for decades.

The revelation has come at a time when the issue of UFOs, now formally called unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), has generated great interest in recent years, including of lawmakers who have held hearings on the subjects.

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) of the US Department of Defense (DoD) has found that the US military misled the public and its own personnel, including officers, with myths of UFOs to hide actual top-secret projects, according to Wall Street Journal.

In recent years, several stories about UFOs have gained widespread attention, such as stories about Area 51 military base, the story of orb-like UFOs that US military pilots have spotted, and mysterious sightings around military bases. The issue has also become politicised as far-right Republicans have accused the purported ‘deep state' of hiding UFO-related truth from public and even the government.

The truth, it has emerged, has been much banal.

The Journal has reported that many popular stories about UFOs, that grew into a whole lore over decades, were planted by the US military to keep top-secret military programmes under wraps.

For example, in 1980s, a US Air Force colonel gave photos of what were dubbed as flying saucers to a pub-owner near the Area 51 base who then put those up in the pub. That led to the development of the lore about alien UFOs at Area 51. In reality, the doctored photographs were intentionally planted to create the myth of alien UFOs to hide the fact that the US government was developing top-secret fighter planes Area 51.

The alien UFO lore meant that whenever someone saw a strange aircraft in the area, it was believed to be an alien aircraft and dismissed as a rumour. In reality, those alien UFOs were stealth fighters under development!

The report said that a host of soldiers and officers were told that they were part of projects involving aliens and were made to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This meant that even many people within the government thought they were working in alien-related programmes when they were not!

On another occasion, the US government conducted a secret test involving electromagnetic pulse to test the security of one of its nuclear missile installations. But the senior leadership never told personnel stationed at the base about the test. This meant that personnel stationed at the base came under the false impression that their base came under an alien attack. Their impression and distrust of the government has lasted to this day.

Straight Arrow News


				The Pentagon deliberately spread UFO myths to mask classified weapons programs like the F-117 stealth fighter. False evidence included doctored photos and fake alien craft stories.			


				Air Force officers were inducted into a fake reverse-engineering program called “Yankee Blue” as part of a decades-long hazing ritual. A 2023 Defense Department memo ordered the practice to stop.			


				A 2024 Pentagon report omitted findings about internal disinformation, including pranks and fake documents. A second, more complete volume is expected in late 2025.			

The Pentagon knowingly promoted UFO myths for decades to mask secret weapons development programs, especially at classified sites like Area 51. A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that military officials planted false evidence, including doctored photographs, to divert attention from stealth aircraft testing.

In one instance during the 1980s, an Air Force colonel gave fake “flying saucer” photos to a bar owner near Area 51. The hoax fed speculation that the military was experimenting with alien technology, when in fact, they were conducting stealth fighter operations.

A congressionally mandated 2024 report by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) found no credible evidence of alien spacecraft or reverse-engineering programs. However, the report also excluded key findings that revealed the military's role in spreading disinformation to the public.

According to the Journal, the Air Force pushed to omit sensitive details that could expose classified programs or damage careers. The Defense Department now says a second report, expected later in 2025, will include findings related to false documents and events used to perpetuate the UFO narrative.

As part of classified program briefings, the military sometimes initiated new officers into what appeared to be a top-secret project called “Yankee Blue,” which claimed to involve reverse-engineering alien technology. They showed officers staged photos of flying saucers and swore them to secrecy — often without revealing the fabrication.

What began as a loyalty test or prank evolved into a decades-long ritual. Some officers carried the story into retirement, repeating it even during official investigations. AARO uncovered the practice in 2023, prompting the Secretary of Defense to issue a memo ordering it to stop, calling it a form of hazing.

AARO recorded 757 sightings between May 2023 and May 2024, a sharp rise from prior years. Investigators later identified most of the sightings as drones, birds, weather balloons or satellite reflections.

Analysts determined that a widely circulated 2015 video, showing a fast-moving sphere, actually captured a misidentified object distorted by camera angle and the relative speed of a jet.

Congress has continued to press for transparency, forming a caucus to investigate UAPs or unidentified anomalous phenomena. Lawmakers are now demanding to know which agencies have participated in crash retrieval efforts.

The Defense Department says it will release a follow-up report to clarify the role internal disinformation played in shaping public and military perceptions of extraterrestrial contact.

Tarot cards, Mothman dolls, and spirit stones were just a few of the goodies on display at the UFO Conference in Fairborn held over the weekend. 

While many welcomed to the two-day event were there to discuss the paranormal, others came for the colorful booths and rare shopping experience set up at the Holiday Inn. 

“What brought me here was more people that have the same interest as us. You get to find out everything you could ever want to know about the unknown and who doesn't love that?” Kim Ashworth, who sells candles, told the Dayton Daily News. 

The lifelong lover of the paranormal was among over a dozen vendors selling themed goods at the event. More than just a business opportunity, Ashworth was keen to emphasize just how important the conference was as a learning opportunity. 

“I think I've been fascinated my whole life. Anything that didn't seem right or off or just a little bit spooky to most people I found fascinating,” Ashworth stated. “Like, everything you think you know you are constantly finding out more information that makes you rethink everything. But that's what keeps life interesting and fun.”







Bookseller Brandy Wolf pointed to a famous Stephen Spielberg movie for fueling an early interest in aliens. 

“I think ET originally got me going and I've been interested since then,” she said. 





There were others who, despite being new to the scene, exhibited craftsmanship in their wares. Jocelyn Whitt was one such vendor, whose crocheted creations of cryptids impressed onlookers. 

“I've been crocheting for about 20 years,” she said. “I crochet about anything. Blankets, cryptids, stuffed animals.” 





According to Whitt, it takes only an evening or two to crochet her favorite cryptid: Mothman. Despite a phalanx of adorably depicted versions of Point Pleasant's most famous resident, another frequent flyer proved more popular at the conference.

“Right now, it's the Yip-Yip Aliens,” Whitt said. “Everyone thinks they are pretty funny.” 





The event's corridor of vendors was a welcome break from the intense discussions surrounding aliens, regressions, and anecdotes of alleged “men-in-black.” Much of the merchandise on display highlighted the humorous side of such serious topics. 

“I would say definitely come with an open mind. Come and explore and make your own decisions. Don't let other people influence you. If you are in search of an answer and you find it fantastic but also just take it as a really fun experience,” Ashworth said. “Everyone has their own interpretation, and I think if you come with an open mind then you're going to leave happy regardless because it's not a waste. You're going to find something to talk about.”

Cosmos » Marine life

Cosmos science journalist

What do whales have to do with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence?

According to the WhaleSETI team, tonnes. The researchers are studying intelligent, aquatic, nonhuman communication systems to develop filters to help sift through cosmic signals for signs of extraterrestrial life.

In a similar way to studying Antarctica or other places on Earth as a proxy for Mars, the scientists from the SETI Institute and the University of California, Davis, are working to unravel the complexities of humpback whale vocalisations to pick up “patterns, meanings, and potential modes of interspecies communication.”

Now, for the first time, they report that that humpback whales produce large bubble rings during friendly interactions with humans. The phenomenon, which resembles smoke rings blown by some humans, could be a form of play or communication.

“Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators,” says Dr Fred Sharpe, a behavioural ecologist at UC Davis and co-lead author of the paper in the journal Marine Mammal Science.

“We show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication.”

Humpback whales are known to create bubbles in a variety of contexts, including thick walls of bubbles to round up prey and bubble trails and bursts when competing for proximity to females.

Bubble rings, while well-studied in toothed whales, including Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, and Orinoco dolphins, have only been seen sporadically in baleen whales.

The new study collated reports on 12 bubble ring events – including 39 rings produced by 11 individual humpback whales – which were collected by naturalists, citizen scientists, and researchers on boats or in the water.

The WhaleSETI team also contacted researchers who were using drones to monitor whales to see if the behaviour occurred the absence of humans. They found no such evidence. 

“Humpback whales often exhibit inquisitive, friendly behaviour towards boats and human swimmers,” says co-lead author Jodi Frediani, a marine wildlife photographer and UC Davis affiliate.

“We've now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behaviour.”

Ring blowing during inquisitive encounters adds to the humpback whale's diverse repertoire of behaviours towards other species, which includes the playful lifting of dolphins and human swimmers and inspecting the dead.

“Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” says Dr Laurance Doyle, SETI Institute scientist and co-author on the paper.

“This important assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behaviour in humpback whales.”

In 1961, US radio astronomer Frank Drake came up with the equation for estimating the chances of intelligent civilisations in the galaxy. As Cosmos reported in 2024, Drake's Equation has since gone through some updates.

“By integrating our findings into the broader context of Drake's Equation,” the WhaleSETI team writes on its website, “we aspire to advance our understanding of the factors influencing the emergence of communicative intelligence in extraterrestrial civilizations.

“Through this interdisciplinary approach, our mission is to make significant strides in the quest to comprehend the prevalence and nature of communicative signals in the cosmos, ultimately contributing to the ongoing exploration of the potential for extraterrestrial life.”

A two-day UFO Conference in Fairborn brought extraterrestrial aficionados and lifelong paranormal investigators together at the Dayton Holiday Inn. Attending the event were some of the nation's most popular presenters on topics as diverse as Roswell and ancient aliens. 

With Fairborn Mayor Dan Kirkpatrick and state Rep. Brian Lampton, R-Beavercreek, welcoming visitors to the city, the weekend-long event included several guest speakers. 

Headlining the event was Donald Schmitt, author of numerous books on the Roswell Incident. Before him, Thomas Wertman, state director of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), set the stage by walking the audience through the work he does investigating reported UFO sightings. 





“Since 2008, I have done 896 investigations in the US; 239 in Canada, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and other countries out there, and there's others I did that I didn't count on the list. But I just got fascinated with the subject out there,” Wertman said. 

The former educator described the incident that first inspired him to research UFOs. For him, it was a chance encounter with what he described as a “disc” while a teenager in the 1960s.



“I look up and there in the trees I see this silver disc hovering right there. It was the size of a car, low enough to hit the trees. And as we're walking its following us,” Wertman explained, describing the incident that occurred in rural South Carolina. 

Wertman told a captivated audience that he would go on to dive deep into the subject, including reading books by broadcaster Frank Edwards. Years later, he joined MUFON as an investigator.





With a graph created using data from MUFON, Wertman demonstrated how spikes in UFO reports can sometimes be driven by TV shows. In one case, UFO sightings in Ohio jumped significantly the year Hangar 1: The UFO Files began airing. 

According to Wertman, MUFON classifies investigated sightings under several categories ranging from manmade identified flying objects such as planes to hoaxes. Investigations are typically carried out using the most accessible technology available. 

“I have tools that investigators fifty years ago would have loved to have,” Wertman stated. “A witness calls a report in I can go on Google Earth, put the address in and review the terrain before I ever go out there.”

Other applications used include Stellarium and LiveATC. Through them, the MUFON state director is able to gather evidence that can at times provide rational explanations to reported sightings. 

“I've got the ability to pull up flight data. I can go back about two-and-a-half to three years of flight data. I can also import that flight data into Google Earth to get three dimensional perspectives of what I was looking at,” he said. 

During his presentation, Wertman shared data collected by MUFON in 2023 that showed California led the nation in the number of UFO cases reported at 729 that year. Florida was second with 504 cases while Ohio was fifth at 299 cases during the same period. According to Wertman, the dominance of the two coastal states is due to their weather, with residents of California and Florida spending more time outdoors. 

“I tell people honestly 70, 80, 90 percent I can probably explain. It goes back to something that you can find data behind to support your opinion. But then there's that 10-20 percent, that's what I really want to go after.”

Schmitt was given a rockstar welcome before recounting his efforts to investigate the Roswell incident of 1947. 

“I've actually interviewed over 600 witnesses either directly or indirectly involved with what happened in New Mexico, what started all this back in 1947,” he said to an enamored audience. 

Other speakers for the day included author Ben Moss and Mike Bara from the TV show “Ancient Aliens” who attended via Zoom. 





For fans of anything extraterrestrial the conference proved to be a veritable buffet of ufology. While there wasn't much for skeptics, it was a rare occasion where believers in cover-ups and alien abductions could confer in real life.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — As Louisiana Rep. Kimberly Landry Coates stood before her colleagues in the state's Legislature she warned that the bill she was presenting might “seem strange” or even crazy.

Some lawmakers laughed with disbelief and others listened intently, as Coates described situations that are often noted in discussions of “chemtrails” — a decades-old conspiracy theory that posits the white lines left behind by aircraft in the sky are releasing chemicals for any number of reasons, some of them nefarious. As she urged lawmakers to ban the unsubstantiated practice, she told skeptics to “start looking up” at the sky.

“I'm really worried about what is going on above us and what is happening, and we as Louisiana citizens did not give anyone the right to do this above us,” the Republican said.

Louisiana is the latest state taking inspiration from a wide-ranging conspiratorial narrative, mixing it with facts, to create legislation. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed a similar measure into law last year and one in Florida has passed both the House and the Senate. More than a dozen other states, from New York to Arizona, have introduced their own legislation. 

Such bills being crafted is indicative of how misinformation is moving beyond the online world and into public policy. Elevating unsubstantiated theories or outright falsehoods into the legislative arena not only erodes democratic processes, according to experts, it provides credibility where there is none and takes away resources from actual issues that need to be addressed.

“Every bill like this is kind of symbolic, or is introduced to appease a very vocal group, but it can still cause real harm by signaling that these conspiracies deserve this level of legal attention,” said Donnell Probst, interim executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.




Louisiana's bill, which is awaiting Republican Gov. Jeff Landry's signature, prohibits anyone from “intentionally” injecting, releasing, applying or dispersing chemicals into the atmosphere with the purpose of affecting the “temperature, weather, climate, or intensity of sunlight.” It also requires the Department of Environmental Quality to collect reports from anyone who believes they have observed such activities. 

While some lawmakers have targeted real weather modification techniques that are not widespread or still in their infancy, others have pointed to dubious evidence to support legislation.

Discussion about weather control and banning “chemtrails” has been hoisted into the spotlight by high-profile political officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Recently, Marla Maples, the ex-wife of President Donald Trump, spoke in support of Florida's legislation. She said she was motivated to “start digging” after seeing a rise in Alzheimer's.

Asked jokingly by a Democratic state senator if she knew anyone in the federal government who could help on the issue, Maples smiled and said, “I sure do.”

Chemtrail conspiracy theories, which have been widely debunked and include a myriad of claims, are not new. The publication of a 1996 Air Force report on the possible future benefits of weather modification is often cited as an early driver of the narrative.

Some say that evidence of the claims is happening right before the publics' eyes, alleging that the white streaks stretching behind aircrafts reveal chemicals being spread in the air, for everything from climate manipulation to mind control. 

Ken Leppert, an associate professor of atmospheric science at the University of Louisiana Monroe, said the streaks are actually primarily composed of water and that there is “no malicious intent behind” the thin clouds. He says the streaks are formed as exhaust is emitted from aircrafts, when the humidity is high and air temperature is low, and that ship engines produce the same phenomenon.

A fact sheet about contrails, published by multiple government agencies including NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, explains that the streaks left behind by planes do not pose health risks to humans. However, the trails, which have been produced since the earliest days of jet aviation, do impact the cloudiness of Earth's atmosphere and can therefore affect atmospheric temperature and climate. 

Scientists have overwhelmingly agreed that data or evidence cited as proof of chemtrails “could be explained through other factors, including well-understood physics and chemistry associated with aircraft contrails and atmospheric aerosols,” according to a 2016 survey published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. In the survey of 77 chemists and geochemists, 76 said they were not aware of evidence proving the existence of a secret large-scale atmospheric program.

“It's pure myth and conspiracy,” Leppert said. 

While many of the arguments lawmakers have used to support the chemtrails narrative are not based in fact, others misrepresent actual scientific endeavors, such as cloud seeding; a process by which an artificial material — usually silver iodide — is used to induce precipitation or to clear fog.

“It's maybe really weak control of the weather, but it's not like we're going to move this cloud here, move this hurricane here, or anything like that,” Leppert said.

Parker Cardwell, an employee of a California-based cloud seeding company called Rainmaker, testified before lawmakers in Louisiana and asked that an amendment be made to the legislation to avoid impacts to the industry. 

The practice is an imprecise undertaking with mixed results that isn't widely used, especially in Louisiana, which has significant natural rainfall. According to Louisiana's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, a cloud seeding permit or license has never been issued in the state.

While presenting Louisiana's bill last week, Coates said her research found charts and graphics from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on spraying the air with heavy metals to reflect sunlight back into space to cool the Earth.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy, with support from NOAA, to develop an initial governance framework and research plan related to solar radiation modification, or SRM. A resulting report, which Coates holds up in the House session, focuses on possible future actions and does not reflect decisions that had already been made.

SRM “refers to deliberate, large-scale actions intended to decrease global average surface temperatures by increasing the reflection of sunlight away from the Earth,” according to NOAA. It is a type of geoengineering. Research into the viability of many methods and potential unintended consequences is ongoing, but none have actually been deployed.

In recent years, misinformation and conspiratorial narratives have become more common during the debates and committee testimonies that are a part of Louisiana's lawmaking process.

And while legislators say Louisiana's new bill doesn't really have teeth, opponents say it still takes away time and focus from important work and more pressing topics. 

State Rep. Denise Marcelle, a Democrat who opposed Louisiana's bill, pointed to other issues ailing the state, which has some of the highest incarceration, poverty, crime, and maternal mortality rates.

“I just feel like we owe the people of Louisiana much more than to be talking about things that I don't see and that aren't real,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I moved from Switzerland to Thailand. I feel less pressure to be an 'Instagram mom' here.","https://www.businessinsider.com/mom-koh-samui-thailand-raising-daughter-stress-perfect-mother-2025-6","Mon, 09 Jun 2025 03:54:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Cacchione, a 41-year-old Swiss woman raising her daughter in Koh Samui, Thailand. She is also the founder of mate.travel, a destination-focused travel and events platform. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I met my now-husband in 2009 on a popular diving island in Thailand.

I was on vacation from my hometown of Basel, Switzerland, while he had stopped on the island to complete his divemaster training during a yearlong trip around the world.

After dating long-distance for a year and a half, we decided to move to Koh Tao to work at the diving center where we had first met. It's an island in the Gulf of Thailand, just a ferry ride from Koh Samui.

He became a diving instructor, while I started off as an underwater videographer and eventually became an instructor myself.

We got married five years later, and although we loved the time we'd spent on that island, we were ready to settle down and start a family.

Koh Samui, over 10 times bigger, offered the environment we were looking for, so we moved there instead.

It's a perfect mix of the laid-back island lifestyle we love and all the amenities we need. There is a cinema, a shopping mall, an international airport, and hospitals and schools.

When I was pregnant, my mother moved to Samui to be close to her first grandchild. I gave birth to my daughter in 2020, who is now five years old and enrolled in an international kindergarten on the island.

I normally drop my daughter off by 9 a.m. and pick her up between 3:30 and 4 p.m.

It's on the later side, since the earliest she can do is 8:30 a.m., but I don't like to rush in the mornings, and neither does she.

It's a Montessori-inspired school that follows the English curriculum.

In Switzerland, the school day usually starts around 8 a.m., so kids need to get up much earlier. In the afternoon, students typically return home for lunch. Moreover, different grades have different schedules.

When I was visiting a friend in Switzerland, her two kids didn't have the same lunchtime. Coordinating is impossible; your whole day revolves around your kids.

Many kids back in Switzerland also participate in lots of activities. As a mother, I probably would've felt pressured to enroll my daughter in something.

While there are extracurricular activities for kids in Samui, there is no pressure to sign them up. Nobody will say, ""Oh, your kid's not doing ballet?"" Everyone's friendly and supportive.

Social media here is more about traveling and breaking free from a conventional lifestyle. There is nothing about ""I'm a perfect mom, this is what I did today.""

Even in my daughter's school, the kids get exposed to so many different cultures and learn to be more accepting of others from a young age.

People living in Samui tend to be more open-minded. Most of the people I've met have already lived in other countries before; this is rarely their first stop.

When my daughter sees videos of other children playing at a park on YouTube or from friends back in Europe, and she says, ""Mommy, can we go to the park?"" I say, ""Well, there's no park.""

There are indoor play spaces but hardly any well-maintained outdoor playgrounds or parks like the ones I've seen back in Switzerland.

I've found that if you don't want to do an activity, it's difficult to just go somewhere and meet other families. You need to know where to go or arrange to meet someone somewhere.

For teenagers, it's much harder to find things to do. Some hang out at the shopping mall, but getting around the island can be difficult.

Walking here isn't easy — it's hot, there aren't many sidewalks, and there's no public transportation like buses or subways. The roads can be dangerous, so I'd never want my child riding a motorbike here.

They're really kid-friendly here. There's so much space almost everywhere, and she can run around. Even in restaurants, you never feel shushed.

We live up in the mountains, about 10 minutes from the main road. There is no road noise, and we have a nice view of the valley and a little bit of the ocean.

It's very quiet and slow, even in the mornings. If I'm 10 minutes late dropping my daughter off, it's not a problem. Even as a mother, I'm not stressed.

The CEOs of Uber, Dell, Goldman Sachs and more are expected to announce Monday that they will collectively invest billions of dollars into so-called Trump accounts for the children of their employees, a White House spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.

The executive are slated to make the commitments during President Donald Trump's roundtable event touting the eponymous pilot program, which would deposit $1,000 from the government in investment accounts for newborn Americans. NBC News first reported the details of the event.

More than half a dozen corporate leaders are set to appear for the ""Invest America"" roundtable at the White House at 2 p.m. ET, the White House official told CNBC. They include:

The provision to create the accounts passed the House last month as part of the massive budget bill that the president is pushing Republicans to send to his desk before the Fourth of July. The bill is pending before the Senate, where it faces strong pushback from some fiscally conservative Republicans who are demanding major changes.

The program — previously referred to as ""Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement"" or ""MAGA Accounts"" — would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028.

The tax-deferred accounts, which track the overall U.S. stock market, allow additional contributions of up to $5,000 per year. The seed money will be funded by the Treasury Department and controlled by the child's guardians. Funds can be distributed once the beneficiary turns 18.

The pilot program is similar to other savings account options that already exist, including 529 college savings plans, which have higher contribution limits. Some financial advisors say that the Trump accounts may not offer the best investment incentives.

""The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill will literally change the lives of working, middle class families across America by delivering the largest tax cuts in history, increasing the child tax credit, and by creating this incredible new 'Trump Account' program, which will put the lives of young Americans on the right financial path!"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC in a statement.

Chipotle Mexican Grill is hoping that Americans' love for ranch will boost its sales.

On June 17, the burrito chain is launching Adobo Ranch, a spicier take on the iconic condiment that has transcended salads to adorn pizza, chicken wings and chips. The menu item is Chipotle's first new dip since queso blanco, which launched in 2020.

The debut comes as Chipotle tries to recover from a rough start to the year. In the first quarter, the company reported its first same-store sales decline since 2020. Executives cited a pullback from consumers who had become more concerned about the economy.

The company also lowered the top end of its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth and said traffic wouldn't grow until the second half of the year.

Shares of Chipotle have fallen 12% this year, dragging its market cap down to $71 billion.

But Adobo Ranch could help to boost the company's sales if it draws cautious diners back to the chain's restaurants.

The dipping sauce is made with adobo peppers, sour cream and herbs and spices, according to the company. Adding Adobo Ranch to an order will cost an extra 75 cents.

Ranch outsells ketchup, although NIQ retail sales data shows that mayo still holds the top spot as the favorite condiment of U.S. consumers.

There is no doubt that Britain is helping Ukraine to carry out terrorist attacks inside Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

There have been several sabotage incidents on Russian railways since the start of the month. The worst occurred on June 1 when a bridge collapsed in front of a moving passenger train in Bryansk Region, killing seven people and injuring more than 100 others.

The same day, Ukraine targeted Russian airbases across the country – from Murmansk in the Arctic to Irkutsk in Siberia – in a coordinated assault which involved explosive-laden drones taking off from commercial trucks. According to Moscow, most of the incoming UAVs were shot down, and none of the affected Russian planes were damaged beyond repair.

Speaking during the ‘Forum of the Future 2050' in Moscow on Monday, Lavrov acknowledged that the “risk of the rise in the level of terrorist threat exists” in Russia.

“It is obvious that all this is being done by the Ukrainian side, but it would have been helpless without the support... from the British,” he said.

Such activities were previously backed by both the US and the UK, but “now we would have to do solely with the British,” Lavrov claimed.

The diplomat was referring to the fact that the UK remains one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters, despite the US changing course under the administration of US President Donald Trump towards trying to restore dialogue with Moscow and to broker a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine conflict.

“Although who knows, maybe there are still some special services in the US that are participating in such activities by inertia, but the British are 100% involved in them,” Lavrov stressed.

Last week, Moscow's ambassador to London, Andrey Kelin, similarly accused the UK of participating in Ukrainian drone raids on Russian airbases.

“This kind of attack involves, of course, provision of very high technology, so-called geo-spatial data, which can only be done by those who have it in possession. And this is London and Washington,” Kelin told Sky News. He added that he did not believe that the US was somehow involved due to Trump denying any knowledge of Kiev's plans.

Downing Street has neither confirmed nor denied the UK's participation, with a government spokesman saying: “We never comment on operational matters at home or abroad.”

Memo authorising the military to be deployed against anticipated protests is pre-emptive act – a first for the US

LA protests – live updates

The Trump administration's deployment of national guard troops to Los Angeles to intervene in civilian protests in the face of opposition from the Californian governor is a major escalation that risks the politicisation of the US military, armed service veterans are warning.

Former top military figures have told the Guardian that the decision to put up to 2,000 troops under federal control and send them into the streets of LA is a violation of the military's commitment to keep out of domestic politics in all but the most exceptional circumstances. The last time a US president federalised the national guard against the wishes of a state governor was in 1965, when Lyndon Johnson deployed them to protect civil rights marchers in Alabama.

“This is the politicisation of the armed forces,” said Maj Gen Paul Eaton. “It casts the military in a terrible light – it's that man on horseback, who really doesn't want to be there, out in front of American citizens.”

Eaton, who commanded the training of Iraqi troops during the invasion of Iraq, predicted that the LA deployment would lead to the eventual invocation of the Insurrection Act. The 1807 law empowers the president to deploy the full US military against insurrection or armed rebellion.

“We are headed towards the invocation of the Insurrection Act, which will provide a legal basis for inappropriate activity,” he said.

The largely peaceful protests in LA against Trump's deportation efforts have entered their fourth day. National guard troops began arriving in the city on Sunday, with authorisation to protect federal personnel and buildings but not to engage in law enforcement activities.

Trump's move in the absence of a genuine civil emergency has sent alarm through military circles, which have long prided themselves on being above politics. “This deployment was made counter to what the governor wanted, so it seems like a political forcing – a forced use of the military by Trump because he can,” said a retired senior US army officer who requested anonymity in order to preserve their lifelong non-partisanship.

Trump's memo federalising the national guard for deployment in LA is written in sweeping terms, in effect casting it as a nationwide mobilisation. It says that regular military troops, as well as national guard forces, can be employed by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to protect federal functions anywhere in the country where protests are occurring.

Most troublingly, the memo also acts pre-emptively – an action never seen before in the US – authorising the military to be deployed against anticipated protests. It says that troops can be sent to “locations where protest against [federal] functions are occurring, or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments”.

On Sunday, Trump signaled that LA was just the start of a much wider deployment. “We're gonna have troops everywhere,” he said.

Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran who is CEO of Vet Voice Foundation which advocates for veterans and military families participating in American democracy, said that the executive order was an invitation to Hegseth to “mobilise as many troops as he wants anywhere within the US. That's a massive escalation across the country.”

Geoffrey DeWeese, a former US army judge advocate who is now a legal director within the National Institute of Military Justice, expressed concern about how the national guard would be used in LA. Under the memo, they can act as protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, which potentially means that troops could accompany Ice in immigration deportation raids on homes and businesses.

“Ice and the national guard are [both] wearing camouflage, carrying automatic weapons – so how do civilians differentiate them? And what message does it send, when all you see are men and women in uniform, with guns and helmets and goggles and maybe gas masks?”

The military mobilisation that is now unfolding is far from unexpected. Military and constitutional experts who were convened by the law and policy institute the Brennan Center last summer to wargame what Trump might do in a second administration predicted precisely the current train of events.

Trump himself made no attempt to disguise his intentions, repeatedly telling his supporters during last year's election campaign that if re-elected he would use the military against “the enemy within”.

Concerns about the deployment have been heightened by Trump's previous actions which already pointed towards a politicisation of the armed services. In February he fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and several other top brass without giving just cause.

Retired lieutenant general Jeffrey Buchanan, the former commander of the US Army North, said the dismissals also had a politicising effect. “It will lead to Biden's generals, and Trump's generals – or generals who are ‘my guys' and generals who are ‘not my guys'. That erodes confidence in the military, because the people will think that the military are now politicians.”

Buchanan added: “The military's ultimate loyalty is to our constitution, not to a particular leader. We've had plenty of tensions between military leaders and presidents in our history, but we've always maintained this tradition.”

There are also worries about Trump's upcoming military parade to be staged in Washington DC on 14 June to mark the 250th anniversary of the US army. The date happens to coincide with the president's 79th birthday.

“Tanks are rolling into DC, $40m is about to be spent, in a giant function to celebrate one man. That's deeply unAmerican,” said Vet Voice's Goldbeck.

She added that while the military celebrated its birthdays, street parades were avoided “because that is the action of a dictator.

A ship with aid supplies for Gaza carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists was stopped by Israel from reaching the Palestinian enclave. Israel had warned it wouldn't allow it to make it to the territory. DW has more.

Follow DW for updates on the situation in Gaza, Israel and the wider Middle East region on Monday, June 9, 2025:

At least 12 Palestinians were killed and others wounded on Sunday as Israeli forces opened fire near two aid distribution points in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials and witnesses.

Witnesses said Israeli troops fired on crowds approaching food hubs run by the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

Israel's military said it fired warning shots at approaching ""suspects"" who ignored warnings to turn away, in an area that is considered an active combat zone at night.

The shootings occurred around 6 a.m. (0300 UTC/GMT) near Rafah and central Gaza, as desperate residents gathered for aid.

Adham Dahman, one of the injured witnesses, said a tank fired toward them. ""We didn't know how to escape,"" he said. ""This is a trap for us, not aid.""

A GHF official said all three distribution sites operated on Sunday without any incidents of violence in or around the area.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) has confirmed that the Madleen, a ship carrying humanitarian aid that was bound for Gaza, has been intercepted by Israeli forces.

In a statement, the group said its vessel was ""attacked/forcibly intercepted by the Israeli military … in international waters.""

""The ship was unlawfully boarded, its unarmed civilian crew abducted, and its life-saving cargo — including baby formula, food and medical supplies — confiscated,"" the FFC said.

Israel has ""no legal authority to detain"" the volunteers aboard the Madleen, human rights attorney and Freedom Flotilla organizer, Huwaida Arraf, said.

Arraf added that the seizure is a violation of international law and goes against the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ""binding orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza.""

The statement said Israel does not have the legal right to detain the volunteers, who are ""not subject to Israeli jurisdiction and cannot be criminalized for delivering aid or challenging an illegal blockade.""

""Their detention is arbitrary, unlawful, and must end immediately,” Arraf said.

Israel's Foreign Ministry has said that the Madleen, a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza Strip, has been intercepted and is ""safely making its way to the shores of Israel.""

The passengers, who include Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, among others, are expected to return to their home countries, the ministry said on X.

""While Greta and others attempted to stage a media provocation whose sole purpose was to gain publicity — and which included less than a single truckload of aid — more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel within the past two weeks,"" the ministry said.

""The tiny amount of aid that was on the yacht and not consumed by the 'celebrities' will be transferred to Gaza through real humanitarian channels,"" the statement added.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the organization that launched the Madleen, has accused Israeli authorities of ""kidnapping"" the people on board. 

In a series of posts on Telegram, the group also said the ship had come ""under assault in international waters"" and that Israeli forces had sprayed the vessel with a ""white irritant substance"" before ""illegally"" boarding the ship.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, responsible for the Madleen boat carrying aid for Gaza, said it was ""under assault in international waters"" as it approached the besieged Palestinian enclave in the early hours of Monday.

""Quadcopters are surrounding the ship, spraying it with a white irritant substance,"" the Freedom Flotilla Coalition said on its Telegram channel. 

""Communications are jammed, and disturbing sounds are being played over the radio.""

The group then said the Israeli army had ""boarded the vessel.""

Israel's Foreign Ministry said the Israeli Navy was communicating with the aid ship, calling it the ""selfie yacht.""

""Using an international civilian communication system, the Israeli Navy has instructed the ""selfie yacht"" to change its course due to its approach toward a restricted area,"" the ministry said on X.

The post included a video purportedly showing an Israeli official announcing the following message: ""The maritime zone of the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic. It's part of the… naval blockade. If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you're able to do so through the port of Ashdod via the established channels…""

A ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza Strip is approaching the Palestinian enclave, which is under an Israeli blockade.

In addition to supplies, the British-flagged Madleen is carrying climate advocate Greta Thunberg and several other activists.

As it neared Gaza early on Monday morning, the occupants aboard the Freedom Flotilla Coalition's ship said it was coming ""under assault"" from Israeli forces and was surrounded by quadcopters.

Israel's Navy has said it has told the aid ship to change course.

On Sunday, Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said that he had instructed the military to stop the ship from reaching Gaza, warning ""the antisemitic Greta and her Hamas-propaganda-spouting friends"" to turn back.

Jurors in Harvey Weinstein's MeToo retrial appeared far apart on a verdict as they returned to court on Monday for a third day of deliberations.

The jury asked to be reminded of the definition of reasonable doubt and rules about avoiding a hung jury, and the foreperson sent a note saying he wanted to speak to the judge “about a situation that isn't very good”.

The foreperson told Judge Curtis Farber that he was concerned about “something going on in the jury room”. He was then taken behind closed doors to discuss the matter with Mr Farber, prosecutors and the defence team.

Weinstein waived his right to be present for that conversation, which was held in Mr Farber's robing room, outside the view of reporters and the public.

It was not immediately clear what the foreperson said. Mr Farber has yet to give jurors the instructions they wanted reread to them.

After the closed-door conversation, Weinstein's lawyers returned to the courtroom and huddled around the court stenographer's machine, jotting down notes while Mr Farber heard another, unrelated case.

The jury of seven women and five men began weighing charges against the former movie mogul on Thursday.

Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of committing a criminal sex act and one count of rape.

On Friday, a Weinstein juror asked to be removed from the case, saying he felt other jurors were treating one member of the panel in an “unfair and unjust” way.

The judge told him he had to keep deliberating and also denied a defence request for a mistrial over the issue.

Weinstein was originally convicted in New York in 2020 of one count of rape and one count of sexual assault in a verdict considered a landmark in the MeToo movement.

But the conviction was subsequently overturned, leading to his retrial – with an additional accuser added last year – before a new jury and a different judge.

Weinstein was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape.

After the 2020 conviction was thrown out, Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, opted to charge Weinstein again almost immediately, eventually bringing two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act and one count of third-degree rape against him.

Weinstein denies the charges, alleging the sexual encounters were consensual. His lawyer Arthur Aidala said the Oscar-winning producer had “mutually beneficial” relationships with his accusers, who ended up with auditions and other show business opportunities.

NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety.”

Hundreds of workers at the National Institutes of Health on Monday openly protested the Trump administration's cuts to the agency and consequences for human lives, writing in a sharply worded letter that its actions are causing “a dramatic reduction in life-saving research.”

In a June 9 letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, NIH workers said they felt “compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.”

“For staff across the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we dissent to Administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe,” they said.

The letter is an extraordinary rebuke of the Trump administration's actions against the NIH, which include: terminating hundreds of grants funding scientific and biomedical research; firing more than 1,000 employees this year; and moving to end billions in funds to partner institutions overseas, a move current and former NIH workers say will harm research on rare cancers and infectious diseases, as well as research that aims to minimize tobacco use and related chronic illnesses, among other areas.

Some NIH workers signed their names publicly, openly daring to challenge a president who has sought to purge the government of employees he views as disloyal to him. Others signed anonymously.

“It's about the harm that these policies are having on research participants and American public health, and global public health,” said Jenna Norton, who works at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, one of NIH's 27 institutes. “There are research participants who generously decide to donate their time and literal pieces of their body, with the understanding that that service is going to help advance research for diseases that they are living with and help the next person who comes along with that disease.”

“These policies are preventing us from delivering on the promise we made to them and honoring the commitment that they made, and putting them at risk,” she said.

The workers wrote that they hope Bhattacharya welcomes their criticisms given his vows to prioritize “academic freedom” and to respect dissenting views as leader of the NIH, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Its authors called it the “Bethesda Declaration” — a play on the controversial “Great Barrington Declaration” that Bhattacharya co-authored during the covid-19 pandemic.

Bhattacharya's declaration advocated against lockdown measures and proposed that widespread immunity against covid could be achieved by allowing healthy people to get infected with the virus and instituting protective measures only for medically vulnerable people. It was criticized at the time by Francis Collins, then-director of the NIH, who called Bhattacharya and his co-authors “fringe epidemiologists,” according to emails the American Institute for Economic Research obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

In their letter, NIH workers demanded that Bhattacharya restore grants that were “delayed or terminated for political reasons.” Those grants funded a range of projects, including those addressing Alzheimer's disease, ways to boost vaccination rates, and efforts to combat health disparities or health misinformation.

“Academic freedom should not be applied selectively based on political ideology. To achieve political aims, NIH has targeted multiple universities with indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,” the NIH workers wrote.

The funding terminations, they said, “throw away years of hard work and millions of dollars,” “risk participant health,” and “damage hard-earned public trust, counter to your stated goal to improve trust in NIH.”

In an emailed comment, Bhattacharya said, “The Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months, including the continuing support of the NIH for international collaboration. Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive. We all want the NIH to succeed.”

The NIH's nearly $48 billion budget makes it the world's largest public funder of scientific research. Its work has led to countless scientific discoveries that have helped improve health and save lives around the globe. But it hasn't been without controversies, including instances of research misconduct and not effectively monitoring grant awards and the related research.

Researchers and some states have sued NIH and HHS over the grant cuts. An April 3 deposition by NIH official Michelle Bulls said Rachel Riley, a senior adviser at HHS who is part of the Department of Government Efficiency created by executive order, provided NIH officials lists of grants to terminate and language for termination notices. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, led DOGE through May.

Norton has worked at the NIH as a federal employee or contractor for about a decade. She said the current administration's policies are “definitely unethical and very likely illegal,” listing a string of developments  in recent months. They include terminating studies early and putting participating patients at risk because they have had to abruptly stop taking medications, and holding up research that would predominantly or exclusively recruit participants from minority races and ethnicities, who have historically been underrepresented in medical research.

“They're saying that doing studies exclusively on Black Americans to try to develop interventions that work for that population, or interventions that are culturally tailored to Hispanic-Latino populations — that that kind of research can't go forward is extremely problematic,” Norton said. “And, as a matter of fact, studies that over-recruit from white people have been allowed to go forward.”

The NIH workers also demanded that Bhattacharya reinstate workers who were dismissed under recent mass firings and allow research that is done in partnership with institutions in foreign countries “to continue without disruption.” The NIH works with organizations around the globe to combat major public health issues, including types of cancer, tobacco-related illnesses, and HIV.

In addition to the firing of probationary workers, NIH fired 1,200 civil servants as part of a rapid “reduction in force” at federal health agencies. During a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff, a recording of which was obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the decisions about RIFs “happened before I got here. I actually don't have any transparency into how those decisions were made.”

He started at NIH on April 1, the day many workers at NIH and other agencies were told they were fired. Other workers have been fired since Bhattacharya took the helm — nearly all the National Cancer Institute's communications staff were fired in early May, three former employees told KFF Health News.

The letter is the latest salvo in a growing movement by scientists and others against the Trump administration's actions. In addition to in-person protests outside HHS headquarters and elsewhere, some former employees are organizing patients to get involved.

Peter Garrett, who led the National Cancer Institute's communications work, has created an advocacy nonprofit called Patient Action for Cancer Research. The aim is to engage patients “in the conversation and federal funding and science policymaking,” he said in an interview.

His group aims to get patients and their relatives to speak out about how federal cancer research affects them directly, he said — a “guerrilla lobbying” effort to put the issue squarely before members of Congress. Garrett said he retired early from the cancer institute because of concerns about political interference.

Career officials routinely work under both Republican and Democratic presidents. It is par for the course for their priorities and assignments to evolve when a new president, Cabinet secretaries, and other political appointees take over. Usually, those changes occur without much protest.

This time, workers said the upheaval and harm done to the NIH is so extensive that they felt they had no choice but to protest.

In 11 years at NIH, Norton said, “I've never seen anything that comes anywhere near this.”

In the June 9 letter, the workers said, “Many have raised these concerns to NIH leadership, yet we remain pressured to implement harmful measures.”

“It's not about our jobs,” said one NIH worker who signed the letter anonymously. “It is about humanity. It is about the future.”
